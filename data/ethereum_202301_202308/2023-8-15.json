        "content": "Why are Ethereum Network Fees so High?: Learn more in this guide\n\n\u200dIf you have ever found yourself scratching your head, wondering why a minor transaction on the Ethereum blockchain leaves your wallet considerably lighter, then you\u2019re not alone.\n\nWith the ever-increasing traffic on the Ethereum blockchain, transaction fees have skyrocketed, leaving many to ponder whether using the network is worth it.\n\nIn this article, we will address why Ethereum network fees are so high, explore the factors contributing to these high fees, and provide practical tips on reducing and avoiding them.\n\nSo buckle up, because today we will unravel some useful information on Ethereum and its fees!\n\nAlso read: Ethereum Is Turning Deflationary, But Price Remains Stagnant\n\nA Quick Look at Ethereum\n\nEthereum\u2019s debut in cryptocurrency was a turning point for the entire blockchain industry. It was the first blockchain to challenge and match the dominance of the Bitcoin network.\n\nEthereum is a decentralized platform that allows developers to create, publish, and distribute applications and smart contracts.\n\nWith its innovative features and services, and a community-run ecosystem that supports thousands of decentralized applications, it quickly gained popularity among investors and users worldwide.\n\nPerhaps its most notable feature is the ability to deploy smart contracts, which accelerated the development of the crypto industry.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum Investors Await Rally as Addresses in Profits Hit Monthly Low\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum Transaction Fees\n\nTransaction fees, or gas fees, are incurred when executing a transaction on the Ethereum network.\n\nEvery network action, whether sending Ether (ETH) or interacting with a smart contract, requires computational power. Miners, who validate transactions and maintain the network, are compensated with gas fees for their efforts.\n\nGas fees are denominated in Gwei, a tiny fraction of an ETH.\n\nOne Gwei is equivalent to 0.000000001 ETH. When you initiate a transaction, you specify a gas limit, the maximum amount of computational work you are willing to pay for.\n\nAdditionally, you set a gas price, the amount of Gwei you are willing to pay per unit of gas. The total transaction fee is calculated by multiplying the gas limit by the gas price.\n\nFactors Contributing to High Ethereum Fees\n\nSource: CNN\n\nSeveral factors have contributed to the high fees on the Ethereum network:\n\n1. Network Congestion\n\nAs the popularity of Ethereum has soared, the number of transactions on the network has increased dramatically. This surge in demand has led to network congestion, causing delays and driving up transaction fees.\n\nDuring peak hours, when the network is crowded with users, gas prices tend to skyrocket as users compete to process their transactions.\n\n2. Gas Limit and Gas Price\n\nThe gas limit and gas price you set for your transactions can significantly impact the fees you pay. You will pay more for your transactions if you set a high gas limit or a high gas price.\n\nFinding a balance and optimizing these parameters to minimize fees while ensuring your transactions are processed promptly is important.\n\n3. Smart Contract Complexity\n\nThe complexity of smart contracts also plays a role in determining transaction fees. More complex smart contracts require more computational resources, resulting in higher gas fees.\n\nAs decentralized applications (dApps) and their functionalities become more intricate, the network experiences increased congestion, leading to higher gas prices.\n\n4. Ethereum Network Upgrades\n\nThe Ethereum network has undergone several upgrades to improve scalability and address the issue of high fees. One such upgrade is EIP-1559, which introduced a base fee mechanism to make gas prices more predictable and reduce fee volatility.\n\nHowever, these upgrades take time to implement and may not immediately alleviate the problem of high fees.\n\nHow to Reduce and Avoid High Ethereum Fees\n\nSource: CNBC\n\nNow that we understand the factors contributing to high Ethereum fees let\u2019s explore some practical tips to reduce and avoid them:\n\n1. Optimize Gas Limit and Gas Price\n\nTo minimize transaction fees, optimizing the gas limit and gas price for each transaction is crucial.\n\nTo decrease fees, you can set a lower gas limit and gas price, but avoid setting them too low to prevent transaction delays.\n\nExperiment with different values and find the optimal cost and transaction speed balance.\n\n2. Use Layer-2 Scaling Solutions\n\nLayer-2 scaling solutions encompass technologies constructed on the Ethereum network to boost transaction throughput and cut fees.\n\nThese solutions, such as Optimistic Rollups and zkSync, process transactions off-chain or more optimally, alleviating the burden on the Ethereum mainnet. By utilizing layer-2 solutions, you can benefit from faster and cheaper transactions.\n\n3. Choose Off-Peak Times\n\nGas fees tend to be lower during off-peak times with less network congestion.\n\nYou can take advantage of lower fees by scheduling your transactions during these periods, such as late at night or on weekends.\n\nMonitoring gas price charts or using tools like Gas Now can help you identify the optimal transaction times.\n\n4. Consider Gas Tokens\n\nGas tokens, such as CHI or GST2, allow you to pre-purchase gas at a lower price and use it to pay transaction fees in the future.\n\nYou can effectively reduce your overall gas costs by acquiring gas tokens when gas prices are low and redeeming them when fees are high.\n\nHowever, remember that gas tokens might have limitations and some wallets and platforms might not support them.\n\n5. Choose the Priority Fee Option\n\nSome wallets and platforms offer a priority fee option that allows you to pay a slightly higher fee to process your transaction faster. If time is of the essence, opting for a priority fee can ensure your transaction is prioritized by miners and confirmed more quickly.\n\nSource: Comparic\n\n6. Explore Alternative Blockchains\n\nIf high Ethereum fees persist or if you require faster and cheaper transactions, consider exploring alternative blockchains.\n\nBlockchains like Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, and Solana offer lower fees and faster transaction speeds.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that these blockchains may have different functionalities and may not support all Ethereum-based tokens and applications.\n\n7. Stay Informed and Adapt\n\nThe Ethereum network keeps evolving, and developers are actively creating new solutions to tackle high fees.\n\nStay informed about network upgrades, improvements, and emerging technologies that aim to reduce fees. B\n\ny adapting to the changing landscape, you can leverage the latest tools and innovations to minimize your transaction costs.\n\nConclusion\n\nHigh Ethereum network fees can be a barrier for users looking to transact on the blockchain. However, by understanding the factors contributing to these fees and implementing the tips mentioned above, you can reduce and avoid high fees on the Ethereum network.\n\nRemember to optimize your gas limit and gas price, explore layer-2 scaling solutions, transact during off-peak times, consider gas tokens, choose priority fees when necessary, explore alternative blockchains, and stay informed about advancements in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nWith these strategies, you can navigate the world of Ethereum transactions more cost-effectively.\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial or investment advice.

        "title": "Should You Buy Ethereum While It's Still Down? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "After a long, discouraging crypto winter, prices have been slowly recovering so far this year.\n\nEthereum (ETH 0.70%) is currently up by around 53% in 2023, but it's still down nearly 62% from its all-time high in late 2021. If you've been waiting for the right time to invest, now may seem like a smart buying opportunity, as crypto prices steadily inch closer to their previous peaks.\n\nBut some investors are still cautious, which is understandable considering how quickly the crypto market crashed last year. The last thing anyone wants is to invest while prices are higher, only to have the market plummet yet again.\n\nSo is it really a smart time to invest in Ethereum? The answer is, it depends.\n\nThe case for investing now\n\nMarket volatility is always unnerving, but it's especially challenging in the crypto space. While Ethereum has experienced incredible highs over the last few years, the lows can be unbearable for many investors.\n\nHowever, remember that crypto is a long-term investment. Even the strongest cryptocurrencies will likely see extreme volatility in the near term, but the best investments have the potential for significant long-term growth.\n\nEthereum remains one of the strongest players in the industry, and it has some major advantages over its competitors, including:\n\nIts sheer size: With a market cap of around $221 billion, Ethereum makes up just under 20% of the entire crypto market. While popularity alone doesn't necessarily make for a strong investment, it's tough for smaller cryptocurrencies to compete with a behemoth like Ethereum -- putting it in a league of its own.\n\nWith a market cap of around $221 billion, Ethereum makes up just under 20% of the entire crypto market. While popularity alone doesn't necessarily make for a strong investment, it's tough for smaller cryptocurrencies to compete with a behemoth like Ethereum -- putting it in a league of its own. It's the leading smart contract platform: The Ethereum blockchain is host to a wide variety of decentralized applications (dApps), ranging from NFT marketplaces to metaverse applications to decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. Although many other networks (such as Solana and Cardano ) can also host dApps, Ethereum is far and away the most popular platform.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain is host to a wide variety of decentralized applications (dApps), ranging from NFT marketplaces to metaverse applications to decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. Although many other networks (such as and ) can also host dApps, Ethereum is far and away the most popular platform. It's constantly updating: Last year, Ethereum developers successfully completed The Merge, a landmark upgrade that moved the network from the energy-intensive proof-of-work system to the far more efficient proof-of-stake. But there are many other updates still in the pipeline -- most notably The Surge, which should vastly improve the network's speed and reduce transaction fees.\n\nIn other words, Ethereum has a lot going for it right now. It's consistently been one of the clear leaders in the crypto space, and if it continues its upgrades and improvements, it has the potential to soar even more over time.\n\nWhen it may be best to avoid Ethereum\n\nAs with any cryptocurrency, Ethereum is still largely speculative. While it has many distinct advantages, those are mostly speculative right now, too.\n\nIf NFTs, the metaverse, or DeFi become more mainstream, Ethereum will benefit from it. But if those applications never catch on with the public, the crypto may have a tough time staying relevant. Right now, nobody can say how this space will fare over the long term, and there's always a chance it could fail.\n\nThis isn't to say you shouldn't invest in Ethereum for these reasons. For many investors, the potentially lucrative earnings outweigh the risk of crypto's speculative nature. But in general, even the \"safest\" cryptocurrencies are still more volatile than stocks -- which can be a deal-breaker for more risk-averse investors.\n\nIf you're on the fence, ask yourself which of these two scenarios you'd regret more: investing now and losing money if Ethereum fails, or not investing and missing out on those earnings if it succeeds.\n\nThere's no right or wrong answer here, but it can help you determine where your priorities lie. If your biggest concern is making a bad investment and losing money, crypto in general may not be the best fit for you right now.\n\nCrypto can be incredibly volatile, and it's important to consider your risk tolerance before you invest. That said, Ethereum has built a reputation for being a leader in the industry, and it has plenty of advantages that could make it a smart buy right now."

        "title": "Finance and Crypto: Understanding the Difference Between Ethereum and Ethereum Tokens - Easy Reader",
        "content": "In the rapidly evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, Ethereum has emerged as a pioneering platform that goes beyond being just another digital currency. Ethereum\u2019s versatility lies in its ability to support both its native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), and a wide array of tokens built on its blockchain. Generally, in the crypto landscape, the fluctuating prices of cryptocurrencies including Eth price, play a pivotal role, capturing the attention of investors and enthusiasts.\n\nThis article delves into the distinctions between Ethereum including price dynamics, Ethereum-based tokens and their significance in the world of finance and crypto.\n\nEthereum: The Platform and the Cryptocurrency\n\nEthereum, introduced by Vitalik Buterin in 2015, is a decentralized blockchain platform designed to execute smart contracts and deploy decentralized applications (DApps). While Bitcoin primarily functions as a digital currency, Ethereum serves as a versatile foundation for various blockchain-based innovations.\n\nEther (ETH), Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, is used to pay for transaction fees and computational services on the network. Ether holds intrinsic value and is a tradable asset on various cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nEthereum Price Dynamics\n\nEthereum\u2019s price is shaped by a myriad of elements, including market demand and supply dynamics, technological advancements, regulatory developments, macroeconomic trends, and investor sentiment. The price surged in the wake of the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) boom in 2017, fueled by increased adoption of the Ethereum platform for token creation.\n\nSubsequent years witnessed both peaks and corrections in Ethereum\u2019s price, with considerable attention drawn to its scalability challenges and transaction fees during periods of high demand. The anticipation and subsequent launch of Ethereum 2.0, a major upgrade aiming to enhance scalability and efficiency, have also influenced price movements.\n\nThe DeFi boom, marked by the rapid growth of decentralized finance applications built on Ethereum, played a pivotal role in propelling the demand for Ether. The rise of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and their popularity in digital art and collectibles further boosted Ethereum\u2019s value.\n\nHowever, Ethereum\u2019s price volatility is a double-edged sword, enticing potential gains while posing risks for investors. The significance of understanding Ethereum\u2019s price trends and the underlying factors cannot be overstated, as it empowers stakeholders to make informed decisions in the ever-evolving world of finance and crypto.\n\nEthereum Tokens: Beyond Ether\n\nEthereum\u2019s innovation goes beyond its native cryptocurrency. Ethereum\u2019s platform enables the creation of tokens, which are digital assets with distinct functionalities and use cases. These tokens are created through smart contracts and adhere to Ethereum\u2019s standards, often referred to as \u201cERC\u201d standards. Some notable ERC standards include ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155..\n\nERC-20 Tokens: The Backbone of Crypto Economics\n\nERC-20 tokens are the most widely recognized and used tokens on the Ethereum network. They adhere to a standardized set of rules, allowing for seamless interaction and compatibility with various wallets, exchanges, and DApps. These tokens serve a multitude of purposes, including crowdfunding through Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), facilitating decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, and representing digital versions of real-world assets.\n\nERC-721 Tokens: Uniqueness and NFTs\n\nIn contrast to ERC-20 tokens, ERC-721 tokens are unique and indivisible. They have gained significant attention due to their association with non-fungible tokens (NFTs). NFTs represent ownership of unique digital items such as artwork, collectibles, and virtual real estate. Ethereum\u2019s support for ERC-721 tokens has played a pivotal role in the NFT boom, revolutionizing the way creators monetize their digital creations.\n\nERC-1155 Tokens: Efficiency and Flexibility\n\nERC-1155 tokens introduce a hybrid approach that combines both fungible and non-fungible characteristics. This standard allows for the creation of multiple token types within a single contract, enabling more efficient and cost-effective management of digital assets. This efficiency makes ERC-1155 tokens particularly suitable for blockchain-based games and applications where various items need to be managed within a unified framework.\n\nKey Differences Between Ethereum and Ethereum Token\n\nPurpose and Functionality- Ethereum serves as a decentralized platform for smart contracts and DApp deployment, while Ethereum tokens are digital assets built on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain with specific use cases and functionalities.\n\nValue Proposition- Ether (ETH) holds intrinsic value as a cryptocurrency and is used for transaction fees and network operations. Ethereum tokens derive their value from the underlying projects, services, or assets they represent.\n\nCreation and Standards- Ethereum is the foundation on which tokens are created through smart contracts adhering to various ERC standards. These standards define the rules for token behavior and interactions.\n\nInteroperability- While Ethereum tokens can be exchanged on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain and are compatible with various wallets and exchanges, Ethereum itself operates as a separate blockchain network.\n\nBottom Line\n\nEthereum\u2019s distinction lies in its dual role as a blockchain platform and a cryptocurrency. While Ether (ETH) serves as the native cryptocurrency, Ethereum\u2019s true power lies in its ability to host a diverse range of tokens through its smart contract capabilities.\n\nERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155 tokens exemplify the flexibility and innovation possible within the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling the creation of decentralized finance applications, unique digital assets, and efficient multi-token management. Understanding the nuanced differences between Ethereum and its tokens as well as Ethereum price dynamics, is crucial for anyone navigating the exciting world of finance and crypto."

        "content": "Ethereum co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, has lauded X\u2019s new Community Notes feature, highlighting its alignment with core blockchain values despite its non-cryptocurrency origins.\n\nIn December 2022, the social media giant formerly known as Twitter, now X, launched Community Notes. Since then, it has steadily grown in prominence, establishing itself as a cornerstone tool for the platform.\n\nOpen-source in nature, Community Notes allows anyone to participate as a contributor. Though still recognized as being in its developmental pilot phase, the feature plays a central role in a burgeoning community dedicated to identifying and correcting misinformation on the microblogging platform.\n\nWhat do I think about Community Notes?https://t.co/9A0PnanndM \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) August 16, 2023\n\nVitalik Buterin remarked on the striking parallels between the tool and some blockchain projects. He praised its decentralized essence, the emphasis on community engagement, and its transparent coding structure.\n\nIn a recent blog post, Buterin went on record to say that Community Notes serves as a \u201cremarkably useful\u201d tool, even when circumstances become fraught with contention.\n\nButerin\u2019s intrigue with Community Notes stems from its potential as a manifestation of \u201ccrypto values,\u201d despite not originating from the cryptocurrency realm. \u201cIt might be the most fitting embodiment of \u2018crypto values\u2019 we\u2019ve encountered in the mainstream arena so far,\u201d he expressed.\n\nYou might also like: Vitalik Buterin shares insights on Ethereum\u2019s account abstraction journey\n\nAn interesting facet of Community Notes is its unique consensus-based operational procedure. Before a note gains approval and becomes visible to the audience, there has to be a mutual agreement among its contributors.\n\nThe platform mandates a consensus for note validation, a process thoroughly detailed on their official site.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/kcoleman/status/1691704978099105901?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1691704978099105901%7Ctwgr%5E7b19b1f578dcab33728923c9b92d8e3f3e9f9e0c%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fblockworks.co%2Fnews%2Fvitalik-community-notes-x\n\nHighlighting this consensus approach, Keith Coleman, X\u2019s vice president of Product, showcased an excerpt from Buterin\u2019s insights into crypto values. This acknowledgment garnered even more attention when CEO Elon Musk further shared Coleman\u2019s post, casting a spotlight on Buterin\u2019s thoughts to his vast array of followers.\n\nButerin accentuated the decentralized aspect of the notes. He clarified that these annotations, which either add context or challenge assertions made on X, don\u2019t stem from a singular authority. \u201cThe process is democratic, allowing any individual to draft and vote. The final decision regarding the display of these notes rests with an open-source algorithm,\u201d he detailed.\n\nHe also introduced the notion of \u201ccredible neutrality,\u201d a term he coined in 2020, referring to a system that remains impartial and unbiased. In Community Notes, this neutrality represents its effort to remain unbiased and all-inclusive.\n\nButerin also acknowledged that while Community Notes bears resemblance to the values of decentralization, it doesn\u2019t quite match up to the standards set by decentralized social media, saying, \u201cfor those who may find fault with its operation, alternative viewing isn\u2019t an option. However, for extensive applications, it\u2019s likely the closest we\u2019ll see in the foreseeable future.\u201d\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Valkyrie Investments has filed for an Ethereum futures exchange-traded fund (ETF), as seen in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing on Aug. 16.\n\nAccording to that filing, nearly all of the fund\u2019s assets will be invested in exchange-traded Ethereum futures, while a small portion will be invested in collateral investments such as cash, cash-like instruments, or high-quality securities. The text of the filing emphasizes that the fund\u2019s assets will not be invested in Ethereum (ETH) itself.\n\nValkyrie\u2019s filing indicates that the fund\u2019s investment capacity may be limited by regulations set by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). Those limits currently restrict ETH futures positions to 8,000 contracts per month. Each contract represents 50 ETH (currently $91,100). Valkyrie said the fund may invest in longer-dated futures contracts and additional collateral investments if it reaches these limits.\n\nValkyrie previously tried to combine its Bitcoin futures ETF (called the \u201cBitcoin Strategy ETF\u201d) with Ethereum futures in an Aug. 4 filing. That filing would see Valkyrie integrate both investments and rename the fund accordingly starting on Oct. 3 if approved.\n\nThe status of that filing, and its connection to the recent filing, have not been clarified in the document.\n\nInterest in crypto ETFs is high\n\nEthereum futures ETFs attracted widespread interest from asset managers this summer. Volatility Shares, Bitwise, ProShares, VanEck, Roundhill, and Grayscale have all applied to offer an Ethereum futures ETF in recent weeks.\n\nThat interest comes alongside broader interest in cryptocurrency ETFs, as Valkyrie and many other companies are also pursuing a spot Bitcoin ETF. Valkyrie submitted its application to the SEC on June 21 after the asset management giant BlackRock did the same just days earlier. As of the current date, no U.S. company has been granted permission to offer a spot Bitcoin ETF, reportedly due to inadequate surveillance-sharing agreements\n\nValkyrie was also one of the first companies to offer a Bitcoin futures ETF in October 2021. It offers various other crypto-related investments as well.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "Can Ethereum Price Cross $2,000 Before The End Of August? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "The Ethereum price has been on a rather disappointing run for investors over the last month and this decline has seen it fall to the low $1,800s. As the onslaught continues, the question now is will Ethereum be able to cross the $2,000 resistance before the month runs out?\n\nETH Open Interest On The Rise\n\nOne interesting factor about the current trend for the digital asset is the rate at which open interest is growing. Now, during times of falling prices where long traders are suffering the most in the market, open interest tends to decline as traders start to pull back from bullish positions. However, that has not been the case lately.\n\nRelated Reading: Will Bitcoin Price Crash Similarly To 2019 And 2020? As data from Coinglass shows, the Ethereum open interest has been on the rise lately. This growth trend is evident across exchanges, a number of which saw a significant jump in their Ethereum open interest.\n\nFor example, in the last day, the ETH open interest rose 16.77% on CoinEx, 14.48% on OKX, and 13.08% on Bitget. It doesn\u2019t end there as the likes of Huobi and Binance also saw an 8.15% and 5.94% increase in their ETH open interest, respectively.\n\nETH open interest on exchanges jumps 5.98% in 24 hours | Source: Coinglass\n\nAs a result of this, the total exchange ETH futures open interest in USD moved from $6 billion last week to $6.54 billion on Wednesday. Given that the ETH futures open interest across exchanges was sitting at $6.4 billion on Tuesday, it translates to a 5.98% jump in total open interest in the last 24 hours alone.\n\nWhat Does This Mean For Ethereum Price?\n\nThe steady rise in the Ethereum futures open interest on exchanges could point to a coming halt in the price decline. This is because, despite the falling prices, investors expect the price of the cryptocurrency to keep rising, which means bullish sentiment has not waned.\n\nWhat the current trend points to is likely a case of investors selling off holdings to secure some profit. But with so much open interest, it means there is not a lot of runway for the sellers. As a result, they will run out of steam soon and buyers will take over the market once more.\n\nWhen this happens, it would not take long until the Ethereum price is back up once more. Pulling above $2,000 will be more of a hurdle though. This is because the price of ETH continues to trade below its 50-day moving average, giving bears steam for the resistance at $2,000.\n\nETH bulls hold $1,800 support amid decline | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nHowever, with the expectations of an Ethereum ETF being approved by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), there could be more volume flowing into the asset soon. This could be just the push ETH\u2019s price would need to break $2,000. But the first ETH ETF deliberation by the SEC will happen in October, crossing August out of the picture.\n\nFollow Best Owie on Twitter for market insights, updates, and the occasional funny tweet\u2026 Featured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

This attracted the attention of Elon Musk.\n\nThe crypto community, as usual, reacted to Musk's tweet, tagging the ETH creator. A Twitter user interpreted this to suggest that Musk is bullish on ETH. In a surprising turn of events, Elon Musk followed Ethereum developer Vitalik Buterin on Twitter in June.\n\nTwitter has seen dramatic events unfold in recent months, but amid this, Community Notes emerged as a generally respected tool, attempting to combat disinformation by providing context and facts to messages.\n\nElon Musk, in particular, has paid keen attention to this Twitter feature. As reported, Elon Musk thanked Japanese contributors for their efforts in providing community notes in Japanese, which attracted a comment from Shiba Inu lead Shytoshi Kusama.\n\nTwitter was rebranded to X in July, marking the start of billionaire Elon Musk's vision to transform it into \"the everything app.\"\n\nLong before Elon Musk's $44 billion purchase of Twitter last year, he talked about creating an all-encompassing service called \"X.\" In typical Musk fashion, the concept was expansive and amorphous."

Making a bearish engulfing candle in the daily chart, the downtrend leads the 1.58% on 8th August and warns of a deadlier correction phase.\n\nThe Ethereum price currently trades at $1821 below the 50-day EMA and might soon approach the 200-day EMA. The sharp increase in trading volume supporting the downfall makes the downtrend more intense.\n\nIn the 4-hour chart, the bearish obstacles become clearer. These are the 200 EMA and the supply zone at $1875, undermining the recent ETH price bullish attempt. The extensive short-term selling spree might soon challenge the $100 mark.\n\nCurrently, the downtrend breaks under the resistance trendline of the broken falling channel pattern. However, a lower price rejection before the candle closing will increase the chances of a breather rally.\n\nThe trapped short-term buyers can find this potential breather as an exit strategy to minimize losses. However, this can, in turn, fuel the downtrend leading to more discounted prices.\n\nComing to the technical indicators, the RSI and MACD indicators present bearish sight in both 4-hour and daily charts. With the 50-day EMA and the 200 EMA in a 4-hour chart representing the selling side, a reversal breaking either EMA will unlock a bullish rally.\n\nIs This The Best Dip To Buy?\n\nIn case of a breather rally, the Ethereum prices can reach $1850 upon the short-term correction breakout. Moreover, the ETH price is approaching the long-term support trendline, increasing the reversal chances. Comparing the previous reversal, the ETH price is set for a 25%-40% jump.\n\nHowever, a prolonged downtrend can challenge the bullish dominance of the $1800 mark. And, in case of a $1800 breakdown, the Ethereum price can plunge to $1712."

Discover SCENE\n\nThe Shiba Inu (SHIB) ecosystem is finally launching Shibarium, its Ethereum layer-2 network.\n\nAccording to the developers, Shibarium's mainnet launch provides the essential technical foundation \u201cfor the entire SHIB state.\u201d Today's launch follows an extensive beta testnet phase, which saw a reported 21 million users.\n\nShibarium, like the swath of layer-2 networks on the market, seeks to address some of the scalability challenges inherent in the Ethereum network. By offering enhanced throughput and reduced transaction fees\u2014apparently even lower than those boasted by Polygon (MATIC)\u2014it aims to improve the overall efficiency and user experience of decentralized application applications (dApps) and transactions.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cCost and scalability of a new layer-2 network depends on a lot of factors including the number of validators, how many transactions flowing in the system, but our initial test has revealed sub-fractional transactions cost compared to Polygon and instant speeds,\u201d SHIB developer Kaal Dhairya told Decrypt.\n\nThe move also boosts the project's chances of leaving the meme coin category behind. Initially launched in 2020, Shiba Inu (SHIB) quickly joined the ranks of Dogecoin (DOGE) as yet another canine entry to the annals of crypto comedy.\n\nAlongside Shibarium, though, the developers behind the project also promise a new identity protocol to show Shiba Inu is more than an internet meme.\n\nShiba Inu lead developer who goes by the pseudonym Shytoshi Kusama emphasized that the key differentiator of Shibarium from other scaling solutions is that the \u201cL2 solution powers our entire governance and Shiba State framework.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith it, we can ensure low-cost transactions, membership, ownership, and much more on-chain for our ShibArmy and beyond,\u201d Shytoshi Kusama told Decrypt.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nShibarium and its steak delegates\n\nShibarium is built on a consensus mechanism called Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPOS), with the network\u2019s underlying infrastructure relying on a combination of validators and delegators.\n\nIn this particular design, validators take charge of running nodes, facilitating transaction processing, and generating new blocks. This collective effort also ensures the overall security of the ecosystem. Delegators, meanwhile, are backing the validators by staking support tokens.\n\n\u201cOur DPOS system is a great way for Shibizens to have a role in our new state,\u201d Kusama told Decrypt. \u201cIn essence, validators and delegators are the first two roles in the society and we will scale to thousands more roles as we build a better future.\u201d\n\nAccording to the developers, Shibarium is also poised to play a key role in supporting other components of the existing Shiba Inu ecosystem.\n\nThis extends to backing assets like the SHIB and LEASH tokens, SHIBOSHI NFTs, SHIB The Metaverse, the ShibaSwap decentralized exchange, and the Shiba Eternity game.\n\n\u201cIn my view, Shibarium's best use case is that it is specifically designed to be a blockchain for everyone,\u201d Kusama told Decrypt. \u201cWe specialize in building frameworks that support the community, not a specific use case. In this way, we promote unity, diversity, and decentralization.\u201d"

The CREW\u2019s documents were filed this month.\n\nThe document did not provide additional information on other contents in the wallets.\n\nHowever, the holding indicates a clear departure from Trump\u2019s former anti-crypto posture.

President Trump has been listed as his company\u2019s manager, President, secretary, and treasurer since 2022.\n\nThrough this licensing, the NFT company used his \u201cname, likeness, and image\u201d to release two NFT collections that garnered broad attention from the crypto community. Last year, the first batch of the collection was launched to much hype and interest from his supporters. A \u201cseries 2\u201d was launched in April.\n\nMeanwhile, the NFT collections have always seen their value impacted by the media coverage surrounding Trump. Data from Coingecko shows that while the value of the first collection has doubled to $188 as of press time, the second collection\u2019s value is trading far below its mint value of $99.\n\nThe NFT collections are not owned, managed, or controlled by Trump, his company, or their affiliates.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum, the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is witnessing some intriguing and potentially alarming trends. While ETH long liquidations are growing in size, open interest in the cryptocurrency is simultaneously skyrocketing. This paradoxical situation demands a closer look.\n\nLong liquidations and open interest: What's happening?\n\nLong liquidations refer to the forced selling of assets, in this case, Ethereum, when traders cannot meet margin requirements for their leveraged positions. The fact that these liquidations are increasing suggests that many traders are getting caught on the wrong side of the trade, possibly due to sudden price drops.\n\nOn the other hand, open interest represents the total number of outstanding derivatives contracts, such as futures and options, that have not been settled. Skyrocketing open interest indicates that more traders are entering into contracts, betting on Ethereum's future price movements.\n\nThe simultaneous occurrence of increasing long liquidations and surging open interest is perplexing. It suggests that while many traders are being liquidated, even more are entering the market, possibly with leveraged positions. This scenario can lead to heightened volatility and risk in the Ethereum market.\n\nEthereum's price analysis\n\nOver the past month, Ethereum's price has shown some fluctuations. Starting from July 1, 2023, ETH was trading at $1,934.04. As the month progressed, it reached a high of $1966.81 but also dipped to lows like $1,830.05. As of Aug. 13, 2023, Ethereum was trading at $1,836.95.\n\nThis price movement, combined with increasing long liquidations, suggests that traders might be over-leveraging their positions, expecting Ethereum to rise. When the price does not move as anticipated, or if there is a sudden drop, these over-leveraged positions get liquidated, leading to the observed increase in long liquidations."

        "content": "With the global crypto market cap consolidating around $1.15 trillion, Ether\u2019s price has been hovering around $1800 over the past week. As a result, the market is neither greedy nor fearful. At press time, the Ethereum F&G Index flashed a neutral reading of 46.\n\nFrom the beginning of 2023 until now, Ethereum\u2019s realized price has consistently hovered between $1,500 and $1,600. At press time, it was on the brink of $1700. The realized price is technically one of the most reliable on-chain analysis metrics. The price is arrived at by dividing the sum of all coin values at the time when they were last moved by the circulating supply. Usually, the realized price has acted as a support during bear markets. On the other hand, whenever the market price has dropped below the realized price, it has swiftly bounced back, suggesting the market sees Ethereum as undervalued during those moments.\n\nConsequentially, this resilience indicates an underlying confidence in Ethereum\u2019s value. Such a setup points out that the broader market believes that ETH is worth more than its current market price. Highlighting what could be a good investment strategy, a recent CryptoQuant analysis pointed out,\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re someone with a long-term investment horizon, at least a year or more, and have confidence in the asset, considering buying and holding Ethereum whenever it nears the Realized Price Line might be a sound strategy.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: 19 SEC-Flagged Crypto Tokens Witness Trade Volume Spike\n\nDeposits to Exchanges Drop, ETH Premium Rises\n\nLet us delve into a couple of other metrics to understand what other market participants are doing at this juncture. ETH\u2019s exchange deposit transactions have been on a downtrend since mid-June. From a high of 19,000 created on June 18, the number was hovering around 38,500 a day back, suggesting that fewer participants are selling their ETH holdings.\n\nAlso Read: Coinbase: \u2018Fresh\u2019 Whale Wallets Created in 2023 Drive Activity on Base\n\nParallelly, in several regions, users are paying a premium to acquire Ether. The Korean Premium Index for this asset was hovering around 0.36 on August 13. However, it flashed a value of 1.09 at press time. The rising premium value likely indicates that Korean retail investors are applying buying pressure by accumulating ETH.\n\nThus, it can be contended that the current activity by ETH holders is setting the stage for the asset to gradually recover. Thus, long-term holders could consider accumulating at this stage.\n\nAlso Read: Stablecoin Market to Grow From $125 Billion to $3 Trillion: Bernstein"

However, the updated filings by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) raise the approximate value to $2.8 million.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s Crypto History\n\nTrump kept exploring the crypto sea via his biographical NFT collections, depicting the highlights of his storied and questionable life.

        "content": "\n\n\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, former US President Donald Trump has emerged as an Ethereum whale, potentially profiting a staggering $2.8 million from his ETH holdings. The revelation comes from certified financial disclosures for 2023, released by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW).\n\n\u2018Ethereum whale\u2019 refers to an individual or entity that possesses a substantial amount of the crypto Ethereum. Such whales wield significant influence over the market, capable of executing substantial transactions that can impact Ethereum's price and market dynamics.\n\nTrump's involvement with Ethereum has proven highly lucrative, with earnings totalling $2.8 million from his ETH holdings, a substantial increase from the $250,000 to $500,000 reported in his April 14 filing. Notably, the former President has reportedly reaped an additional $4.8 million from licensing fees associated with nonfungible token (NFT) collections that prominently feature his likeness. His foray into crypto-related ventures has generated an estimated net profit of approximately $7.6 million.\n\nAs Trump sets his sights on potentially returning to the White House in the forthcoming 2024 election, his indictment in Georgia somewhat overshadows this financial revelation. On August 14, Donald Trump and 18 associates were accused of conspiracy to overturn his 2020 election defeat in Georgia.\n\nMoreover, Trump's stance on crypto has been nothing short of controversial. Despite his notable involvement with Ethereum and NFTs, he has previously voiced scepticism towards cryptos, going so far as to label them as potentially \"fake\" and a \"disaster waiting to happen.\" He has also been a vocal critic of Bitcoin, referring to it as a \"scam\" and expressing concerns about its competition with the US dollar.\n\nHowever, as the financial landscape increasingly intertwines with the world of crypto, Trump's substantial ETH holdings underscore the evolving nature of wealth accumulation and the novel investment avenues that continue to capture global attention. As the former President navigates legal challenges and eyes a potential political comeback, his financial involvement in the crypto realm adds yet another layer of intrigue to an already dynamic narrative."

        "content": "Shiba Inu launched the Shibarium mainnet, an Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution, on Aug. 16 after months of testing that saw millions of users participate and 21 million wallets created.\n\nShibarium is built on a new consensus mechanism called proof-of-participation (PoP), which works by selecting validators in proportion to their quantity of holdings in the associated cryptocurrency. This is done to avoid the computational cost of proof-of-work schemes. The new L2 blockchain solution is designed to interact with the primary Ethereum layer-1 blockchain, providing a more scalable and cost-effective transaction platform.\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) rose to popularity during the bull market of 2020\u20132021, even briefly overtaking the OG meme cryptocurrency, Dogecoin (DOGE). However, it couldn\u2019t hold onto its gains for long and lost more than 80% of its valuation during the bear market.\n\nThe price decline didn\u2019t deter the Shiba Inu community, which built a decentralized ecosystem around the cryptocurrency comprising a decentralized exchange, ShibaSwap, and a native token, BONE, along with a metaverse and a Web3 game. The price of SHIB also surged to a new multiweek high in anticipation of Shibarium\u2019s launch.\n\nPrior to the mainnet launch, Shiba Inu\u2019s lead developer, who goes by the pseudonym Shytoshi Kusama, noted that the L2 has already gained a lot of traction from new projects. In a post on X (formerly known as Twitter), the developer shared a screenshot of companies currently developing on Shibarium, suggesting over 100 companies are already using it.\n\nIn an exclusive conversation with Cointelegraph, Kusama noted that many people in the tech world are talking about an \u201ceverything app,\u201d but these innovations must be carried out from a community and decentralization perspective. He added that Shibarium incorporates both these principles in its operations while honoring \u201cthe principles of decentralization, interoperability and user-centric design for both blockchain and the technology sector at large.\u201d\n\nRelated: Why is Shiba Inu price up today?\n\nKusama further elaborated and said that the validator and delegator aspects of the new L2 will keep Shibarium decentralized, but that the true innovation lies in the framework, governance and charter to help govern the ecosystem\u2019s technology, community, protective and innovative aspects.\n\n\u201cBy using Shibarium for governance in this system, alongside self-sovereign identity to ensure quality membership (Shibizenship), the metaverse as our territory, and the ability to partner with other like-minded states, we have effectively shattered what nationhood is and rebuilt it upon the Shib ethos of decentralization!\u201d\n\nShibarium will make use of the Heimdall validator and Bor block production nodes, quite similar to the Polygon ecosystem. Heimdall will be based on the Tendermint consensus engine, while Bor will be completely interoperable with the Ethereum Virtual Machine.\n\nUsers must lock 10,000 BONE in the Shibarium network to become validators. Twenty-one million BONE will be reserved as rewards for validators and delegators inside the Shibarium ecosystem and used to pay authorized gas charges.\n\nMagazine: Deposit risk: What do crypto exchanges really do with your money?"

The zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) is a layer-2 scaling solution that provides lower transaction costs and higher throughput for DApps running in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nCointelegraph spoke exclusively to Linea senior product manager Declan Fox to unpack major milestones since the zkEVM\u2019s launch. Fox highlighted Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin\u2019s belief that zero-knowledge rollups (ZK-rollups) would prove crucial in the operation of the wider Ethereum ecosystem as Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (zk-SNARK) technology improves.\n\n\u201cBytecode-compatible zkEVMs, like Linea, provide stronger security guarantees than existing scaling solutions and maintain the full network effects of the EVM \u2014 the most adopted smart contract execution environment.\u201d\n\nAccording to Fox, Linea\u2019s mainnet facilitates trustless bridging between Ethereum and layer 2 in minutes, creating a capital-efficient environment for liquidity to be tied into rollups. Linea also addresses the disadvantages of optimistic rollup solutions that have a seven-day withdrawal confirmation time.\n\n\u201cMuch like how countries without foreign exchange control in the financial markets are more competitive, zkEVM solutions will soon outperform optimistic solutions in terms of user and liquidity acquisition.\u201d\n\nFox added that Linea supports a variety of Web3 use cases, while its low transaction costs and high throughput makes it particularly useful for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.\n\n\u201cLinea is seamless for existing DeFi protocols and DApp developers to build composable money legos that work together to create innovative user experiences.\u201d\n\nLinea also features default integration with ConsenSys\u2019 browser-based MetaMask wallet, allowing DApps on the network to access millions of users across the ecosystem.\n\nFox also noted that the potential for the Linea ecosystem is \u201cboundless,\u201d reflecting on the capabilities of ZK-rollup technology to provide lower costs, higher throughput and Ethereum-based security while providing a capital-efficient bridge to the layer-1 mainnet.\n\nThe public release also saw Linea\u2019s ERC-20 token bridge go live, allowing ERC-20 tokens \u2014 like stablecoins, liquid staking ETH and memecoins \u2014 to be bridged and accessible through the scaling solution.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: Here\u2019s how Ethereum\u2019s ZK-rollups can become interoperable"

With the aim of resolving Ethereum's scalability difficulties, Shibarium's mainnet launch serves as the fundamental framework for the whole SHIB ecosystem. It aims to increase transaction throughput while lowering costs, potentially outperforming rivals in terms of speed and cost-efficiency for decentralized applications (dApps) and transactions.\n\nThe launch of Shibarium is an intentional step to elevate Shiba Inu above its meme coin roots. SHIB, which was first released in 2020, quickly became popular in the memecoin space of cryptocurrencies together with Dogecoin (DOGE). The initiative hopes to move beyond its meme status by establishing a new identity of the protocol with the addition of Shibarium.\n\nThe Shiba Inu lead developer who goes by the moniker Shytoshi Kusama emphasized how different Shibarium is from other scaling methods. In order to provide users with efficient transactions, ownership and membership features, it works as a layer-2 solution that powers governance and the Shiba State framework.\n\nThe network relies on the Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPOS) consensus mechanism.\n\nThe Shiba Inu ecosystem's numerous elements, such as tokens like SHIB and LEASH, SHIBOSHI NFTs, the decentralized market ShibaSwap, and the Shiba Eternity game, are all significant in relation to Shibarium."

BAYC, in second place, recorded sales worth $931,784 with fewer traders.\n\nSolana drives Polygon down\n\nIn other developments, Solana [SOL] NFTs have flipped Polygon on the blockchain standing with the most volume. While the competition for dominance in the NFT space is intensifying, the upturn signifies the increasing attention the NFT ecosystem has gained in recent times.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Polygon Profit Calculator\n\nPreviously, AMBCrypto compared how the Solana and Polygon blockchain have fared all through the year. According to the analysis, Polygon has had more active addresses than Solana in the last 30 days. And this could be attributed to the rising NFT participation within the network.\n\nHowever, in the last 24 hours, Solana\u2019s sales volume increased to $1.44 million. Also, wash trading on the blockchain rose by 249.59%. As expected, Ethereum maintained the lead over the other two with a volume of $8.41 million."

        "title": "Bitcoin and Ethereum Now Less Volatile Than Oil - U.Today",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), the two biggest cryptocurrencies by total market capitalization, keep displaying uncharacteristically anemic performance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to data analytics firm Kaiko, the 90-day volatility for BTC and ETH has plummeted to 35% and 37%, respectively. In contrast, oil's volatility is currently pegged at 41%.\n\nVolatility refers to the rate at which the price of a given asset increases or decreases for a given period of time. Historically, the flagship cryptocurrency has been known for its penchant for extremely high volatility. However, this has not been the case recently, with Bitcoin acting as a stablecoin.\n\nThis unusual bout of stability for Bitcoin has been accompanied by a sharp decrease in trading volume. Data reveals that Bitcoin's trading volume for last month was at its lowest since November 2020, with its 30-day volatility approaching a five-year low.\n\nIt is worth noting that Bitcoin now demonstrates lower volatility than other traditional stalwarts like the S&P 500, tech stocks and notably, gold, its closest rival.\n\nAs reported by U.Today, the Bollinger Bands, a widely used technical indicator, provides further insights into the anemic performance of the bellwether coin. Bollinger Bands are used to assess price and volatility over time for financial instruments. The narrowing of these bands signals a lull in price fluctuations.\n\nCryptocurrency analysts have recently observed that both Bitcoin and Ethereum's Bollinger Bands have tightened to their \"slimmest on the weekly timeframe.\" This indicates a broader shift toward tranquility on the crypto market.\n\nIn the meantime, oil prices have remained somewhat stable. Recent reports suggest that concerns over China's slowing economy have been offset by expectations of a tighter U.S. supply. However, Brent crude futures and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude are still navigating the rough seas of global economic factors."

        "content": "Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin has offered an endorsement of X's \"Community Notes\" feature, highlighting its relevance and association with \"crypto values\" in a lengthy blog post.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe social media platform's last two years have been filled with dramatic events, especially after Elon Musk's $44 billion acquisition last year and his crackdown on reporters and free speech.\n\nDespite these changes, Community Notes emerged as a widely respected feature, aiming to tackle misinformation by attaching context and facts to tweets.\n\nInitially introduced as \"Birdwatch\" in January 2021, Community Notes has seen steady growth, with a significant expansion phase overlapping with Musk's acquisition. The feature offers context on tweets that garner substantial attention, especially those covering contentious topics. These notes are not determined by a centralized team but are contributed and voted upon by the platform's users. An open-source algorithm dictates which notes are showcased, promoting transparency by enabling users to verify the algorithm's output against what is presented on the platform.\n\nButerin's interest in Community Notes stems from its embodiment of values often associated with cryptocurrency. Although not a typical \"crypto project,\" the system upholds principles like decentralization, transparency and community governance. Buterin argues that the transparency offered by Community Notes aligns closely with crypto values.\n\nHe believes this approach provides significant value by deterring centralized manipulation and granting due credit to platforms that uphold ethical standards."

As the market reacted to the Binance-related news, it also potentially led to an unexpected change in certain cryptocurrencies\u2019 price action resulting in millions of dollars in liquidations.\n\nEthereum leads the liquidations race\n\nApart from Bitcoin, it was Ethereum that stood out as the altcoin with the most liquidation. Being the second biggest cryptocurrency in the world, it is not a surprise, but the volume of long liquidations stood out from normal. Within the past day, over $15 million worth of long liquidations were observed in the case of ETH.\n\nThe other major cryptocurrencies that stood out in this regard were Dogecoin, Pepe coin, ApeCoin and Compound. DOGE noted over $6.13 million worth of long liquidations, marking a two-month high, while the volume of PEPE nearly hit $1 million against merely $80,000 worth of short liquidations.\n\nDogecoin long liquidation\n\nSimilarly, APE recorded about $1.44 million worth of long contracts being liquidated, hitting a monthly high, and COMP followed in suit, observing $809,000 in long liquidations. Collectively, the crypto marketnoted over $121 million worth of long liquidations against $10 million in short liquidations within a day.\n\nApeCoin long liquidations\n\nWhile the exact reason behind this is unknown, the sudden shift in tone and liquidations is most likely a reaction to FUD. Earlier in the day, Binance\u2019s regulated buy and sell arm, Binance Connect, was announced to face closure. This was confirmed by Binance Smart Chain-based decentralized exchange Biswap that tweeted,\n\n\u201cAfter a thorough consideration, Binance has made a difficult decision to disable Binance Connect on 15 August due to its provider closing the supporting card payments service. This change aligns with the strategic efforts of Binance to focus on its core businesses.\n\nConsidering the price action reaction to the FUD, the crypto market lost about $14 billion in a day, dropping by 1.2% to hit a total market capitalization of $1.12 trillion."

Now, it turns out that he may own much more\u2014putting the high-profile crypto-skeptic in the \u2018whale\u2019 category.\n\nIn a fresh set of financial disclosure documents submitted to the Office of Government Ethics, Trump reports owning just over $2.8 million in cryptocurrency held in an Ethereum wallet. The updated figure was uncovered by the Washington-based ethics watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), and shared on Twitter on Tuesday.\n\nThe disclosures also showed that Trump earned close to $4.9 million in licensing fees from a collection of non-fungible tokens (NFT) that his campaign launched as part of his bid to return to the White House in 2024 after his previous defeat to current-President Joe Biden in 2020.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSales of the tokens took off in the months following their release last December, including a brief surge after his first indictment by a state court in New York. However, their value sank soon after the candidate launched a second batch in April that crashed the first set\u2019s value.\n\nThe size of Trump\u2019s holdings put him in the category of crypto \u2018whales,\u2019 a term used to describe aholder of a massive amount of a given token.

        "title": "Breaking: Vitalik Reveals All Ethereum L2's Have Backdoors - CoinGape",
        "content": "Recent revelations by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin have thrown the crypto community into a debate about decentralizing Layer 2 projects like Arbitrum and Optimism. Buterin disclosed that all Layer 2 scaling solutions and rollups have a backdoor on the Ethereum blockchain, casting doubt on the presumed decentralization of these projects.\n\nAll Layer-2 Solutions Have Backdoors- Vitalik\n\nButerin explained that developers and project owners have access to multi-sig wallets, allowing them to make protocol changes. Although these backdoors can be seen as \u201ctraining wheels\u201d for the Ethereum blockchain, they have caused a division in ideology among crypto enthusiasts. Proponents argue for the necessity of the mechanism as a safeguard, while purists demand immutable and 100% decentralized protocols.\n\nLayer 2 protocols face potential regulation\n\nCrypto and DeFi analyst Chris Blec, a long-time critic of Layer 2 projects, supported Buterin\u2019s statement. Blec refers to such projects as \u201cbanking 2.0\u201d and argues that these protocols will likely be subject to regulation.\n\nInterestingly, even the largest stablecoins in the Ethereum ecosystem, USD Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) have central control that allows their teams to freeze assets in response to security threats.\n\nThey can call them temporary all they want but words don\u2019t actually matter. All that matters is that the backdoor is there. \u2014 Chris Blec (@ChrisBlec) August 14, 2023\n\nThe backdoor poses a risk of centralization, a principle that contradicts the essence of blockchain technology. On the other hand, removing the backdoor could introduce new vulnerabilities. As the crypto community grapples with this predicament, the Ethereum landscape faces tough decisions that could shape its future trajectory.\n\nWhile Layer 2 projects promise increased efficiency and lower transaction costs, their decentralization remains in question due to the backdoor access available to developers.\n\nConsequently, the debate continues over the trade-offs between security and centralization in the crypto world. Hence, the road ahead for Ethereum and its Layer 2 scaling solutions may be marked with increased scrutiny and potential regulatory implications."

        "content": "How to Bridge Assets to Cardano: A Comprehensive Guide to Decentralized Finance\n\n\u200dIn the rapidly evolving world of blockchain technology, bridging assets between different networks has become increasingly important.\n\nDecentralized finance (DeFi) offers a secure and efficient solution for users looking to transfer their assets to the Cardano blockchain.\n\nIn this comprehensive guide, we will explore the step-by-step process of bridging assets to Cardano, the benefits of decentralized finance, and the various platforms that support cross-chain bridging.\n\nAlso read: How to Bridge to Mantle?\n\nSource: Finbold\n\nIntroduction to Decentralized Finance and Cardano Blockchain\n\nIn recent years, decentralized finance (DeFi) has gained significant traction in the blockchain industry.\n\nDeFi refers to the concept of using smart contracts and blockchain technology to provide financial services without the need for intermediaries.\n\nCardano, a leading blockchain platform, has emerged as a prominent player in the DeFi space due to its scalability, advanced security features, and robust governance protocol.\n\nFurthermore, Cardano, with its native token ADA, offers a wide range of opportunities for users seeking to leverage decentralized finance.\n\nBy bridging assets to the Cardano blockchain, users can tap into the benefits of its advanced features and gain access to a diverse ecosystem of DeFi products and services.\n\nAlso read: How to Bridge to Conflux?\n\nUnderstanding the Bridging Process\n\nBridging assets involves transferring tokens from one blockchain network to another. Cryptocurrencies are often designed to function on specific chains, but bridges enable liquidity to flow seamlessly across different networks.\n\nIn the case of Cardano, bridging assets enable users to transfer tokens from other networks, such as Ethereum, to the Cardano blockchain.\n\nThe bridging process is managed by cross-chain bridging platforms that facilitate the secure transfer of assets between networks.\n\nThese platforms utilize smart contracts to lock funds in the original network and create equivalent tokens in the destination network.\n\nAdditionally, validators oversee the transactions on both chains to ensure the accuracy and security of the token transfer.\n\nSelecting a Wallet: Metamask and Cardano Native Wallets\n\nBefore initiating the bridging process, users must select a suitable wallet to store their assets.\n\nTwo popular options for bridging assets to Cardano are the Metamask wallet and Cardano\u2019s native wallets, such as Daedalus and Yoroi.\n\nMetamask is a widely used wallet that supports multiple blockchains, including Ethereum.\n\nAdditionally, it allows users to manage their Ethereum assets and interact with decentralized applications (DApps). To bridge assets from Ethereum to Cardano, users can connect their Metamask wallet to a cross-chain bridging platform that supports both networks.\n\nAlternatively, Cardano\u2019s native wallets, Daedalus and Yoroi, provide a seamless experience for managing ADA and interacting with the Cardano blockchain.\n\nUsers can securely store their ADA tokens and participate in activities like staking and voting within the Cardano ecosystem.\n\nUsers can connect their Cardano wallet to a compatible cross-chain bridging platform to bridge assets to Cardano.\n\nStep-by-Step Guide to Bridging Assets to Cardano\n\nSource: Coingape\n\nConnecting with a Cross-Chain Bridging Platform\n\nTo initiate the bridging process, users must connect with a cross-chain bridging platform supporting Cardano.\n\nTwo prominent options for bridging assets to Cardano are Celer Bridge and Multichain.\n\nCeler Bridge is a trusted cross-chain exchange that supports transfers to the Cardano Ouroboros chain.\n\nIt offers a streamlined process with lower fees and less slippage than traditional bridging options. To begin bridging with Celer Bridge, follow these steps:\n\nGo to the Celer Bridge website and link your preferred wallet, such as Metamask or Cardano\u2019s native wallet. Choose Cardano as the destination blockchain for your tokens. Select the token you wish to transfer and specify the amount. Review the transaction details and click \u2018Swap\u2019 to initiate the bridging process.\n\nMultichain is a multi-chain decentralized exchange (DEX) that supports Cardano and many other blockchains.\n\nIt offers a user-friendly interface and facilitates bridging from over 20 different blockchains, including Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, and more. To bridge assets to Cardano using Multichain, follow these steps:\n\nNavigate to the Multichain website and connect your preferred wallet, such as Metamask. Choose Cardano (Milkomeda Mainnet) as the target chain and select the source chain from which you want to send assets. Specify the token you want to bridge to Cardano and the amount you wish to transfer. Review the transaction details and approve the bridge to initiate the asset transfer.\n\nChoosing the Source and Destination Chains\n\nWhen bridging assets to Cardano, users must select the source chain from which they want to transfer tokens and the destination chain, Cardano\u2019s Ouroboros chain.\n\nFurthermore, the source chain could be Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, or any other compatible blockchain supported by the bridging platform.\n\nSelecting the Token and Specifying the Amount\n\nAfter choosing the source and destination chains, users must select the specific token they want to bridge to Cardano.\n\nDepending on the source chain, the token could be any ERC-20 or BEP-20 token. Users should double-check the token\u2019s compatibility with the bridging platform before proceeding.\n\nOnce the token is selected, users can specify the amount they wish to transfer to Cardano. It is advisable to start with a small amount for testing purposes before initiating larger transfers.\n\nReviewing the Transaction Details and Approving the Bridge\n\nBefore finalizing the bridging process, users should carefully review the transaction details, including the token, amount, and any associated fees.\n\nIt is essential to double-check the wallet address and ensure its accuracy to avoid any loss of funds.\n\nAfter reviewing the transaction details, users can approve the bridge and initiate the asset transfer. The bridging platform will lock the assets in the source chain and create equivalent tokens on the Cardano blockchain.\n\nMonitoring the Asset Transfer to Your Cardano Wallet\n\nOnce the bridging process is initiated, users can monitor the progress of the asset transfer to their Cardano wallet.\n\nThe transfer may take some time to complete depending on network congestion and other factors. Users should be patient and refrain from making unnecessary transactions during this period.\n\nSource: TradeSanta\n\nExploring Cross-Chain Bridging Platforms for Cardano\n\nCeler Bridge: A Trusted Option for Asset Transfer\n\nCeler Bridge is a cross-chain exchange that offers a streamlined and cost-effective solution for bridging assets to Cardano.

        "content": "Web3 gaming platform Immutable has commenced public testing of its Immutable zkEVM in collaboration with Polygon Labs.\n\nWork on the zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) network began in March after Immutable announced a partnership with Polygon Labs. Polygon\u2019s own \u201choly grail\u201d Ethereum-scaling zkEVM hit mainnet on March 27.\n\nIn an Aug. 14 announcement, Immutable said its zkEVM will give game developers access to lower development costs and the security and network effects that come with the Ethereum ecosystem. In March, Immutable\u2019s co-founder and president, Robbie Ferguson, said the zkEVM is aimed at increasing ownership rights for Web3 gamers.\n\nImmutable zkEVM developer documents. Source: Immutable\n\nOver 20 gaming companies have partnered with Immutable to support the launch, including GameStop, TokenTrove marketplace, Web-based game distributor Kongregate, game designer iLogos and others, according to Immutable.\n\nAt least 12 games have already started building their Web3 titles on zkEVM, it added. These include CoinArcade, Galaxy Commanders, Medieval Empires, MetalCore, Meta Toy, DragonZ SAGA, Rune Realms, Shardbound, Infinite Victory, EF Defense and SimWin Football. MetalCore, in particular, has announced a beta launch date of September 15 on Immutable zkEVM.\n\nImmutable zkEVM testnet will use zero-knowledge proofs to secure transfers between itself and Sepolia Ethereum, allowing developers to test out how the mainnet version will work once it launches.\n\nThe network is fully compatible with Ethereum applications, meaning that developers can port Ethereum projects over to it with minimal changes, Immutable stated. The team will also be deploying an \u201cImmutable Relayer for currency abstraction and gas sponsorship\u201d soon, which will allow developers to create gas-less wallet accounts.\n\nImmutable\u2019s chief technology officer and co-founder, Alex Connolly, expressed his view that the new network will be \u201cirresistible\u201d to developers, stating:\n\n\u201cThis chain, combined with our suite of platform products, is the first end-to-end EVM solution dedicated exclusively to making games successful. We\u2019re already seeing a massive influx from games, players and partners that will make the Immutable ecosystem irresistible for the next generation of web3 games.\"\n\nImmutable is the developer of the Gods Unchained Web3 trading card game, which was originally launched on Ethereum. In April 2021, the company launched its first zero-knowledge-based layer 2 network Immutable X in an attempt to lower transaction fees for players of its games.\n\nRelated: Immutable\u2019s Gods Unchained launches on Epic Games Store\n\nHowever, that network is not fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine, the computation engine that Ethereum uses. For this reason, users of Immutable X must create derivative keys through a web interface in order to use the network. By contrast, users should now be able to simply switch networks within their wallets to access Immutable zkEVM.\n\nEthereum founder Vitalik Buterin has recently weighed in on the benefits and disadvantages of zkEVMs, saying that they may cause data inefficiency and latency issues but may also greatly improve the scalability of Ethereum."

Having already resonated with a community of over 21 million user wallets during its beta testnet, the live Shibarium mainnet is now ready to on-board millions more who are interested in shaping a new future that honors the principles of decentralization, interoperability, and user-centric design for both blockchain and technology at large.\n\n\u201cMany in the tech world, inside and outside blockchain, are promising \u2018everything apps\u2019 and full user interactivity in the world of ideas, goods, services, and other opportunities,\u201d said Shiba Inu Lead Developer who goes by the pseudonym Shytoshi Kusama. \u201cHowever, any such promise absolutely must start at a place of both community and decentralization. As part of one of the most popular cryptocurrencies on the planet, Shibarium lives at the intersection of those two principles in a way that eludes most other technologies, even many other blockchains.\u201d\n\nFocusing on facilitating high-speed transactions with minimal gas fees and transforming the user experience in the blockchain space, Shibarium is built on the community-first and environment-friendly consensus mechanism that is Proof of Stake (POS). The Shibarium blockchain is built on a sturdy foundation of both validators and delegators. Validators run nodes, process transactions, and create new blocks, ensuring the seamless operation and overall security of the ecosystem. Delegators, meanwhile, are empowered to support these carefully curated validators by staking support tokens. Both validators and delegators are rewarded for their participation in this ecosystem with a governance token called BONE, which has a total supply of 250,000,000. BONE can also be used within Shiba Inu State governance.\n\nAnyone can build cost-effective protocols on Shibarium, expanding the reach and potential of the ecosystem while enriching the overall user. The Shiba Inu Ecosystem is also prioritizing the integration of Self-Sovereign Identity, or SSI, into all necessary protocols moving forward so that those who interact with the Shiba Inu Ecosystem are empowered to fully control and secure their digital identity without the interference of third parties. SSI enables users\u2019 self custody of verified credentials including physical documents that confirm and secure identity, such as passports and driver\u2019s licenses.\n\nNow that it is live, Shibarium will also be used to support the other parts of the existing Shiba Inu Ecosystem, including the $SHIB and $LEASH tokens, SHIBOSHI NFTs, SHIB The Metaverse, the ShibaSwap DEX, and the Shiba Eternity game alongside the thousands of incoming community projects.\n\nAbout SHIB\n\nSHIB, a world-leading ecosystem of decentralized finance (DeFi) cryptocurrencies has gained popularity among millions of holders worldwide. It has 3.6 million Twitter followers and is frequently ranked as the second most searched crypto project by Google. Its ecosystem of tokens include $SHIB, $LEASH, and $BONE, plus native SHIBOSHIs NFTs.\n\n\n\nSHIB.io utilizes the Shib Ecosystem to power quality technologies including SHIB:The Metaverse and Shibarium, the Layer 2 blockchain, providing a solid foundation, scalability, security, and innovation for a decentralized world.\n\n\n\nTo learn more about SHIB, please visit the official website: https://shibatoken.com.\n\nTo learn more about or join Shib visit: https://www.shib.io."

        "title": "The Rise of Bitcoin Spark: Is It The New Ethereum In The Making? - Benzinga",
        "content": "Bitcoin Spark is rapidly gaining traction in the crypto domain, challenging the dominance of established cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. This article explores the intricacies of Bitcoin Spark, its comparison with Ethereum, and the reasons behind its rising prominence.\n\nEthereum: A Brief Overview\n\nEthereum has long been a major player in the crypto world, known for its versatility and the unique functionalities it offers. It extends the blockchain applications beyond just cryptocurrency, enabling developers to build and deploy decentralized applications (dApps) powered by smart contracts. Ethereum's native token, ETH, facilitates transactions within these smart contracts and acts as a security measure against inefficient code and malicious activities.\n\nOn the contrary, Bitcoin's primary purpose has been as a digital currency and a store of value. Ethereum's broad application scope and dynamic platform have attracted a significant number of investors who see it as a promising avenue for long-term growth.\n\nBitcoin Spark: A New Contender\n\nBitcoin Spark, or BTCS, is a novel cryptocurrency project aiming to improve upon the limitations of Bitcoin and, in some aspects, Ethereum. It uses a radical blockchain technology known as Proof-Of-Process (PoP), which is a hybrid of Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) models. This unique consensus model enhances the transaction capacity and reduces transaction fees, making BTCS more efficient for everyday transactions.\n\nMoreover, the Bitcoin Spark network includes a separate layer for smart contracts, which can use different programming languages. This layer reaches consensus on the main network but allows innovative dApps to be developed without causing transaction congestion.\n\nDeciphering Proof-of-Process\n\nThe PoP model is a novel concept introduced by Bitcoin Spark. It combines the principles of PoW and PoS with a unique algorithm that restricts linear rewards based on stake size or raw processing power. This innovative approach prevents the concentration of power among large-scale miners.\n\nBTCS mining requires an easy-to-use mining program that can be installed on any device. This program automatically limits the device's processing power usage, thereby controlling the mining capability. The rewards for miners are proportional to the processing power they rent out to the network, fostering a fair distribution of BTCS tokens.\n\nA New Era of Mining\n\nBitcoin Spark's mining approach is a significant departure from traditional methods. Bitcoin's PoW model involves solving complex mathematical problems using high-end computers, consuming a lot of energy. In contrast, Ethereum's PoS model requires participants to lock a certain amount of ETH to earn validation rights.\n\nBitcoin Spark, with its PoP model, simplifies this process. It allows users to mine using any device, making mining more accessible and promoting decentralization. This method also ensures a fair distribution of BTCS tokens regardless of the size of the stake or the computing power of the mining device.\n\nRewarding Network Participants\n\nBitcoin Spark has devised innovative ways to reward network participants. The primary source of revenue comes from a decentralized CPU rental system. Users pay with BTCS tokens to access processing power, which then goes into the mining rewards pool.\n\nThe project also earns revenue from advertising. Half of the revenue from advertisements on the Bitcoin Spark application and website is distributed among network participants and miners. The community actively polices the advertising content, ensuring a clean and trustworthy platform.\n\nBitcoin Spark's Tokenomics\n\nBitcoin Spark's tokenomics closely mirror that of Bitcoin, with a maximum supply of 21 million tokens. However, the time to reach this maximum supply is significantly longer for BTCS, allowing for a prolonged period of mining rewards distribution.\n\nDuring the ICO phase, BTCS was offered at $1.50, with an additional 20% bonus. This presented an excellent opportunity for investors to participate in the project's growth.\n\nThe Future of Bitcoin Spark\n\nBitcoin Spark's unique features and solutions looks to stir interest among investors and crypto enthusiasts. Its potential for disrupting the crypto space makes it an intriguing project to watch.\n\nWhile Ethereum continues to maintain its stronghold with its unique offerings, Bitcoin Spark is rapidly emerging as a strong contender. As both platforms continue to evolve, the competition for dominance in the crypto world is heating up.\n\nFind out more about Bitcoin Spark on:\n\nWebsite: https://bitcoinspark.org/\n\nBuy BTCS: https://network.bitcoinspark.org/register\n\nThis post was authored by an external contributor and does not represent Benzinga's opinions and has not been edited for content.

        "title": "Top Use Cases of Ethereum NFT Assets - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Check out the Use cases before trading Ethereum NFT Assets, and the Future of Digital Ownership\n\nUnique digital tokens that reflect ownership or validity of particular digital or physical goods are known as Ethereum NFT assets. On the Ethereum blockchain, using decentralized apps and smart contracts, they are generated, purchased, traded, and owned. Because they enable direct peer-to-peer transactions without middlemen and can establish verifiable ownership, Ethereum NFTs have grown in popularity and revolutionized how digital assets are priced, acquired, and traded.\n\nUse Cases of Ethereum NFT Assets:\n\nA wide range of use cases across several sectors and areas is possible for Ethereum NFT (Non-Fungible Token) assets. NFTs are suited for applications where ownership, authenticity, and provenance of digital or physical assets are vital due to their distinctive characteristics, such as indivisibility, verifiability, and scarcity. Some well-known applications for Ethereum NFT assets are listed below:\n\n1. Collectibles and Digital Art:\n\nBy enabling artists to tokenize and market their digital creations as distinct digital assets, NFTs have revolutionized the art sector. Limited edition or one-of-a-kind works of art can be produced by artists to ensure scarcity and exclusivity. By enabling provenance monitoring, NFTs make it possible to quickly verify the ownership history and validity of the artwork. Marketplaces for digital art and collectibles built on NFT technology, such as SuperRare, OpenSea, and Rarible, have grown in popularity.\n\n2. Gaming and Virtual Resources:\n\nIn-game characters, objects, and virtual assets may now be owned and traded by gamers because of the widespread use of NFTs in the gaming sector. NFTs enable the safe purchase, sale, and transfer of these assets, giving users actual ownership and the opportunity to profit from their gaming accomplishments. Axie Infinity, CryptoKitties, and Decentraland are three prominent blockchain-based games that highlight the potential of NFTs in the gaming industry.\n\n3. Entertainment and Music:\n\nThe music and entertainment businesses are changing thanks to NFTs. Exclusive music songs, albums, or concert tickets can be made available by musicians as NFTs, giving fans the chance to purchase one-of-a-kind digital mementos. NFTs can give artists new sources of income, allow for direct fan interaction, and give royalty payments transparency and traceability. NFT marketplaces for music and entertainment have formed on platforms like Audius and Rarible.\n\n4. Virtual Property:\n\nIn virtual worlds or metaverses, NFTs have been used to represent ownership of virtual land, buildings, and assets. Virtual real estate may be purchased, sold, and developed by users to provide one-of-a-kind and immersive experiences. Users can exchange NFT-based virtual assets and monetize their works in virtual settings provided by platforms like Decentraland and The Sandbox.\n\n5. Identity and Domain Names:\n\nNFTs may be used to symbolize domain name ownership, enabling users to safely purchase, sell, and transfer individual internet addresses. As a result, there is no longer a need for a centralized authority to manage and trade domain names. NFTs may also be used for digital identity management, enabling people to demonstrate control over and ownership of their digital identities and personal data.\n\n6. Physical Asset Tokenization:\n\nPhysical assets like real estate, designer products, and works of art may be tokenized using NFTs to create digital equivalents that can be exchanged on the blockchain. This makes it possible for often illiquid assets to have fractional ownership, liquidity, and efficient value transfer. NFTs offer provenance and transparency, which lowers the risk of fraud and fosters confidence in high-value transactions.\n\nJust a handful of the numerous use cases for Ethereum NFT assets are shown in the preceding paragraphs. NFTs are expected to be used by new applications and sectors as technology progresses to unlock value, establish ownership, and provide distinctive digital experiences.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "How the Latest \u201cERC-4337\u201d Ethereum Upgrade Will Impact NFT? - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Know how the ERC-4337 Ethereum upgrade will impact the NFT market and ecosystem in 2023\n\nThis article will explain how the latest \u201cERC-4337\u201d Ethereum upgrade will impact the NFT market and what it means for NFT creators and collectors.\n\nWhat is ERC-4337?\n\nERC-4337 is an Ethereum standard that achieves account abstraction on the protocol without any consensus-layer changes. Deployed on the Ethereum mainnet in March 2023, ERC-4337 makes transacting and creating contracts in a single contract account possible. It opens the door to user-friendly crypto wallet designs that could facilitate broader adoption.\n\nAccount abstraction is a long-awaited feature of Ethereum that aims to combine the features of the protocol\u2019s two existing account types: externally owned accounts (EOAs) and smart contract accounts. EOAs are owned and controlled by users, while smart contract accounts are smart contracts deployed on the network. Both accounts can receive, hold, and send ether or tokens, but only smart contract accounts can execute code and logic.\n\nMost existing crypto wallets on Ethereum, such as MetaMask, are EOAs, meaning they are limited by the rules set around EOAs. These limitations include solely relying on private keys to access accounts and requiring all transactions to be signed. ERC-4337 allows users to use smart contract wallets containing arbitrary verification logic instead of EOAs as their primary account. This means that users can have more control and flexibility over their transactions, such as using social recovery, customization, upgradeability, multi-factor authentication, automatic payments, and more.\n\nHow Does ERC-4337 Work?\n\nERC-4337 works by introducing a higher-layer pseudo-transaction object called a UserOperation. A UserOperation is a data structure that describes a transaction to be sent on behalf of a user. Unlike a normal transaction, a UserOperation contains several other fields, such as nonce, gas limit, gas price, fee recipient, signature, and data. The signature field is not defined by the protocol but by each account implementation \u2013 the smart contract wallet sending the UserOperation.\n\nA UserOperation is not directly included in a block but instead sent to a special contract called an EntryPoint. An EntryPoint is a singleton contract that executes bundles of UserOperations. Bundlers are nodes (block builders) that can handle UserOperations, create a valid EntryPoint.handleOps() transaction, and add it to the block while it is still valid. This can be achieved in various ways, such as flash bots or proposer-builder separation.\n\nERC-4337 also introduces a concept of paymasters \u2013 helper contracts trusted by accounts to validate an aggregated signature and pay for the gas fees of UserOperations. Paymasters can also implement different fee models, such as sponsored transactions or tokens as gas.\n\nHow Does ERC-4337 Impact NFTs?\n\nERC-4337 has several implications for the NFT market and ecosystem. Here are some of the main benefits and challenges of ERC-4337 for NFTs:\n\nBenefits:\n\nERC-4337 enables more user-friendly and secure crypto wallet designs that can attract more users to the NFT space. Users can have more options and features for managing their NFTs, such as social recovery, customization, upgradeability, multi-factor authentication, automatic payments, and more.\n\nERC-4337 allows users to pay gas fees differently, such as using tokens or sponsored transactions. This can lower the barriers to entry for NFT creation and trading, especially for users who do not have either or do not want to deal with volatile gas prices.\n\nERC-4337 supports aggregated signatures (e.g., BLS), which can reduce the size and cost of transactions involving multiple signatures. This can enable more efficient and scalable solutions for NFT minting and transferring.\n\nChallenges:\n\nERC-4337 requires users to trust bundlers and paymasters to handle their UserOperations correctly and fairly. Users may face censorship, front-running, or malicious behavior from these actors.\n\nERC-4337 adds complexity and overhead to the protocol and the user experience. Users may need to understand how UserOperations work and how to interact with different bundlers and paymasters.\n\nERC-4337 does not solve the environmental impact of NFTs on Ethereum. NFTs still consume a lot of energy and generate many carbon emissions due to the proof-of-work consensus mechanism of Ethereum. Users who care about sustainability may prefer solutions like layer 2 scaling or alternative blockchains.\n\nIn conclusion, ERC-4337 is an innovative Ethereum standard that achieves account abstraction without consensus-layer changes. It allows users to use smart contract wallets instead of EOAs as their primary account, enabling more user-friendly and flexible crypto wallet designs. It also allows users to pay gas fees differently and supports aggregated signatures for more efficient transactions.\n\nERC-4337 has significant implications for the NFT market and ecosystem. It can lower the barriers to entry for NFT creation and trading, as well as enable more features and options for managing NFTs. However, it also introduces some challenges and risks, such as trusting bundlers and paymasters, dealing with complexity and overhead, and addressing the environmental impact of NFTs.\n\nERC-4337 is a promising development for Ethereum and NFTs, but it is not a silver bullet. Users should be aware of the benefits and challenges of ERC-4337 and make informed decisions about their NFT activities.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Bulls In Fear, Will ETH Revisit $900? - The Coin Republic",
        "content": "Ethereum is worrying investors. A major fall will soon be witnessed toward the round mark of $1000, followed by $900. The chart showcases bearishness and double top formation near $2000, and the price is struggling near the lower trendline of the symmetrical triangle pattern. This technical formation indicates that the ETH price is ready for a correction, and sellers are engaging in short buildup activity noted on the charts.\n\nFrom the start of 2023, ETH price showed accumulation, revamped from the support region of $1000, and showed a significant runaway. At now, the technical sentiments are signalling that ETH is looking to cool off the gains and looking for a retracement now. Moreover, the trading volume shows strong seller participation for the last session, and buyers are starting to unwind their positions and are in fear.\n\nThe ETH price failed to break out of $2000, and since then, there has been a steady decline. Furthermore, the ETH price is trading near the 100-day EMA and close to the major trendline, which, if it breaks, will lead to a major correction in the following sessions.\n\nAt press time, ETH price is trading at $1841 with an intraday drop of 0.27% showing selling pressure on the charts. Moreover, the trading volume increased by 1.66% to $4.95 Billion. The pair of ETH/BTC is at 0.0627 BTC, and the market cap is $224.75 Billion. Moreover, analysts\u2019 sell rating suggests a downfall toward $1000, followed by strong support of $900.\n\nETH Signals a Reversal Toward $900 On Daily Charts\n\nSource: ETH Price Chart At TradingView\n\nETH price is hovering in a narrow range on the daily charts, indicating a weak chart structure and signaling a correction in the following sessions. Moreover, the price is near the major trendline and the 200-day EMA, which, if it breaks, would lead to a revisit of the demand zone at $900. Moreover, key indicators initiated a sell signal which paused near the lower bollinger band waiting for a breakdown.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Short Term Chart Shows Negative Outlook\n\nSource: ETH Price Chart At TradingView\n\nOn the 4-hour charts, ETH price suggests a negative outlook with $900 being the likely target.\n\nThe RSI curve stayed near neutrality and showed a bearish divergence indicating a selling signal for the upcoming sessions. Moreover, the charts favour the bears, and buyers are looking in trouble now.\n\nThe MACD indicator showed convergence of moving averages; the MA line stuck with the signal line indicates consolidation. However, it also signals that the ETH price might face a significant correction toward $900 in the upcoming sessions.\n\nConclusion:\n\nEthereum (ETH) price is hovering near the cluster of $1800, close to the 200-day EMA, which sellers are preparing to smash in the upcoming sessions. The technicals are giving a sell signal, as the buyers started laying off the gains, confirming that sellers were looking to win the battle and came into action.\n\nTechnical Levels:\n\nSupport Levels: $1200 and $900\n\nResistance Levels: $2000 and $2200\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe views and opinions stated by the author, or any people named in this article, are for informational purposes only and do not establish financial, investment, or other advice.

        "content": "The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may approve the foremost Ethereum futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This news comes amid the rising interests of several financial giants that have filed applications with the US SEC to deploy ETF products based on cryptocurrencies, such as BTC and ETH.\n\nBig Victory For Crypto: SEC To Greenlight Ethereum ETFs\n\nA Bloomberg report disclosed that the SEC is showing a possible green light to approve an ETH futures ETF for institutional investors in the country. This approval could create a way for other companies, such as Bitwise, ProShares, Volatility Shares, and Roundhill, that have submitted applications to provide ETH futures ETFs.\n\nThe SEC has hesitated to approve cryptocurrency ETFs until late 2021. The commission allowed trading in funds related to Bitcoin futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.\n\nSince then, there has been increasing speculation concerning the potential of an Ethereum futures product being deployed into the broader financial market. But the US financial watchdog has been slow to permit a derivatives product in the second-biggest crypto asset.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s reason for delaying anchors on concerns about manipulating digital asset prices and insufficient liquidity.\n\nThe Cryptocurrency ETF Landscape\n\nMany asset management companies in the US and beyond have continued pushing to launch crypto exchange-traded funds. Grayscale Investments LLC, a leading asset management firm, still awaits the US SEC\u2019s decision to approve its application. The firm filed to convert its asset from a Bitcoin trust to a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nIt is worth noting that Grayscale reportedly announced its decision to hire more workers for its ETF team. In related news, another prominent asset management company, Valkyrie Investments, filed for an ETF based on Ethereum futures on Wednesday, August 16.\n\nNotably, the fund will invest nearly all its assets in Ethereum exchange-traded futures, allocating a small portion to collateral investments like cash, cash-related instruments, or high-end securities.\n\nIn another development, Galaxy Digital CEO, Mike Novogratz, referenced reliable sources at Invesco and BlackRock, stating his optimism for regulators to approve a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund. He said that the question of approving a spot Bitcoin ETF is a \u201cmatter of time, not whether the agency will approve.\u201d\n\nThe CEO added that institutional players are optimistic that the US financial agency will approve spot Bitcoin ETFs in less than six months. While the United States SEC delays its approval, other countries have long supported crypto ETFs.\n\nFor instance, the holding company linked to QR Asset Management QR Capital in Brazil announced an ETH ETF approval in 2021. Brazil\u2019s securities regulatory agency, Comiss\u00e3o de Valores Mobili\u00e1rios (CVM), approved its Ethereum $ETH ETF fund application.\n\nFeatured image from Pixabay and chart from TradingView.com"

At this level, 2.48 million addresses acquired a total of 3.8 million ETH.\u201d \u2013 Ali (@ali_charts, on X)\n\nThis is what the Twitter (X) account known as Ali (@ali_charts) said on August 16. Pointing to a relevant price zone for Ethereum at $1,600, that should have high buyer demand in case ETH loses its current ranges.\n\nIf #Ethereum falls below the $1,800 mark, the next significant support level is positioned at approximately $1,600.

When the price of Ethereum drops, open interest spikes, followed by a bounce, which is followed by a decrease in open interest.\u201d \u2013 crypto sunmoon\n\nMeanwhile, it\u2019s possible to see, in the shared chart, a recent small drop in ETH\u2019s price, followed by a small spike in Ethereum\u2019s Open Interest positions \u2014 but these are far smaller than previous movements, which could suggest that the OI spike is not done yet. Neither price drops.\n\nEthereum: Open Interest \u2013 All Exchanges, All Symbol.

        "content": "Messari\u2019s Q2 2023 report on the state of Bitcoin, Ethereum and the crypto market was published yesterday.\n\n1/ We're proud to present our inaugural State of the Market report for Q2 2023! \ud83d\udcf0\ud83d\udce2\n\n\n\nA collection of market data and key performance indicators from 30+ projects covered through our Protocol Services\u2019 engagements, with Bitcoin & Ethereum as benchmarks.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udd17https://t.co/BlwiuIzXma pic.twitter.com/y9AFWy6yEa \u2014 Messari (@MessariCrypto) August 15, 2023\n\nThe PDF is a whopping 68 pages long, and was compiled by Senior Research Analyst Mihai Grigore, along with Stephen Basile, Editorial Coordinator, and Peter Horton, Research Analyst.\n\nThe report aggregates market data and key performance indicators from over 30 crypto projects followed by Messari, and also includes Bitcoin and Ethereum as a comparison.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum in Messari\u2019s crypto report\n\nWith regard to Bitcoin in particular, an analysis was made of Stacks, a layer-2 based on Bitcoin that enables the creation of smart contracts.\n\nStacks\u2019 market capitalization has increased by 53.3% since the beginning of the year, mainly due to the success of Ordinals and other Bitcoin assets.\n\nIts TVL hit an annual high at $36.0 million, although the Nakamoto version is still under development.\n\nsBTC is also still under development, hoping to provide access to a huge amount of liquidity in BTC through a bridge.\n\nDuring the quarter, due to a bug, Stacking was disabled for two cycles.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nAs far as Ethereum is concerned, the report highlights the growth of ETH\u2019s dominance from 17.4% at the beginning of the year to 18% at the end of June.\n\nIn addition, it points out that there was also an increase in usage and burns during the quarter, resulting in higher deflation.\n\nLayer-2 solutions also continued to grow, but growth was limited by rising gas costs.\n\nMarket performance\n\nCompared to twelve months ago, among the cryptocurrencies analysed in this report, Ethereum stands out, with an unparalleled +80%.\n\nIn second place, in terms of price performance compared to June 2022, is Stacks (+69%) followed by Bitcoin (+53%).\n\nIt is worth noting that the majority of the others show losses between June 2022 and June 2023, with Pocket Network recording a whooping -72%.\n\nLosses of over 60% were also reported for Boba Network and The Sandbox, and over 50% for Near, Apecoin, and 1inch,\n\nAmong the main altcoins, the negative performances of Cardano (-37%), and Solana (-44%) stand out, followed by -26% for Polkadot. Avalanche, Filecoin and Hedera also did poorly.\n\nBNB saved itself with +9%, while Tron did better with +17%.\n\nXRP (+42%) and Polygon (+37%) did well.\n\nA completely different story applies to the performance of the second quarter alone, i.e. the comparison between prices on 30 June 2023 and those on 31 March of the same year.\n\nThe strongest of the crypto assets analyzed was Tron, with +16%, followed by Bitcoin (+7%) and Ethereum (+6%).\n\nPractically all the others suffered, with losses of over 40% for Polygon, Apecoin, 1inch and Boba Network.\n\nSolana stopped at -11%, with XRP at -12%. BNB, on the other hand, lost 24% of its market value in the quarter.\n\nIn other words, it was not a good quarter for the crypto markets. However, it should not be forgotten that July was a much more positive month, thanks in particular to XRP\u2019s victory over the SEC.\n\nTrading volumes on Bitcoin, Ethereum and crypto according to Messari\u2019s report\n\nBy contrast, trading volumes were all down compared to both June 2022 and March 2023.\n\nThe only exceptions were Stacks (+312% compared to June 2022) and Venus (+390% compared to March 2023).\n\nThis should come as no surprise, both because during 2022 the hype of 2021 completely wore off, causing 2023 to begin with almost no hype, and because even during the first six months of 2023 the hype actually continued to wane.\n\nCuriously, Bitcoin\u2019s trading volumes fell more compared to March 2023 (-53%) than to June 2022 (-48%), while for Ethereum it was the opposite: only -24% compared to March, but -57% compared to last year.\n\nAmong the major altcoins, all of them have recorded a larger drop in volume since June 2022 than since March 2023, so Bitcoin in this respect is a real exception.\n\nOn the other hand, the first quarter of 2023 saw a real dominance of Bitcoin on the crypto markets, whereas in June 2022 all cryptocurrencies suffered from the collapse of Celsius.\n\nHowever, this only reiterates that Bitcoin is different from all other cryptocurrencies, and that in the long run it tends to lose less when prices fall."
