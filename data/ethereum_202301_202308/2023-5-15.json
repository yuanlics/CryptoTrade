        "title": "Ethereum vs. Bitcoin: Which Crypto Is Better? - Nasdaq",
        "content": "Cryptocurrencies, also known as digital currencies, have been all the rage over the last couple of years. Coins like bitcoin have skyrocketed in recent years, and financial institutions are starting to get on board. Two of the largest and most popular coins are ethereum and bitcoin. This article explores and compares both currencies and will help you understand the pros and cons of each so you can determine which one might be right for you.\n\nRead: Looking To Diversify In A Bear Market? Consider These 6 Alternative Investments\n\nAbout Cryptocurrencies\n\nA cryptocurrency is a secure, virtual currency that is nearly impossible to counterfeit. These digital coins are assets that exist on distributed networks. The networks\u2019 decentralized nature means that governments and other central authorities can\u2019t control them.\n\nBlockchain technology, which is a technology based on a distributed ledger database, underpins cryptocurrencies. Cryptography and encryption techniques secure the network and prevent tampering. Every transaction is stored as a separate block on the chain, and those records are guaranteed to be accurate and immutable.\n\nEthereum vs. Bitcoin\n\nEthereum and bitcoin are arguably the most popular cryptocurrencies on the market today. They certainly are the largest by market cap. Bitcoin\u2019s market cap is over $363 billion, while ethereum\u2019s market cap is around $161 billion.\n\nBitcoin\n\nBitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, launched in 2009 by a crypto architect known pseudonymously as Satoshi Nakamoto. The idea for this digital currency was simple yet revolutionary. It promised an alternative to traditional currency, called fiat currency, via a decentralized and transparent financial system accessible to all.\n\nBitcoin works on a blockchain network. Transactions happen between bitcoin wallets using private keys, which provide mathematical proof of their authenticity. Cryptography ensures both the integrity and the chronological order of transactions, and a distributed consensus system confirms pending transactions.\n\nBitcoin has capped the number of coins that can be minted at 21 million. Once that number has been reached, the coins can still be traded but no more can be introduced.\n\nThe following stats from CoinMarketCap are current as of Sept. 27:\n\nBitcoin Quick Stats Price $18,973.12 Market cap $363.56 billion Market dominance 39.17%\n\nEthereum\n\nEthereum\u2019s white paper was released in 2013, and the project officially launched in 2015. Ethereum is an open-source, community-driven project and has seen quite a bit of evolution since its inception.\n\nLike Bitcoin, Ethereum is a decentralized, peer-to-peer network that snubs censorship and surveillance. The focus of the project is to enable access to financial services and commerce for everyone. It does this by allowing for the development of other cryptos as well as the execution of smart contracts on its platform, CoinMarketCap explained.\n\nIBM describes smart contracts as programs stored on a blockchain that run automatically when predetermined conditions are met. These functionalities make Ethereum a more versatile platform than Bitcoin.\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, Ethereum allows for an unlimited number of tokens.\n\nGood To Know The main difference between Ethereum and Bitcoin is the fact that Ethereum is programmable. That feature broadens the scope of Ethereum, making it more than just a digital currency. It makes Ethereum a marketplace for financial services, games and apps.\n\nEthereum Quick Stats Price $1,316.21 Market cap $161.30 billion Market dominance 17.39%\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum: Pros and Cons\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are both blockchains, but they serve different purposes, each with its own benefits and drawbacks.\n\nPros and Cons of Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin has a narrow purpose: provide an alternative to fiat currency and a system for processing transactions.\n\nPros\n\nBitcoin was the first cryptocurrency on the market.\n\nThe coin has the best brand recognition and most liquidity, which has made it the most widely accepted cryptocurrency.\n\nThere\u2019s still huge potential growth for bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin uses blockchain technology designed to protect against fraud or identity theft.\n\nIts value is based on supply and demand, not political interference.\n\nBitcoin has a faster transaction speed than fiat currency.\n\nThe 21 million cap on bitcoins could drive prices higher by making the coin more scarce.\n\nCons\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price is highly volatile.\n\nBitcoin has limited functionality.\n\nBitcoin uses an extreme amount of energy, which is bad for climate change.\n\nBitcoin doesn\u2019t provide 100% anonymity.\n\nPros and Cons of Ethereum\n\nWhereas the purpose of the Bitcoin blockchain is to process transactions and store value, Ethereum is a platform that also supports the development of other projects.\n\nPros\n\nEthereum leverages blockchain technology for its decentralized, transparent system.\n\nThe technology enables functionality beyond digital currency, such as decentralized applications and smart contracts.\n\nThe developer community is one of the largest.\n\nThe Ethereum platform processes transactions faster than Bitcoin.\n\nEthereum recently completed an upgrade that reduced its carbon footprint 99.95%.\n\nCons\n\nThe coin is not bitcoin, which is the most popular cryptocurrency in the world.\n\nbitcoin, which is the most popular cryptocurrency in the world. The transaction fees are potentially higher than on the Bitcoin platform.\n\nEthereum is slow compared to alternative platforms, referred to as \u201cEthereum killers,\u201d like Solana, although the recent upgrade could improve Ethereum\u2019s speed exponentially.\n\nUnlimited supply could dampen demand for ethereum tokens.\n\nKnow the Risks of Investing In Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nAll cryptocurrency investments are speculative. The more aware you are of the risks, the better you can mitigate them if you decide to invest.\n\nHype and FOMO Risks\n\nThe fear of missing out is a powerful driver for people to buy cryptocurrencies. With bitcoin\u2019s explosion in value over the past few years, it\u2019s easy to get caught up in the hype. No one wants to lose out on the chance of getting rich from cryptocurrency, especially when it has already made many people extremely rich.\n\nHowever, regulators continue to warn the public that you could lose all your money in crypto. For example, bitcoin\u2019s price has dropped about 60% since the beginning of the year, and ethereum is down significantly, too.\n\nSecurity Risks\n\nBecause cryptocurrencies are digital assets, they\u2019re potentially vulnerable to hackers. The first month of 2022 saw several notable hacks. Hackers stole $80 million worth of crypto from Quibit, a decentralized platform. And the Crypto.com exchange reported the theft of about $35 million in cryptocurrency, most of which was ethereum and bitcoin.\n\nAnalysts also warn that quantum computers could hack crypto wallets, even though the technology isn\u2019t mainstream yet.\n\nTax Risks\n\nThe IRS wants to know about gains from crypto investments you\u2019ve sold. There\u2019s a tax question on Form 1040 specifically regarding cryptocurrencies. Failing to disclose this information could lead to stiff penalties or possible criminal investigation.\n\nRegulatory Risks\n\nGovernment-imposed regulations could make cryptocurrency safer and more secure, but they might also affect your access, the ways you use it and how it\u2019s taxed.\n\nWhich Investment Is Right for You?\n\nBoth bitcoin and ethereum have increased in value by staggering percentages since their release. But they\u2019re still experimental, and with innovation comes problems that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau warns haven\u2019t been resolved. For example, the decentralized nature of blockchains means there\u2019s no one to turn to if things go wrong. In addition, transactions can be much more expensive on a blockchain than through a bank or debit or credit card.\n\nIf you decide that investing in a blockchain is the way to go, it makes sense to consider the top two. Determining which one\u2019s right for you depends on your needs and goals.\n\nBitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency and has the most support commercially. If you\u2019re looking for a cryptocurrency alternative to fiat currency, bitcoin seems to be a good choice, as long as you\u2019re prepared to weather the volatility.\n\nTechnically speaking, Ethereum is more than a cryptocurrency. The Ethereum network acts as a marketplace for users to buy and sell goods and decentralized applications. If you\u2019re interested in more than a cryptocurrency, ethereum might be a good choice for you.\n\nDaria Uhlig contributed to the reporting for this article.\n\nData is accurate as of Sept. 27 2022, and subject to change.\n\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Ethereum vs. Bitcoin: Which Crypto Is Better?\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "title": "Understanding Ethereum holding: Exploring potential benefits and risks for investors - Fredericksburg.com",
        "content": "Before buying Ethereum (ETH), or any cryptocurrency for that matter, it is always a good idea to do your research to be sure of the potential risks and benefits. This guest post will provide an overview of investing in Ethereum, including an exploration of the basics of Ethereum, the power of HODLing, the benefits of Ethereum HODLing, best practices, risks and considerations, and how you can start investing in Ethereum.\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum: The basics\n\nEthereum is a decentralized blockchain platform that helps in developing smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Its native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization after Bitcoin. Ethereum differs from Bitcoin in that it not only serves as a digital currency but also provides a platform for creating and executing programmable smart contracts, which allows for various applications beyond simple transactions.\n\nThe power of holding: Why Ethereum?\n\nHODLing, a term popularized in the cryptocurrency community, refers to holding onto your cryptocurrency investments for the long term, regardless of short-term market fluctuations.\n\nEthereum's smart contract functionality and position in decentralized application development make it a potential long-term investment option for some investors. It has also been shown to be growing in adoption by businesses and developers.\n\nBenefits of Ethereum holding\n\nSome investors view Ethereum HODLing as a potential way to earn financial returns. Ethereum's historical performance has included significant price increases, and some market projections suggest the potential for long-term appreciation. However, as with any investment, there are risks to consider.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum HODLing can be a strategic investment for diversifying your portfolio. As traditional investment options may be subject to inflation and other economic factors, holding Ethereum can provide a hedge against these risks. Additionally, Investors can potentially earn passive income through staking their Ethereum holdings and participating in the network's consensus mechanism.\n\nBest practices for Ethereum holding\n\nTo effectively HODL Ethereum, it is recommended to follow some best practices. First, it can be essential to set clear investment goals and have a long-term investment mindset. Avoid being swayed by short-term market fluctuations and resist the urge to make impulsive decisions based on emotions. Conduct thorough research and stay informed about the cryptocurrency market, Ethereum's development and any regulatory changes that may impact its value.\n\nIn addition, make sure to choose the right storage options for your Ethereum holdings.\n\nMany investors prefer hardware wallets or cold storage options as they are often considered more secure than keeping Ethereum on exchanges or online wallets. Implement proper security measures, such as using strong passwords and enabling two-factor authentication, to safeguard your Ethereum holdings.\n\nRisks and considerations\n\nAs with any investment, Ethereum HODLing can also come with risks and considerations.\n\nThe value of Ethereum, like other cryptocurrencies, can be highly volatile and may fluctuate significantly in a short period of time. Regulatory changes or technological risks could also impact the value and adoption of Ethereum. Therefore, it's crucial to carefully assess the risks and consider your risk tolerance before investing in Ethereum.\n\nIt's also important to note that cryptocurrency investments should not constitute your entire investment portfolio. Diversify your investments across different asset classes to manage risks effectively and ensure a well-rounded investment strategy. Consider your overall financial goals, investment timeline and risk tolerance before allocating a portion of your portfolio to Ethereum.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum HODLing may be a potential strategy for long-term financial growth and investment opportunities. By understanding the basics of Ethereum, adopting a long-term investment mindset, diversifying your portfolio, managing risks and implementing proper security measures, you can start your journey toward financial security with Ethereum. Remember to always do your research, consult with a financial advisor if needed and stay informed about the ever-evolving cryptocurrency market. Get started with Ethereum HODLing today and unlock the exciting possibilities for your financial future.\n\nThis content is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as financial advice.\n\nLee Enterprises newsroom and editorial were not involved in the creation of this content."

        "title": "Better Buy: Cardano or Ethereum? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Every year, it seems, there's a new blockchain rival that investors think might eventually take Ethereum's (CRYPTO: ETH) place as the top Layer-1 blockchain. In years past, these blockchain rivals have included the likes of Solana (CRYPTO: SOL) and Avalanche (CRYPTO: AVAX). But, due to its strong track record of innovation, Ethereum has retained its market-leading position.\n\nThis year, the blockchain that everyone is talking about as a potential Ethereum rival is Cardano (CRYPTO: ADA). Year to date, Ethereum is up 53%, and Cardano is up 50%, so it's almost a dead heat. Let's take a closer look at how the two blockchains stack up to see which one is the better investment right now.\n\nEthereum's first-mover advantage\n\nEthereum has the first-mover advantage in just about every sector of the blockchain world. It literally invented the concept of smart contracts, so it's perhaps no surprise that it is still the clear leader in everything from non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to decentralized finance (DeFi). If you take a look at the top-selling NFT collections, for example, almost all of them are Ethereum-based, and it remains the top blockchain by overall NFT sales volume.\n\nBut the one drawback of Ethereum has always been its performance. There are blockchains that are faster and cheaper to use, and that has left openings for new rivals to emerge. This is the reason Solana and Avalanche first emerged as potential \"Ethereum killers.\" Even after The Merge, Ethereum still relies on a complex network of Layer-2 scaling solutions to process transactions quickly and keep fees in check. The main Ethereum blockchain can still only process 10 to 20 transactions per second. Meanwhile, Solana routinely handles 5,000 transactions per second, and has plans to boost its capacity to 600,000 transactions per second.\n\nNew Cardano innovations\n\nThat's why some investors are sitting up and taking notice now that Cardano has finally introduced its long-promised Layer-2 scaling solution, Hydra. According to some Cardano developers, Hydra is the key to 1 million transactions per second. That's a performance benchmark that Ethereum has been promising (but failing to deliver) for years. At 1 million transactions per second, the Cardano blockchain would be nearly 15 times faster than Visa's credit card network, which claims to be capable of processing 65,000 transactions per second.\n\nAnd Cardano has suddenly boosted its profile in the DeFi world, where for years it was a non-player. DeFi is a new priority for Cardano in 2023, and thus far, the blockchain has delivered. It has a new stablecoin, new decentralized exchanges, and new DeFi protocols. Combined, all of these innovations could make it possible for Cardano to create a robust DeFi ecosystem. It's too early to say that Cardano is a serious rival to Ethereum, given that it still ranks No. 18 among all blockchains in DeFi. However, the case can now be made that it's no longer a so-called ghost chain where nothing ever happens.\n\nWho is innovating faster?\n\nAt the end of the day, the blockchain sector is just like any other part of the tech industry. Innovation matters, and investors are willing to pay a premium for tokens on blockchains that appear to be innovating faster. Right now, Ethereum is still riding high after pulling off The Merge last year -- a technological feat that some have compared to changing the engine of an airplane in mid-flight. So the innovation bar is high these days. Investors are looking for truly breakthrough innovations, not just incremental improvements.\n\nUltimately, the answer to the question of which blockchain is innovating faster might come down to performance in newly emerging areas such as artificial intelligence (AI). The blockchain that secures a clear first-mover advantage in AI, for example, could be the one to invest in for long-term growth. Thus far, neither Cardano nor Ethereum has emerged as the obvious market leader, although Cardano does seem to have the makings of an AI strategy.\n\nAnd the winner is...\n\nRight now, I'm bullish on both Ethereum and Cardano. Both blockchains have seen stellar gains thus far in 2023. But, given Ethereum's track record of delivering performance over a longer period of time and its entrenched status as the market leader, the nod goes to Ethereum as the better buy."

        "title": "Ethereum Researchers Remain Mystified After Blockchain Briefly Fails To Finalize - The Defiant - DeFi News",
        "content": "User Transactions Continued To Be Processed Normally\n\nBy: Samuel Haig \u2022 Loading...\n\nDeFi News\n\nLast week, Ethereum briefly stopped finalizing blocks, raising concerns across the web3 community despite transactions continuing to be processed normally.\n\nTwo incidents rattled the Ethereum ecosystem on Thursday and Friday, with blocks failing to finalize for three and eight epochs (roughly 20 minutes and one hour) in separate events. dYdX, a popular derivatives platform, paused deposits while waiting for finalization to resume.\n\nDevelopers released patches for the two affected clients, Prysm and Teku, on Friday, but researchers are still unsure as to the exact cause of the problem.\n\n\u201cI'm not sure that any of us fully understand why,\u201d Ben Edgington of the Ethereum Foundation said. \u201cIt\u2019s still under analysis exactly what the root cause of the issue was and why the chain recovered.\u201d\n\nThis is the first major incident suffered by the Beacon chain, Ethereum\u2019s proof of stake (PoS) consensus layer that merged with the mainnet execution layer last September, and serves as a cautionary reminder of the experimental nature of blockchain technology.\n\nDespite Ethereum being the No. 2 cryptocurrency with a $225B market cap and a $27B DeFi ecosystem, the protocol can still encounter unexpected issues, particularly while work continues on its disruptive roadmap of upgrades.\n\nBusiness As Usual\n\nEthereum users successfully continued to transact on-chain through the incident.\n\n\u201cAlthough the network was unable to finalize, the network was, as designed, live, and end users were able to transact on the network,\u201d the Ethereum Foundation said in a blog post. \u201cAfter all clients caught up, the network finalized again.\u201d\n\nDeFi Alpha Premium Content DeFi Daily | Weekdays\n\nDeFi Alpha Letter | Weekly\n\nDefiant Podcast Transcript | Weekly\n\nInbox Dump | Saturday\n\nWeekly Recap | Sunday Looking for Alpha? Become a premium member of The Defiant and join our DeFi Alpha community. Start for free\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation attributed the incident to an \u201cexceptional scenario\u201d which caused a high load for Teku and Prysm\u2019s consensus layer clients. \u201cThe full cause for this is still being evaluated,\u201d it added.\n\nTeku and Prysm\u2019s patches include optimizations limiting resource usage during periods of network congestion.\n\nPost Mortem\n\nOn Sunday, Ben Edgington of the Ethereum Foundation and Superphiz, the Beacon Chain community health consultant, discussed the incident on YouTube.\n\nEdgington said finality occurs when at least two-thirds of validators agree on Ethereum\u2019s state during attestations after each epoch. He said last week\u2019s incident manifested as roughly 60% of validators failed to attest at the same time, preventing the network from reaching finality.\n\n\u201cIt [was] as if 60% of the validators went offline,\u201d Edgington said. \u201cTo finalize the chain, we need two-thirds or 66% of validators showing up.\u201d\n\nClient Diversity\n\nThe pair described the network\u2019s recovery as a testament to the value of Ethereum client diversity, with only two of Ethereum\u2019s five major clients suffering issues.\n\nEdgington said Lighthouse client users experienced no issues during the incident because Lighthouse rate-limits the reprocessing of old states. However, he said that Lighthouse\u2019s design could cause different problems under certain circumstances.\n\n\u201cAs we\u2019ve seen around these edge cases, it can actually strengthen things if clients take slightly different approaches because some will be able to carry the network where others fail,\u201d he said.\n\nRecurring Problem\n\nEdgington and Superphiz agreed that it is likely that Ethereum will encounter similar issues again in the future.\n\nWhile researchers are currently unsure what exactly triggered the finalization issues, Edgington suggested the speed of the network\u2019s growth may be driving up the computational resources needed to validate Ethereum.\n\nHe noted that Ethereum\u2019s validator count is up by 2500% since the Beacon chain launched in December 2020, conceding that developers may have neglected large-scale stress-testing on testnets in recent years.\n\nEdgington said Ethereum\u2019s core developers have learned their lesson and will deploy large private testnets to \u201cstress test some of these scenarios with more realistic validator numbers.\u201d\n\nEmergency State\n\nWhile the Ethereum network regained finalization on its own last week, Edgington and Superphiz noted that measures are in place to protect the network against a severe outage.\n\nFinalization usually occurs after two epochs, but the Beacon chain enters an emergency state called \u201cInactivity Leak\u201d mode if finalization does not occur after four epochs. In this mode, validators receive no rewards for attesting but face escalating penalties for failing to do so.\n\nEdgington said the mechanism slowly drains ETH from non-performing validators until active validators come to represent a two-thirds majority and can finalize the network again.\n\nHe said the mechanism offers protection against catastrophic events, such as war, which could isolate people living in different jurisdictions from each other. After about three weeks without finalization, Ethereum would fork and recognize the block history maintained by the network\u2019s remaining active validators.\n\nLast week\u2019s incident had a \u201cminimal\u201d Impact on validators, according to Edgington, with Ethereum\u2019s nearly half a million validators losing a cumulative 28 ETH during a brief Inactivity Leak period."

        "title": "3 reasons why Ethereum price could struggle at the $1.9K level - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Since May 12, Ether\u2019s price has been struggling to sustain its $1,800 support level, as investors face pressures from a worsening crypto regulatory environment and the Ethereum network\u2019s high gas fees. Also negatively impacting Ether\u2019s (ETH) price are three indicators signaling reduced demand for its decentralized applications (DApps) and a lack of leverage buying demand from professional traders.\n\nRegulators signal their plan to further limit crypto intermediaries\n\nAccording to court documents filed on May 15, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has given a formal response in court in relation to Coinbase\u2019s petition for clear crypto regulation. The SEC stated that any rulemaking may take years and that enforcement actions will continue in the meantime.\n\nOn May 16, the Economic and Financial Affairs Council of the European Union \u2014 comprising finance ministers of all member states \u2014 approved the highly anticipated Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, which will come into effect by mid-2024.\n\nSome argue that MiCA facilitates business growth in the region. Others focus on the privacy risks for personal users\u2019 data and the risks imposed on non-custodial solutions, including decentralized finance applications.\n\nThe drop in DApp deposits is concerning\n\nThe Ethereum network is experiencing problems caused by surging gas fees \u2014 the cost associated with transactions, including those performed by smart contracts. For the past four weeks, the average transaction fee has stood above $9, which severely limited the demand for DApp usage.\n\nTotal deposits on the Ethereum network in Ether terms plunged to their lowest levels since August 2020. Such an analysis excludes the effects of native Ethereum staking, which recently started to allow withdrawals.\n\nEthereum network applications' total deposits in ETH. Source: DefiLlama\n\nAccording to DefiLlama data, Ethereum DApps reached 14.9 million ETH in total value locked (TVL) on May 16. That compares with 16.5 million ETH two months prior, a 10% decline. As a comparison, TVL on BNB Smart Chain in BNB (BNB) terms was essentially flat in the same period, while Polygon (MATIC) deposits on the Polygon network increased by 29%.\n\nBNB Smart Chain attempts to take a lead in DEX volume\n\nEthereum might have been the absolute leader in decentralized exchange (DEX) volume since its inception, but this position is being challenged. Ethereum\u2019s market share by volume on DEXs peaked at 75% in the week ending March 5 but steadily declined to its lowest level ever, 39.6%, in the week ending May 14.\n\nWeekly DEX volume by chain. Source: DefiLlama\n\nGainers since March 5 on DEX trading volume were Arbitrum, increasing to 14% from 7%, and BNB Smart Chain, growing to 31% from 5.6%. One might argue that the success of the Ethereum network\u2019s scaling solutions reflects bullishness for Ether\u2019s price, but that relationship is not so direct.\n\nRelated: Updated European tax directive requires reporting on all crypto asset transfers\n\nData shows pro traders turning bearish\n\nEther quarterly futures are popular among whales and arbitrage desks. However, these fixed-month contracts typically trade at a slight premium to spot markets, indicating that sellers are asking for more money to delay settlement.\n\nAs a result, ETH futures contracts in healthy markets should trade at a 5 to 10% annualized premium \u2014 a situation known as contango, which is not unique to crypto markets.\n\nEther 3-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nEther professional traders have avoided leverage longs (bullish bets) since early April.

        "title": "Here's why the SEC never classified ether as a security - Protos",
        "content": "Listen to this article.\n\nIn 2018, former Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) director William Hinman famously opined that Ethereum \u2014 as it existed then \u2014 wasn\u2019t a security. For years, that speech caused confusion about the securities classification of thousands of other ICOs.\n\nLegions of securities lawyers were shocked at Hinman\u2019s conclusion. The New York Attorney General believes ETH is a security. Even SEC chair Gary Gensler disagreed.\n\nEventually, the truth came out: Hinman had a financial conflict of interest when he gave that speech. He was making millions of dollars from a pro-Ethereum entity at the time.\n\nBefore he became chairman of the SEC, professor Gary Gensler explained to students in a 2018 MIT course, \u201cIn my opinion, Ethereum passed the Howey Test and that means that it would be considered a security.\u201d He continued, \u201cI don\u2019t even think there\u2019s much doubt what this was in 2014 when they raised the $18 million.\u201d\n\nStill, industry insiders accused the SEC of failing to provide clear guidance or send fair notice to issuers of digital assets that they might qualify as securities. Instead of categorizing thousands of ICOs explicitly, the SEC has chosen to explain its determinations in civil lawsuits, slowly, on a case-by-case basis.\n\nAlthough the SEC has classified some of the largest ICOs as securities offerings like XRP, TRX, and TON, it has avoided classifying ETH.\n\nNo financial harm, no reason to sue\n\nNot only is there no basis for financial harm from ICO investors, Ethereum also enjoys one of the most populous fan bases in the crypto industry. Millions of US constituents support Ethereum.\n\nNevertheless, some aspects of Ethereum are worryingly similar to an investment contract \u2014 a type of security. For example, Vitalik Buterin explicitly told investors that he was hoping for the price of ETH to quintuple during an interview at the 2014 Texas Bitcoin Conference (Ethereum\u2019s ICO raised approximately $18 million worth of BTC in 2014).\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re hoping is something like what happened with Mastercoin (MSC), so if that slice is something like 20%, and then the value of ether goes up by five, then we basically have the entire initial BTC that we got all over again.\u201d \u2014Vitalik Buterin, March 6, 2014\n\nPromising investment returns is a hallmark of a securities offering. After Mastercoin\u2019s (MSC) initial rally, its price eventually collapsed to nearly $0. In contrast, ether has rallied consistently over the years. So, because Ethereum ICO investors haven\u2019t experienced financial harm as a result of their investment, no one has successfully challenged the securities classification of Ethereum\u2019s ICO in a civil lawsuit.\n\nSimilarly, Congress charged the SEC with protecting investors. With no harm involved with Ethereum\u2019s ICO, commissioners chose to focus on other enforcement targets. As the years passed and the price of ETH increased, the statute of limitations expired.\n\nRead more: What did Gary Gensler really say when he promoted Algorand?\n\nNevertheless, questions about Ethereum\u2019s present-day securities classification remain. In particular, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has loudly warned of the risks of Ethereum\u2019s transition to Proof-of-Stake as heightening its securities likeness. On a related matter, all five commissioners have agreed to sue Ethereum staking services like Kraken.\n\nNYAG believes ETH is a security\n\nAlthough not a securities regulator, the NYAG oversees conduct in Wall Street, the world\u2019s largest financial center. In her lawsuit against KuCoin, NYAG Letitia James explained her designation of ETH as a security.\n\nNew York\u2019s chief lawyer alleged KuCoin failed to register as a broker-dealer in securities like ETH and falsely represented itself as a compliant exchange.\n\nNYAG classified ETH, LUNA, and UST as alleged securities.\n\nThe SEC agrees with at least two of those three designations, LUNA and UST, and hasn\u2019t classified ETH.\n\nThe NYAG explicitly acknowledged that her lawsuit is the first time a major regulator had classified ETH as a security in court. She called ether \u201ca speculative asset that relies on the efforts of third-party developers in order to provide profit to the holders of ETH.\u201d\n\nRead more: Gary Gensler can\u2019t say if ETH is a security because of the SEC\n\nJames also alleged KuCoin sold unregistered securities through KuCoin Earn, a product that allowed users to earn interest on digital asset deposits. She alleged KuCoin failed to register as a securities and commodities broker in New York before launching its earn product.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks to block KuCoin from operating in New York until it can comply with state regulations. It also asks that KuCoin stop misrepresenting that it\u2019s an exchange and implement geo-blocking based on IP address and GPS-based location.\n\nEven if the ICO passed Howey, would ETH today pass Howey?\n\nWhether ETH is a security has been a matter of debate that hinges on whether its promoters have passed the four prongs of the US Supreme Court\u2019s Howey Test. It specifies that an offering is likely a type of securities offering, known as an investment contract, if purchasers:\n\nInvest money, into a common enterprise, with a reasonable expectation of profit, to be derived from the efforts of others.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that Ethereum\u2019s ICO passed the Howey Test, but the statute of limitations for an SEC lawsuit has expired on 2014 events. On the other hand, it\u2019s possible that ETH today, with its proof-of-stake yield and various other financial qualities, could pass the Howey Test. Only a US court ruling on an SEC lawsuit would settle this question.\n\nGot a tip? Send us an email or ProtonMail.

        "content": "Market-leading liquid staking platform Lido has enabled staked ETH withdrawals. The move came as Lido launched the V2 upgrade live to mainnet on May 15.\n\nThe upgrade is the largest yet for the protocol, and it has two major components:\n\n\u201cLido V2 introduces two major components, with the most user-facing aspect being Ethereum withdrawals. This allows Ethereum stakers with Lido to directly unstake ETH through the protocol.\u201d\n\nLido now has a withdrawals page where users can deposit their stETH tokens to get ETH in return.\n\nFollowing a successful on-chain vote, Lido V2 is officially here.https://t.co/36EmuagToD \ud83c\udfdd\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/sl4kjNpUYw \u2014 Lido (@LidoFinance) May 15, 2023\n\nLido Staking Withdrawals Live\n\nLido noted that under normal circumstances, the stETH or wstETH withdrawal period can take anywhere between 1-5 days. Furthermore, the stETH injected back into the protocol will be burnt in order to release the ETH at a 1:1 ratio.\n\nThe announcement added that the upgrade lowers a number of previous inconveniences surrounding Lido on Ethereum staking experience. Additionally, it \u201callows for a more efficient use of Lido\u2019s staked ETH throughout the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem.\u201d\n\nThe token unlocks dashboard is projecting a spike in withdrawals on May 16. It reports 45,830 ETH currently in the pending withdrawal queue, which is likely to grow once Lido stakers start withdrawing.\n\nIt estimates that almost 7,000 ETH worth around $12.6 million will be withdrawn over the next eleven hours.\n\nNansen\u2019s dashboard is still reporting that there are more deposits than withdrawals on the Beacon Chain. It also claims a total of 20 million ETH are staked though this is likely to be on the high side since the Beaconcha.in explorer claims 18.3 million.\n\n6,274,752 ETH is staked with @LidoFinance. That\u2019s over 29% of total deposits! And later today, Lido will enable ETH withdrawals for the very first time What will happen?

This new modular component allows for the development of on-ramps for new Node Operators. It promotes staking diversity by allowing solo stakers, DAOs, and Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) clusters.\n\nETH Price Reaction\n\nEthereum prices are marginally down on the day, trading at $1,812 at the time of writing. ETH has retreated 13% over the past month as crypto markets continue to correct.\n\nLido has 29% of all staked Ether, so withdrawals may add some selling pressure to markets in the short term.\n\nIts native LDO token has gained 7.2% on the day, climbing to $2.09 at the time of writing. Furthermore, Lido DAO tokens are up 15% over the past week."

        "content": "Piggybacking off the success of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, its founder Sam Altman is reportedly close to snagging $100 million in funding for his crypto project Worldcoin. The project had already raised $100 million at a valuation of $3 billion last year from marquee investors including Andreessen Horowitz and the venture capital arm of Coinbase.\n\nBut former Ethereum core developer Hudson Jameson \u2014 who currently works with Polygon Labs \u2014 thinks that Worldcoin\u2019s plans are \u201cunrealistic and scary.\u201d\n\nThe crypto project uses a device called an orb that scans the irises of individuals to determine if they are human. People who participate and sign up by scanning their irises are rewarded with Worldcoin. The idea is to use iris-scanning technology to create a global ID system that will provide access to its global currency, Worldcoin.\n\nJameson said he is uncertain about the rollout of Worldcoin since the project ambitiously plans to onboard tens of millions of users by 2025. Jameson also raised concerns about the transparency of the project.\n\nIn a Twitter thread, he noted:\n\n\u201cLast I checked, I\u2019ve seen 0 indications they have publicly accessible plans to deal with the huge socio-economic issues that are going to vary region to region. There also isn\u2019t a working group where they are inviting experts on this. If there is, there is 0 advertising of it.\u201d\n\nJameson went on to question the tokenomics of the project, calling it \u201csuspicious.\u201d As per Jameson, 80% of the Worldcoin supply is meant for the public while the investors and the team will each own 10% of the supply. He added:\n\n\u201cHow is that going to create a fair worldwide currency? Is there any analysis from them on preventing wealth gaps in certain areas?\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Jameson said that the project is trying to solve a global problem \u201cwhile being ignorant of the factors to solving that problem besides building cool tech.\u201d On a grim note, he concluded that he does not foresee success for Worldcoin.\n\nA research engineer at Worldcoin, however, said that the project\u2019s token distribution is \u201cpretty good\u201d compared to other popular tokens.\n\nJameson is far from being the only one questioning the future of Worldcoin. Ethereum core developer Tim Beiko also expressed his doubts, saying \u201ccheap + open access FaceID\u201d could potentially make Worldcoin \u201cobsolete.\u201d\n\nMentioned in this article"

However, Coinbase recently received more than 53,400 ETH, out of which the majority were moved from the Coinbase\u2019s cbETH deposit address \u2014 that may be related to the fact that ETH staking was terminated.\n\nCoinbase Witnesses Massive ETH Inflow\n\nOn Monday, the cbETH deposit address 0xc7\u2026a019 saw a massive withdrawal of 44,000 ETH to the Coinbase 10 wallet address, as per the data obtained from CryptoQuant. This suggests that people have been terminating their ETH staking contract, which further indicates a building sell pressure for Ethereum.\n\nadvertisement\n\nA wrapped cryptocurrency, such as cbETH, is a crypto token that symbolizes another cryptocurrency that has been \u201cwrapped\u201d or \u201clocked up\u201d in a digital smart contract.

Some individuals have been holding off on doing so ever since the staking option was initially made available in December 2020.\n\nSince Ethereum\u2019s long-awaited \u201cShapella\u201d upgrade, most stakers and entities who have staked Ether have withdrawn incentives rather than their principal. According to TokenUnlocks, staking incentives accounted for more than 172,000 Ether, or more than 95% of withdrawals. Users who had completely stopped staking and would no longer take part in Ethereum\u2019s consensus mechanism \u2014 which is used to arrange and confirm transactions \u2014 made up the remaining 5%, which was their initial stake.\n\nIn the wake of this crypto news, the price of ETH is currently exchanging hands at $1,826.91, which represents a gain of 1.31% over the past 24 hours, compared to a drop of 1.92% recorded over the preceding seven days.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin-Ether Correlation Dips Below 80% For First Time In 2 Years, What It Means?"

        "content": "Bitcoin Cash will introduce a major upgrade to its blockchain.\n\nNew CashTokens will enable developers to run smart contracts on its network.\n\nOne core developer claims the network will be 100x more efficient than Ethereum.\n\n\n\nAmid major congestion on the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks, traders are begging for upgrades to boost scalability. Bitcoin Cash (BCH), one of the more successful Bitcoin hard forks, could soon deliver an upgrade to outshine both.\n\nThe Bitcoin Cash network is gearing up for its own hard fork, set for Monday, May 15. The upgrade will introduce \u2018CashTokens,\u2019 an ERC-20-like standard for the network. These tokens will enable Bitcoin Cash to run smart contracts.\n\nAccording to core developers, this decentralized Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchain will be more scalable and efficient than Ethereum.\n\nHow Will Bitcoin Cash Change After the Hard Fork?\n\nScheduled for May 15, the \u2018Ethereum Killer\u2019 is a hard fork on the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) network. This means that this change to the network protocol will not be compatible with previous chain versions.\n\nThe primary feature of the latest Bitcoin Cash hard fork is the introduction of \u2018CashTokens,\u2019 which are similar to Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 tokens. Their introduction is a game-changer for Bitcoin Cash. The upgrade will allow developers to issue tokens directly on the BCH network.\n\nIssuing tokens (and memecoins) on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain is not the most exciting feature of the upgrade. More importantly, CashTokens will enable the blockchain to run smart contracts. This feature will allow developers to build dApps directly on Bitcoin Cash.\n\nWill Bitcoin Cash Be the Ethereum Killer?\n\nSo far, Ethereum has remained the most significant smart contract blockchain network. However, congestion issues, high fees, and other issues have led to a series of competing networks. With its latest upgrade, Bitcoin Cash will be one of them.\n\nThe hard fork will not just enable Bitcoin Cash to power smart contracts. It will also enable it to harness the built-in scalability of the network, making its smart contracts run efficiently and at a low cost. In particular, one core developer says that dApps on Bitcoin Cash will be 100x cheaper than Ethereum.\n\nBitcoin Cash developer Jason Dreyzehner claims the network owes its performance to the UTXO accounting model. UTXO stands for \u201cunspent transaction output,\u201d and differs from the account/balance model used by cryptos like Ethereum.\n\nTo start with the basics \u2013 Bitcoin Cash owes its performance, scalability, and privacy to the \"UTXO model\": funds are sent to a new contract in every transaction output, so the system never reuses \"accounts\", even if you re-use an address. \u2014 Jason Dreyzehner (@bitjson) June 30, 2022\n\nThe UTXO model has several features that make it potentially better than the alternative. Each transaction creates a new UTXO, making coins harder to track and boosting privacy. On the other hand, this model also enables parallel transaction processing, allowing for greater scalability.\n\nIf Bitcoin Cash becomes a scalable solution for dApps, this could help significantly boost its utility. Rather than just being a decentralized currency, BCH will power an ecosystem of decentralized applications.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nWhile Bitcoin Cash developers boast of its scalability, the network has still not seen a substantial test of its performance.\n\nDespite its similarities to BCH, including its use of the UTXO model, Bitcoin still suffers from network congestion since the creation of ordinals.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nA decentralized and scalable smart contract network would enable developers to create better dApps, boosting blockchain adoption. This would have a significant impact on the decentralized finance space.\n\nRead more about Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) recent congestion issues:\n\nBitcoin Core Dev Insists on Ordinals Ban, Starts Civil War Instead\n\nRead about the latest trends in crypto venture capital:\n\nVenture Investment in Crypto Drops to New Low: Report"

        "title": "Ordinals turned Bitcoin into a worse version of Ethereum: Can we fix it? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The launch of BRC-20 tokens and Ordinals NFTs on Bitcoin has transformed the No. 1 blockchain overnight into a clunkier version of Ethereum.\n\nThe core developers and miners who signed off on the network\u2019s Taproot upgrade in November 2021 never envisaged this would be the result. Bitcoin now suffers from many of the same problems that have bedeviled Ethereum for years, including scammy memecoins and shitcoins, NFTs of monkey pictures hogging block space and skyrocketing transaction fees.\n\n\n\nThe network is even having to deal with incidences of miner extractable value (MEV), whereby miners profit by reordering pending transactions.\n\nMati Greenspan\n\n\u201cI\u2019m kind of upset at myself for not realizing,\u201d says Quantum Economics founder Mati Greenspan, a Bitcoiner since 2013.\n\n\u201cIt took these guys starting to hype up JPEGs on Bitcoin until I was like: \u2018Oh shit, what did we just do?\u2019\u201d He laughs ruefully.\n\nSome Bitcoiners on Bitcointalk and Twitter refer to the impact of Ordinal NFTs and BRC-20 tokens as an attack on Bitcoin, an exploit of Taproot, or simply as spam clogging up the network.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s sparked a fierce debate over whether unexpected outcomes are precisely the sort of outcomes you should expect from a permissionless protocol, or whether something needs to be done to get rid of them.\n\n\n\nWhy are Bitcoin fees so high?\n\nBRC-20 tokens were only launched by anonymous developer Domo back on March 8. They use Ordinal inscriptions of JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data to deploy token contracts, mint tokens and transfer tokens. Some argue this is horribly inefficient and costs four times as much in transaction fees as if they just used binary.\n\n\n\nAlongside the inefficiencies, there\u2019s also a gold rush for minting memecoins. Someone will deploy a contract with a ticker for a new token and a max supply, and then traders rush in to mint as many as possible in the series, on a \u201cfirst come, first served\u201d basis, at whatever fee rate gets them priority. These tokens have already surpassed $1 billion in market cap \u2014 even though Domo argues they will be worthless.\n\n\n\nBut they are here to stay \u2014 at least in the short term \u2014 with major wallets already adding support for BRC-20 tokens. And newer developments, such as the launch of a Uniswap fork that amassed $500,000 in trading of \u201csmart BRC-20\u201d tokens (SBRC-20) in just a few days, suggest that the building of a permissionless new ecosystem on Bitcoin is set to continue.\n\nFees too high to bank the unbanked\n\nGreenspan points out that while the flurry of interest has seen Bitcoin transactions hit an all-time high, the number of unique addresses plummeted, meaning fewer people are accessing the network. And while transaction fee revenue has overtaken the block reward \u2014 seen by many as the only way to ensure Bitcoin\u2019s security after another couple of halvings \u2014 it comes with a lot of issues.\n\n\u201cI spoke to one miner yesterday who said his revenue has doubled, which is nice, especially ahead of the halving, so it\u2019s good for miners, but it\u2019s terrible for the countries of Nigeria and El Salvador, for example, where, suddenly, the average cost to send a transaction is $30,\u201d he says. \u201cThe dream of financial inclusion on Bitcoin has been temporarily postponed.\u201d\n\nRead also: What it\u2019s actually like to use Bitcoin in El Salvador\n\nInterestingly, this isn\u2019t the first time someone has put a token or NFTs onto Bitcoin. Counterparty led the way with NFTs on Bitcoin, with Spells of Genesis and Rare Pepes in 2015 and 2016. And stablecoin Tether also launched a token on Bitcoin back in 2014 via the Mastercoin protocol (which later became Omni).\n\nJoseph Hall tries using Bitcoin to get by in El Salvador for Magazine.\n\nBan the spam, say Bitcoin maxis\n\nOn Bitcointalk, there is much discussion of fighting off the \u201cattack on Bitcoin,\u201d with some claiming it\u2019s the work of malicious Bitcoin SV devs. Users are talking about a soft fork to \u201cenforce strict Taproot validation script size,\u201d ways the protocol can filter out what they see as \u201cspam\u201d or even a hard fork to reverse Taproot.\n\nBitcoin developer Luke Dashjr stated that \u201caction should have been taken months ago. Spam filtration has been a standard part of Bitcoin Core since Day 1. It\u2019s a mistake that the existing filters weren\u2019t extended to Taproot transactions [\u2026] since this is a bugfix, it doesn\u2019t really even need to wait for a major release.\u201d\n\nIf Ethereum devs ever did anything remotely close to the below email, there would be absolute hysterics. People say ETH devs are too centralized with too much power. Look in the mirror. https://t.co/yBVNk2kixW \u2014 Hal Press (@NorthRockLP) May 9, 2023\n\nGlassnode\u2019s lead on-chain analyst, Checkmate, tells Magazine that he believes this sort of censorship is against the entire ethos of Bitcoin and notes there are already optional mempool rules enabling node operators to filter ordinals if they choose.\n\nCheckmate\u2019s Twitter profile pic.\n\n\u201cFrom my view, any attempt to ban or censor these transactions is far more of an attack on Bitcoin than leaving them be. They are within consensus rules, and when a loud minority of individuals want to change the rules to stop something they don\u2019t like, that is the real attack.\u201d\n\nBut podcaster Chris Blec made the case on Twitter that limiting transaction types to ensure the health of the network wasn\u2019t censorship.\n\n\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t depend on the content of the message or the sender of the message, then it\u2019s not censorship,\u201d he said.\n\nHass McCook, a former member of the Bitcoin Mining Council and a Bitcoin true believer, is no fan of Ordinals but thinks trying to get rid of them is a step too far, saying:\n\n\n\n\u201cThe only thing more important than Bitcoin is freedom. My general take is I personally don\u2019t like it and don\u2019t see value in it. But I don\u2019t want to censor it. I think that could go down a very dark path.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the protocol allows for something and somebody is happy to pay to do that thing, then it is what it is.\u201d\n\nI haven't heard one coherent argument yet as to how limiting spam on Bitcoin (including that which enables ordinals) equates to \"censorship\".\n\n\n\nIf there is one, please provide it here. \u2014 Chris Blec (@ChrisBlec) May 9, 2023\n\nImpossible to ban Ordinals anyway\n\nAndrew Poelstra, director of research for Blockstream, is one of the inventors of Taproot. He doesn\u2019t like the upgrade\u2019s \u201ctoxic\u201d offspring either but doesn\u2019t see any practical way to stop them.\n\n\u201cAs near as I can tell, there is no sensible way to prevent people from storing arbitrary data in witnesses without incentivizing even worse behavior and/or breaking legitimate use cases,\u201d he wrote.\n\nRead also: Is Bitcoin a religion? If not, it soon could be\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be possible just to ban \u2018useless data,\u2019\u201d he said, noting that people could just hide useless data like NFTs inside of useful data like \u201cdummy signatures or public keys.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cDoing so would incur a 2x cost to them, but if 2x is enough to incentivize storage, then there\u2019s no need to have this discussion because they will be forced to stop due to fee market competition anyway.\u201d\n\nBitcoin transaction fees are back down to $5. I'm so glad that Ordinals fad is finally over. pic.twitter.com/8gl4kwcXTC \u2014 Mati Greenspan (@MatiGreenspan) May 14, 2023\n\nIgnore them, and they\u2019ll go away\n\nThe best-case scenario \u2014 and the most likely, according to interviewees for this piece \u2014 is that interest in the tokens and NFTs will die down as the memecoin fad plays out.\n\n\u201cNetwork congestion on Bitcoin is not a new thing, right?\u201d says Greenspan. \u201cIt usually comes with hype. But also it leaves when the hype is over.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s most likely to happen is people are gonna run out of money.\u201d\n\nBut if Ordinals continue to have an outsized impact on the network, there\u2019s always the nuclear option of forking Bitcoin to modify or remove Taproot. Blec and many others have raised the possibility, though it seems mostly hypothetical at this stage.\n\nIf enough Bitcoin ecosystem participants (users, node operators, miners) reach a consensus that Bitcoin should be forked in a way that reduces spammy txs, that's not censorship.\n\n\n\nYou can still mine & use the current fork and mint your dumb jpgs there. \u2014 Chris Blec (@ChrisBlec) May 9, 2023\n\nFork Bitcoin to get rid of Ordinals\n\nGreenspan says, while it\u2019s always possible to implement a hard fork, \u201cit\u2019ll split the network. And nobody wants that.\u201d\n\nMcCook says the market chose Bitcoin, rather than Bitcoin Cash or Bitcoin SV during the scaling wars in 2017, and he predicts the current version would win over a fork with Taproot.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d take the Ordinals one. So, even though I don\u2019t find any value in Ordinals, maybe I need to inscribe something in the future that I need to have absolute censorship resistance,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThis could potentially have pretty powerful implications. Let\u2019s say Julian Assange decided to do his WikiLeaks info dump as an inscription, this is a very useful thing.\u201d\n\nGreenspan also believes the benefits of using Bitcoin to store data have only just begun to be explored.\n\n\n\n\u201cPeople are now aware that Bitcoin has the ability to store files. And I\u2019m excited to see what, you know, forward-thinking developers will do with this new tool. More than just creating memes.\u201d\n\nMake the tokens better\n\nWhen he released BRC-20, Domo added, \u201cI believe there are almost certainly better design choices and optimization improvements to be made.\u201d\n\nPlenty of people agree. One of the easiest improvements would be to use binary rather than the JSON format, which developer John W. Ratcliff argues is \u201cone of the most inefficient data formats anyone could use.\u201d He believes this would reduce BRC-20 tokens from 89 bytes to 19.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis means that they are paying over four times as much in fees to commit these BRC-20 tokens than necessary,\u201d he said.\n\nHashrate Index researcher Colin Harper says that using binary code \u201ccould reduce bandwidth by as much as 80%.\u201d However, this wouldn\u2019t entirely solve the problem, as Bitcoin influencer Udi Wertheimer points out, given the spike in fees is due to token minting degens bidding up fees to get their transaction prioritized into order to mint or snatch up low serial number tokens before the supply runs out.\n\nThere\u2019s also another way to issue assets on Bitcoin called Taro, which Domo says is \u201ca better solution. Taproot Asset Representation Overlay is a proposed protocol that will allow people to issue digital assets on Bitcoin that can be transferred to Lightning for fast and cheap transactions.\n\n\n\nRead also: Attack of the zkEVMs! Crypto\u2019s 10x moment\n\nBuild a virtual machine on top of Bitcoin\n\nA much more radical and experimental approach is being taken by Trustless Computer, which is behind a Uniswap v2 fork called Trustless Market that enabled $500,000 worth of swaps in its first three days.\n\nThe project\u2019s documentation states it\u2019s working toward a Turing-complete virtual machine called BVM built on top of Bitcoin to enable a DeFi ecosystem.\n\n\n\nCore team member @punk3700 tells Magazine it \u201cis not a layer 2, it\u2019s a \u2018protocol within layer 1\u2019\u201d that works like Ordinals but uses SBRC-20s.\n\n\n\nInstead of writing \u201ctext files to Bitcoin, Trustless Computer writes smart contract transactions to Bitcoin. Raw files vs. programs/logic/apps.\u201d He claims this cuts down the bandwidth required for the tokens by 80%\u201390%.\n\nStick-figuring out how a Bitcoin Virtual Machine would work.\n\n\u201cI think the BRC-20 in their current form (using text files) are a flash in the pan,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t use paper and pen to build an alternative scalable financial instrument.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur SBRC-20 implementation is different. We use smart contracts, the same ERC-20 smart contract on Ethereum. It works exactly as programmed.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOrdinals is v0.1 of what is possible on Bitcoin. Trustless Computer shows that you can build a full DApp ecosystem on Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nHe expects that we\u2019ll see MakerDAO, Aave, Compound and other smart contracts deployed soon, which, if it works as he claims it will, would be a huge change for Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nWhile the project has recieved coverage in other major crypto news outlets, Magazine hasn\u2019t verified their tech works as promised, and the extent to which you can integrate smart contracts with Bitcoin is debatable, so tread carefully.\n\nCan we scale Bitcoin with ZK-rollups?\n\nThe influx of NFTs and token minting on Bitcoin has shown the blockchain remains unable to scale to deal with increased demand, meaning the more popular it gets, the worse it works.\n\n\n\nThe Lightning Network is usually touted as the solution, but Nostr creator Fiatjaf noted it has been unable to cope with the recent fee spike. \u201cChannels are too fragile, it costs a lot to open a channel under a high fee environment, to run a routing node and so on,\u201d he wrote, stating that users instead had to rely on the centralized Lightning providers.\n\nGreenspan believes that gradual progress toward scaling is the only safe solution to ensure Bitcoin remains bulletproof.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen Segway; we\u2019ve seen Taproot. I mean, these are, these are good progressions and steady scaling. Which is what\u2019s best usually for a decentralized network of this size. You don\u2019t want to rush things because you might break them. As we\u2019ve seen.\u201d\n\n\n\nRead Also: Reformed \u2018altcoin slayer\u2019 Eric Wall on shitposting and scaling Ethereum\n\n\n\nVarious parties, including StarkWare and blockchain researcher Eric Wall, have been investigating scaling Bitcoin using zero-knowledge (ZK) rollups, which is Ethereum\u2019s plan to solve its very similar challenges.\n\n\n\nBut ironically, while the surge in demand caused by Ordinals has shown that further scaling is required, it\u2019s also made it much less likely the community would agree to a new hard fork to enable ZK-rollups. After all, they voted for Taproot and look what happened?\n\n\u201cI doubt that will ever happen,\u201d says Checkmate.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am also skeptical of even a soft fork since the unintended consequences of the witness discount have woken everyone up to the risks of change.\u201d"

        "title": "3 reasons why Lido DAO price jumped 40% in a week \u2014 Outperforming Bitcoin, Ethereum - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The price of Lido DAO (LDO) has rebounded to its three-week high of $2.21 as of May 16, up 40% when measured from its local low of $1.57, established four days ago.\n\nThis impressive double-digit recovery appeared in tandem with other top-ranking crypto assets, including Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH). However, LDO has greatly outperformed the broader crypto market (TOTAL), which is up only 4.5% since May 12.\n\nLDO/USD daily price returns vs. BTC/USD, ETH/USD and TOTAL. Source: TradingView\n\nBut what are the reasons why Lido DAO is outperforming the rest of the cryptocurrency market right now? Let\u2019s take a closer look at the three biggest factors likely driving up LDO\u2019s price.\n\nEther depositors\u2019 return after Shapella\n\nThe LDO price recovery coincides with the net positive inflows into Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake (PoS) contract in recent days.\n\nLido DAO is primarily an Ethereum liquid staking platform. It enables users to pool their funds to become validators on Ethereum, thus bypassing the network\u2019s requirement of depositing at least 32 ETH.\n\nIn April, Ethereum underwent a network upgrade called Shapella, which supports reward withdrawals from its staking contract. As a result, its PoS contract witnessed days when the amount of ETH withdrawals outnumbered deposits.\n\nFor instance, the net ETH staked with its PoS contract was 19.27 million ETH on April 11, a day before the Shapella upgrade. The number fell to 90,704 a week later, followed by a consistent recovery, according to data tracked by Nansen.\n\nEther deposits and withdrawals into/from its PoS contract. Source: Nansen\n\nAs of May 16, the Ethereum PoS contract had over 20 million ETH, underscoring the growing demand for liquid staking service providers like Lido DAO. The price of its governance token, LDO, likely benefited from the narrative.\n\nFor instance, Lido DAO\u2019s nearest competitor, RocketPool (RPL), has also soared 15% to around $50 when measured from its May 12 low.\n\nLido v2 mainnet launch\n\nIt should be noted that Lido DAO did not support full ETH withdrawals. Instead, it issued staked Ether (stETH), theoretically pegged to ETH by 1:1, to users that could be exchanged freely for other crypto assets across exchanges.\n\nBut that was until recently.\n\nOn May 15, Lido DAO launched the mainnet version of \u201cLido v2,\u201d which enables Ether stakers to burn their stETH and exit the protocol at a 1:1 ratio. Since the upgrade, LDO\u2019s price has climbed 20%, or half of its 40% rebound thus far.\n\nRelated: Celsius moves $781M in stETH just as Lido withdrawals open\n\nLido DAO whales have also supported LDO\u2019s upside move in the days leading up to the Lido v2 launch. And, according to data resource Lookonchain, this may suggest that the \u201cbuy the rumor\u201d scenario may have contributed to the LDO price rally.\n\nDue to the launch of Lido V2, we noticed 3 whales accumulating $LDO in the past week.\n\n\n\n- 0x9EA7 withdrew 724,822 $LDO($1.52M) from #Binance at $2.01.\n\n\n\n- 0x4E4e withdrew 655,641 $LDO($1.38M) from #Binance at $1.83.\n\n\n\n- 0x9eda bought 570,883 $LDO with 974K $USDC at $1.71 on May 12. pic.twitter.com/S0cNUxpLw0 \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) May 16, 2023\n\nLDO\u2019s price rising wedge bounce\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, LDO\u2019s 40% bounce started near the lower trendline of a prevailing falling wedge setup. Traditional analysts see a falling wedge as a bullish reversal pattern.\n\nLido DAO daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe LDO/USD pair has recovered similarly in recent history, with each rebound taking its price to the wedge\u2019s upper trendline. Now with the price treading around the upper trendline again, LDO could enter a breakout stage or pull back to retest the lower trendline.\n\nLDO\u2019s breakout scenario will have the price rally toward $3.35 by June 2023, up around 50% from current price levels. This target appears after adding the maximum wedge height to the potential breakout point near $2.70.\n\nConversely, the pullback scenario could bring the LDO price near $1.56 by June 2023, down 30% from current price levels. This level has served as support and resistance in the past.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Disclaimer: The information presented does not constitute financial, investment, trading, or other types of advice and is solely the writer\u2019s opinion.\n\nETH dropped below 50-EMA but was checked by 100-EMA.\n\nA positive CVD spot could offer bulls slight hope.\n\nThe second largest digital asset based on market cap, Ethereum [ETH], is weathering the current strong macro headwinds better than Bitcoin [BTC]. For perspective, ETH\u2019s weekly loss was about 5% at press time, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check ETH Profit Calculator\n\nIn the same period, BTC depreciated by about 7%; thus, the king coin was hammered more than the ETH \u2013 further reinforcing ETH\u2019s decoupling from BTC. But Binance Coin [BNB] outperformed both assets on the weekly front.\n\nDespite the corrections, the Crypto Greed and Fear index was \u201cneutral\u201d with a value of 48 at press time, compared to the \u201cgreed\u201d position last week (7-14 May).\n\nWill bulls continue defending $1800?\n\nA short-term downside couldn\u2019t be overruled with price action below the 50-EMA (Exponential Moving Average) and the RSI hovering below the 50-mark.\n\nNotably, short-term holders could panic-sell their ETH holdings if market sentiment deteriorates in the coming days/weeks.\n\nETH\u2019s market structure\u2019s first sign of weakness will be a breach and daily session close below the 100-EMA of $1764 (yellow line). Such a downswing could sink ETH to $1700. The second telltale sign of weakness will be a close below $1700, which could depreciate ETH to $1500.\n\nOn the upside, bulls could feel relieved if they push ETH above the 50-EMA of $1845 (blue line). Such a move could fuel hopes of reclaiming the $2000 psychological level and dent any prevailing bearish sentiment.\n\nMeanwhile, CMF (Chaikin Money Flow) hovered near zero after retreating from the negative zone \u2013 capital inflows improved but wavered in the past few days. Similarly, the OBV was also flat, meaning demand wavered \u2013 suggesting a likely short-term consolidation.\n\nPositive aggregated CVD means \u2026\n\nAccording to Coinalyze, the aggregated CVD (Cumulative Volume Delta) spot, which tracks buyer/seller activities alongside overall sentiment, was positive.\n\nThe metric has been negative since 3 May, but flipped to positive on 12 May after the price hit the $1800 support level. It shows buyers have been in charge for the past two days.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nOn the liquidation side, long positions worth $2.5 million were wrecked in the past 24 hours, compared to $1.9 million in short positions. This development depicts a mild bearish sentiment that could undermine a strong ETH recovery.\n\nMacro traders following ETH/USDT would want to watch out for the US debt ceiling woes alongside the US Retail Sales data scheduled for Tuesday (16 May), which will affect all USD/USDT pegged assets/pairs."

        "content": "Print this page\n\nSimply sign up to the Exchange traded funds myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nLatest news on ETFs Visit our ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools\n\nFive ETF issuers filed to launch ether futures ETFs last week, in what could become a \u201cwinner-take-most\u201d scenario, analysts say.\n\nGrayscale was the first issuer to act, filing on May 9 to launch the Grayscale Ethereum Futures ETF, based on the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency, behind bitcoin.\n\nDirexion, Roundhill Investments and Bitwise followed on May 10 with their own versions, filings show, while Valkyrie lodged an application on May 12.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has not yet approved any ether futures ETFs. At least one firm \u2014 Kelly Strategic Management \u2014 filed for an ETF that would have invested in ether futures. Soon after, however, the firm withdrew its application.\n\nThe SEC, however, has given the green light to ETFs that invest in bitcoin futures. The now-$928mn ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) was the first to launch in October 2021.\n\nThis article was previously published by Ignites, a title owned by the FT Group.\n\nThe SEC has rejected bids for physical bitcoin ETFs due to the potential for fraud and manipulation. SEC chair Gary Gensler has called bitcoin a \u201cWild West\u201d market that leaves investors less protected than stock and bond markets.\n\nIf approved by the SEC, the five ETFs will invest primarily in ether futures traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the filings show.\n\nEther is the native cryptocurrency of the ethereum network, a \u201cdecentralised network of computers that operates on cryptographic protocols\u201d, Grayscale\u2019s filing notes. The funds will not invest directly in ether or any digital assets.\n\nThe five ETFs\u2019 investment strategies are largely the same, prospectuses show. They will invest in wholly owned subsidiaries organised under the laws of the Cayman Islands.\n\nRepresentatives from the issuers did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n\u201cNo news is good news for bitcoin futures ETFs, and it\u2019s a good sign for the prospect of futures-based ether ETFs, as well,\u201d said Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research for North America at Morningstar. \u201cThere isn\u2019t any evidence that bitcoin ETFs were a failed experiment for the SEC, so this may be the right time for these funds to be approved.\u201d\n\nShortly after it launched, the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF amassed $1bn in assets at a faster pace than any previously launched ETF. However, its net asset value plunged 63.7 per cent in 2022. Since its inception, market depreciation has erased $1.3bn in investor assets.\n\nOther bitcoin futures ETFs, such as ones from VanEck and Valkyrie, have struggled to keep up. The VanEck ETF has just $41mn in assets and Valkyrie\u2019s has $30mn, respectively, according to FactSet data.\n\nThere was a \u201cgood case\u201d for the SEC to approve the ether futures ETFs for the same reason that they approved the bitcoin futures ETFs in the first place, noted Matt Apkarian, associate director for product development at Cerulli Associates.\n\n\u201cThe fact that these are digital asset futures doesn\u2019t really change what the SEC needs to see relative to any other futures-based exchange-traded products,\u201d Apkarian said.\n\nGrayscale might also be calling the SEC\u2019s bluff in regard to its statements in favour of futures-based crypto ETFs, Armour noted.\n\nIn June Grayscale sued the SEC after the regulator rejected its bid to convert its Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. The firm claimed in the lawsuit that the SEC had no grounds to reject a spot bitcoin ETF after approving futures ETFs. The suit is ongoing.\n\nLatest news on ETFs Visit the ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools helping you to understand everything from performance to ESG ratings\n\nThe \u201crest of the pack\u201d might just be jumping in line, in case the SEC approved these ETFs, rather than signalling increased optimism that they would be given the go-ahead, Armour said.\n\nRoundhill and Direxion do not currently offer any crypto-related products. Bitwise, meanwhile, runs a $477mn 10 Crypto Index Fund and $70mn Crypto Industry Innovators ETF (BITQ), which invests in companies that derive most of their revenue from the crypto ecosystem, not crypto directly.\n\nIn March, Bitwise launched the Bitwise Bitcoin Strategy Optimum Roll ETF (BITC), a futures ETF designed for long-term investors.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see this become somewhat of a winner-take-most scenario like we saw with BITO,\u201d Apkarian said, referring to ProShares\u2019 Bitcoin futures ETF. \u201cI think the first-mover advantage is likely why we are seeing so many firms trying to launch so quickly right now.\u201d\n\n*Ignites is a news service published by FT Specialist for professionals working in the asset management industry.

        "content": "The United States Department of Commerce has imposed a 10-year export privilege ban on Virgil Griffith, an Ethereum developer serving a five-year prison sentence. The ban restricts him from enjoying export privileges until April 12, 2032.\n\nThe export privilege ban affects his ability to participate in international trade and business. On April 12, 2022, Virgil Griffith was convicted in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York for breaching the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). Griffith was found guilty of unauthorized export of services to North Korea and circumventing U.S. sanctions imposed on the country.\n\nU.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman accused Griffith of knowingly sharing technical information with North Korea that could aid in money laundering and evading sanctions, according to a statement. As a result of his conviction, Griffith was sentenced to 63 months in prison, followed by three years of supervised release. He is also obligated to pay a $100 assessment and a criminal fine of $100,000.\n\nUnder the provisions of the Export Control Reform Act, individuals convicted of specific offenses, such as violating the IEEPA, may face a denial of export privileges for up to 10 years. This denial can lead to the revocation of licenses or authorizations previously granted by the Bureau of Industry and Security \u2014 an agency of the Commerce Department.\n\nAs a result of the bar, Virgil Griffith will be restricted from engaging, directly or indirectly, in any transactions involving commodities, software or technology that fall under the jurisdiction of U.S. export regulations. This effectively entails the denial of his export privileges as a U.S. citizen.\n\nRelated: Two more charged with teaching North Koreans to evade US sanctions with crypto\n\nHe was initially denied bail but was finally granted a bond order for $1 million at the end of December 2019. In October 2020, Griffith filed a motion to dismiss the conspiracy charges, claiming that his April 2019 conference presentation consisted of widely available public information; therefore, he was not providing a \u201cservice\u201d to North Korean officials.\n\nMagazine: North Korean crypto hacking: Separating fact from fiction"

More complex transactions involving higher gas fees, such as token trades on decentralised exchanges, incurred even steeper costs.\n\nPepe at $1 billion\n\nBut after a period of unprecedented gains which saw Pepe surpass a $1 billion market capitalisation, the memecoin madness that defined Ethereum in recent weeks \u201cseems to slowly be dying down,\u201d Hildobby, a pseudonymous data analyst at crypto venture fund Dragonfly, told DL News.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nDune data compiled by Hildobby, shows that median gas fees on Ethereum have dropped 64% from an early May peak. On May 15, the median gas fee for transactions returned to 50 gwei, down from 142 gwei on May 5.\n\nEthereum\u2019s gas fees are typically expressed in gwei, a unit equivalent to one-billionth of an Ether.\n\nEthereum median daily gas price (Hildobby)\n\nHildobby explained that the median gas fee is a proxy for Ethereum blockspace demand and represents what users should expect to pay to get their transactions processed.\n\nLike most blockchains, Ethereum employs a dynamic fee system designed to thwart malicious actors from inundating the network with transactions, obstructing other users.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nWhen Ethereum\u2019s activity level rises, the network correspondingly increases the base fee \u2014 the minimum amount of gwei users must pay to initiate transactions.\n\nIf the volume of transactions remains high, gas fees continue to escalate. However, a decrease in demand for transaction submission triggers a corresponding reduction in the base gas fee.\n\nNOW READ: MiCA is here. There are nine other EU crypto laws you should know about\n\nIn the context of trading memecoins like Pepe, traders must take into account the cost of submitting transactions to Ethereum. If traders can\u2019t offset the high gas fees with profits, they\u2019ll trade less.\n\n\u2018Insanely high\u2019\n\n\u201cGas gets so high that most people get priced out or it no longer becomes worth it for a lot of people to do smaller transactions,\u201d Ryan Myher, co-founder of crypto analytics platform LORE, told DL News.\n\n\u201cThe return on investment would have to be insanely high just to cover the gas.\u201d\n\nWhile the current drop in activity on Ethereum is providing a respite from high transaction fees, not everyone is convinced the memecoin hype is over.\n\nAlex Strong, a trader at crypto trading firm Scimitar Capital, told DL News that the main reason gas costs were down was because fewer people are speculating on-chain in the past week.\n\nThis drop in activity \u201cmight be temporary,\u201d he said, leaving open the possibility for another memecoin resurgence.\n\nTypically, during periods when investors are willing to take on risk, they tend to pile into more volatile assets like stocks or crypto. And memecoins are risky even by crypto standards.\n\nAt least one market move suggests a memecoin surge is a sign of the top:\n\nNOW READ: Aragon\u2019s $200m activist battle ignites DAO debate: \u2018Lining up soldiers doesn\u2019t mean an attack\u2019\n\nIn May 2021, Dogecoin, often described as the original memecoin, hit an all-time high of $0.73, while Bitcoin traded above $55,000. But a month later, the total crypto market capitalisation had dropped 36% from its highs, with Dogecoin down more than 56%.\n\n\u201cGas prices are dropping significantly and coming back to pre-meme craze levels, almost,\u201d Crypto Koryo, a pseudonymous crypto trader and writer, told DL News.\n\n\u201cThe question is: Is the meme narrative finished now? or is this a small pullback?\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see how it goes this time,\u201d he said."

        "title": "Ethereum stumbles with settlements as validators go missing - CoinGeek",
        "content": "The Ethereum network has experienced two glitches in the past week with settling transactions on its Beacon Chain. The two delays occurred late last week after validators failed to confirm valid blocks, causing some exchange services to pause deposits. Developers are still looking for the cause.\n\nThose working to fix the problem downplayed the seriousness of the issue, noting there were no cases of transactions being lost or remaining unsettled for long. However, they did admit it was something that required fixing and that developers faced technical challenges in ensuring the network didn\u2019t suffer longer-term and more severe settlement delays in the future.\n\nWhile glitches have occurred on all blockchains of all types, Ethereum is a constantly-shifting ocean of complexity with new rules and definitions. Even some of its closest followers confess they struggle to keep up with the latest terminology. While the technical inner circle might not consider an issue serious, they may be potentially so, leading to problems explaining Ethereum\u2019s security to potential users.\n\nThis ever-changing technical environment leads to Ethereum being called \u201cexperimental\u201d and even a \u201chobby platform\u201d that isn\u2019t ready for large-scale applications where billions of dollars in money and asset value could be at risk.\n\nLast week\u2019s issues affected Ethereum\u2019s on-chain \u201cfinalization,\u201d an explicit settlement concept and \u201ccheckpointing\u201d technique that has existed in Ethereum since its recent switch to a proof-of-stake (PoS) processing algorithm. Designed to prevent blockchain \u201cre-orgs\u201d (re-organizations), it determines that a transaction is considered officially \u201cfinalized\u201d if at least 2/3 of all validators vote (or \u201cattest\u201d) for consensus after a defined period has passed. Ethereum has unique names for these processes, and finalization occurs following consensus over two \u201cepochs\u201d (one epoch is 32 12-second \u201cslots,\u201d meaning a transaction should be officially final after about 12.8 minutes).\n\nIn other words, to most ordinary users, transactions would have appeared to proceed as normal, but the blockchain itself delayed in considering them permanent and unalterable. This caused some exchange services to pause deposits. While the first delay lasted just a few minutes, the second lasted over an hour, reportedly due to 60% of validator nodes appearing absent.\n\nCommenting on the issue, Ethereum client developer at ConsenSys Ben Edgington said Ethereum was still functionally working, maybe with degraded performance for a short time, but not one that stopped the network itself. The root cause, he said in a video interview, was \u201cstill under analysis,\u201d and no developer intervention was required to fix the delay. However, once the cause is determined, they will likely issue patches to prevent future incidents.\n\nHe described it as a panic situation only on the technical back-end, as validators worked to rebuild older network \u201cstates\u201d to check past attestations while new slots continued to pour in every 12 seconds. Old attestations are discarded so they don\u2019t clog up space, but the challenge was working out which ones were important for finalizations and which weren\u2019t. Different validators have their own ways of performing these processes, so it was more of a crisis for some than others.\n\nIn theory, a chain re-org is possible within the two-epoch period or before finalization if enough validators vote/attest with their stakes to do so.\n\nIn \u201cprobabilistic\u201d blockchain networks such as Bitcoin (and Ethereum when it still ran on proof-of-work), there are recommendations on how many additional transaction blocks must pass (if any) before a previous one is considered \u201cfinal,\u201d but the protocol itself does not define this.\n\nEthereum completely changed its protocol rules and economic incentives when it switched to proof-of-stake (PoS) transaction validation late in 2022. Though this nominally more \u201cenvironmentally friendly\u201d move has generated favorable media attention, it also injected a lot of uncertainty over whether Ethereum could remain \u201csafe\u201d or trustworthy in the longer term.\n\nApplication developers, especially enterprise-tier ones, don\u2019t want to administer their own systems under rule uncertainty or ongoing technical experiments; they want stable systems that are proven to work. This is why BSV retains Bitcoin\u2019s original, \u201cset in stone\u201d protocol rules and proof-of-work (PoW) based confirmations and economic incentives. On a global scale, this is by far the more trustworthy option for blockchain.\n\nWatch The Bitcoin MasterClasses: Party-to-party is revolutionary, and that\u2019s because Bitcoin is traceable\n\nwidth=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nNew to blockchain?

        "content": "Attorney Deaton asked why the government dismissed the charges against former Ethereum adviser Nerayoff despite going through the pains of securing an indictment.\n\nAttorney John E. Deaton, CryptoLaw founder, and pro-XRP lawyer, has taken to Twitter to question the reason behind the recent dismissal of criminal extortion charges against former Ethereum adviser Steven Nerayoff.\n\nIn a tweet today, attorney Deaton, who revealed himself as a former federal prosecutor, asked why prosecutors would go through the trouble of securing an indictment only to dismiss the case later.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nDeaton also wondered what would have prompted the prosecutors to dismiss the charges against Nerayoff, especially after the defendant took an offensive approach, accusing the government of prosecutorial misconduct.\n\nSome of Nerayoff\u2019s allegations against U.S. investigators, as cited by Deaton, include the fact that he was placed in a van and asked to provide evidence against Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, Caitlin Long, founder and CEO of Custodia Bank.\n\n\u201cNerayoff alleges that he pled not guilty, refused to let the Feds intimidate him, and demanded a trial. Why would the government dismiss?\u201d Deaton quizzed.\n\nDeaton Highlights Possible Reason Behind the Dismissal\n\nNotably, Deaton suggests that the prosecutors may have dismissed the case against Nerayoff due to the validity of his claims.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cMy experience tells me that some of his claims had teeth to them, and the Government did not want to engage in discovery. When you add his claims with Chokepoint 2.0 and the Administration\u2019s current war on Crypto, it makes you [Think],\u201c he added.\n\nCourt Dismisses Case Against Nerayoff\n\nFor context, Nerayoff and one of his employees, Michael Hlady, were initially accused of extorting an unnamed crypto firm. The Seattle-based company hired Nerayoff and Hlady to provide guidance for its 2017 initial coin offering (ICO).\n\nHowever, prosecutors allege that both Nerayoff and Hlady threatened to destroy the company if it failed to pay them millions of dollars for their services. While Hlady pled guilty in August 2021, Nerayoff maintained his innocence.\n\nAccording to reports, U.S. District Judge Margo Brodie dismissed the charges against Nerayoff on May 5, ending a three-and-a-half-year legal battle between the former Ethereum adviser and federal prosecutors.\n\nThe lawsuit was struck out six weeks after prosecutors requested to drop the case due to their inability to prove the charges against Nerayoff."

        "title": "What Is ERC-6551? Ethereum's New NFT Standard - DailyCoin",
        "content": "Although ERC-721 introduced NFTs to the world, it still has many limitations.\n\nSo, Ethereum has released a new standard that addresses all the issues of ERC-721 .\n\n. ERC-6551 looks to usher in a new era of NFTs.\n\nThe ERC-721 standard made history by introducing NFTs to the world. Since their inception, NFTs have revolutionized industries by introducing new applications in the form of static images, breedable cats, generative artwork, tickets, and more.\n\nAs NFT adoption grows, developers uncover new use cases for NFTs. However, the standard they\u2019re built on has limitations that could hinder NFTs from realizing their true potential. This is where Ethereum\u2019s new standard, ERC-6551, comes into play.\n\nERC-6551 is specially designed to propel every NFT on the network to become more dynamic, hence ushering in a new era.\n\nWhat is ERC-6551?\n\nERC-6551 is Ethereum\u2019s new standard for NFTs that aims to make them more dynamic and interactive. It gives ERC-721 NFTs the full capabilities of an Ethereum account using token-bound accounts (TBA).\n\nThe new standard allows standard NFTs to go beyond static assets and assume enhanced functionality and interactivity. It deploys unique smart contracts or wallets for each ERC-721 NFT and then uses a permissionless registry to record the account\u2019s on-chain activity.\n\nERC-6551 is a new standard that allows an NFT to have its own wallet. In other words, The NFT itself acts as a wallet with its own wallet address.\n\n\n\nThese wallets are called \"Token Bound Accounts\", aka TBA.\n\n\n\nLet's illustrate this and see what are the advantages.\n\n\n\n(2/15) pic.twitter.com/0O8NM9CzcN \u2014 Zak\u00b3\u26b1\ufe0f (@ZakaiMill) May 15, 2023\n\nAdditionally, thanks to the ERC-4337 standard, a smart contract deployed by ERC-6551 will function like a wallet that can store assets and make transactions. Moreover, the new standard is backward-compatible with all ERC-721 tokens, meaning existing NFTs can implement the new standard without going through any hassles of wrapping assets or more.\n\nWhile ERC-721 NFTs have paved the way for mainstream adoption of NFTs and unlocked new use cases for blockchain-based assets, they\u2019re swarming with issues such as limited provenance, lack of composability, and being too static. The new NFT standard addresses all the problems in the prior standard and brings new opportunities to the table.\n\nWhat Does ERC-6551 Bring to the Table?\n\nERC-6551 is set to change the NFT industry by allowing every NFT to be more dynamic and functional. In hindsight, the new standard could revolutionize many industries, especially web3 gaming and on-chain identification.\n\nBefore the new standard, players who owned in-game NFTs would have their assets sit separately in their wallets. With ERC-6551 and its token-bound accounts in the mix, game developers can introduce new use cases such as inventories, gear, and other mechanics requiring multiple assets to interact with each other.\n\nERC-6551 also opens up opportunities for on-chain identification in various areas, such as loyalty programs, allow-listing, reward, and credit rating. Implementing on-chain identification could enhance the reliability and security of protocols, leading to more robust systems.\n\nThe sky\u2019s the limit for NFTs with ERC-6551, and it would be interesting to see what new diverse applications will pop up.\n\nOn The Flipside\n\nRecently, Ethereum gas prices went to levels not seen since May 2022 because of the ongoing meme coin PEPE mania. Network gas prices have been averaging at over 100 gwei.\n\nOne user paid 64 ETH in gas fees for a single transaction, equivalent to $120,000, due to recent Ethereum network congestion.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nEthereum\u2019s new standard has the potential to take Web3 to another level by evolving the very nature of static NFTs to be more dynamic, composable, and interactive.\n\nCardano Developer shuts down rumors of Hydra high TPS:\n\nCardano Dev Dismisses Hydra TPS Rumors: \u201cIt Is Misleading\u201d\n\nZeebu is bringing the telecom carrier industry to web3:\n\nZeebu to Enable Instant Global Transactions for Telecom Companies"

        "content": "Bankrupt crypto lender Celsius has resumed staking Ethereum (ETH), according to data shared by Arkham Intelligence.\n\nArkham reported that the bankrupt lender staked 30,800 ETH \u2014 $56.9 million \u2014 via staking solutions provider Figment during the past week. A research analyst at 21Co, Tom Wan, corroborated the Arkham report.\n\nAccording to Wan, Celsius deposited over 40,000 Ethereum through Figment between May 10 and May 12.\n\nThe reason behind this deposit is currently unknown, considering Celsius withdrew part of its staked ETH in April. At the time, industry players interpreted this as a move that the bankrupt firm was consolidating its assets.\n\nCelsius remains one of the biggest firms with a staked ETH portfolio. According to the Arkham Intelligence dashboard, the lender holds 410,378 staked ETH worth $749.37 million.\n\nMeanwhile, Celsius transactions are not altogether surprising given that several entities that withdrew their staked ETH have begun re-staking them. Liquid staking derivatives protocol Lido has led the charts in staked ETH withdrawals and deposits over the past few weeks, according to Nansen\u2019s dashboard.\n\nTotal ETH staking deposits soar above withdrawals.\n\nThe total number of staked ETH reached a new all-time high of 21.62 million worth $39.5 billion \u2014 as staking deposits have surpassed withdrawals \u2014 according to Etherscan data.\n\nSince withdrawals were enabled on April 12, the total number of ETH withdrawn stands at 2.67 million, while ETH deposited is at 3.46 million. This means there is a net staking balance of 785,000 ETH, according to Token Unlocks data.\n\nNansen\u2019s data corroborates the above. According to its dashboard, several crypto entities like Kraken and other centralized exchanges led the initial wave of withdrawals in compliance with the regulatory pressure they faced from U.S. financial regulators.\n\nHowever, as these entities\u2019 withdrawals began to subside, liquid staking protocols like Frax Ether and Rocket Pool have seen the total value of assets locked on their platforms increase by double digits within the past month, according to DeFillama data.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "As the world of cryptocurrencies evolves, Ethereum (ETH) investors are beginning to take notice of the power of yields and their potential impact on the crypto space. Yields, in essence, are the payments investors receive for holding cryptocurrencies, and they can come in many shapes and forms.\n\nHow ETH Yields Could Revolutionize The Space\n\nOne of the most important things to understand about yields is that they exist on a risk curve. This means that the percentage of yield paid out to investors is a function of supply and demand, as well as the perceived risk associated with the cryptocurrency in question.\n\nRelated Reading: Only 1,032 Addresses Control Over 60% Of All Litecoin (LTC) In Circulation\n\nFor example, a cryptocurrency with a limited supply and high demand is likely to have a higher yield than one with a larger supply and lower demand. Similarly, a cryptocurrency that is perceived as less risky is likely to have a higher yield than one that is perceived as more risky.\n\nAccording to the crypto analyst and researcher Adam Cochran, this is where the potential of cryptocurrencies really shines through.\n\n1/25 I think most people in crypto don't fully understand or appreciate yields and what it can mean for the crypto space at large \u2013 as it's one of the things that gets me incredibly bullish on the space. And it's part of why I think ETH still has a 20x+ in its future. \u2014 Adam Cochran (adamscochran.eth) (@adamscochran) May 15, 2023\n\nBy creating non-dilutive yields through the use of fees, cryptocurrencies can offer investors a way to earn passive income without the risk of inflation. This is particularly important in a world where traditional investments like savings accounts and bonds offer little to no yield.\n\nOne cryptocurrency that is particularly well-positioned to take advantage of the power of yields is Ethereum. With its growing ecosystem of decentralized applications and smart contracts, ETH has the potential to generate significant fees for investors through its use as a platform for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, according to Cochran.\n\nFor example, ETH staking currently offers yields in the 5%-7% range, while Synthtetix (SNX) staking can generate yields of up to 24% in external fees. Similarly, Curve (CRV) staking can generate yields of up to 15% in crvUSD fees. This means that billions of dollars in capital are now able to generate yields of more than 3% annual percentage yield (APY), which is a significant opportunity for investors.\n\nThis is particularly important in a world where traditional investment opportunities like savings accounts and bonds offer little to no yield. As more investors become aware of the potential of cryptocurrencies to generate high yields with acceptable levels of risk, this can likely drive more interest and investment in the space.\n\nFrom HODLing To Yielding\n\nIn its recent post, Adam Cochran emphasized the importance of focusing on asset productivity and real yield in the cryptocurrency space. Despite the current narrative that fundamentals don\u2019t matter and memes and rhetoric dominate the market, Cochran believes that one day, the true value of assets will become apparent.\n\nAccording to Cochran, those who already possess assets have the advantage, as they stand to gain significant capital gains in addition to the 2% APY on the face value of the asset. This is particularly relevant in the cryptocurrency space, where prices can be extremely volatile and subject to sudden fluctuations.\n\nRelated Reading: Bitcoin Miners Continue To Sell, Bearish Sign?\n\nFurthermore, Cochran predicts that as funds of increasing size start to realize the long-term potential of the cryptocurrency space, they will begin to invest heavily.\n\nThis influx of capital will fundamentally change the finance industry, and those who have acquired a significant number of coins before this shift will reap the benefits.\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Asymmetry Finance, a liquid staking tokens (LST) protocol, today announced its seed round totaling $3 million in conjunction with the official launch of its platform. The raise was led by Ecco Capital, a venture capital fund focused on frontier crypto innovation. Asymmetry Finance\u2019s liquid staking tokens protocol is a custom-built solution to the centralization of the staked Ether market.\n\nWhile the $13.6 billion LST market continues to blossom into one of the most attractive sectors of DeFi due to its liquidity and flexibility, the LST market remains highly centralized. Currently, 88% of the LST market is staked on Lido Finance \u2013 creating a single point of failure and posing significant security vulnerabilities. The centralized custodianship of staked assets on Ethereum will only grow more concerning as more users flock to the network to stake assets following the recent Shapella upgrades.\n\nNew and veteran DeFi users, as well as institutions, are in need of a liquid staking solution that promotes decentralization, while retaining the benefits of LSTs and optimal capital efficiency. Asymmetry offers an immediate solution to the scalability and centralization challenges facing the Ethereum LST market.\n\n\u201cStaking on Ethereum is essential for securing, scaling, and sustaining the network,\u201d said Justin Garland, co-founder of Asymmetry Finance. \u201cThe percentage of ETH staked relative to other chains is significantly lower which we believe presents a unique opportunity to onboard users and reshape the highly centralized staking market. We want to encourage all Ethereum holders to stake and help secure the network itself while also earning yield. The challenge is incentivizing users to simultaneously contribute towards decentralization as well, rather than compounding on the centralization that we currently see in the market.\u201d\n\n\u201cSubstantial centralization not only inherently conflicts with the core fundamentals of DeFi, but also has potential knock-on effects for the entire ecosystem,\u201d added Hannah Hamilton, co-founder of Asymmetry Finance. \u201cAsymmetry\u2019s vision is not to directly challenge Lido or Rocketpool, but to advance the core tenets of decentralization on the Ethereum network, and empower DeFi users with a novel liquid staking alternative.\u201d\n\nThe successful seed raise drew support from some of the most notable venture funds, including: Ecco Capital, Republic Capital, and GMJP. Additionally, Asymmetry received investment from one of the leading LST providers, Ankr, highlighting Asymmetry\u2019s symbiotic relationship with all LST providers. Asymmetry Finance will use the resources to further develop its liquid staking protocol, add top talent to the team, and onboard decentralized finance (DeFi) enthusiasts and institutions to its platform.\n\n\u201c\u200b\u200bRepublic Capital sees the liquid staking market as one of the leading sectors in the current crypto industry and we\u2019re thrilled to see tech providers and developers that not only seek to increase decentralization but also create an easier experience for the act of staking,\u201d commented Graham Friedman, Head of Venture of Republic Crypto. \u201cWe see the Asymmetry team as fitting this vision by nailing both items. Blended with their experience in crypto native teams we look forward to their continued launch of products that augment and enhance the staked asset markets in order to help it thrive and grow.\u201d\n\n\u201cEcco Capital views the growing staking economy as DeFi's fixed income equivalent. We have partnered with Asymmetry Finance because of their dedication to decentralizing the Ethereum liquid staking ecosystem. The team continues to ship major milestones in their roadmap, and aims to build the best tools for retail users and institutions to access highly competitive DeFi yield on one seamless platform,\u201d said Daniel Abrahamian, CIO of Ecco Capital.\n\nCentral to the Asymmetry Finance protocol is its flagship project, Simple Asymmetry Finance Ethereum (safETH), which aims to deliver consistent yield to users in a safe and efficient manner. The core elements of safETH include:\n\nFee-Free Decentralized Asset Basket: The use of a decentralized basket of assets \u2013 with no additional user fees \u2013 directly mitigates risks such as the central point of failure, and a singular dominant custodian, at risk of possible regulation.\n\nThe use of a decentralized basket of assets \u2013 with no additional user fees \u2013 directly mitigates risks such as the central point of failure, and a singular dominant custodian, at risk of possible regulation.

        "content": "Uwerx (WERX) Token Sale Reaches New Heights And Could Surpass Bitcoin Cash (BCH) And Ethereum Classic (ETC)\n\nCrypto investments have been seen to make people wealthy with suitable investments at the right time in the right project.\n\nThis article will give you insights into the market. And hopefully, benefit you enough to guide you in making that suitable investment.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) Experiences Massive Mining\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) is the fork of the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain. Even though they are often mistaken to be the same coin, they differ primarily in their native currency, Ethereum uses (ETH), while Ethereum Classic uses (ETC).\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) focuses solely on 'immutability,' famously known as 'code is law.' Ethereum Classic (ETC) is fully decentralized and can run a wide range of decentralized applications using its native coin ETC for transactions and smart contracts on its network.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) has also moved closer in similarities to Ethereum (ETH). After Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) merge, the computing power of Ethereum Classic (ETC) almost doubled. This is because mining has significantly stopped on the Ethereum (ETH) network.\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) Launches BCH BULL\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) is a blockchain forked out of Bitcoin (BTC) to solve Bitcoin's (BTC) throughput issue, which initially took long hours to complete.\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) offers lightning-fast transactions than Bitcoin (BTC). Users enjoy cheaper transaction fees, scalability, a maximum block size of 8 megabytes, and an emergency adjustment feature.\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) was set up to be a better-suited crypto than Bitcoin (BTC) for affordable, everyday payment.\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) recently launched BCH BULL, which lets users create hedge positions on assets like gold and Bitcoin (BTC). This move allows people to permissionlessly lock their Bitcoin Cash (BCH) to external legacy currencies without worrying about the volatility of cryptocurrencies.\n\nUwerx (WERX) Token Price Sees A New High\n\nUwerx aims to be a freelancing platform that maximizes blockchain's ability to offer many advantages to freelancers and companies.\n\nUwerx offers a 1% transaction fee by using smart contracts to eliminate middleman involvement. This means the platform utilizes blockchain to provide cheaper transaction fees compared to 10%-20% of other freelancing platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, and Freelancer.\n\nUwerx will also see a 25-year liquidity lock on developers\u2019 liquidity, giving investors security on investment. They will also renounce smart contract ownership of the project when it lists on centralized exchanges. In addition, Uwerx has been audited by SolidProof and InterFi Network to promote transparency and long-term viability.\n\nWERX is Uwerx\u2019s native token, and it will be used to transact on the platform. WERX has seen an increase in value recently and is currently priced at $0.0225 per WERX token. The project's stage 4 allocation increased from 60 million to 77.5 million, and presale token allocation has risen to 54% from the previous 45%. Uwerx is also developing an Alpha version of the platform, which will be released next week.\n\nInvestment confidence has also increased, with founders' allocation reduced from 8% to 7%. A new stage 5 presale will soon start with a 72.5 million token allocation, and the hard-cap presale will end on 31st July 2023.\n\nThese three coins are moving forward with massive gains for investors. Still, Uwerx stands tall with excellent investment security, a promising real-world use case, and a successful presale that has boosted the value of WERX.\n\nFollow the links below and learn more about Uwerx and how to benefit from its amazing offers.\n\nPresale: invest.uwerx.network\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/uwerx_network\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/uwerx_network\n\nWebsite: https://www.uwerx.network\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article.

        "title": "$500K worth of stETH redeemed in 3 hours as Lido enables withdrawals - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The Lido liquid staking protocol has enabled Ether withdrawals for the first time, according to May 15 data from Parsec Finance. Over 260 Lido Staked Ether (stETH) was redeemed for its underlying Ether (ETH) in the first three hours, worth about $500,000.\n\nLido is a liquid staking derivatives (LSD) protocol that allows ETH holders to stake their coins with participating validators and earn additional ETH as a reward. When users stake their ETH with Lido, they receive stETH in return. As users earn ETH from staking, their stETH increases in quantity to reflect the additional rewards.\n\nHowever, before the April 13 Shapella upgrade, Ethereum did not allow validators to withdraw their Ether held in the staking contract. Even after Shapella, Lido users couldn\u2019t withdraw their ETH because Lido\u2019s software did not have a withdrawal function. But on May 15, the Lido decentralized autonomous organization voted to upgrade Lido to version two, allowing withdrawals for the first time.\n\nRelated: New Cosmos chain will use liquid staking coins for security\n\nData from Parsec shows that it took about an hour for stakers to realize that they could withdraw. The first hour of withdrawals produced around 4 ETH ($7,308) worth of redemptions of stETH. But the following hour, redemptions swelled to approximately 227 ETH ($414,956). The pace of redemptions fell the following hour to around 44 ETH ($80,388). Over $500,000 worth of ETH was withdrawn in the first three hours of withdrawals being enabled.\n\nETH withdrawals on Lido. Source: Parsec\n\nLiquid staking solutions have gained in popularity since the Shapella upgrade. On May 1, liquid staking became the top decentralized finance category in terms of total value locked, surpassing even decentralized exchanges, according to DefiLlama. However, there are still some legal questions around liquid staking in the United States, as the Securities and Exchange Commission has recently stated that it may see staking providers as securities issuers."

        "content": "There have never been more validators securing the Ethereum blockchain than now.\n\nAlmost 50,000 new validators are waiting to enter the active validator set on Ethereum.\n\nETH staking rewards are nearing double digits.\n\nThe Ethereum Shapella upgrade was thought to become a bearish event for the price of ETH. That\u2019s because it unlocked billions worth of ETH and allowed validators to exit.\n\nHowever, this hasn\u2019t happened. In fact, the number of validators wanting to start validating has just hit a new all-time high as staking APR continues to grow.\n\nETH Validators Hit All-Time High\n\nValidators wanting to enter the active validator set on the Ethereum blockchain have continually grown over the past week or so.\n\nAccording to data from beaconcha.in, there are now 571,695 active validators validating transactions on Ethereum. This is essentially a new all-time high of active validators.\n\nETH validator data. Source: beaconcha.in.\n\nThe number is poised to grow. beaconcha. also reports that over 49,000 new validators are waiting to enter the program. In comparison, only one is waiting to exit.\n\nThe validator growth might be linked to the ETH staking rewards that have increased significantly in the past weeks.\n\nETH Staking APR Continues to Grow\n\nValidators have been flocking to stake their ETH and validate transactions to receive staking rewards, which have recently increased exponentially.\n\nAccording to data from TokenUnlocks, ETH staking APR is currently 8.73%. That\u2019s what individual validators are presently receiving.\n\nETH staking APR. Source: TokenUnlocks.\n\nAs for stakers who stake with liquid staking derivatives (LSD) protocols, the APR is a bit lower. For example, Lido, the most popular LSD protocol, currently offers 6.4% ETH rewards.\n\nRocket Pool, the second largest decentralized staking service, offers 5.17% ETH rewards.\n\nETH is currently trading at $1,828, according to data from CoinGecko. It\u2019s up 1.6% in the past 24 hours.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nLido has yet to enable stETH:ETH withdrawals. Once they\u2019re enabled, the total number of validators might drop, even if for a moment.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nA large number of validators and node runners increase the security of a blockchain.

        "content": "GM. This is Milk Road, the telescope of crypto news. Our updates can help give you a clearer view of the digital currency world.\n\nHere\u2019s what we got for you today:\n\nWtf is an ERC721-C? \ud83e\uddd0\n\nETH staking returns highest since Shapella\ud83e\udef0\n\nFrom $0 \u2192 $7M in one weekend \ud83d\udcc8\n\nBinance is leaving Canada \ud83c\udf6a\n\nPrices as of 8am EDT\n\nToday\u2019s edition is brought to you by Origin Protocol, whose newest offering OETH is changing up the ETH staking game and bringing user\u2019s additional yield.\n\nWHAT\u2019S AN ERC721-C? \ud83e\uddd0\n\nLook, we like cartoon jpegs as much as the next person.\n\nBut there\u2019s 1 pesky problem with the NFT world: royalties. They\u2019re the extra fees (5-10%) you pay on marketplaces like OpenSea when you buy an NFT.\n\nThe upside: the NFT artist gets paid (woo!)\n\nThe downside: more fees = NFT traders get less money (boo!)\n\nThat\u2019s where ERC721-C comes in.\n\nIt\u2019s the new remix to the ERC721 standard for Ethereum-based NFTs. It\u2019s designed to help NFT artists earn more royalties from their work (the \u201cC\u201d stands for \u201cCreator.\u201d)\n\nHere\u2019s how:\n\nProgrammable royalties. Creators can distribute NFT collection royalties directly to holders that buy their NFTs?\n\nOpenSea/Blur can\u2019t set royalties to 0%. Marketplaces will do this to compete against each other, even though that means creators don\u2019t get paid. Tsk tsk\n\nSo\u2026what next? Well, first an NFT collection needs to actually start using this \u2013 no one really has yet.\n\nBut this is a pretty cool way to implement royalties (more $$ for creators), while also benefiting traders (creators can share royalties with buyers).\n\nWanna read more? Check out our Milk Road Guide to ERC721-C below.\n\nEver since Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai Upgrade, liquid staking has been the talk of the town. The battle between providers has been fierce.\n\nAnd now, a new challenger has entered the arena. And it\u2019s not just any contender, it\u2019s the veteran DeFi protocol, Origin Protocol.\n\nThey just launched Origin Ether (OETH) \u2013 an innovative approach to staking your ether to earn that juicy yield.\n\nHere\u2019s the breakdown:\n\nIt aggregates yield across liquid staking derivatives such as Lido, Rocketpool and Frax\n\nIn addition to earning rewards from only staking, OETH earns significantly higher APY by providing liquidity in DeFi\n\nYield is provided passively so you don\u2019t have to pay any gas fees\n\nAnd they\u2019re serious about security. The protocol is audited by OpenZeppelin, the same folks that audit Coinbase, The Ethereum Foundation, and Aave.\n\nStart earning yield on your Ether with OETH today, or boost the yield from your stETH, rETH, or frxETH by depositing them with Origin!\n\nETH\u2019S STAKING RETURNS ARE HIGHEST SINCE SHAPELLA \ud83e\udef0\n\nEthereum stakers are earning BANK. That\u2019s because the annualized rate of return just hit a whopping\u2026 *checks notes*\u2026. 8.76%.\n\nThis is the yearly return for staking ETH to help validate transactions on the network.\n\nThat\u2019s the highest it\u2019s been since the network\u2019s Shapella update. AKA when Ethereum started letting people unstake their holdings.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f The current annualized rate of return for #ETH staking stands at 8.6%, which is a historical peak. Since the Shanghai upgrade, ETH2.0 contracts have seen 3.4 million $ETH deposits and 2.67 million ETH withdrawals, resulting in a net pledge of 734.92k ETH (worth $1.4\u2026 https://t.co/8gtcBRtlio https://t.co/mJjRBBNzFp \u2014 BecauseBitcoin.com (@BecauseBitcoin)\n\nMay 15, 2023\n\nSo what? This is good! More staking & returns = more people are confident in the Ethereum network.\n\nThere\u2019s one caveat though\u2026\n\nThe line to stake ETH is longer than 7/11\u2019s free slurpee line on July 11 every year.\n\nAt the moment, there are about 50K validators waiting in line. And you\u2019ll have to wait about a month to become an Ethereum validator and start earning yield. Womp womp\n\nEthereum\u2019s quite literally the coolest kid on the block right now.\n\nFROM $0 \u2192 ~$7M IN ONE WEEKEND \ud83d\udcc8\n\nWow, do we have a story for you. It involves an NFT personality (ben.eth), two trending meme coins and $6.9M\u2026\n\nBuckle up, Roadies. Here\u2019s the story in 5 parts:\n\nPART 1: CREATE A SH*TCOIN\n\nOne cool thing about sh*tcoins is they don\u2019t do anything, so you can name them whatever you want. In this case, ben.eth took the easy route and named his after himself, $BEN.\n\nPART 2: LAUNCH SH*TCOIN WITH A PRESALE\n\nben.eth didn\u2019t go the traditional presale route, he started collecting ETH directly to his wallet. He was able to raise 55 ETH from over 300 contributors \u2013 around $100K at the time.\n\nPART 3: GIVE AWAY OWNERSHIP TO YOUTUBER\n\n$BEN was on a fast track to 0 until another Ben jumped in to save the day. An unlikely \u201chero\u201d who seems to always find himself in the midst of Twitter controversies.\n\nThe infamous Bitboy Crypto.\n\nGuys $BEN is live. People all want to invest in themselves and now Bens can do that. The facts:\n\n\u2013 The coin has my name\n\n\u2013 We have a Ben DAO on telegram\n\n\u2013 Bens are better than Jeffs so we should easily take over JeffCoin as the number one name on the blockchain \u2014 Ben Armstrong (@Bitboy_Crypto)\n\nMay 8, 2023\n\nWhile he joined as a team member, he ended up taking over the whole damn thing a day later. A classic case of the student becoming the teacher.\n\nAnd even though ben.eth abandoned his prized creation within 72 hours, Bitboy\u2019s tweets were enough to pump the price more than 10x in a day.\n\nHUGE $BEN Announcement I did not launch the project. But I am now taking it over 100%. @eth_ben and I have agreed in principle to an agreement where all of the assets and liquidity for @bencoin_eth will be transferred to me within a week. @eth_ben will become an advisor. \u2014 Ben Armstrong (@Bitboy_Crypto)\n\nMay 11, 2023\n\nPART 4: ANNOUNCE A NEW SH*TCOIN\n\nSo what do you do when a Youtuber buys out your sh*tcoin right after launch? You create another one.\n\nben.eth called it $PSYOP.\n\nTwitter\n\nWithin an hour he had already raised $1M. And at the end of the presale, his wallet was holding ~$6.9M (nice).\n\nPART 5: REPEAT STEPS 1 AND STEP 2\n\nAnd steps 3 and 4, if you\u2019re lucky enough to come across someone as passionate about their name as Ben Armstrong is.\n\nThe craziest part of all this? People don\u2019t care know about what they are buying. And some were sending over multiple ETH. As of writing, $PSYOP hasn\u2019t even launched.\n\nSo what? This says a lot about the current crypto landscape.\n\nWhile we wait for true value to be created and adoption to continue, the space is dominated by attention and FOMO.\n\nMILK & COOKIES \ud83c\udf6a\n\nNFTfi just launched a brand-new phase in their popular loyalty program. In EARN SEASON 1 you can earn exclusive, non-transferable reward points for NFT borrowing/lending on their platform. (Sponsored)\n\nBinance leaves Canada amid increased regulation.

        "content": "Litecoin momentum is potentially changing, network usage is skyrocketing, and the cryptocurrency\u2019s halving is ahead.\n\nYet the asset remains drastically undervalued relative to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other factors. Here is a closer look at why Litecoin could be the most undervalued asset in crypto.\n\nLTC Vs BTC Vs ETH Compared\n\nLitecoin was once a top ten or higher cryptocurrency that has since fallen from that lofty pedestal. A nine-month-long up-only bull run and more than 10,000% ROI left the coin ranging for going on its fifth full year.\n\nUnlike other top coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, LTC never made dramatic new all-time highs in 2021. On some exchanges, the record high is still set for 2017. After the 2017 bull market peak, Litecoin has lagged behind the two largest coins by market cap.\n\nBut this is common in the final stages of a bull market, after which Litecoin wildly outperforms both BTC and ETH in a flash. That sort of situation could return, according to the charts below, starting with the below comparison of LTC versus Bitcoin and Ether.\n\nLTC is drastically underperforming BTC and ETH | LTCUSD on TradingView.com\n\nCrypto Market Moment Ready To Change\n\nAnother sign that LTC is due to outperform the market can be found in the one-month LMACD crossing bullish. The signal is at least a two months ahead of Bitcoin and Ether and suggests a larger move in Litecoin first.\n\nAccording to Investopedia, momentum \u201crefers to the inertia of a price trend to continue either rising or falling for a particular length of time.\u201d The LMACD is a momentum measuring tool, and it could be indicating that Litecoin\u2019s inertia just made a major swing in the positive direction.\n\nThe LMACD has crossed bullish on only one of these charts | LTCUSD on TradingView.com\n\nLitecoin Elliott Wave And The Final Advance\n\nLitecoin technicals, according to Elliott Wave Principle, could also point to much higher prices. The current wave count and Fibonacci retracement levels are characteristic of an expanding diagonal pattern.\n\nThese patterns appear at the beginning or the end of a motive wave. Considering the larger wave count, this would suggest an ending expanding diagonal and perhaps the last major rally in Litecoin in some time.\n\nIs this an ending diagonal pattern? | LTCUSD on TradingView.com\n\nLTC Fundamentals Support Soaring Higher\n\nFinally, LTC transactions are currently skyrocketing. From a fundamental perspective, this is as bullish as it gets for any cryptocurrency. Litecoin is benefiting from an explosion of ordinals on the LTC-20 standard, congestion on Bitcoin and Ethereum, and more.\n\nNetwork transactions are off the charts | LTCUSD on TradingView.com\n\nEssentially, the Litecoin ecosystem is booming again. When network usage skyrockets, LTCUSD spikes in price. We also have yet to mention Litecoin\u2019s halving, which is less than 80 days away.\n\nA mega thread \ud83e\uddf5on why I am more bullish on #Litecoin than any other asset in the space starting with what I believe is cyclical perfection using Hurst Cyclical theory Internal 1/3 harmonics match up with a larger cycle, which also has 1/3 harmonics I see the grand finale next pic.twitter.com/cAh5CrnlUZ \u2014 Tony \"The Bull\" (@tonythebullBTC) May 16, 2023\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

The seamless integration of cutting-edge AI technology into the dynamic cryptocurrency industry holds the promising potential to catapult both domains to remarkable heights of innovation and success.\n\nAI-powered trading bots could be armed with machine learning algorithms that analyse vast amounts of data, make lightning-fast decisions, and execute trades with precision. But there's one potential feature of AI that could be a great help to investors - predictive analysis. AI algorithms can crunch historical data, market analysis, and a multitude of other variables to forecast crypto trends and price movements. Cryptocurrencies are notoriously volatile and unpredictable, but these AI-powered crystal balls can provide valuable insights for traders, investors, and enthusiasts alike. In this article, we'll look at what the popular AI chatbot ChatGPT has to say about two well-performing cryptocurrencies \u2014 Solana (SOL) and PAT WARS (PAWS).\n\nHindustan Times - your fastest source for breaking news! Read now.\n\nCan ChatGPT Predict the Future of Solana (SOL)?\n\nSolana is an open-source, decentralised finance (DeFi) project\n\nThe author of this article asked ChatGPT what lies ahead for Solana (SOL). In their own words, the results were intriguing.\n\nIn recent months, Solana experienced some turbulent times, facing unexpected outages that tested the patience of its users and raised concerns about the platform's stability. Investor confidence took a hit as questions arose regarding the network's resilience and ability to handle growing demand. The author asked a jailbroken version of ChatGPT what it makes of Solana and if it can recover after its recent setbacks. The chatbot seemed optimistic, thinking Solana to be the Ethereum killer. \"Solana is faster and more efficient than Ethereum, with lower transaction fees, higher transaction throughput, and better scalability,\" it says.\n\nSolana is an open-source, decentralised finance (DeFi) project, born from the fertile minds of visionaries in 2017 and sprouted in March 2020. With its headquarters nestled in the enchanting city of Geneva, Switzerland, Solana harnesses the boundless potential of blockchain's permissionless nature to deliver high-functioning DeFi solutions.\n\nCan ChatGPT Predict the Future of New Coins Like PAT WARS (PAWS)?\n\nPAWS has just launched its presale\n\nPAT WARS (PAWS) combines two unlikely forces - cat memes and Star Wars. PAWS has just launched its presale, but could ChatGPT predict its future based on the journey of other meme coins?\n\nI fed ChatGPT information about PAT WARS, including its strong community focus, its NFT collection featuring its four Jedi cats, its native token PAWS, and its plans to explore the gaming and DeFi spaces. The chatbot acknowledged that predicting the future of cryptocurrency is challenging, but it provided some potential scenarios for the future of PAT WARS.\n\nChatGPT thinks PAWS\u2019 value could increase if it delivers on its promises to build a strong and vibrant community. \"Increased demand, limited token supply, and successful marketing efforts could contribute to its growth. Additionally, if the project explores and executes successful ventures in gaming and DeFi, it could attract further interest and potentially increase the value of PAWS,\" it says.\n\nHowever, the chatbot acknowledges the crypto market is highly volatile and unpredictable. \"Many meme coins experience initial excitement during their presale or launch but struggle to maintain momentum in the long run.\"\n\nAI is reshaping the landscape of decentralised platforms, and it will be interesting to see where the technology goes from here.\n\nFind out more about PAT WARS (PAWS):\n\nWebsite:https://www.patwars.com\n\nTwitter:https://twitter.com/PATWARSOfficial\n\nTelegram:https://t.me/PATWARSOfficial\n\nDisclaimer: This article is a paid publication and does not have journalistic/ editorial involvement of Hindustan Times.

        "title": "Crypto Week Ahead: BTC, ETH Show Weak Stance As Binance Exits Canada. New Twitter CEO Linda Yaccarino Could Be A Crypto Ally - ABP Live",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), two of the most popular cryptocurrencies, managed to become stable within the $27,000 and $1,800 range, respectlvely, after weeks of slump. They still have some ways to go and need to pick up steam in order to achieve the positive marks of over $28,000 and $1,900, respectively. Binance, the world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange in terms of trading, has taken a stance against Canada\u2019s new crypto regulations and has decided to exit the country entirely, which could lead to a blow to crypto prices in the coming day. However, the soon-to-be Twitter CEO Linda Yaccarino could prove to be a crypto ally. Read on to find out more.\n\nBefore we proceed further, readers should note that the overall crypto market and coin prices are extremely volatile in nature. There are no foolproof methods to ascertain how cryptocurrencies are expected to behave in the future. This article is aimed at helping investors stay on top of the current market scenarios and the biggest events that have already taken place as well as some upcoming occurrences that are worth noting. Investors are advised to do their own research before taking any call.\n\nCrypto Prices Over The Past Week\n\nLast Monday (May 8), the overall crypto market cap stood at $1.16 trillion. BTC price stood at around $28,210, ETH price stood at around $1,865.\n\nA week later, the overall market cap dipped down to $1.14 trillion, as per CoinMarketCap data.\n\nCheck Out Top Crypto Prices Today\n\nDeFi's total volume stands at $1.65 billion, at 6.31 percent of the total market 24-hour volume. In case of stablecoins, the overall volume stands at $23.09 billion, at 88.42 percent of the total 24-hour market volume.\n\nBTC dominance, at the time of writing, stood at 46.45 percent.\n\nOver the past seven days, Bitcoin achieved a high of $28,299.16 (on May 10) and a low of $25,964.88 (May 13), showing signs of a relatively weak run.\n\nEthereum, on the other hand, saw a high of $1,879.84 (May 10) and a low of $1,746.31 (May 12).\n\nCrypto Events To Note\n\nPepe (PEPE), the memecoin that got listed on Binance earlier this month, continues to see a decline in prices, remaining the top loser of the day as per CoinMarketCap (as on May 15).\n\nIn a major development, Binance has announced that it will stop operations in Canada. This was an outcome of the country\u2019s regulatory guidelines on investor limits and stablecoins. The exchange are clearly not happy with the new rules, indicating that they have made the Canadian market unsustainable.\n\nBinance CEO Changpeng Zhao, on the other hand, is looking to offload a part of his stake in the company and is actively looking at strategies to do so, as per reports.\n\nIn a bit of good news amid the overall gloomy weather, Twitter\u2019s soon-to-be new CEO Linda Yaccarino was spotted following the Shiba Inu (SHIB) account on the microblogging platform. Could this signal adoption of crypto on the platform later on? We\u2019ll have to wait and find out.\n\nWhat Crypto Traders Are Saying About Current Market Scenario\n\nMudrex co-founder and CEO Edul Patel told ABP Live, \u201cBitcoin has seen a slight recovery, gaining over 1 percent in the last 24 hours, following a few days of a downward trend. Despite being down 60 percent since its all-time high, the cryptocurrency has made significant gains, nearly 98 percent, since its lowest cycle in January. To initiate a decent increase in the near term, Bitcoin needs to surpass the $27,400 resistance level. However, if it fails to do so, it might experience another decline towards the $27,000 level.\u201d\n\nWazirX Vice President Rajagopal Menon offered his take, \u201cDespite midweek growth on lower-than-expected inflation readings, Bitcoin and Ethereum faced moderate losses over the last seven days. However, BTC pulled back amid competition from a rising dollar, hitting a two-month low.\u201d\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

        "title": "IoTeX community votes massively in favor of bridging its token to Ethereum - CryptoDaily",
        "content": "In a significant development for the blockchain industry, IoTeX's community has overwhelmingly voted in favor of Improvement Protocol 21 (IIP-21), paving the way for bridging IOTX, the native coin of the IoTeX network, to Ethereum.\n\nThe proposal received overwhelming support from the IoTeX community, with a final tally of 306 million IOTX (73.77%) voting in favor of the bridge, while 109 million IOTX (26.23%) opposed the proposal.\n\nA total of 334 wallets participated in the vote, whose successful outcome reflects the community's enthusiasm for expanding the utility and reach of IOTX through cross-chain interoperability.\n\nEnormous potential for Ethereum and IoTeX\n\nBlockchain bridges have gained increasing attention as they offer numerous benefits to the blockchain ecosystem. By enabling tokens to move seamlessly between different blockchains, bridges address scalability challenges, reduce network congestion, and enhance user experiences.\n\n\u201cOne of the primary motivations behind IIP-21 is to leverage Ethereum's robust DeFi ecosystem, increase IoTeX token liquidity within Ethereum, and build a vibrant developer and user community,\u201d said IoTeX CEO and Co-Founder Raullen Chai. \u201cThe proposed bridge between IoTeX and Ethereum holds immense potential for both platforms and the broader blockchain community,\u201d he added.\n\nPresently, IOTX exists on the IoTeX network and is bridged to Binance Smart Chain and Polygon.\n\nAddressing limitations\n\nHowever, the legacy ERC-20 version of IOTX on Ethereum, known as IOTX-E, has limited supply and circulation, restricting its usage in DeFi protocols and availability on major centralized exchanges.\n\nThe proposal aims to address these limitations by implementing CIOTX (Cross Chain IOTX), a wrapped version of IOTX on the Ethereum blockchain. CIOTX will be fully backed by the circulating IOTX on IoTeX, ensuring a sufficient supply for utilization in any Ethereum-based DeFi application and circulation on centralized exchanges.\n\nThis strategic move enables IoTeX to tap into the thriving DeFi ecosystem on Ethereum, including on popular protocols like Uniswap, Curve, Aave, and Compound.\n\nSeamless token swapping\n\nIntroducing CIOTX on Ethereum will facilitate the seamless swapping of tokens between CIOTX and IOTX-E. By listing CIOTX alongside IOTX-E on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap and Curve, users can exchange the two tokens at market prices, with the market determining their respective values based on demand. This feature enhances liquidity and provides greater flexibility for users in managing their IOTX assets.\n\nThe benefits of blockchain bridges extend beyond IoTeX and Ethereum. With IoTeX diverting some network traffic away from Ethereum, the bridge helps alleviate congestion and scalability challenges the Ethereum network faces. By dispersing transactions to other less congested blockchains, bridges contribute to the overall improvement of blockchain scalability and user experience.\n\nA fantastic step forward\n\nThe successful passage of IIP-21 signifies a significant step forward for IoTeX and the broader blockchain community. With the bridging of IOTX to Ethereum and the introduction of CIOTX, IoTeX aims to create a comprehensive ecosystem of IOTX-backed tokens that can be utilized across multiple blockchains.\n\nThis integration of IoTeX and Ethereum opens new possibilities for DeFi applications, enhancing the utility and value of IOTX while promoting interoperability within the blockchain landscape.\n\nAs the blockchain industry continues to evolve, bridges like the one proposed in IIP-21 play a crucial role in unlocking the full potential of different blockchain platforms. By enabling seamless token transfers, bridges enhance scalability, reduce congestion, and foster collaboration between blockchain ecosystems, ultimately driving innovation and adoption in the decentralized finance space.\n\nLeveraging IoTeX\u2019s speed and efficiency\n\nWith the bridging of IOTX to Ethereum, businesses can now explore the possibility of enabling instant payments using IOTX or CIOTX tokens, leveraging the speed and efficiency of the IoTeX network while benefiting from Ethereum's vast user base and DeFi infrastructure.\n\nThe successful implementation of IIP-21 and bridging IOTX to Ethereum represent a significant milestone in the blockchain industry. As blockchain bridges continue to gain prominence, we expect to witness the emergence of new use cases and innovative applications across various sectors, ultimately driving the widespread adoption of blockchain technology and fostering a more interconnected and efficient decentralized ecosystem.\n\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Court filings by the U.S. SEC claim that Jump Trading entered a secret deal with Do Kwon in 2021.\n\nJump Trading allegedly propped up Terraform Labs\u2019 TerraUSD stablecoin a year before it collapsed.\n\nThe deal allowed TerraUSD to regain its dollar peg in 2021 in exchange for a discount on Luna purchases by Jump.\n\nChicago-based Jump Trading is once again in the crosshairs of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as recent court filings by the securities regulator highlight a secret deal between the high-frequency trading firm and the now defunct Terraform Labs involving the latter\u2019s TerraUSD stablecoin.\n\nJump Trading Made Over $1 Billion After Secret Deal With Do Kwon\n\nAccording to a report by the Wall Street Journal, recent court filings made by the SEC as part of its ongoing fraud lawsuit against Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon confirmed that Jump Trading was the unnamed U.S. trading firm that was listed in the initial complaint. The complaint alleged that when the TerraUSD stablecoin lost its peg to the US Dollar in May 2021, Kwon and Terraform Labs entered into a secret deal with Jump Trading to prop up its price. As per said deal, Jump purchased large amounts of TerraUSD which drove up the stablecoin\u2019s price and helped it regain its peg.\n\nIn exchange for helping restore TerraUSD\u2019s peg, Terraform Labs allowed Jump to buy its Luna token at 30, 40, and 50 cents over the next three years. The agreed-upon price allowed Jump Trading to scoop up Luna tokens at a massive discount, which ultimately netted more than $1 billion for the trading firm. Reports of Jump\u2019s involvement with Terraform Labs\u2019 started circulating earlier this year after the SEC filed charges against Do Kwon and his crypto firm.\n\nJump Trading\u2019s role in helping TerraUSD regain its dollar pegs contradicts the claims made by Do Kwon about the stablecoin\u2019s self-healing capability. The SEC has accused Kwon of making misleading statements about the capabilities of the stablecoin\u2019s underlying algorithm while keeping investors in the dark about secret deals that actually propped up TerraUSD. As of now, Jump Trading has not been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with the stablecoin or Terraform Labs\u2019 collapse in May last year."

        "content": "Why Shapella looks like a game changer for Ethereum\n\nDr Sreejith Das\n\nby Dr Sreejith Das, CEO and co-founder of Attestant\n\nAnalysts were evenly divided in the run up to the Shapella on April 12, and many thought that the ability to withdraw staked Ether for the first time in years would put downward pressure on the price.\n\nHowever, Ether went up for a period before retreating to where it was before the upgrade.\n\nIn terms of active validators staking in the network, we saw an initial reduction of nearly 3,000 validators, and a further 11,000 currently waiting to exit, but this has been more than offset by the 16,000 new validators waiting to enter.\n\nRather than a predicted reduction in the number of validators staking, we have seen the appetite for staking remain remarkably stable. It would however be a mistake to assume that now the Shapella upgrade has been successfully completed things will carry on as they have been.\n\nFor the first time ever, it is now possible to unstake Ether and get back the original stake.\n\nWhy is this so important? Before now, staking Ether was like buying a bond that didn\u2019t pay coupons, can\u2019t be resold, and had no maturity date. Not an attractive proposition to an institutional investor!\n\nWith the ability to un-stake successfully implemented, it opens up the asset class to a wider range of new investors that were prevented from staking Ether by their disciplined risk management.\n\nThese new investors can choose to run staking software in-house, stake custodially, or use a non-custodial staking service and enjoy all the benefits of the staking return without giving up ownership of their assets and be confident they will get their Ether back on demand.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that there aren\u2019t some unanswered questions for risk managers and compliance officers at institutional investment firms. Highly regulated institutional investors face challenges when reporting, assessing the jurisdiction, tax status and accounting for staking profits and losses.\n\nThe Shapella upgrade does however remove one major obstacle in that institutions can prove that they can retain custody of their funds and withdraw when they see fit.\n\nThis point has become particularly salient in light of the centralized lending platform collapses that took place in 2022.\n\nNo pension fund trustee would entrust their funds with a bunch of fresh-faced Millennials who have little financial experience or understanding of compliance. However, if they can manage the investment process, any questions related to risk management end.\n\nShapella marks a turning point for institutional investors (that manage trillions of dollars worth of assets), allowing them to earn a return where they couldn\u2019t before.\n\nIn an era of increasing inflation, more limited access to credit and considerable macro-economic uncertainties, the need for greater diversification and strong returns make digital assets an attractive choice.\n\nResearch from Boston Consulting Group estimates the tokenization of global illiquid assets to be a 16 trillion dollar business opportunity by 2030. There\u2019ll be no shortage of new and exciting digital assets to invest in, and any well-constructed portfolio will contain a mix of both high risk and low risk investments.\n\nIn order to help facilitate the shift of institutional money to Ethereum, developers should take note of what investors need. They want access points to gain exposure to digital assets, they want a variety of products with varying levels of risk and returns that currently don\u2019t exist or are very limited.\n\nIt is clear that the digital asset industry will have to step up its service offering if it\u2019s to evolve into the future of finance, and developers should look to structure new products aimed at institutional investors that acknowledge concerns they might have related to fraud and volatility.\n\nThe Shapella upgrade may have passed without much fanfare, but we might look back in the future and recognise this as being the pivotal moment when the cryptocurrency industry matured and answered long-held compliance issues from institutional investors.\n\nDigital assets have come a long way in the last decade from being a fringe movement on the sidelines of finance to a multi-trillion dollar asset class, the next decade will see this industry continue to grow and gain the legitimacy of institutional investment."

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum face challenges, Liechtenstein embraces BTC, and Tether reports huge profit\n\nData from CryptoCompare shows that the price of the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) started the week on a downward trend, moving from around $28,000 to a low of roughly $26,500, before it started to recover. BTC is now changing hands at $27,400.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Ether, the second-largest digital currency by market capitalization, moved in a similar way with a downward movement from $1,850 to less than $1,750, before a recovery started to take it to the $1,830 mark.\n\nHeadlines in the cryptocurrency space this week varied, with some of the most significant surrounding congestion on the Bitcoin blockchain and glitches on the Ethereum network. Bitcoin\u2019s congestion, partly driven by the growing popularity of its non-fungible tokens (NFTs) Ordinals, saw leading exchange Binance briefly halt BTC withdrawals before adjusting withdrawal fees.\n\nWe've temporarily closed #BTC withdrawals due to the large volume of pending transactions.\n\n\n\nOur team is currently working on a fix and will reopen $BTC withdrawals as soon as possible.\n\n\n\nRest assured, funds are SAFU. May 8, 2023\n\nThe exchange revealed at the time it will keep on monitoring on-chain activity and \u201cadjust accordingly if needed.\u201d It also added it\u2019s working on enabling BTC Lightning Network withdrawals, which would alleviate such situations in the future.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s congestion comes at a time when liquidity has seemingly started dropping. According to CCData\u2019s Order Book data, Bitcoin\u2019s capacity to accommodate sizable orders without substantial price fluctuations has diminished since 2023.\n\nPer the data, the amount of BTC needed to change the price by 1% dropped from 1,400 ($23 million) in January to 462 ($13 million) in April.\n\nWhile Bitcoin suffered from congestion, an unexpected disruption occurred on Ethereum that saw the network become temporarily unable to fully authenticate transactions. The hiccup only lasted 25 minutes and while blocks were being proposed, they were not being finalized.\n\nParticipants using the blockchain noticed that their transactions were seemingly processing as usual, but during the 25-minute stretch of irregularity, these transactions were susceptible to being altered because of the malfunction.\n\nLiechtenstein to accept Bitcoin for state services\n\nLiechtenstein\u2019s Prime Minister and Finance Minister Daniel Risc has revealed that the country will soon allow Bitcoin payments for state services, which will be instantly converted to Swiss francs, its official currency.\n\nHe also expressed interest in investing some of the state\u2019s reserves, which amount to 2.23 billion francs (about $2.51 billion), in cryptoassets in the future. The country, which has no debt, saves three times its annual budget of 900 million francs (around $1 billion) and invests it in securities.\n\nMeanwhile, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) National Security Division is said to be investigating cryptocurrency exchange Binance for allegedly allowing Russians to use its platform in violation of US sanctions.\n\nThe company and its executives have not been accused of anything related to the investigation, which is part of a national security probe and a criminal division investigation. Binance restricted its services in Russia after sanctions were imposed on the country in April 2022.\n\nHowever, according to a company executive, the exchange continued operations, blocking only certain areas of Ukraine no longer under government control and servicing non-sanctioned individuals.\n\nThe investigation comes at a time in which Binance has seen its spot trading volume suffer a 48% fall last month, marking the second consecutive month of declines for the cryptocurrency trading platform.\n\nAccording to CCData\u2019s latest Exchange Review report, Binance\u2019s trading volume dropped to $287 billion last month, recording its second-lowest monthly trading volume since 2021\n\nOver the week two of the world\u2019s top market-making firms, Jane Street Group and Jump Crypto, have also chosen to scale down their cryptocurrency trading operations in the United States as regulators crack down on the industry.\n\nJane Street has been in the crypto market since 2017 while Jump Crypto, the crypto division of Jump Trading, is shrinking its US presence while growing its operations abroad. Both firms still operate as market makers on a smaller scale, and haven\u2019t completely stopped their crypto activities.\n\nNotably, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a formidable force in American corporate advocacy, has taken up arms for digital asset industry players who have been vocally critical of U.S. regulatory approaches.\n\nThe Chamber has thrown its considerable weight behind the legal challenge brought against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by Coinbase, which came as Coinbase asks the SEC to clarify its rules for the industry.\n\nTether reports $1.5 billion profit\n\nLeading stablecoin issuer Tether has recently disclosed a Q1 net profit of $1.5 billion, a figure that more than doubles its 2022 performance from the same period. As of May 9, the company\u2019s consolidated total assets were approximately $81.8 billion, while its consolidated liabilities amounted to $79.4 billion.\n\nIn a groundbreaking step, Tether, the entity responsible for USDT, has expanded its reserves report to include new categories. This marks the first instance of the company openly declaring its investment in bitcoin, physical gold, overnight repo, and corporate bonds.\n\nThe disclosed holdings include $1.5 billion in bitcoin and a substantial $3.3 billion in precious metals, which are likely being used to back Tether\u2019s gold-backed cryptocurrency, Tether Gold (XAUT).\n\nWhile Tether is reporting significant profits, crypto exchange Bittrex filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the District of Delaware. The exchange estimated it had more than 100,000 creditors, between $500 million and $1 billion in assets, and between $500 million and $1 billion in liabilities.\n\nFrancisco Memoria is a content creator at CryptoCompare who\u2019s in love with technology and focuses on helping people see the value digital currencies have.

        "content": "Since the crypto market has started to give bullish signals, whales have become active too. The presale of Tradecurve has become the biggest recipient of whales\u2019 investments. Experts are confident that Tradecurve will become a blue-chip project in 2023, therefore many investors want to join the project from its presale phase to maximize their benefits. Meanwhile, projects like THE Protocol (THE) and Ethereum (ETH) have struggled to grab the attention of investors.\n\nTHE Protocol (THE) Collabs For Charitable Cause\n\nThe crypto market has seen a flurry of meme coins lately, with THE Protocol (THE) being one of them. But in the absence of any strong fundamentals and use cases, THE Protocol (THE) has failed to grow. The value of THE Protocol (THE) has plummeted by more than 65% in the past month. Hence, THE Protocol (THE) is currently trading at $0.000545. However, THE Protocol (THE) tried to become different from other meme coins by launching THE Charity Protocol. The collaboration between THE Protocol (THE) and THE Charity Protocol aims to harness the benefits of Web3 to support charitable causes. With this partnership, THE Protocol (THE) helps donors contribute to a range of charitable initiatives.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Network Suffers Challenges\n\nEthereum (ETH) network recently suffered transaction finality challenges for two consecutive days. While the Ethereum (ETH) network first malfunctioned on May 11 for about 25 minutes, it again faulted on May 12 for more than an hour. However, the Ethereum (ETH) network did not suffer a total outage, and only the block-finalizing process was hampered.

        "content": "After the major upgrade to the Ethereum (ETH) ecosystem launched in mid-April that enabled investors to withdraw their staked ETH, the staking returns on the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap have reached record highs.\n\nIndeed, the Ethereum staking annualized rate of return, or the interest rate for running an ETH validator, at press time, stood at 8.76%, which is a historical high since the Shanghai update introduced staking withdrawals, according to the latest data retrieved from analytics platform Token Unlocks on May 15.\n\nSpecifically, since the implementation of unstaking on the Ethereum network, investors have deposited 3.44 million ETH into ETH 2.0 contracts, whereas they have withdrawn 2.67 million ETH at a net pledge of 770.70k ETH (worth around $1.41 billion), as the recent information shows.\n\nHistorical Ethereum statistics. Source: TokenUnlocks\n\nAlso called \u2018Shapella,\u2019 the recent development on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain has not only allowed the unlocking of billions worth of ETH but has also promised to bring about other positive aspects, such as the dropping the gas fees for developers on the platform, in an aim to make it more scalable and efficient.\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nAs things stand, Ethereum is currently changing hands at the price of $1,827.92, up 1.37% in the last 24 hours, as it tries to reverse the losses of 1.50% over the previous seven days and of 13.38% during the past month, according to the data from May 15.\n\nEthereum 24-hour price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nWith the most recent results, the crypto market seems to be trying to recover from the losses suffered over the previous weeks and avoid some experts\u2019 bleak estimates of the Ethereum price ending up in the mid-$15,000 area if the decline continues, which Finbold reported on May 12.\n\nAs it happens, it seems that the crypto community\u2019s earlier predictions about the average price of Ethereum standing at $1,834.52 by the end of the month are materializing, and the CoinMarketCap members are currently even more bullish, eyeing $1,835.77 by May 31.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "On May 11th and 12th, the Ethereum network was hit by two separate incidents that caused a significant loss in Finality. According to a recent tweet by Glassnode, over 60% of validators on the network stopped performing their duties during these incidents.\n\nOn May 11th and 12th, the #Ethereum network experienced two occasions where over 60% of the validators stopped performing their duties, causing a loss in Finality.\n\n\n\nFinality refers to the state where a supermajority of validators (2/3 of the total stake) have attested to the\u2026 pic.twitter.com/H13rdYeFPP \u2014 glassnode (@glassnode) May 14, 2023\n\nFinality is a crucial state where a supermajority of validators (2/3 of the total stake) have attested to the final state of the blockchain, ensuring that a block and its processed transactions cannot be altered or removed from the blockchain.\n\nDue to the absence of up to 60% of validators, the Ethereum chain\u2019s performance was impacted, leading to a degradation in performance.\n\nDaily slots of about 3.68% were missed, and 253 blocks were not proposed on time. However, this was still lower than the 658 blocks missed during the Shapella upgrade.\n\nOn a more technical level, some consensus layer clients encountered older attestations and were forced to load up older states for verification, which caused these systems to overheat and malfunction.\n\nNevertheless, some clients did not encounter this issue due to a difference in design approach. Hence, validators running these clients continued to process transactions and produce blocks.\n\nIn both incidents, the affected validators returned online within 20 minutes and an hour, respectively, with the participation rate quickly jumping back to over 98%.\n\nInactivity Leak: A First For Ethereum Network\n\nFortunately, these incidents did not affect end-users on the Ethereum mainnet, and transactions continued to be processed as usual. However, the second incident resulted in the first-ever Inactivity Leak, an emergency state utilized to recover Finality on the Beacon Chain.\n\nAn inactivity Leak is a state where inactive validators are increasingly penalized until they are diluted out of the chain or begin participating once more.\n\nDuring the Inactivity Leak, the amounts subtracted from validators\u2019 beacon chain accounts are effectively burned, resulting in less ETH issuance during that time.\n\nNevertheless, these incidents serve as a reminder of the importance of network security and the need for a reliable and robust validator ecosystem. However, the Ethereum community must continue to take proactive measures to prevent future incidents and ensure the smooth operation of the network.\n\nRelated Reading | Weekly Market Watch: Bitcoin & Ethereum Tumble While Altcoins Struggle To Survive"

        "title": "Ethereum Trader Review - Scam or Legit? - Business 2 Community",
        "content": "Ethereum Trader claims to be a user-friendly platform for people to learn more about trading Ethereum. It boasts a simple user interface, and the signup process of this platform seems to be equally easy to undertake.\n\nDespite those positives, the site\u2019s content focuses more on Ethereum and less on its other offerings. There are also many lesser known online trading platforms that have emerged to be scams. So, is Ethereum Trader a scam or legitimate? This Ethereum Trader review aims to find out.\n\nEthereum Trader Summary Information is key to trading, and the Ethereum Trader website claims to offer investors ample of it. Before we go into reviewing this trading site, here are a few things to know: \ud83d\udca0 Supported Cryptos Ethereum, with some support for BTC and altcoins \ud83d\udca5 Claimed Winrate Not Specified \u2139 Fees None \ud83d\udcb5 Minimum Deposit Not available \ud83d\udcf1 Mobile App Not available \u2013 but the website is responsive \ud83d\udd58 Withdrawal Speed Up to 24 hours \ud83c\udffa Type of Trading Crypto Trading \ud83d\udcde Customer Support Available - but only for registered users Visit Ethereum Trader Cryptocurrencies are unregulated. Trading with unregulated brokers will not qualify for investor protection.\n\nWhat is Ethereum Trader?\n\nEthereum Trader is a crypto trading platform that is said to have been created by those \u201cwho have been studying Ethereum for years\u201d as a way to give others a chance to others to trade in the world\u2019s most popular altcoin.\n\nExtremely light on information, Ethereum Trader is said to be an educational platform, focusing on teaching people about the different intricacies of Ethereum to help them trade better. Many third-party review sites have stated that it sports advanced trading tools that can predict the price of Ethereum to help people trade profitably.\n\nIf that is the case, Ethereum Trader would be similar to a trading robot, which would allow users to engage in hands-free trading without having to actively monitor the market. But not much has been said about this platform beyond that.\n\nAccessing this website is easy as the Sign-up button is readily visible on the front page. And the site has been designed in a way to tell the entire history and the benefits of Ethereum. However, there is not much to find on the platform\u2019s advertising copy.\n\nAt best, the platform is an educational site that informs users about how to trade cryptocurrencies properly, and at worst \u2013 it might be a scam. But we can\u2019t be certain of any of that because of the lack of information prevalent on this site.\n\nWe recommend going your own research and checking out the reviews by yourself before making any investment decisions. And even if the site does facilitate Ethereum trading, remember that ETH remains volatile, considering the recent pullback that pushed it back below the $2k level.\n\nEthereum Trader Pros and Cons\n\nHere are the pros and cons of Ethereum Trader.\n\nPros Primarily supports Ethereum trading\n\nPrimarily supports Ethereum trading Claims to have a host of educational tools\n\nClaims to have a host of educational tools Multiple advanced trading tools are available \u2013 according to the platform\n\nMultiple advanced trading tools are available \u2013 according to the platform Affordable to start an account\n\nAffordable to start an account Has a no-fee approach Cons No detail about the trading tools available\n\nNo detail about the trading tools available Not specific about the minimum amount requirement\n\nNot specific about the minimum amount requirement Doesn\u2019t seem like it has multi-asset support\n\nDoesn\u2019t seem like it has multi-asset support Extremely light on information\n\nHow does Ethereum Trader work?\n\nIt is not clear how Ethereum Trader works since most of the features are possibly locked behind the minimum deposit requirement that you only know once you start creating an account. What we do know, however, is that Ethereum Trader paints itself as an information-focused platform in the same vein as Immediate Granimator.\n\nIt means that after creating an account, users might be able to learn about Ethereum and its prospects when it comes to trading or other things like Dapp development, smart contracts, and more. Furthermore, a lot of information about this platform is outdated since it focuses a lot on Ethereum Mining, written before rollout of the Ethereum Merge.\n\nIt is facts like these that make this platform dubious to many, which makes investing in presale cryptos a better option since they already provide you with ample information and reasons to invest.\n\nThe site does say, however, that you can practice on the \u201cDemo Trading account\u201d before using real money, which also requires a deposit of the minimum requirement.\n\nAn Ethereum Trader mobile app is not available for this platform, as far as the information provided is concerned. But the site is flexible and responsive. All the buttons were interactable, and all icons were visible when we tried out the home page of this site.\n\nThat said, the official website says nothing about cryptocurrencies other than Ethereum, which means that it might only be suited for you if you are an Ethereum trader.\n\nBut since the information here is so little, we recommend weighing all the risks before investing.\n\nEthereum Trader Key Features\n\nListed below are the key features that Ethereum Trader claims to have.\n\nEthereum Trader states that it offers educational tools for those interested in Ethereum trading. These tools are apparently a combination of articles, videos, and other tutorials, and also contain trade secrets that can help users trade successfully.\n\nDemo Trading Account\n\nA demo trading account is helpful for those who are using an unknown platform for crypto trading for the first time since it helps them get the hang of the tools available. Ethereum Trader claims that it offers a \u201cdemo trading account\u201d so users can \u201cpractice, practice, and practice\u201d before trading on the live markets.\n\nEthereum Focused Trading\n\nAs you can guess from the name, Ethereum Trader is only concerned with Ethereum trading. There is no mention of any other assets, and it is also not clear if the platform supports cryptoassets built on the Ethereum blockchain, like Solana. That said, the entire content available on the official platform seems to be only hinting toward Ethereum support.\n\nThat is a disadvantage since it doesn\u2019t allow people to diversify their investments, which is why we recommend checking out new cryptocurrencies that have better upsides than even Ethereum at the moment.\n\nVisit Ethereum Trader\n\nCryptocurrencies are unregulated. Trading with unregulated brokers will not qualify for investor protection.\n\nEthereum Trader Fees\n\nEthereum Trader hasn\u2019t made any specifications about fees, which might not be a bad thing since it is common for other trading bots not to have any starting fees. That said, the fee structure seems dubious at times, especially since there is no mention of a minimum deposit as well.\n\nTrading Fee None Account Fee None Commission None Withdrawal/Deposit Fee None\n\nEthereum Trader Minimum Deposit\n\nPlatforms like Ethereum Trader, even though they do not require any fee, do have a minimum deposit required to activate the account. The same is the case here, but information about the minimum deposit is not available. It is likely that you will hear about it once you create your account, but for now, the details are absent.\n\nEthereum Trader Compatible Devices\n\nWe tested Ethereum Trader on multiple devices, including desktops, laptops, Android, and Apple phones. Our reviewers noted that the official website looks good on all fronts. All the icons were visible to us, the fonts weren\u2019t small, and the sign-up button was interactable.\n\nIs Ethereum Trader a Scam?\n\nWe wanted to check out if Ethereum Trader is a scam or if it is a legitimate platform, to which we don\u2019t have a non-ambiguous answer yet.\n\nEthereum Trader claims to be a legitimate service, and it doesn\u2019t boasts that it has a hands-free trading tool that offers a high win rate. It also is pretty clear about it being an educational platform rather than a tool specific to trading.\n\nHowever, the information available on the platform is minimal at best. It only talks about Ethereum, and many of the facts related to Ethereum have not been updated on the website. the site still posts details about Ethereum mining, something that has not been the case since the arrival of Merge.\n\nAlso the site also talks about being an educational platform, but we couldn\u2019t assess them because of the lack of an account. And the account couldn\u2019t be made because of the lack of information about the minimum deposit.\n\nThe site does say that it will assist you with an account manager during the initial days of your trade. But how much fee will the account manager take? No info about that is available. There are customer reviews available on Trustpilot that have given it an average rating at best.\n\nSitejabber, on the other hand, has mostly bullish reviews about this platform. It has given it 4.8 out of five stars.\n\nSo, due to these facts, we recommend exercising caution when trading on Ethereum Trader. The site has too many things that you can consider as red flags, and there is support for only one cryptocurrency (for which it hasn\u2019t even updated the information). Invest at your own risk when using Ethereum Trader.\n\nEthereum Trader Customer Support\n\nCustomer Support is available on Ethereum Trader, but only for those who register. Reviews do say that the support team is ready to reach out to traders at any time they want, which is good news since you will need help navigating a platform for which the information provided is so little.\n\nHow to Use Ethereum Trader?\n\nHere are the steps to start using Ethereum Trader\n\nStep 1 \u2013 Visit Ethereum Trader\n\nPay a visit to Ethereum Trader\u2019s official website and enter your details, including name, email, and phone number. Click the \u201cLearn More\u201dbutton to start the registration process. You will receive an email that will prompt you to verify your account.\n\nStep 2 \u2013 Deposit the Amount\n\nEthereum Trader has most of the features locked behind a minimum deposit requirement. It is likely that you will know the exact amount you must deposit once you create the account and are reached out by an account manager.\n\nStep 3 \u2013 Start Trading\n\nOnce you have funded your account, you can start enjoying the live trading facilities and trading.\n\nHow to Delete an Ethereum Trader Account?\n\nIt is not clear how one can delete an Ethereum Trader account. One may reach out to their account manager and submit the request for account termination.\n\nAre Celebrities Endorsing Ethereum Trader\n\nThere are many who have been asking if Ethereum Trader is being endorsed by the likes of Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Martin Lewis, or more. And the answer is simple \u2013 there is no evidence. Elon Musk is mostly interested in DOGE, and Ethereum Trader is focused on only Ethereum. Jeff Bezos hadn\u2019t spoken much about cryptocurrencies since before the crypto winter started in 2022, and Martin Lewis has often been falsely associated with crypto trading platforms.\n\nWho are the Founders of Ethereum Trader?\n\nEthereum Trader has not provided transparent information about who the founders of the platform are. Social media platforms have nothing to say, and third-party reviews, even from reputed sites, have given us only vague hints. While it is highly likely that the platform is from a team of crypto traders, we don\u2019t know what their names are. The site also doesn\u2019t appear to be related to the similar platform Ethereum Code.\n\nEthereum Trader Payment Methods\n\nEthereum Trader is said to accept traditional fiat payments and withdrawals such as credit cards, debit cards, and eWallets. And since the platform primarily focuses on Ethereum, crypto payments may also be possible \u2013 but it is speculation at this point.\n\nThe Verdict\n\nEthereum Trader is a crypto trading platform that apparently only focuses on Ethereum. It deals with educational resources more than it does with crypto trading and is said to offer advanced trading tools for those who want to trade ETH. But no evidence exists to support those claims.\n\nThere is also no information about this website\u2019s founders. The information provided on the platform is low, and customer reviews of this platform are few. So, we recommend doing your own research. Also see our reviews of other automated trading platforms.\n\nVisit Ethereum Trader\n\nCryptocurrencies are unregulated. Trading with unregulated brokers will not qualify for investor protection.\n\nFAQs"
