        "title": "Ethereum Staking: What Is It? - Built In",
        "content": "Ethereum staking refers to the process of transaction validation on the Ethereum blockchain network. This method sees users lock in, or \u201cstake,\u201d the platform\u2019s native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), to qualify for validator privileges in order to help secure the network and earn rewards.\n\nWhat Is Ethereum Staking? Ethereum staking refers to participation in Ethereum\u2019s transaction validation process following its move to a proof-of-stake consensus protocol. When staking, users lock in, or \u201cstake,\u201d tokens on the blockchain in order to earn validator opportunities that secure the network in exchange for rewards.\n\nIn 2022, Ethereum underwent a major transition known as the Merge, when its consensus mechanism switched from a proof-of-work protocol to a proof-of-stake protocol.\n\nTo stake Ether means becoming a validator, one of the pillars of proof-of-stake protocols. A validator is an entity who participates directly in Ethereum network consensus by authenticating transactions, creating new blocks on the chain and monitoring for malicious activity. Validators support the Ethereum protocol first-hand, and get subsequent rewards for doing so.\n\nProof-of-Stake vs. Proof-of-Work Proof-of-Stake: Requires crypto staking to operate; uses validators to create new blocks and build out network.\n\nProof-of-Work: Requires crypto mining to operate; uses winners of complex, competitive puzzles to create new blocks and build out network.\n\nStaking is quite different from more familiar concepts like investing, Arie Trouw, software engineer and co-founder at XYO Network, explained: While investing in Ethereum is as simple as buying Ether and letting it sit in a wallet as the price fluctuates, staking, on the other hand, allows a user to earn tokens with interest, participate in liquidity pools, lending, yield farming and derivatives.\n\nHow Does Ethereum Staking Work?\n\nIn short, kicking off Ethereum 2.0 staking and the validator process means a user must stake 32 ETH, then acquire validator privileges and program their staking node accordingly.\n\nIn particular, there\u2019s a few core technologies that make Ethereum staking work and are important components of the validator process: Validator keys and epochs.\n\nValidator Keys\n\nValidator keys are the key pair associated with each validator that\u2019s established, and are used to verify validators and associated blocks on the Ethereum chain. Validator keys consist of one public key and one private key, and are each represented as a separate string of random characters. The validator public key is used by the network to identify the validator and deal with reward collection, and is attached to the transaction data when ETH is deposited for the staking deposit contract. The validator private key is used to sign any on-chain actions as a validator, like block proposals and attestations.\n\nEpochs\n\nOnce keys and a node are set up, a validator must then wait to be selected to authenticate a transaction in part of the block production process. These are completed in time slots \u2014 a fixed time interval of 12 seconds during which a block is formed.\n\nAs time slots accumulate, they accrue into epochs, which are groups of 32 separate time slots that are each respectively 12 seconds. This totals 384 seconds, or 6.4 minutes, to form one epoch\n\nThe first block of an epoch is known as a checkpoint, which is followed by 31 regular blocks. This process is important to understand algorithmically, since the hash encoding the regular blocks from 2 to 32 refer to the first checkpoint block as its key base, creating a single chain that holds the epoch together.\n\nTo complete the validator process, each block within a time slot is voted for by one committee of validators, each having a minimum of 128 members. The maximum number of members is 2,048, however, anything more than that is considered redundant. These 128 (or more) members are automatically and randomly elected to the committee from the general pool of Ethereum validators, fixed for the epoch duration.\n\nFurthermore, each committee is distributed over one time slot, forming 32 committees per each epoch. While one of the committee members validates a block, the remaining members can vote for this initiative. This kind of voting is called block attestation, Eugene Zomchak, product owner at CoinLoan, a crypto marketplace and lending platform, said. If approved, the block will become part of the main chain. At the end of an epoch, validators from the common pool are shuffled to form new committees for the next epoch. In total, there are at least 4,096 members per committee across 32 committees, equaling 131,072 Ether per epoch, Zomchak estimated.\n\nThe process rinses and repeats in entirety, ranging from a few seconds to several hours depending on network congestion.\n\nFind out who's hiring.

To solo stake, you must run and maintain an internet-connected Ethereum node using your own hardware and software, in addition to depositing 32 ETH. Being a validator means having machinery and internet strong enough to keep a node online at all times, otherwise the validator\u2019s ETH will be penalized.\n\nWhile solo staking is a significant responsibility, successful solo stakers earn rewards directly from the protocol instead of through third parties. They also have full control over the keys used to collect funds from ETH deposits and staking rewards.\n\nStaking as a Service\n\nStaking as a service, or \u201cSaaS\u201d in the Ethereum community, describes third-party services that run and maintain validator nodes on users\u2019 behalfs. Users will still have to deposit 32 ETH to activate a validator, but delegate node operations to SaaS providers, usually for a cut of reward earnings. Staking as a service is often best for those who want to stake Ethereum but don\u2019t have the necessary hardware or knowledge to be a validator on their own.\n\nStaking as a service requires users to share their validator keys with their SaaS provider, leaving only partial control over node operations and fund access. However, this also means having a fully-maintained validator client to earn staking rewards from.\n\nPooled Staking\n\nPooled staking, or staking pools, involves multiple users contributing ETH together to reach the required 32 ETH deposit and activate one set of validator keys. Similar to staking as a service, pooled staking delegates validator node operations to a third-party, but can be done so with a low amount of ETH. In many staking pools, users are given a liquidity token that acts as a receipt of staked amounts, which can be used as collateral on decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.\n\nPooled staking is the cheapest way to begin Ethereum staking, as many pools accept any amount of ETH to stake and reap rewards. Using a staking pool also doesn\u2019t require users to generate validator keys. Due to having several participants involved under a single validator, though, rewards are split and are usually smaller in value than other staking methods.\n\nMore on Cryptocurrency List of Cryptocurrencies You Need to Know\n\nHow to Stake Ethereum\n\nFor solo staking or using staking as a service methods, the first step is holding a balance of 32 ETH. This ETH will be used for the deposit in the staking deposit contract to become a validator. Since 32 ETH is required for one validator, any more purchased will each need the same ETH amount.\n\nFor pooled staking, users must hold enough ETH to join a collective staking pool of their choice, where they\u2019ll stake only a portion of ETH and receive rewards respective to their contribution.\n\nAny of these deposits for the validator process go onto the Beacon Chain, a proof-of-stake chain part of the Ethereum mainnet.\n\n\u201cAny extra funds [beyond 32 Ether] will not give you any profit,\u201d Zomchak said. \u201cSo it makes sense to leave them to form another validator.\u201d\n\nDepending on your way of staking, here\u2019s how to jump into it from here:\n\nFor Solo Stakers\n\n1. Begin Validator Process on Ethereum.org\n\nSolo stakers begin the validator process at Ethereum\u2019s Staking Launchpad page, which walks through the requirements to become a validator. This process starts solo stakers on the Goerli testnet, so they can test their node setup before placing it on Ethereum\u2019s mainnet.\n\n2. Prepare Ethereum Node\n\nRunning a node requires hardware devices that can operate 24/7 and have more than 900 terabytes in memory to spare. One of the simplest options for running a personal node is using preconfigured plug-and-play solutions like Dappnode or Avado.\n\nSolo stakers must also download software on their devices that enables transaction validation, known as an execution layer (EL) client and consensus layer (CL) client. These clients work to verify data and secure the network, and are what help the node run. Client options are available to choose from on the Launchpad page.\n\n3. Generate Validator Keys\n\nThrough the Launchpad page, users can choose how to generate their validator keys, whether that be building from a source or by downloading a key generator like Wagyu Key Gen. After creating and configuring the keys, deposit data attached in the keys\u2019 files will be needed for upload on the Launchpad page to continue.\n\n4. Connect Wallet and Deposit 32 ETH\n\nOn the final step of the Launchpad page, this is where users must connect a crypto wallet and send their deposit of 32 ETH to the designated staking deposit contract address. From here, users will have to wait for their deposit to be processed and validator to be activated on the Beacon Chain, which can be monitored by using their validator public key on sites like beaconcha.in or BeaconScan.\n\n5. Maintain Node and Practice Being a Validator\n\nAfter testing node setup and skills on the Goerli testnet, users who are comfortable enough can begin solo staking using the same steps on the Mainnet Launchpad page.\n\nFor Staking as a Service (SaaS)\n\n1. Find and Download or Sign Up for a SaaS Provider\n\nStaking as a service isn\u2019t natively supported on the Ethereum network, so users will have to seek out a SaaS provider based on their preferences. As a starter, some staking as a service providers include Blox Staking and Abyss Finance.\n\n2. Follow Instructions to Generate Validator Keys and Set Up a Validator\n\nMany SaaS providers will have guided instructions and a built-in system to help stakers generate their validator keys and set up as a validator. Users going this route will not have to use an outside software to get their keys or configure a node, as the provider will already have these procedures arranged within their application.\n\n3. Connect Wallet and Deposit 32 ETH\n\nSimilarly with solo staking, users will have to deposit 32 ETH to the attached staking deposit contract address in-app to secure their validator status.\n\nFor Pooled Staking\n\n1. Find and Deposit Into a Staking Pool\n\nPooled staking also calls for third-party solutions in order to stake, but there are several to choose from based on how much ETH users have available. Many staking pools will take any amount of ETH for users to join, with a few only requiring deposits as little as 0.0001 ETH. Some popular crypto exchanges, such as Coinbase and Binance, even offer staking options through their platforms that use pooling.\n\n2. Earn and Use Liquidity Tokens\n\nAfter depositing, users tend to receive rewards from staked ETH in the form of liquidity tokens, as mentioned. These tokens can be converted back for ETH, traded on crypto exchanges or held in users\u2019 wallets to gain interest.\n\nWhy to Stake Ethereum\n\nMonetary Rewards\n\nThose who stake Ethereum and become validators \u201care providing a public good for the network and getting paid for it,\u201d said Habeeb Syed, a senior associate attorney at Vicente Sederberg LLP.\n\nStaking Ether is also \u201ca low-risk way to put your tokens to work,\u201d Syed added. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to go through the trouble of setting up your own validator, you can always use a centralized exchange or other platform which offer easier alternatives.\u201d\n\nThe reward for validating blocks is no longer fixed, as rewards once were under Ethereum\u2019s prior proof-of-work consensus mechanism. A block\u2019s value now depends on the number of active validators in a network and the total amount of staked funds paid into Ethereum\u2019s protocol.\n\nDecentralized application, or dApp, developers may \u201ctip\u201d validators as an incentive to speed up transaction processing and prioritize their operations in the queue by including them in the next available block. Another method, known as maximum extractable value, is a way validators gain additional revenue by reorganizing the order of transactions on standby from the common memory pool before they are included in a new block.\n\nExactly how much you can make from staking ethereum depends on multiple factors, including how much ETH is staked, the way a user stakes, the amount of validators on-network and the market value of ETH upon reward processing. Ethereum uses a specific formula to take these factors into account and delegate rewards. As of April 2023, users can expect around four percent annual percentage yield on their staked ETH, according to MilkRoad.\n\nSustainability and Accessibility\n\nSustainability and accessibility are reasons why users flock to Ethereum, according to Syed.\n\n\u201cUltimately, proof of stake does allow more people to participate in a more meaningful way on the network, and it makes usage of Ethereum more palatable without the energy waste controversy,\u201d Syed said. \u201cBut it does not in and of itself make Ethereum more accessible for users.\u201d\n\nThe biggest barriers to accessibility that remain are gas fees and transaction speeds. A common misconception of Ethereum 2.0 is that the network would be faster and cheaper. Syed said that\u2019s not the case.\n\n\u201cPeople purchasing Ether or transacting on the network for the first time may be confused by having to pay several dollars for a simple transaction,\u201d Syed said, in a post-Merge market. While proof of stake significantly reduced Ethereum\u2019s energy usage, gas fees have generally stayed the same. Though historic, the Merge upgrade has left room for improvement, potentially to be seen with additional upgrades down the line.\n\nHow Many Validators Are on the Ethereum Network?\n\nEthereum has over 606,000 validators on its network as of June 2023. To maintain network stability, Ethereum implements a queue of eight validator activations or exits per epoch, preventing any mass validator joins or leaves.\n\nHow Long Is Ethereum Staked For?\n\nAfter staking, how long users have to wait to \u201cunlock\u201d or move out tokens depends on network conditions, varying from a few days to a few weeks. The standard bonding period of ETH stands at 14 days before it goes into the exit queue, according to Bitbuy.\n\n\u201cOnce tokens are staked, they\u2019re on hold for an extended period to provide liquidity [respective to the amount of] staked Ether,\u201d said Trouw.\n\nRisks of Staking Ethereum\n\nSlashing and Validator Penalties\n\nWhen a validator operates maliciously or makes an incorrect on-chain attestation, this will result in slashed, or lost, earnings. This \u2018\u201cslashing insurance\u201d is there to keep validators accountable, and is utilized to punish validators for inactivity or malicious actions.\n\nSome violations that cause slashing include proposing and signing two different blocks for the same slot or attesting to change the history of a block. If slashed, staked ETH will gradually be taken from the validator and they will be removed from the network.\n\nThird-Party Vulnerabilities\n\nIf using a staking as a service provider or staking pool, staked ETH is held by a third party and not kept privately by the staker. This makes earnings more susceptible to system theft, hacking or government intervention if the third party violates the law.\n\nMarket Volatility\n\nStaking any cryptocurrency comes with the possible change in token value as the market shifts. This can result in quick increases in reward earnings, but also quick decreases, so it\u2019s best to consider budget and willingness for investment risk before staking."

        "title": "How to create a smart contract using Ethereum - TechTarget",
        "content": "Smart contracts, which are programs that run on a blockchain, have transformed blockchain from a data storage technology to an application platform that allows developers to support a variety of business processes, from supply chain management to real estate administration to decentralized finance.\n\nAt the center of it all is the Solidity programming language.\n\nAlthough smart contracts can be written in a number of programming languages, Solidity has become the first choice for many developers doing smart contract programming. That's why it's worth knowing about.\n\nSolidity is a powerful and complex programming language that takes time to master. However, starting out with Solidity isn't daunting, particularly for developers who have a background in object-oriented programming (OOP). This article shows you how to get started.\n\nBut before we get to the nuts and bolts of the matter, let's look at why Solidity has become so popular.\n\nSmart contracts for the Ethereum network: How they work and why they're popular One of the biggest reasons for Solidity's popularity is that it's the language used for programs that run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). To understand why this is significant, it's useful to understand a bit of the history of blockchain. This article is part of Blockchain for businesses: The ultimate enterprise guide Which also includes:\n\nTop 10 benefits of blockchain for business\n\nTop 10 benefits of blockchain for business What are the 4 different types of blockchain technology?\n\nWhat are the 4 different types of blockchain technology? 7 must-have blockchain developer skills Download 1 Download this entire guide for FREE now! Blockchain technology became commonplace with the introduction of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin in 2009. When it was first introduced, the Bitcoin blockchain supported transferring Bitcoin (the cryptocurrency) between parties. But, other than that, the Bitcoin blockchain was dumb. It didn't support executing rules or enforcing conditional logic. You couldn't program a transaction such as \"have Bob transfer two Bitcoin to Alice on the first of the month as payment for rent on Bob's apartment.\" However, another blockchain network came along that did have this sort of capability. That network was Ethereum. Solidity is the way Ethereum supports executing rules or enforcing conditional logic by way of smart contracts, and it is the language Ethereum created for writing smart contracts. Ethereum also specified the EVM as the mechanism for running smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The EVM acts as an intermediary between the smart contract's compiled bytecode and the Ethereum blockchain, very much in the same way that a Java virtual machine acts as the intermediary between compiled Java bytecode and the computer hosting the Java program. The way smart contract development works under Ethereum is that developers write smart contract code in Solidity as a text file. Then, they use a tool called the Solidity compiler (solc) to transform the Solidity text into bytecode that the EVM can understand. Finally, the bytecode is deployed to and stored on the Ethereum blockchain at a particular address (see Figure 1.) Figure 1. The Solidity software development lifecycle. Depending on how it's programmed, the smart contract can run on its own continually, or other smart contracts can call functions in the smart contract by using special tools. Solidity and the EVM caught on. Eventually, other blockchains such as Avalanche and Hedera incorporated the EVM specification. As support for the EVM grew among different blockchains, so too did the popularity of the Solidity programming language. Today GitHub reports over 56,000 source code repositories related to Solidity.\n\nCreating and deploying a smart contract to the Ethereum network Now, let's create a smart contract and show how to deploy it on Ethereum. The Solidity programming language supports inheritance, encapsulation and polymorphism as is typically found in OOP languages such as Java, C# and TypeScript. Whereas in OOP the basic unit of encapsulation is the class, in Solidity it's called a contract. A contract can contain public or private data members and functions. One added feature that is special to Solidity is the notion of the predefined msg, tx and block variables, which are global to any contract. The msg variable describes the external call made to the contract. The tx variable describes the fee associated with the cost of contract execution as well as the party that is going to pay that fee. A feature common to all blockchains is that there is a fee, measured in a unit of denomination called gas, incurred every time a transaction is executed, regardless of whether the transaction is a simple transfer of funds or a function being executed in decentralized applications such as Solidity contracts. The block variable describes the state of a block on the underlying blockchain on which the contract is hosted. For example, the property block.gaslimit reports the maximum amount of gas the underlying blockchain will allow to be consumed by a given transaction. As with object-oriented programming, Solidity supports interfaces, thus allowing developers to define the methods and data members that an implementing contract will provide. Also, a smart contract is considered a composite data type just as class is in OOP. The following code examples demonstrate the steps in creating a smart contract that declares an interface and then implements that interface in another Solidity smart contract. The final step shows yet another smart contract that returns the interface of the implementation contract. Listing 1 declares an interface named ILocation. (All the code for this article is available in one of my GitHub repositories here.) // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT pragma solidity ^0.8.17; interface ILocation { function getLongitude( ) external view returns(uint16 ); function getLatitude( ) external view returns(uint16 ); } Listing 2 shows how to implement the ILocation interface in a contract named Location. Notice that the syntax to declare a contract as an implementation of an interface is expressed at line 5 using the is keyword. // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT pragma solidity ^0.8.17; import \"./ILocation.sol\"; contract Location is ILocation { uint16 latitude; uint16 longitude; constructor (uint16 _longitude, uint16 _latitude){ latitude = _latitude; longitude = _longitude; } function getLongitude() external view returns(uint16 ){ return longitude; } function getLatitude () external view returns(uint16 ){ return latitude; } } Listing 3 shows another Solidity smart contract that imports the Location contract defined in Listing 2. Notice the import statement at line 3. Importing the Location contract implicitly imports the ILocation interface too. The function getLocation() returns an ILocation interface which is backed behind the scenes by a Location contract defined in Listing 2. // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT pragma solidity ^0.8.17; import \"./Location.sol\"; contract LocationFactory { function getLocation(uint16 _longitude, uint16 _latitude) public returns (ILocation) { return new Location(_longitude, _latitude); } } The three listings not only demonstrate how to create and use contracts in Solidity programming, the code also demonstrates how to use the program to the interface technique, which is common practice among object-oriented programmers. When it comes time to deploy the code to an EVM-compatible blockchain, first the developer will compile the code into bytecode and then deploy the bytecode to the blockchain either using a tool at the command line or from within an IDE such as VS Code or Remix. Let's look at the details.\n\nTools for writing a smart contract in Solidity The evolution of tools available to create distributed applications based on smart contracts is impressive, given that Solidity was first proposed in 2014. Today, IDEs do most of the heavy lifting, allowing developers to focus on the logic of their smart contracts instead of the minutiae that goes with getting it all to work. Most developers use one for writing smart contracts, and the days of only using a simple text editor are long gone. There are two types of IDEs. One type is hosted on a local machine, the other is online and accessed from a web browser. IDEs for local machines include VS Code and JetBrains WebStorm (see Figures 2 and 3). Figure 2. The Visual Studio IDE configured for Solidity programming using the Hardhat framework. Figure 3. The JetBrains IDE configured for Solidity programming using the Hardhat framework. Development in a local IDE will also involve using frameworks such as HardHat and Truffle to help execute compilation and deployment. As for online tools, Ethereum's Remix is the most popular (see Figure 4). Remix reduces the labor of creating Ethereum smart contracts by doing common development chores such as library management, code autocompletion, syntax checking and even deployment. Remix allows you to deploy smart contracts to development EVMs that are special to Remix. Also, you can bind the IDE to a MetaMask wallet browser plugin and then use test Ether cryptocurrency from a variety of Ethereum accounts to fund the transaction fees that go with deploying and running the smart contract to the blockchain. Figure 4. Ethereum's Remix is an online IDE that integrates with Metamask wallet to enable paying transaction fees."

For instance, the SEC explicitly mentioned BNB (BNB), Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA), which are direct competitors to Ethereum\u2019s smart contract-processing capabilities.\n\nHowever, as noted by analyst Jevgenijs Kazanins, Ether\u2019s omission does not mean that it has the green light from the SEC.\n\nSEC did not mention #ETH in the list of tokens that it considers to be securities when suing Coinbase and Binance.

Still, not even the retest of the $1,780 level on June 6 was enough to flip those whales and market makers into bearish sentiment.\n\nTo exclude externalities that might have solely impacted the Ether futures, one should analyze the ETH options markets. The 25% delta skew indicator compares similar call (buy) and put (sell) options and will turn positive when fear is prevalent because the protective put option premium is higher than the call options.\n\nEther 30-day 25% skew. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe skew indicator will move above 8% if traders fear an Ether price crash. On the other hand, generalized excitement reflects a negative 8% skew. As displayed above, the 25% delta skew moved above the positive 8% threshold on June 5, indicating bearishness. However, the subsequent bounce to $1,880 on June 6 has moved the metric back to a neutral state.\n\nRelated: Coinbase reminds world it tried to \u2018embrace regulation\u2019 as SEC sues for violations\n\nEther\u2019s price looks poised to hold above $1,800\n\nIn short, these three indicators signal resilience \u2014 namely, the TVL bounce to 14.6 million ETH, the 4% increase in DApps\u2019 active addresses and a meager impact on Ether derivatives markets, despite the retest of the $1,800 level.\n\nEthereum network usage data remains healthy, and the recent retest of the 67-day support was not enough to scare professional traders, according to derivatives metrics.\n\nConsequently, bulls seem to have dodged a bullet, greatly reducing the risk of an imminent price crash.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "The SEC has brought charges against two popular crypto exchanges in as many days. Yesterday, it accused Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, and several connected entities, of a laundry list of securities law violations. Today, it charged Coinbase with operating as an unregistered national securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency. It also said it failed to register its crypto staking program.\n\n\"You simply can't ignore the rules because you don't like them or because you'd prefer different ones; the consequences for the investing public are far too great,\u201d said Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. In response, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong tweeted, \"Instead of publishing a clear rule book, the SEC has taken a regulation by enforcement approach that is harming America.\"\n\nThe SEC's charges against Coinbase center around securities\n\nIt's several years since Gary Gensler took the helm of the SEC. But from the outset, he's said he believes many cryptocurrencies are unregistered securities. He thinks they are operating without the required oversight. Recent moves from the SEC reflect this belief.\n\nIf a product is a security, it comes under the umbrella of the SEC and there are strict rules about how it can be traded and share information. Platforms that trade securities need to register and follow SEC regulations. But, up until now, most cryptocurrencies have been considered commodities. These are regulated by the CFTC and the rulebook is different.\n\nSo, what constitutes a security? The SEC's argument is that a product is an investment contract if a person \"invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party.\" The SEC thinks this applies to cryptocurrencies that are run by foundations or other entities if they make statements that lead investors to think they could make a profit.\n\nAs a result, the SEC accuses Coinbase of operating an unregistered marketplace where people can trade securities. It says that Coinbase's failure to register means crypto investors have been deprived of investor protections. It also argues that Coinbase's staking-as-a-service program was not correctly registered.\n\nOur top crypto play isn't a token - Here\u2019s why We\u2019ve found one company that\u2019s positioned itself perfectly as a long-term picks-and-shovels solution for the broader crypto market \u2014 Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and all the others. In fact, you've probably used this company's technology in the past few days, even if you've never had an account or even heard of the company before. That's how prevalent it's become. Sign up today for Stock Advisor and get access to our exclusive report where you can get the full scoop on this company and its upside as a long-term investment. Learn more and get started today with a special new member discount. Get started\n\nCoinbase has hit back at the charges. Armstrong says the popular exchange has tried to register with the SEC. He also points out that the SEC reviewed its business and allowed it to become a public company in 2021. According to Armstrong, \"The SEC and CFTC have made conflicting statements, and don't even agree on what is a security and what is a commodity.\"\n\nIn contrast, the SEC says Binance deliberately mishandled customer funds\u2026 as well as selling unregistered securities\u2026 and several other things\n\nTiming aside, there are some similarities between the SEC's cases against Binance and Coinbase. Both are accused of operating unregistered exchanges and the unregistered offer and sale of securities. But that's where it ends.\n\nThe accusations against Binance go a lot further and are more concerning -- particularly if you're a customer of Binance or Binance.US. According to the SEC, \"Zhao and Binance misled investors about their risk controls and corrupted trading volumes while actively concealing who was operating the platform.\"\n\nThe SEC says the companies involved lied about the controls in place to prevent market manipulation. Moreover, it accuses Sigma Chain, another company owned by Zhao, of carrying out wash trading on the platforms. Wash trading essentially involves buying and selling an asset to push up trading volumes and create an unfounded impression of demand.\n\nThe complaint also raises questions about the custody of crypto assets on Binance.US. It says customers don't know where their assets are stored. The SEC document warns this gives, \"Zhao and Binance free reign to handle billions of dollars of crypto assets that customers have deposited, held, traded, and/or accrued on the Binance.US Platform with no oversight or controls.\"\n\nWhat it all means for crypto investors\n\nThere are a lot of moving parts to crypto regulation. The SEC's charges come as key players, including Coinbase, testify in front of the House Committee on Agriculture on draft crypto legislation. We don't know what shape additional crypto regulation in the U.S. will take, nor do we know how the SEC's legal cases will pan out.\n\nWhat's for sure is that the question of how to categorize and regulate crypto isn't going away. If you hold assets with Binance or Binance.US, it's worth reading the SEC's accusations in full. Binance has said it will defend itself vigorously and that client funds are safe. But given that we're talking about your money, it's important to understand the details so you can make up your own mind.\n\nIn the meantime, brace yourself for further volatility, whatever exchange you use. Cryptocurrencies are extremely risky investments. One way to protect yourself is to only invest money you can afford to lose. You can also minimize risk by ensuring your crypto is part of a diversified portfolio. If you currently only own cryptocurrency, the risk is that you'll lose everything if the industry fails. Consider also opening a brokerage account and exploring other assets such as stocks, bonds, or real estate. That way you won't have all your financial eggs in one basket."

        "title": "9 programming languages for smart contract development - TechTarget",
        "content": "Smart contract programming languages allow developers to craft special programs for transferring digital assets in response to specific conditions. These smart contracts typically run on top of a blockchain to automate asset exchanges without the need for intermediaries.\n\nOne of the first smart contract languages was the Bitcoin Scripting Language. It is useful for ensuring parties get paid and for exchanging digital currency during a Bitcoin sale. However, it is not practical for more complex transactions.\n\nOver the years, new smart contract programming languages such as Solidity, Vyper and Yul emerged specifically for writing more sophisticated applications. In addition, developers have created frameworks for executing smart contract programs written in legacy programming languages such as Java, JavaScript and C++. Developers should consider their programming experience and target platform when choosing the most appropriate language for a project.\n\nWhat to look for in a smart contract language Sanjiv Maewall, CTO of blockchain and digital assets at Deloitte Consulting, suggests developers assess characteristics such as security features, execution performance, developer community support, available tools and the relative ease of learning a language. Doing so can ensure that the language they choose provides a comprehensive, secure and efficient smart contract development environment. This article is part of Blockchain for businesses: The ultimate enterprise guide Which also includes:\n\nTop 10 benefits of blockchain for business\n\nTop 10 benefits of blockchain for business What are the 4 different types of blockchain technology?\n\nWhat are the 4 different types of blockchain technology? 7 must-have blockchain developer skills Download 1 Download this entire guide for FREE now! \"Familiarity with other languages additionally aids in picking up new smart contract languages rather quickly and allows for existing best practices to also be retained in the smart contract domain,\" Maewall said. Previous programming experience can also make it easier to understand important concepts in smart contract development. Knowledge of object-oriented programming, error handling and testing leads to more secure, reliable and efficient smart contracts. Nicko Guyer, Hyperledger FireFly community lead and senior full stack engineer at Kaleido, a vendor of blockchain tools and platforms, recommends developers determine the type of blockchain they plan to use before picking a language. The blockchain should be selected based on the requirements of the particular project. Even if the best language ends up being an unfamiliar one, you can probably get up and running quickly, particularly if you have prior programming experience. \"If the best answer for your project is a language you don't know, don't be afraid to learn something new,\" Guyer said. \"It's probably not as hard as you might think.\" It is also important to consider how the industry is evolving. Mrinal Manohar, co-founder and CEO at Casper Labs, a blockchain platform and service provider, observed that smart contracts were traditionally written in Solidity. But new standards like WebAssembly (Wasm), a virtual machine that can improve the performance of web applications, allow developers to write smart contracts in more mainstream languages like JavaScript, TypeScript and Python. It may also be helpful to look for a software development kit that supports features that run on top of your favorite programming language. Here are nine smart contract languages that merit serious consideration.\n\n1. C++ C++ is one of the oldest development languages on the list. It was introduced by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1983 to add object-oriented features to the C programming language. It is also a compiled language, which makes it perform well, but the compilation process adds an extra step to the development process. C++ is supported by popular blockchain projects, including EOS, Stellar and Ripple. It can also be compiled into Wasm code. One concern is that C++ is not a memory-safe language, which can result in security issues arising from how a program uses memory. It also can result in longer programs than some of the newer smart contract-specific languages.\n\n2. Clarity Clarity is a newer smart contract programming language introduced for the Stacks blockchain. It employs a framework for writing decentralized applications (dApps) that combine digital assets, data and identity in new ways. One novel feature is that Clarity is a non-Turing-complete programming language, which means it can't simulate every function of a Turing machine (a mathematical model of computation). Although Turing-complete languages allow greater flexibility, they can also be compromised by various smart contract hacks. Clarity's non-Turing-complete approach also makes it easier to perform a more thorough static analysis to identify security issues before deploying new smart contract apps. Clarity apps are also interpreted rather than compiled, which can make it easier to find and fix bugs after deploying an app.\n\n3. Java James Gosling developed the Java programming language in the early 1990s as a replacement for C++. One of its most essential features was the ability to write once and run anywhere. A key innovation was a just-in-time compiler that allows Java applications to run on different processes and operating systems. Java can be used to write smart contracts on Corda, Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, IBM Blockchain and Neo. It has a large development community and a significant ecosystem of open source components.\n\n4. JavaScript JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages for developing web application front ends. It is considered easy to learn and has an extensive open source community, which helps developers get started quickly. Despite the word \"Java\" in its name, JavaScript is an entirely different language introduced by Netscape in the mid-1990s. Many of the most popular blockchain platforms support it, including Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, Neo, Polkadot and Solana. It's a good choice for developing front ends for decentralized apps. For example, the web3.js Ethereum JavaScript API includes libraries for connecting front ends to Ethereum blockchain nodes using HTTP, IPC or WebSocket calls. The ethers.js library provides a basic wallet implementation in JavaScript.\n\n5. Python Guido van Rossum created the Python programming language in the early 1990s. It supports a variety of application development concepts, such as object-oriented programming and structured programming. Users can employ modules to add functionality to existing apps. Python is one of the most popular languages for developing AI apps. One of its top benefits for smart contract developers is ease of use. However, it is an interpreted language, which can slow performance compared to other languages. Blockchain platforms that support Python include Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, Steem and Neo.\n\n6. Rust Graydon Hoare introduced Rust in 2006 to fix some of the memory bugs plaguing C and C++. Like the other languages on this list, it is designed for writing compact and fast apps that can run on everything from embedded systems to high-performance computers. Rust has grown into one of the most popular development languages for writing back-end applications. It's also a good choice for writing highly scalable and fast-performing smart contract applications. However, it can be more complicated to develop on top of Rust compared to languages like JavaScript, Python or smart contract-specific languages. Some of the blockchain platforms that support Rust apps include Aleo, Cosmos, OpenEthereum, Polkadot, Solana and Stacks 2.0.\n\n7. Solidity Solidity is hands down the most popular smart contract programming language. It was introduced by Ethereum founder Gavin Wood in 2014 and later enhanced by a team at the Ethereum project. It runs on some of the most popular blockchain platforms, including Avalanche, Binance, Counterparty, Ethereum, Tron, Hedera Hashgraph and Polygon. It is based on JavaScript syntax, which can make it easier to learn (see Figure). Another key advantage is its large community of smart contract developers that can help developers master the basics of writing dApps. That said, it comes with several limitations and challenges that some of the newer smart contract languages are designed to mitigate. For example, in 2016, Solidity was blamed for a security vulnerability that enabled an attack on one of the first decentralized autonomous organizations, a popular blockchain-based management structure. Figure. Solidity software development lifecycle on the Ethereum blockchain network.\n\n8. Vyper Vyper is a newer smart contract programming language that is similar to Python. It enables developers to create smart contract apps that run on top of Ethereum, which provides broad support for dApps. One key innovation is a focus on readability and auditability in smart contract development, which can make it easier to find bugs and help developers identify other problems sooner in the development process. A downside compared to Solidity is that Vyper supports fewer features, which improves security but can also limit functionality. Vyper also does not support object-oriented concepts like inheritance, which can slow development but also improve security."

        "content": "Grill.chat, a chat app based on the Subsocial network, has now implemented Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) wallet compatibility, allowing users to chat using their Ethereum identities and send crypto to each other via Polygon, according to a June 7 announcement.\n\nSubsocial is a Polkadot parachain designed for social media applications.\n\nGrill.chat allows users to participate in over 70 chat rooms focused on mostly crypto-related topics. The development team seeks to attract new Web3 projects to build their communities on the platform.\n\nPolkadot Decoded chat room on Grill.chat. Source: Grill.chat\n\nThe integration means that users can now connect their Subsocial wallets to their EVM wallets by signing a transaction verifying that they are the wallet\u2019s owner. This prevents them from needing to own SUB tokens to donate to other users, and it allows them to prove their Ethereum identities to users in chat rooms. In the future, the developers plan to use this integration to allow nonfungible token (NFT) collections to be shown to other users.\n\nIn a conversation with Cointelegraph, Subsocial content lead Zachary Edwards stated that Grill.chat is targeting crypto projects as potential sponsors of chat rooms. Currently, many crypto communities are built around Discord servers and Telegram channels. These channels cannot be integrated into the developer\u2019s website, which means that users need to load a separate program to join the community or interact with it, creating what Edwards sees as unneeded friction for users.\n\nBy contrast, chat groups on Grill.chat can be integrated into a development team\u2019s website or application interface. Edwards pointed to the example of Zeitgeist, a blockchain-based predictions market app. Its interface features a \u201cchat\u201d icon that opens directly into a Zeitgeist chat room on Grill.chat.\n\nZeitgeist user interface with Grill.chat window open. Source: Zeitgeist\n\nHowever, the app\u2019s users previously encountered friction from another source, Edwards said. Many of the biggest crypto projects are on EVM-based networks such as Ethereum, Polygon and Avalanche. Crypto users are accustomed to using wallets from these networks and don\u2019t necessarily want to download a new wallet to use a chat app.\n\nRelated: Decentralized social media: The next big thing in crypto?\n\nTo partially solve this problem, the team implemented a feature that lets users create a Subsocial wallet directly from the app\u2019s interface. They also paid for users\u2019 gas fees via a system that can delegate signing privileges for a limited number of functions.\n\nBut this still didn\u2019t completely solve the problem, as it siloed the user\u2019s Ethereum identity from their Grill.chat posts. The team implemented EVM compatibility to make it easier for Ethereum users to switch to the app, Edwards explained.\n\n\u201cThe cool thing is it's sort of using this off-chain signer technology because, at the end of the day, it\u2019s all running on Substrate [Polkadot parachain technology], and EVM wallets aren\u2019t compatible with Substrate,\u201d Edwards stated. \u201cBut we can still connect those two accounts together so you can chat on the substrate chain, but your EVM account is linked, so you can have identity, donations, NFTs, all of this sort of stuff.\u201d\n\nGrill.chat isn\u2019t the only social media app trying to entice crypto projects into building communities on it. OpenChat is a chat app on the Internet Computer network. Its team told Cointelegraph it\u2019s working on a similar feature to show OpenChat chat rooms on a project\u2019s website.\n\nWeb3 companies are racing to create a blockchain-based social media app that will see mass adoption. On April 26, the Polygon-based Lens network announced a new scaling solution that it said would allow for \u201cinstant posts.\u201d The same day, MeWe said it would move its 20 million users to the Polkadot parachain network Frequency."

        "content": "A widely-followed analyst is giving a bullish outlook on the blockchain development of the Ethereum (ETH) competitor Solana (SOL).\n\nIn a new interview with Paul Barron, the pseudonymous host of InvestAnswers says that the Solana ecosystem is undergoing impressive upgrades.\n\n\u201cWhat amazed me about Solana early on \u2013 we\u2019re talking 25, 26 months ago \u2013 was I was looking for an ETH killer to protect my ETH position. If there was something coming for it, I needed to be on it. But the type of developments that they have done over those last 26 months \u2013 mind-blowing, absolutely crazy.\u201d\n\nHe says the improvements to the blockchain project like Jump Crypto\u2019s open-source validator client Firedancer will boost scalability and network processing times.\n\n\u201cBut what\u2019s really intriguing to me is this, is how they\u2019re going to scale as they go forward with Firedancer and they have a thing called side-scaling and this basically will change exactly how they go forward. Firedancer is a Solana validator developed by Jump Crypto and it aims to significantly enhance Solana scalability and most importantly, what people don\u2019t focus on, is reduce latency times down to essentially milliseconds. This will pose a huge threat to many other things\u2026\n\nThis came from [crypto analytics firm] Messari actually. They talk about how Firedancer puts Solana in the range of CEX (centralized exchange) latency times, i.e. the ability to run a New York Stock Exchange or a NASDAQ or multiple exchanges. And they go on and talk about things like security and expenses and processing times and, again, latency, which is so important.\u201d\n\nAccording to the analyst, the upgrades going on in the ecosystem set it apart from many of the other blockchain projects and it will lead to more development and use cases.\n\n\u201cThese are some of the things that I think are just mind-blowing about Solana that many people kind of don\u2019t understand. They lump it in the same category with other layer-1s, layer-2s, but it is so far ahead because of some of those things that I mentioned and it all comes down to scale. How can you onboard a billion people The answer is with a truckload of scale. And how do you have a breadth of use cases, the answer is zero latency and a ton of throughput.\u201d\n\nSolana is trading for $18.73 at time of writing, down 8% during the last 24 hours.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) cleared its intention to go after the crypto market. Meanwhile, the crypto industry remains united and disagrees with the SEC for actions against Binance and Coinbase, as Bitcoin and Ethereum, and Coinbase (COIN) prices rebounded. Moreover, there are several differences between Coinbase and Binance lawsuits in relation to charges filed by the US SEC.\n\nKey Differences Between US SEC Charges Against Coinbase and Binance\n\nThe US SEC filed 13 charges against Binance and CEO Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao, primarily alleging commingling of funds. Charges include operating unregistered exchanges, broker-dealers, and clearing agencies; misrepresenting trading controls and oversight on the Binance.US platform; and the unregistered offer and sale of securities.\n\nadvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, charges against Coinbase include operating an unregistered exchange, broker, and clearing agency, and offering and selling securities in connection with its staking-as-a-service program.\n\nNo fraud charges were brought against Coinbase and CEO Brian Armstrong was not named in the lawsuit. Whereas Binance CEO \u201cCZ\u201d was named in the Binance lawsuit for commingling of funds and manipulative trading.\n\nDespite Coinbase being a publicly listed company, the SEC alleges Coinbase failed to register and deprived investors of significant protections, including inspection, recordkeeping requirements, and safeguards against conflicts of interest. SEC also holds Coinbase\u2019s holding company Coinbase Global Inc. (CGI) accountable for certain violations.\n\nMoreover, there was no proposal in Coinbase\u2019s lawsuit to prohibit the firm from engaging in financial-related businesses. Coinbase also received show cause notice from ten states California, Alabama, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, New Jersey, South Carolina, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin for\n\nUS SEC mentioned BNB, BUSD, SOL, ADA, MATIC, FIL, ATOM, SAND, MANA, ALGO, AXS, and COTI as securities in the Binance lawsuit. The agency listed SOL, ADA, MATIC, FIL, SAND, AXS, CHZ, FLOW, ICP, NEAR, VGX, DASH, and NEXO as securities in the Coinbase lawsuit.\n\nAlso Read: Terra Classic Passes Crucial Proposal To Revive LUNC, USTC Price To $1 After Parity Upgrade\n\nCrypto Market and Coinbase Shares Rise Higher\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum prices fell below $25.5k and $1800, respectively after the SEC filed the lawsuit against Binance. However, the crypto market defies SEC action against Coinbase and stands together to fight for clarity on crypto rules and guidelines.\n\nBTC price rallied above the $27k level after the Coinbase lawsuit, rebounding from the support at $25.5k. ETH price also jumped higher, with the price currently trading at $1,842.\n\nCoinbase shares rebounded after Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark Invest purchased $21 Million worth Coinbase (COIN) shares. COIN stock price soars over 5% to hit an intraday high of $53.40.\n\nAlso Read: Who Will Win, US SEC Or Crypto Giant Binance?"

        "title": "The Future of Tokenization: Exploring HedgeUp (HDUP), Ripple (XRP), and Ethereum (ETH) - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Tokenization, using real-world assets (RWA) to create blockchain tokens, will play a significant role in the future of cryptocurrencies. We are already seeing this trend develop with projects like HedgeUp (HDUP), which are creating competition for legacy crypto assets like Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP).\n\nHere is a closer look at each and how HedgeUp (HDUP) changes the game.\n\nRipple (XRP): international remittances\n\nRipple (XRP) was launched in 2012 by a company called Ripple Labs. The project, which was initially called OpenCoin, includes the Ripple payment protocol and the XRP cryptocurrency.\n\nRipple (XRP) was designed to facilitate fast and efficient cross-border transactions. But unlike traditional banking systems, the solution runs on a decentralized payment protocol called RippleNet.\n\nSince its launch, Ripple (XRP) has partnered with many banks, payment providers, and other financial institutions. However, it has also faced a good amount of legal issues that are still being resolved to date.\n\nThese haven\u2019t stopped XRP, Ripple\u2019s native cryptocurrency, from becoming one of the biggest crypto assets. The cryptocurrency currently trades at $0.530942 and has a market cap of more than $25 billion.\n\nEthereum (ETH): smart contracts and dApps\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) project is one of the most revolutionary crypto projects ever made. The development of the protocol began in late 2013. And since its launch on June 2015, it has gone on to become the most influential project in the crypto space.\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) protocol introduced the world to smart contracts. This is a revolutionary concept that allows developers to create decentralized applications (dApps). As a result, it has gone on to become the center of decentralized finance (DeFi), which greatly relies on smart contracts to function.\n\nETH is Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency. Thanks to the blockchain\u2019s successes, ETH is now the second-largest crypto asset. It is currently trading at around $1880 and has a market cap of well over $200 billion.\n\nHedgeUp (HDUP): tokenization of RWAs\n\nHedgeUp (HDUP) is a much newer project than Ripple (XRP) and Ethereum (ETH). In fact, it is yet to launch officially, and its presale went live less than two months ago. Despite that, the project has got the market talking. This is because of the game-changing platform it has been developing over the past few months.\n\nHedgeUp (HDUP) is building an investment platform. But unlike other protocols in the crypto ecosystem, this platform doesn\u2019t let you invest in cryptocurrencies. Instead, it gives you exposure to alternative assets like precious metals, rare artwork, valuable jewelry, and more.\n\nHedgeUp (HDUP) accomplishes this by tokenizing RWA into NFTs and making these asset-backed NFTs available to investors to trade. By interacting with these NFTs, users will be exposed to the underlying physical assets. Investors can also make fractional purchases. This involves buying a slice of an asset instead of the whole thing.\n\nAccording to crypto experts, HedgeUp\u2019s unique approach to tokenization has made it one of the best upcoming DeFi projects.\n\nThe HedgeUp (HDUP) presale has been live for many weeks now. It is currently in stage four, with the HDUP token available for $0.036. On top of buying into a promising project, investors who buy the presale get 30% extra tokens.\n\nClick the links below for more information about HedgeUp (HDUP) presale:\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nLegendary Bitcoiner Tuur Demeester of Adamant Research, an advisor to the largest Bitcoin-centric development studio Blockstream, accuses Ethereum (ETH) developers of lying about the scaling prospects of Ethereum's L1. Here's why some other cryptocurrency experts are not excited about the concept of proto-danksharding.\n\nStealthy pivot instead of scaling L1: Tuur Demeester slams Ethereum (ETH) devs\n\nCore developers of Ethereum (ETH), the second largest blockchain, lied about its scaling opportunities from the very beginning. All initiatives in this field were actually an \"on-chain scaling narrative,\" Mr. Demeester stated in a recent tweet.\n\nEthereum founders lied about scaling from the start. While bitcoiners took years to build L2, ETH devs sneered and pumped ETH using an on-chain scaling fairy tale. Later they stealthily pivoted. What's next? You know what they say: there's no way to tell a liar's hard-fork. pic.twitter.com/Ak1aGIp0tg \u2014 Tuur Demeester (@TuurDemeester) June 7, 2023\n\nAs such, all announcements about Etheruem (ETH) scaling concepts outside L2 solutions were just made to \"pump-and-dump\" the price of Ether, an asset of Ethereum (ETH) blockchain.\n\nWith this post, Tuur Demeester agreed with the skepticism of James Prestwitch, a founder of Storj (STORJ) protocol. Mr. Prestwitch recalled that the approach to on-chain scaling evolved from \"original\" sharding into a \"block-as-a-shard\" solution designed to make rollups by third-party devs do all the legwork.\n\nMeanwhile, Demeester stressed that Bitcoiners (BTC) spend \"years\" building real second-layer solutions.\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, recently, Ethereum (ETH) core developers approved the activation of the Cancun-Deneb upgrade in Q4, 2023.\n\nThe upgrade is designed to supercharge Ethereum (ETH) by proto-danksharding, a resource-efficient method of data logistics optimization.\n\nWhat about Bitcoin's (BTC) L2s?\n\nCancun-Deneb (or Cancun) is designed to make the computational costs for all Ethereum (ETH) L2s lower and, therefore, make the blockchain more rollup-friendly.\n\nWhile Bitcoiners (BTC) in general supported Demeester's position, some of his followers decided to strike back. They immediately started asking him about the traction of Lightning Network, the most popular Bitcoin (BTC) L2 scaling solution on payment channels.\n\nEthan Kravitz of AGE Crypto Asset Investment Funds stressed that LN failed to achieve massive adoption so far:\n\nBitcoiners have been pumping Lightning since 2017 at least. It\u2019s still unusable though looks like Lightspark is hopefully fixing that.\n\nSome of Demeester's opponents also called LN a \"coming-soon\" protocol with 100 users maximum."

Code associated with a network node crucial to this process \u2014 the sequencer \u2014 was responsible for the outage.\n\nIn order for the node to send the transactions to Ethereum, one of the two wallets associated with the node needs enough ETH to pay for transaction fees.\n\nArbitrum developers explained in a tweet thread that a \u201cmalfunction\u201d in the sequencer meant batches of transactions stopped being passed to the Ethereum mainnet. This interrupted an automated function that refilled the node\u2019s wallet with ETH for transaction fees \u2014 effectively causing transactions to pile up for hours, awaiting settlement.\n\n\u201cThe Sequencer spent the ~5 ETH it had, but the gas-refunder (which had ~250 ETH) didn\u2019t refill it until it posted a successful batch,\u201d the developers tweeted.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nDespite the incident, the group described the system as \u201cworking as intended,\u201d as the sequencer is only provided ETH if it can successfully post batches. \u201cIf there is a malfunction in the Sequencer, then it cannot spend its way through the high ETH balance of the gas refunder.\u201d\n\nThe network was back processing transactions on Ethereum mainnet as normal as of 10:00 am ET, Wednesday. Since its Nitro upgrade in August 2022, Arbitrum has encountered 8 outages of between 30 minutes and 2 hours, according to blockchain bridge developer Shotaro Granzier-Nakajima.\n\nWednesday\u2019s incident was not an outage of that magnitude, according to A.J. Warner, chief strategy Officer at Offchain Labs.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is no parallel. This was not sequencer downtime. This was a bug that caused a delay in batch posting,\u201d Warner told Blockworks. In fact, Arbitrum \u201coften delays posting to [layer-1] in times of high [layer-1] congestion,\u201d Warner said, noting that alternative zk rollups can also take several hours before posting data to Ethereum mainnet under normal operation.\n\nOffchain Labs said a full postmortem on the situation would be released later today.\n\nNews analysis by Macauley Peterson\n\nAll Ethereum layer-2\u2019s currently operating, employ a centralized sequencer \u2014 in Arbitrum\u2019s case one run by Offchain Labs. That\u2019s not the way it\u2019s meant to be forever, but moving further out on the decentralization spectrum is mostly aspirational at this stage of their development.\n\nAccording to Arbitrum\u2019s documentation, \u201ceventually, sequencing affordances could be given to a distributed committee of sequencers which come to consensus on ordering.\u201d\n\nBlockworks Research\u2019s timely report \u201cSequencers: The Key to The Rollup Investment Thesis\u201d includes the key takeaway that \u201ccentralized sequencers bring concerns surrounding liveness, censorship resistance, and regulatory arbitrage for the L2s.\u201d\n\nWednesday\u2019s incident represents a potential censorship resistance failure. No transaction batches posted \u2192 no layer-1 finality.\n\nThe sequencer was misbehaving, although it was not strictly \u201cdown\u201d and continued to process transactions without posting them to Ethereum mainnet.\n\nIn theory, there\u2019s another route to getting layer-2 transactions processed by submitting them via layer-1 into what Arbitrum calls \u201cthe delayed Inbox.\u201d That is a primary selling point of Ethereum layer-2s and the basis of the claim that they are \u201cinheriting,\u201d in some sense, the security of Ethereum\u2019s mainnet.\n\nFollowing a previous incident which did involve sequencer downtime in January 2022, the Arbitrum team wrote, \u201cthe network is designed to sustain even permanent Sequencer failures by falling back to using Ethereum to process transactions.\u201d\n\nThat wasn\u2019t necessary in this case.\n\nBe that as it may, there is still a considerable amount of trust in Offchain Labs required, even after the launch of the ARB token and initial efforts to decentralize governance.\n\nUntil fraud proofs can be validated permissionlessly, rather than via whitelisted nodes, and solutions to the decentralized sequencer are found, tested, and battle hardened, there will always be additional risks with rollups. It\u2019s a tradeoff users make for higher performance and lower transaction costs.\n\nAnd plenty of users are making that tradeoff! Funds at risk have climbed from a July 2022 trough of about $560 million to a recent peak in May of $2.55 billion.\n\nThe Arbitrum token (ARB), with a current market cap of $1.44 billion, fell roughly 5% on the news, but has recovered about half of that since.\n\nUpdated: June 8, 2023, at 10:48 am ET with comments from Offchain Labs received after publication.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Firedancer delivered good results in initial performance tests, hitting 1 million TPS.\n\nSOL dropped 10% since SEC\u2019s claim that the altcoin was security.\n\nScalability is one of the most significant barriers to blockchain progress in current times. Networks are continuously looking for new, innovative ways to improve transaction throughput so as to gain an upper hand in the competitive environment.\n\nWhile most entities opt for the modular approach i.e, splitting the functions across sidechains and layer-2 chains (L2), the Solana [SOL] network opted for a monolithic way of improving scalability at layer-1 itself, according to on-chain analytics firm Messari.\n\nThe initiative to develop Firedancer, Solana\u2019s second validator client, represents an important step in this direction.\n\n1/ Scalability is a key factor in the crypto space, with the modular approach gaining popularity. However, @Solana has taken a contrarian stance.@kelxyz_ explains how @jump_firedancer, a validator client developed by @jump_ aims to enhance Solana's monolithic approach.? pic.twitter.com/zRc3Q5wSeT \u2014 Messari (@MessariCrypto) June 6, 2023\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Solana Profit Calculator\n\nSolana on \u2018Fire\u2019\n\nSolana got into a partnership with Web3 infrastructure developer Jump Crypto in August 2022. This was to create a new validator client Firedancer, separate from the one originally built by Solana Labs. With the ambition of boosting network throughput, the project delivered good results in initial performance tests, hitting 1 million transactions per second (TPS).\n\nAmong other potential benefits of Firedancer, the first and foremost was reducing Solana\u2019s latency times significantly. This made the network conducive for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and attracting high-frequency traders. Messari stated that Solana\u2019s latency times might be reduced to 400-500 milliseconds, putting it on par with centralized exchanges (CEXs).\n\nMessari\u2019s research highlighted that if it clicks the right boxes, Firedancer had the potential to open up unexplored market space and create new demand for the Solana chain. For example, if it manages to clock 1 million TPS, Solana could attract Web2 applications like social media and financial platforms.\n\nAt the time of writing though, the \u2018Ethereum killer\u2019 processed an average of 4,000 TPS over the last seven days, per data from Solscan. The total transaction fees paid to validators to secure the network was 39.256 in the last 24 hours.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s SOL\u2019s market cap in BTC terms\n\nSOL suffers but\u2026\n\nSOL was yet to recover from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)\u2019s latest blow labeling the ninth-largest crypto asset in the market as a security. At press time, it exchanged hands at $19.85, having dropped 10% since SEC\u2019s claim, according to Santiment.\n\nSurprisingly, market sentiment for the coin turned favorable as a result of this development, going into the positive zone after a week of trading."

        "content": "Deutsche Telekom has started running a validator node for Polygon.\n\nBut it's not entirely clear what the company hopes to gain by doing so.\n\nLast week, Deutsche Telekom started running a validator node for Polygon, a top-ten blockchain by the amount of investor deposits in its DeFi ecosystem. Polygon supporters praised the blockchain\u2019s high-rolling partnership.\n\nValidators nodes, like the ones Deutsche Telekom runs, help confirm transactions sent through blockchains. Those who run them must put up some crypto as collateral to do so, or have others delegate assets to them. In return, those who put up their assets automatically receive rewards from the network.\n\nIn this sense, running validators helps keep blockchains secure.\n\nBut why is Deutsche Telekom, a technology giant associated with a bygone era, diving into the role of a Polygon validator?\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nDeutsche Telekom has a goal to become an infrastructure provider in web3, Dirk R\u00f6der, head of the Blockchain Solutions Center at Deutsche Telekom, told DL News.\n\n\u201cSupporting the Polygon network as a validator is a big milestone in this objective,\u201d he said.\n\nSupporting Ethereum by validating for Polygon?\n\nBut Deutsche Telekom has an even more specific interest in web3.\n\nThe company has \u201ca focus on the Ethereum ecosystem and its scalability solutions,\u201d and Deutsche Telekom\u2019s foray into Polygon is in line with that, R\u00f6der said.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nThe company describes Polygon as \u201cthe leading Ethereum Layer-2 scaling platform\u201d which implies that Polygon relies on Ethereum for its blockchain security like Arbitrum and Optimism. It also says the company \u201crelies on Polygon to strengthen the Ethereum ecosystem.\u201d\n\n\u201cPolygon validators sign checkpoints on the Ethereum blockchain, security is derived directly from Ethereum Layer 1 consensus, which is secured by more than 20 million ETH staked,\u201d R\u00f6der told DL News.\n\nNOW READ: LayerZero demands anonymous devs reveal identities to work on new bug bounty effort\n\nBut Deutsche Telekom\u2019s specific interest in Polygon may not accurately represent the nature of the blockchain \u2014 a concern that once led Polygon to change its marketing.\n\nPolygon initially promoted its technology as a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. However, in response to criticism from many in crypto about potential misrepresentation, the company decided to discontinue the use of such terminology.\n\nPolygon is a sidechain, which operates like an independent blockchain with no security relation with Ethereum. More specifically, some have called Polygon a \u201ccommit-chain\u201d based on the fact that it \u201ccommits\u201d its transaction history to Ethereum but does not rely on it to ensure transaction records are accurate.\n\nDefinitely an error, will correct.\n\n\n\nPolygon PoS is not an average sidechain as well.\n\n\n\nWe generally use the term scaling solutions, but sometimes employees or journalists use L2 because it's very common. Btw sidechains used to be called L2s until very recently (even by the EF). \ud83d\ude42 \u2014 Mihailo Bjelic (@MihailoBjelic) June 27, 2022\n\nR\u00f6der did not immediately reply to a question about Polygon not relying on Ethereum for its security.\n\nPolygon\u2019s assets are secured by a multi-signature wallet controlled by a group of eight individuals or entities. Signature from five of them is enough to make drastic changes to the network which secures almost $1 billion worth of assets.\n\n\u201cDecentralisation often comes at the expense of speed,\u201d R\u00f6der told DL News.\n\n\u201cAs a result, many blockchain projects initially begin in a more centralised form and gradually transition to a decentralised model,\u201d he said. \u201cPolygon follows a similar approach.\u201d\n\nBut perhaps the fact that Polygon is a sidechain, which has nothing to do with Ethereum, doesn\u2019t matter for Deutsche Telekom that much. After all, the company\u2019s not an Ethereum maximalist \u2014 it supports six different blockchains.\n\nIn addition to Polygon, Deutsche Telekom runs validators for major and minor blockchains including Ethereum, Q, Celo, Flow, and Energy Web. It also contributes to Chainlink\u2019s oracle node network which helps DeFi apps receive data from outside sources.\n\nNOW READ: Montenegro leaders turn on crypto after Vitalik\u2019s Zuzalu fest. The reason: Do Kwon\n\nRunning a validator node itself is not an overly complex task. Many are hosted in giant data centres run by companies like Amazon Web Services for a small fee.\n\nHowever, many of the blockchains Deutsche Telekom supports don\u2019t let everyone run a validator. You need a special invite for that.\n\nIn the case of Polygon, one of Deutsche Telekom\u2019s recent additions, the network comprises only 100 hand-picked validators like Deutsche Telekom. In comparison, Ethereum, where anyone can spin up a validator at home or host one at a data centre, has over 700,000 validators.\n\n\u2018Infrastructure, not asset management\u2019\n\nWhat Europe\u2019s largest telecommunications company\u2019s strategy from running validators is remains unclear.\n\nR\u00f6der emphasised that blockchain technology presents a \u201cvalid business case.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe expression \u2018valid business case\u2019 refers to our business model. Deutsche Telekom runs web3 infrastructure and receives percentages of the rewards,\u201d R\u00f6der told DL News.\n\nBut according to another Deutsche Telekom representative, the company does not stake any of its own crypto assets, and instead relies on others to do so and takes a cut of their rewards.\n\n\u201cOur business is infrastructure, not asset management,\u201d the other representative said.\n\n\u201cWe are getting paid to provide rock solid infrastructure to asset holders. Those people use our infrastructure to delegate their tokens and we receive a commission for our service from those rewards.\u201d\n\nNOW READ: Everything is about to change at MakerDAO: Rune Christensen on his Endgame plan\n\nThis week, it announced it was doing the same for the lesser-known Energy Web blockchain.\n\nBut some think that Deutsche Telekom buddying up with blockchains could be more of a marketing strategy than anything else.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting because they\u2019ve been fairly active in crypto for years,\u201d Santiago Santos, a crypto angel investor, told DL News.\n\nSantos speculated on what might be behind the move. \u201cPresumably, some angle to be relevant with their young user base,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s probably cool to run a validator."

The reason was a bug that led to the blockchain\u2019s centrally-controlled sequencer to run out of funds to pay for gas.\n\n\u201cThere was a bug that occurred on the Sequencer that led to its batches reverting on-chain. When the batches revert, the Sequencer is not refunded the gas cost for sending the batch,\u201d Patrick McCorry, a developer at the Arbitrum Foundation, told DL News.\n\nWhen that happens, he said, the Sequencer runs out of ETH, \u201cand when the bug was fixed, it was manually topped up again.\u201d\n\nAt around 11:40 am London time developers in the Arbitrum Discord server started reporting that they could not connect to the network\u2019s Sequencer \u2014 a piece of software which bundles up transactions and sends them to the Ethereum network for confirmation.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nLayer 2 blockchains like Arbitrum need to send transactions back to Ethereum to achieve finality, meaning the transactions are inscribed on the Ethereum blockchain forever and cannot be changed.\n\nOn-chain records show that the Sequencer used up its stock of Ether, the Ethereum-native cryptocurrency used to pay transaction fees on the network. With no Ether to pay for fees, the Sequencer could not send transactions to Ethereum, bringing Arbitrum to a standstill.\n\nArbitrum Sequencer Transactions today (parsec)\n\nArbitrum currently has only one Sequencer that processes transactions. It\u2019s run by Offchain Labs, the company which created and stewards the network.\n\nAfter failing to process transactions for approximately an hour, Arbitrum now appears to be working again.

        "title": "InQubeta (QUBE) Presale is Rapidly Gaining Popularity in the Crypto Market Among Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH ... - BSC NEWS",
        "content": "AI-linked cryptocurrencies like InQubeta are gaining attention from both traditional and crypto investors, driven by the limitless growth potential of the AI sector.\n\nThe InQubeta (QUBE) presale is getting lots of attention from Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) holders. Bitcoin and Ethereum have enjoyed substantial growth in 2023, with prices rising by as much as 40% at some point. However, their prices seem to be stalling out as an increasing number of BTC and ETH holders swap some of their crypto for InQubeta.\n\nIt\u2019s the rational thing to do since InQubeta investors are set to 4x their portfolio during the presale\u2019s ten stages. Prices start at $0.0007 during the presale\u2019s beta stage and rise to $0.028 by its end. Prices are expected to shoot up exponentially once QUBE is officially launched.\n\nThe success of the InQubeta presale mirrors the growing number of investments poured into the artificial intelligence (AI) industry in the past several decades, going from $12.75 billion in 2015 to $119 billion in 2022. Investments in the sector are expected to rise exponentially by 2030 to $1.5 trillion. With so much money being funneled into the AI industry, it only makes sense that a portion is being poured into AI-driven cryptocurrencies like InQubeta that help to push the technology\u2019s development.\n\nInQubeta presale outperforming projections\n\nArtificial intelligence has gone from an interesting sci-fi concept to reality in the past decades. Ideas that once seemed scientifically impossible like self-driving cars are now being mass-produced. Many tech experts are already predicting AI will be the next major technological breakthrough that will significantly impact how the world operates.\n\nThe internet was the last major technological breakthrough that drastically changed many industries. For example, Amazon went on to dominate the retail industry despite not owning any storefronts, reducing its overhead and allowing further expansion. Today Amazon is worth over a trillion dollars. Investors who purchased equity in Amazon during its initial public offering have enjoyed exponential profits. A $10,000 investment in 1997 would be worth about $2.2 million today.\n\nJust like early investors in internet-based businesses went on to enjoy substantial profits, so will those who purchase equity in promising artificial intelligence startups that go on to change the world.\n\nInQubeta (QUBE) is helping to push the AI revolution by developing a platform that allows investors to bypass the unreasonable barriers often associated with traditional investment channels like unreasonable minimum deposits.\n\nCompanies create fractionalized ERC-20 tokens that represent equity and other bonuses on InQubeta\u2019s blockchain. These non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are listed on the marketplace where investors can purchase tokens of companies they think have bright futures. These purchases are made with $QUBE tokens, the platform\u2019s deflationary native currency. A 2% tax is added to all marketplace transactions and sent to burn wallets to lower the supply of tokens. Investors can also earn rewards on the platform by staking their cryptos.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\nBitcoin\u2019s (BTC) growth stalls\n\nBitcoin had a great run in early 2023, but prices have recently stalled. Bitcoin remains the most popular cryptocurrency on the planet, despite the problems older blockchains have like slower transactions and higher speeds. Still early Bitcoin investors have been turned into millionaires and billionaires, Many crypto experts still expect Bitcoin to grow significantly in the future.\n\nEthereum (ETH) mirroring Bitcoin\n\nEthereum\u2019s growth has been virtually identical to the growth Bitcoin has enjoyed this year. Ethereum was the first cryptocurrency to allow for the creation of smart contracts and decentralized apps. It uses a proof-of-work (PoW) protocol and hosts many other cryptocurrencies, including InQubeta\u2019s platform. ETH remains one of the top altcoins, but investors are dumping it in favor of InQubeta which has more room for growth.\n\nSummary\n\nThe verdict is in; a growing number of traditional and cryptocurrency investors are giving AI-linked cryptocurrencies like InQubeta lots of attention. The sector\u2019s limitless growth potential is one of the main factors driving this, with total investments in the artificial intelligence space expected to grow to $1.5 trillion by 2030.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale"

        "content": "Thu 08 Jun 2023 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by La R\u00e9daction C.\n\nWhat surprises does the crypto market hold for us? While it is impossible to answer this question with certainty, analysts cannot resist making predictions and speculations. Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe is one of those experts who taps into his knowledge to examine possible scenarios and shares his conclusions with his numerous followers. His latest prediction suggests a potential upward trend for two cryptocurrencies: Litecoin (LTC) and Ether (ETH).\n\nLitecoin (LTC) price: Surging to unprecedented heights since 2021?\n\nMicha\u00ebl van de Poppe made headlines last May by predicting a surge for Bitcoin amidst a banking crisis. Tireless, the renowned analyst now turns his attention to two altcoins.\n\nIn a recent video published on his YouTube channel, he first predicts a breakthrough for Litecoin (LTC). And the catalyst for this potential surge is none other than the upcoming halving, according to Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe.\n\nHe states, \u201cLitecoin (LTC) is also doing very well. It is destined for a breakout. I believe the halving will occur in (August), which means we still have six to eight weeks before it takes place. I think a very strong rally is certainly likely if it surpasses $100. If it goes beyond $100\u2026, then I suppose it will peak around $160 to $180.\u201d\n\nWhile we wait for Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe\u2019s envisioned scenario to unfold, the price of Litecoin (LTC) is currently at $88.37 (at the time of writing this article).\n\nEther (ETH) not falling behind?\n\nFurther into his analysis, Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe asserts that Ether might follow in Litecoin\u2019s (LTC) footsteps. According to the expert, ETH could also appreciate in value. For this to happen, it is crucial for it to maintain its resistance level at $1800.\n\nMicha\u00ebl van de Poppe believes that if it manages to surpass the immediate resistance at $1903, it can skyrocket and reach $2800. Meanwhile, Ether (ETH) is trading at $1846.41.\n\nMicha\u00ebl van de Poppe\u2019s prediction should delight holders of both cryptocurrencies. But be cautious not to rejoice too soon because another equally renowned analyst, Benjamin Cowen, predicts a decline in altcoins.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "In a significant development for the Ethereum network, developers reached a consensus on Thursday regarding the full scope of an upcoming upgrade known as \u201cDencun.\u201d\n\nExpected to be implemented later this year, this hard fork will incorporate five Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) aimed at enhancing data storage capabilities and reducing transaction fees.\n\nOne of the key components of the upgrade is EIP-4844, colloquially referred to as proto-danksharding. This groundbreaking feature intends to scale the blockchain by creating additional space for data \u201cblobs.\u201d\n\nThis expansion is anticipated to result in reduced gas fees for layer 2 rollups, a significant improvement for its scalability.\n\nAs part of the upgrade, in addition to proto-danksharding, several other Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) have been chosen for integration.\n\nOne of these is EIP-1153, which aims to decrease fees related to on-chain data storage, ultimately improving blockspace and transaction efficiency. Another selected proposal is EIP-4788, which focuses on enhancing the design of bridges and staking pools to enhance interoperability and usability within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nAdditionally, EIP-5656 suggests minor code modifications to the Ethereum Virtual Machine to streamline and optimize the platform\u2019s execution capabilities. Lastly, EIP-6780 is designed to eliminate code that could potentially terminate smart contracts, reinforcing the reliability and robustness of ETH\u2019s smart contract ecosystem.\n\nRelease Date: Ethereum Dev Expected To Go Live by End of 2023\n\nDuring the All Core Developers Execution Layer 163 call, Tim Beiko, the protocol support lead at the Ethereum Foundation, emphasized that no additional elements would be included in the fork. This commitment ensures that the upgrade remains focused and aligned with the outlined objectives.\n\nAlthough an exact date for the hard fork implementation has not been announced, the ETH community expects the Dencun upgrade to go live by the end of 2023. Notably, Dencun will encompass simultaneous upgrades occurring on both sides of the blockchain.\n\nThe execution layer will undergo the \u201cCancun\u201d upgrade, which primarily addresses protocol rules, while the consensus layer, responsible for block validation, will undergo its own separate fork known as \u201cDeneb.\u201d The term \u201cDencun\u201d is a clever amalgamation of these two simultaneous upgrades.\n\nThe agreement among Ethereum developers on the scope of the Dencun upgrade signifies a significant milestone in Ethereum\u2019s ongoing evolution.\n\nAs the network continues to refine its infrastructure, users, and stakeholders eagerly await the implementation of these improvements, which are expected to enhance scalability and reduce transaction costs.\n\nRelated Reading | Binance\u2019s Cosmic Connection: Manta Network Co-Founder\u2019s Journey of Inspiration"

We explore the implications of this anticipated event and its significance for coins like ApeMax, Ethereum, and other players in the crypto market.\n\nThis comprehensive guide has been meticulously compiled through extensive market analysis and research to provide you with valuable insights. From ApeMax, an innovative new token with unique staking opportunities, to well-established giants like Ethereum and Bitcoin, this guide equips you with the knowledge necessary to make informed decisions in the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrencies. By drawing from expert opinions, crypto trends, in-depth analysis, and market data, we aim to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of the current crypto landscape.\n\nApeMax, a new notable entrant in the crypto space, has been generating significant buzz with its presale launch. Designed with innovative tokenomics and a focus on staking, ApeMax offers a promising avenue for users to earn rewards and actively participate in the growth of the ecosystem. In this guide, we investigate further into the specifics of ApeMax\u2019s presale, highlighting its unique features, advantages, and the potential it holds within the broader market.\n\nBy the end of this guide, you will be well-prepared to navigate the thrilling world of crypto presales and the potential Bull Market. However, it is important to approach these opportunities with caution and a comprehensive understanding of the risks involved and never to spend more than what you can afford to lose.\n\nWhen is the next crypto Bull Run?\n\nThe timing of the next bull run in the crypto market remains a topic of speculation and debate among experts and analysts. While many propose that summer 2023 could be a potential timeframe for the anticipated surge, others suggest that it might occur as late as the end of 2024. One factor that could potentially ignite a bull run is the introduction of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) in the Chinese market, which has the potential to generate significant market activity. However, it is important to approach predictions regarding the bull run with caution and skepticism, as accurately pinpointing its exact timing is virtually impossible.\n\nAttempting to predict the onset of a bull run is akin to foreseeing the future, an inherently challenging and unpredictable task. While experts and analysts offer their insights and theories, it is crucial for individuals to exercise caution and not rely solely on these claims. The crypto market is highly dynamic and influenced by a multitude of factors, making it difficult to determine when the bull run will actually materialize. A prudent approach involves conducting thorough research, staying informed about market trends, and making informed decisions based on one\u2019s own risk tolerance and investment goals.\n\nWhat is the ApeMax presale?\n\nThe ApeMax presale presents an exciting opportunity for cryptocurrency enthusiasts to acquire ApeMax coins at advantageous prices. By participating in the presale, you can secure ApeMax tokens at discounted prices. Early adopters not only gain access to ApeMax at favorable rates but also have the chance to enjoy additional perks such as Early Birds Loot Boxes, which offer discounted tokens. These incentives provide compelling opportunities to purchase ApeMax during the presale phase.\n\nWhat will happen during the next crypto bull run?\n\nDuring a bull run in the cryptocurrency market, we can typically expect a surge in network activity and heightened interest in DEFI technology. The increased optimism often leads to the emergence of new projects, including NFTs and altcoins, as well as a broader range of opportunities and new and often unanticipated applications. As the bull run gains momentum, there tends to be more news coverage and buzz surrounding the crypto industry, attracting attention from mainstream media and the general public. This increased visibility often contributes to the wider adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the dynamics of a bull run are highly unpredictable. While certain trends may be observed historically, it remains impossible to accurately forecast the specific outcomes or which cryptocurrencies will experience significant price increases. Therefore, it is crucial to approach claims about specific coins or guaranteed gains during the bull run with skepticism. Instead, individuals interested in the technology and user adoption should focus on exploring the new and exciting developments occurring within the crypto space, keeping a balanced perspective on the potential risks and rewards associated with cryptocurrency investments.\n\nWrapping Up\n\nIn conclusion, the anticipation of the next bull run in the cryptocurrency market has generated both excitement and speculation. While many experts and analysts propose potential timelines, such as summer 2023 or even later, the exact timing remains uncertain. During a bull run, we can expect increased network activity, the introduction of new projects like NFTs and altcoins, as well as heightened news coverage and adoption of cryptocurrencies.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to approach claims about guaranteed gains and specific price predictions with caution, as the market is inherently volatile and unpredictable.\n\nAs buyers navigate this volatile landscape, opportunities like the ApeMax presale offer a chance to acquire tokens at discounted rates, taking advantage of early adoption potential. It is essential to conduct thorough research, exercise skepticism, and make informed decisions to maximize the benefits of participating in the crypto market.\n\nIt is important to verify ApeMax\u2019s availability in your country as this token is not available to buyers from specific countries. The full list of countries is available on the ApeMax website.\n\nApeMax Official Website: https://apemax.io/\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.
