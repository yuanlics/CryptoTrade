        "content": "The primary architect of the Celo blockchain, cLabs, plans to \u201creturn home\u201d as an Ethereum layer-2 network using the Optimism stack.\n\ncLabs said the decision had come after months of research and initial discussions with stakeholders, alongside technical development in rollups. The team announced it Saturday during the Ethereum Community Conference in Paris.\n\n\u201cIt has become a viable path by which to allow Celo to align even more closely with Ethereum \u2014 by connecting trustlessly with it and leveraging its economic security,\u201d cLabs said.\n\nIn an optimistic rollup, transactions are first processed off-chain and considered valid even before they\u2019re settled on Ethereum mainnet, a process which happens in batches \u2014 hence the term \u201coptimistic.\u201d\n\ncLabs is also planning to incorporate EigenDA, a data availability layer sourced from re-staking project EigenLayer. The move would aim to reduce network storage expenses.\n\nThe team intends to design a decentralized sequencer for use by Celo\u2019s existing validators. The network\u2019s native token would still be used for governance. CELO, which started out on Ethereum as an ERC-20, has jumped 11% today to a $300 million market cap.\n\nCelo has lost about half of its market cap over the past year\n\nDetailed in the project\u2019s governance forum, Berlin-headquartered cLabs said adopting a rollup model for Celo could help the network grow.\n\nCelo mainnet, which is EVM-compatible, launched on Earth Day in 2020 \u2014 around two and a half years before Ethereum ditched proof of work for the less energy-intensive proof of stake. Celo says it\u2019s carbon negative via an offset program with Wren, a subscription startup for reducing carbon footprints.\n\nThe upgrade will eventually come as a hard fork, the team said. End users shouldn\u2019t notice if everything goes well.

        "content": "Fidelity Digital Assets released a \u201cQ2 2023 Signals Report\u201d on July 18, which claimed that Ether\u2019s outlook for the next 12 months and the long term is positive. Year-to-date, Ether (ETH) has gained 62%, but while the investment firm might be short-term bullish on Ether, that does not mean it believes that the month-long bullish channel will be sustained.\n\nWhile institutional investors like Fidelity Digital Assets may have a bullish longer-term vision for ETH's price, let\u2019s compare their analysis against network and market data to see if they\u2019re on the money.\n\nEther/USD 1-day price index. Source: TradingView\n\nBeyond the technical indicators, the rationale behind Fidelity\u2019s bullish outlook for Ether is the network\u2019s higher burn rate versus coin issuance, the \u201cnew address momentum\u201d and a growth in the number of network validators.\n\nFidelity \u201cQ2 2023 Signals Report,\u201d July 18. Source: Fidelity Digital Assets\n\nAccording to the Fidelity report, the net issuance since the Merge in September 2022 resulted in a net supply decrease of more than 700,000 Ether. Additionally, the analysts claim that Glassnode data showing an increasing number of Ethereum addresses that transacted for the first time ever proves healthy network adoption.\n\nThe report also points to a 15% increase in the number of active Ethereum validators in the second quarter.\n\nThe expectation around EIP-1153 is also building momentum for the Ethereum network, as the \u201ctransient storage opcode\u201d improves smart contract efficiency, reduces costs and amplifies the Ethereum Virtual Machine design. The change is especially meaningful for decentralized exchanges (DEXs), where Ethereum\u2019s dominance declined to 46% from 60% six months prior, according to DefiLlama data.\n\nDencun upgrade expected to reduce transaction costs\n\nAnother potentially bullish factor for the Ethereum network is the anticipated upgrade on the leading DEX, Uniswap. According to a July 17 presentation at the Ethereum Community Conference, the upcoming Uniswap v4 will allow users to build unlimited types of pools using programmable buttons (hooks), native ETH support and a singleton contract that performs internal transactions before settling final balances.\n\nThe announcement fueled the likelihood that EIP-1153 will be included in the next \u201cDencun\u201d upgrade, which triggered Slingshot and DeFi Pulse co-founder Scott Lewis.\n\ni had missed the news that uniswap labs got eip1153 into cancun.\n\n\n\nthey kept the details for wanting eip1153 secret from the community, only publishing v4 only after inclusion was finalized.\n\n\n\ninformal governance captured by an insider-aligned, for-profit monopoly. sad day. \u2014 scottlewis.canto\u2795 (@scott_lew_is) June 13, 2023\n\nIf approved, the implementation will be vital for the Ethereum network to recoup the market share lost due to high gas fees, as the seven-day average transaction cost has been above $4 since February. Consequently, Ethereum\u2019s total value locked has dropped to its lowest level since April 2020, at 13.55 million ETH, according to DefiLlama.\n\nMoreover, decentralized application activity has dwindled, as shown by DappRadar\u2019s unique active wallets\u2019 30-day data: Uniswap, minus 28%; 1inch Network, minus 14%; MetaMask Swap, minus 8%; and OpenSea, minus 5%. As a comparison, in the same period, BNB Smart Chain\u2019s PancakeSwap gained 10%, and Polygon\u2019s Uniswap users increased 8%.\n\nDerivatives metrics remain flat\n\nEther quarterly futures have been signaling unease among professional traders. Those fixed-month contracts typically trade at a 5% to 10% premium compared to spot markets to compensate for the delayed settlement, a situation known as contango.\n\nEther 3-month futures premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nAccording to data from Laevitas, the Ether three-month futures premium currently stands at 4%, which is below the neutral threshold and lower than the 5.5% level seen on July 14. This indicator is clear evidence that traders are less inclined to use leverage for bullish ETH positions.\n\nMore concerningly, Ether\u2019s 59% gains year-to-date might have caused investors to become overly optimistic. A recent survey from CryptoVantage of 1,000 North Americans that invested in cryptocurrencies over the past five years found that 46% named Ether as the top contender to surpass Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nRelated: Bitcoin rally will lead to \"speculative blow-off top\u201d in 2024, Mark Yusko predicts\n\nCoins with the best chances of surpassing Bitcoin. Source: 2023 CryptoVantage survey\n\nThis is a somewhat startling point of view, but it could be misleading since the survey did not ask whether any coin would eventually flip Bitcoin, so respondents don\u2019t necessarily place strong odds on this outcome.\n\nFidelity\u2019s analysis has given valid reasons for why the firm is bullish on Ether\u2019s 12-month price performance, but in the shorter term, the recurrent high gas fees and lack of interest from leverage buyers signal increased odds of the Ether price breaking below the channel support.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "Not that long ago, the Ethereum blockchain underwent the Shanghai and Capella upgrades; the former impacted ETH\u2019s execution layer, while the latter targeted the Consensus Layer. The network upgrades seem to have pushed Ethereum\u2019s price higher, attracting a lot of investors (and speculators) in the cryptocurrency market. If you haven\u2019t considered this asset class in the past, it\u2019s high time you take ETH seriously. As you learn more about how to buy Ethereum, you\u2019ll find that it\u2019s better to purchase tokens on an exchange; it\u2019s your responsibility to pay the gas fees.\n\nEthereum\u2019s developers have proven they\u2019re committed to steadily improving the network. The much-awaited Shapella Upgrade is live, and ETH has many more upgrades in the pipeline to enhance scalability, security, and sustainability. Surprising or not, developers are preparing for the upcoming upgrade on the Ethereum Mainnet, the Dencun upgrade, that will reduce transaction fees, expected in late 2023. If all goes as hoped, it will enable new use cases. According to Tim Beiko, Protocol Support for the Ethereum Foundation, the developers are in the final stages of planning for Dencun, having a provisional set of EIPs.\n\nWhat\u2019s New in The Recent Ethereum Upgrade?\n\nThe Dencun upgrade combines two upgrades, namely Deneb (the Execution Layer upgrade) and Cancun (the Consensus Layer upgrade). Some of the main improvement proposals considered for inclusion are:\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nEIP-4844 . Also referred to as Proto-Danksharding, EIP-4844 introduces temporary \u201cdata blobs\u201d to the Beacon Chain for a short period of time. The format will be fully compatible with that used in full sharding. This proposal will lower the gas cost of Layer 2 transactions considerably. The new transaction format, i.e., the blob, is contained within the Prismatic Client, but not the execution environment.\n\n.

It deactivates the SELF DESTRUCT opcode, which allows for creating and erasing contracts within a single transaction. The issue of not knowing what storage to delete doesn\u2019t occur. The operation sends all the ETH in an account to the caller, excluding when SELF DESTRUCT is called within the same transaction a contract was created.\n\n.

This proposal brings about two new opcodes, namely TSTORE and TLOAD, which enable storage to be used provisionally. Transient storage is more affordable since it doesn\u2019t require disk access and allows better smart contract designs. Use cases include single-transaction ERC-20 approvals and re-entry locks.\n\n.

Transient storage is more affordable since it doesn\u2019t require disk access and allows better smart contract designs. Use cases include single-transaction ERC-20 approvals and re-entry locks. EIP-6475. Simple Serialize types are introduced to represent Optional [T] values. SSZ structures with optional values can be represented with the idiomatic types of the underlying programming languages. Using simple serialize encoding, developers guarantee transaction formats are forward-compatible.\n\nBesides the EIPs that are formally part of the Dencun upgrade, client teams have proposals that might be included. Let\u2019s take EIP-2537 as an example. It focuses on the BLS12-381 curve, used for signatures within Ethereum 2.0. There\u2019s no denying that Dencun is an essential step in Ethereum\u2019s development, but let\u2019s not forget that it\u2019s still a work in progress.\n\nEthereum Is Undergoing a Period of Tremendous Transformation\n\nPeople are becoming increasingly comfortable with blockchain technology, and the more they use it, the more they rely on it. As Ethereum advances, we continue to see more changes; it\u2019s hard, if not impossible, to anticipate its next move. Over the years, ETH has managed to adapt as new ideas have emerged from research and development, positioning itself as a powerful contender in the cryptocurrency industry. It faces regular updates meant to improve its technical capabilities, mainly realized with hard forks. Once the Dencun upgrade is live, Ethereum will undergo three critical updates: the Verge, the Purge, and the Splurge.\n\nThe Verge upgrade attempts to reduce the amount of data that validators must store on their machines; it will introduce Verkle trees for vector commitments and stateless protocols to make the Ethereum network more lightweight. As highlighted by Vitalik Buterin, it will be possible to launch nodes without having hundreds of gigabytes on your computer. The Purge upgrade is expected to remove legacy transactions and data from the post-Merge era when ETH relied on the Proof of Work consensus mechanism. Nodes will require less storage and bandwidth to sync with the network. What is more, the Purge will introduce sharding, used to disperse data among the nodes for effective management of big data.\n\nFinally, yet importantly, the Splurge upgrade aims to boost scalability and efficiency via rollups, a type of Layer 2 solutions that perform transaction execution outside the blockchain. It can be defined as a series of smaller upgrades striving to ensure the network runs as smoothly as possible. In other words, the Splurge combines several improvements that weren\u2019t included in the earlier upgrades. By the time the Verge, the Purge, and the Splurge are over, Ethereum will be different from what we know today.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nWrapping It Up\n\nFor the time being, it\u2019s impossible to determine how the Dencun upgrade will impact the Ethereum network. From experience, we know that upgrades are applauded by the cryptocurrency community, so a surge in ETH deposits isn\u2019t out of the ordinary. It\u2019s highly unlikely there will be a decline in daily activity, but maybe there won\u2019t be as many NFTs traded on the Ethereum network. While not quite as big as the Merge, the Dencun upgrade constitutes a significant change to ETH; the first testnet fork should be announced soon. There\u2019s still room for other changes to the network, and only time will tell what EIPs developers will include.\n\nAs far as the timing of the Dencun upgrade is concerned, it\u2019s impossible to make a rough estimate until the scope is finalized. Ethereum is still below the $2000 level it reached in April this year, and median gas fees hit a 12-month high due to the resurgence of meme coins. The fast rise of the pepecoin (PEPE) has turned into profit, as those undeterred by the warnings transact on Ethereum, helping the network earn more money. As gas fees increase, more tokens are burnt, which translates into the fact that Ethereum is a deflationary asset. Analysts, nevertheless, are concerned about pepecoin ownership."

        "title": "Proto-Danksharding Is Going to Change Ethereum Completely\u2014And for The Better - Bitrates",
        "content": "A significant improvement to Ethereum is scheduled for later this year: proto-danksharding, the first step on the path to danksharding.\n\nLast year, Ethereum faced a seemingly impossible task \u2013 migrating from the Proof of Work consensus algorithm to the Proof of Stake (PoS) system, which reduced energy consumption by 99.95%. It managed to switch to a completely new design without disrupting the previous blockchain network. In spite of this achievement, there will be more upgrades to the network to improve scalability and ensure evolution. One of the most significant improvements to Ethereum is scheduled for later this year. We're talking about proto-danksharding, the first step on the path to danksharding. Even if rollups can help reduce fees for many Ethereum users, they're inadequate in the long term due to various technical difficulties. Danksharding encourages rollups to use the backspace by lowering the cost.\n\nEIP-4844 Will Benefit Ethereum and Other Layer 2 Rollup Solutions\n\nThe Ethereum Improvement Proposal 4844, also referred to as the Cancun upgrade, introduces a new type of transaction containing a considerable amount of data that can't be retrieved during the Ethereum Virtual Machine execution but whose commitment can be accessed. With EIP-4844, Ethereum is progressing unto an architecture called sharding, which involves splitting the blockchain into tinier, livelier blockchains so that it can handle more transactions. The aim is to scale computation without impacting decentralization and security. Therefore, data must be stored efficiently (and be easily retrievable to end users). Attention must be paid to the fact that sharding and danksharding are interrelated, but they're not one and the same thing. Danksharding represents a means to an end: dividing networks in an effort to scale Ethereum.\n\nTo implement the complete sharding roadmap, blob-carrying transactions are used. A blob refers to partitioned data across bytes, from left to right, enabled by a KZG commitment. Making a cryptographic commitment is just like a promise in that you commit to a statement and demonstrate later that you were abiding by it. A constant-sized polynomial commitment scheme was introduced in 2010 \u2013 it goes by the name of KZG. Even opening multiple evaluations requires only a constant amount of communication overhead. Back on topic, the blobs can help alleviate Ethereum's network burden, growing largely enough to accommodate moderate pieces of data. The blobs are coupled with the Beacon Chain, so the data from the new transaction format is downloadable by all consensus nodes.\n\nTransactions Carrying Blobs Allow Layer 2 Solutions to Retrieve the Data in A Manageable Timeframe\n\nBig data applications require high-performance storage, not to mention transaction support. The blob storage system retains essential consistency and high throughput under heavy access. Blob-carrying transactions don't compete with the gas usage of standard transactions, although they function similarly. A blob enables two batches of transactions in Layer 2 networks, so it's critical to Ethereum's future. Indeed, Layer 2 networks have allowed transaction-heavy applications to overcome the Mainnet's gas fees, but additional scaling is required at the network level. To be clear, danksharding isn't meant to reduce the need for Layer 2 scaling Solutions.\n\nThe Dencun Upgrade Is Nearing the Final Stages of Planning\n\nDencun covers two individual upgrades: Cancun, the upgrade to Ethereum's execution Layer, and Deneb, which targets the consensus layer of Ethereum. Besides proto-danksharding, a few minor code changes to the Ethereum Virtual Machine. The other EIPs that made the proposals are:\n\nEIP-1153 - to introduce transient storage opcode that improves efficiency and reduces costs; it enables cleaner smart contracts, saves lots of gas, and simplifies the EVM design\n\n- to introduce transient storage opcode that improves efficiency and reduces costs; it enables cleaner smart contracts, saves lots of gas, and simplifies the EVM design EIP-4788 - to expose data about the Beacon Chain to the execution layer for permissionless access by smart contracts, improving designs for bridges\n\n- to expose data about the Beacon Chain to the execution layer for permissionless access by smart contracts, improving designs for bridges EIP-5656 - to introduce a new EVM instruction for efficient copying of memory areas\n\n- to introduce a new EVM instruction for efficient copying of memory areas EIP-6780 - to recover funds to the caller but not delete the account; basically, it eliminates code that could terminate smart contracts\n\nEthereum developer Mario Havel stated that Dencun is approaching the final stages of planning during the ETH conference in Spain. The upgrade will hand over the responsibility of storing complete information about the blockchain's state to a dedicated \"archival node,\" which will support a more extensive set of full nodes to store less data. The following upgrade will be the Verge, which will include Verkle trees. At any rate, Ethereum developers will soon release an in-depth specs document that includes test vectors for the Dencun upgrade.\n\nBlockchain architecture is complex (and the Ethereum Roadmap even more so)\n\nThe use of blockchain technology in software development helps create more secure and transparent systems. The blockchain is a complex structure with numerous components, but the Ethereum Roadmap is more complicated in nature. With the arrival of the Merge, Ethereum went from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake, opening the door for Ethereum 2.0 and advancing the evolution of cryptocurrency. The Shapella hard fork was an important milestone on the network roadmap. Still, it's just one step towards a fully scalable Ethereum ecosystem. The Dencun hard fork will implement proto-danksharding in the fourth quarter of 2023, allowing rollups to add cheaper data to the blocks and reduce network fees.\n\nThe blobs set the foundation for data sharding. To be more precise, instead of having separate sidechains, there's only one chain with a huge amount of information. Ethereum will leverage KZG commitments as its polynomial commitment scheme. It's called a commitment because the elliptic curve point is sent to a verifier, who can't alter the polynomial they're working with. They can only provide valid proof. The blobs will store data for a limited amount of time, so they won't come in contact with the Ethereum Virtual Machine even if its contents and availability can be verified by it.\n\nIt's expected that the Ethereum Roadmap will change as new information and technology become available. The Merge was the first step in Vitalik Buterin's big-picture thinking, meaning it's not the last. The network will enter a state of progressive improvements, with efforts focused on a certain point: scalability. As Ethereum's founder put it:\n\nIt is really central to the problems that are preventing a lot of the cryptocurrency and blockchain applications that we dream of going mainstream."

        "content": "Ethena, a crypto start-up, has achieved a significant milestone by securing an impressive $6 million in seed funding, according to a report from Axios. The funding round, led by prominent investment firm Dragonfly, demonstrates growing interest in Ethena's cutting-edge stablecoin project.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThus, in response to the challenges faced by previous stablecoin ventures, the start-up has developed a unique approach to ensuring its stablecoin, known as USDe, maintains a stable value relative to the U.S. dollar. By employing Ethereum derivatives and a hedging mechanism, Ethena aims to ensure that the value of USDe remains pegged to the dollar.\n\nThe difference\n\nThe key to this solution lies in the innovative use of collateral from users, allowing the platform to effectively hedge price exposure through shorting Ethereum via perpetual swaps. Through a balanced combination of staked ETH and derivatives, Ethena aims to neutralize any potential gains or losses, safeguarding the stability of USDe.\n\nThe start-up wants to distinguish itself from previous attempts at algorithmic stablecoins, such as the infamous Terra Luna. Moreover, Ethena's approach sets it apart from current stablecoin leaders USDC and USDT, which predominantly rely on traditional fiat-based assets like bills and bonds.\n\nThe success of Ethena's funding round is further amplified by the support it has garnered from prominent players in the cryptocurrency industry. Notable investors include big crypto exchanges and, additionally, Arthur Hayes. The founder of BitMEX and his family office have provided crucial backing to the project. This is especially noteworthy since Hayes himself has advocated for the development of an algorithmic stablecoin backed by Bitcoin derivatives, known as NakaDollar."

        "title": "Ethereum: What $10B worth ETH burned means for the network - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "The value of ETH burned since 2021 approached $10 billion.\n\nGas usage on the Ethereum network dropped due to low activity.\n\nSince the implementation of Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1559 (EIP-1559), an upgrade aimed at improving the network\u2019s transaction fee mechanism, Ethereum [ETH] has witnessed a significant amount of ETH being burned.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nThe mechanism, which reduces the supply of ETH, has resulted in the burning of nearly $10 billion worth of ETH tokens, Dune Analytics revealed.\n\nCoping with the hope\n\nImplemented in August 2021, the Ethereum team developed EIP-1559 as one of the London Hark Fork Improvement Proposals. This happened alongside EIP-3554, 3198, 3529, and EIP-3541.\n\nAll these developments happened in preparation for its transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS). For EIP-1559, the objective was to get rid of the previous fee market mechanism relating to its main gas fee calculation.\n\nWhile many users had hoped that the development would reduce gas fees on the network, it didn\u2019t. Instead, it brought about a discrete base fee, aimed at prioritizing transactions when validating blocks.\n\nFurther information from Dune, the analytics platforms showed that projects like Uniswap [UNI], Circle [USDC], and NFT marketplace OpenSea, played vital roles in the increase.\n\nAt press time, nearly 300,00 ETH each had been burned via Uniswap and OpenSea. And the reason for this is clear. Uniswap maintained its position as the leading Decentralized Exchange (DEX).\n\nSo, a lot of ETH swaps with other tokens influenced its rise. For OpenSea, its place as the number on the Ethereum-based marketplace puts it in the aforementioned positions. As for USDC, its position as the favored stablecoin in DEXes helped up its rank.\n\nGas usage falls\n\nHowever, Ethereum gas used had decreased as of this writing. According to Santiment, the ETH gas used was 16.05 billion. Used gas usage spikes when there\u2019s a lot of activity on the network.\n\nAnd this demand for ETH causes a rise in gas prices. So, the fall in usage reflects a relatively less busy period for the Ethereum network.\n\nOn looking at the network growth, the on-chain data provider revealed that the metric had decreased sharply. Typically, network growth measures the rate of adoption and influx of new users into a network.\n\nSo, when the network growth increases, it means that a project has impressive traction. However, when the metric decreases, it implies that utilization is low. And this is usually accompanied by low liquidity.\n\nIn conclusion, Ethereum\u2019s burn mechanism has relatively addressed the network\u2019s concerns around transaction fees.\n\nAlso, the substantial amount of ETH burned also demonstrates the demand and usage of the Ethereum network, as well as the effectiveness of creating a more deflationary ecosystem. Whether it will improve or not, time will tell."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nModern account abstraction is \u201creally elegant\u201d because it doesn\u2019t require changes to the underlying protocol like other upgrades before it, said Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin at the Ethereum Community Conference (ETHCC) in Paris.\n\nDevelopers have been working on account abstraction, or different iterations of it, since 2015, even before Ethereum was launched. The idea is to switch from Externally Owned Wallets, or EOAs, to smart contract-based wallets. If they pull it off, managing a crypto wallet would become as easy as managing an email account.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat would mean users could potentially recover their seed phrase\u2014the private key used to sign trasnactions\u2014as easily as they can reset the password on an email account.\n\nThe latest version is EIP-4337 (Ethereum Improvement Proposal 4337), also known as Account Abstraction Using Alt Mempool. The Ethereum (ETH) upgrade would allow users to create non-custodial wallets as programmable smart contracts. This would unlock a number of features, such as easy wallet recovery, signless transactions\u2013which translates into lower transaction fees\u2013and team wallets (also known as multisignature wallets).\n\nAccording to Buterin, the upgrade could be one of the driving catalysts for Web3 adoption around the world. \u201cOne of the key properties we want blockchains to have is that they give you money before you register,\u201d he said.\n\nThe idea, he said, is for users to be able to receive any token, like a stablecoin, that isn\u2019t Ethereum with their smart contract wallet and be able to pay the gas fees without having to converthold ETH.\n\nIn order to allow for these types of wallets and transactions to be broadcasted, the latest account abstraction upgrade would enable the use of \u201cpaymasters,\u201d which allow users to pay for gas fees with whatever token they are transacting with.\n\nEIP-4337 also incorporates signature aggregators\u2014which allow for multiple signers to join together, and only one gets used in a transaction.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nButerin claimed today that \u201cthis is a pretty big deal,\u201d especially in rollups, due to the outsized footprint of a signature on these types of layer 2 solutions. Ethereum layer 2 scaling solutions, like Arbitrum or Optimism, batch transactions together and verify them off the Ethereum mainnet. Account abstraction would allow for signature aggregation. In simple terms, that would allow for more data compression, which translates into cheaper computation, and according to the Ethereum co-founder, \u201cwill reduce costs by 86 times.\u201d\n\nThis is not the only Ethereum upgrade currently in the works. Proto-danksharding, or EIP-4884 is also underway. It\u2019s quickly become one of the main focuses of development on the network because it sets the foundation for a new data type which will drastically reduce costs and make data usage more efficient."

Shortly after, the user transferred the wallet\u2019s entire balance to the exchange, prompting some market participants to speculate that millions of dollars\u2019 worth of sell pressure was due to hit the market for ETH.\n\nPre-mined ETH was issued as a reward to Ethereum\u2019s early supporters, including those who funded the project during its Initial Coin Offering (ICO). The network started off with a supply of 72 million ETH, of which 83% was distributed to those who purchased the cryptocurrency in a crowd sale conducted in July and August 2014.\n\nThe crowd sale participants sent a total of 31,000 BTC to a designated Bitcoin address in exchange for an Ethereum wallet address to which the ETH they purchased would be distributed to after the network\u2019s official launch.\n\nAccording to blockchain data analysed by CoinDesk, 6,600 transactions were sent to the Bitcoin address, although the consensus among industry watchers is that the true number of crowd sale participants is far smaller, with big players likely splitting their purchases into multiple wallets. The average purchase price of ETH amounted to $0.30 per coin for those that took part.\n\nWhile most early buyers sold off their coins as the price of ETH rose significantly over the years, the remaining pre-mine addresses were thought to be staunch supporters of the cryptocurrency or those that lost their private keys and could no longer access their wallets.\n\nIf the wallet\u2019s owner does intend to sell, he or she will be cashing out on what is likely one of the largest returns on an initial investment in history."

The switch saw TUSD become the biggest gainer of the quarter after $1 billion was minted on the Tron network\u2014that's a 50% rise. Tether remains firmly at the top of the list, and concluded the quarter with a 66% share of the stablecoin market.\n\nAccording to CoinGecko, things are also looking gloomy in the NFT sector, despite Bitcoin Ordinals reigniting interest in crypto collectibles. Bored Ape Yacht Club prices have recently sunk to a two-year low, down 88% from their peak in a torrid time for top-tier projects. Trading volumes among all NFTs fell 35% to $3.15 billion in Q2.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nzkSync is taking yet another step to decentralize.\n\nNamed after a mythical creature found in Lewis Carroll\u2019s poem \u2018The Hunting of the Snark,\u2019 the team behind zkSync has launched the latest upgrade to the speedy layer-2 network.\n\nThe launch is in so-called mainnet shadow mode, per the team, as part of the launch's phased rollout. This mode is a testing zone that runs in parallel to the mainnet.\n\nzkSync is a novel scaling solution for Ethereum and one of the few that use zero-knowledge (zk) rollups to do so. Rollups come in two varieties: zk and optimistic. Both batch transactions off of the mainnet, roll them up into even smaller bundles, then those bundles are compressed into a proof, and settled on Ethereum.\n\nPart of that process involves a prover. This piece of technology is what does the compressing and packing of all those transactions. It's the cryptographic equivalent of a trash compactor, except it's not trash but potentially thousands of dollars in crypto activity.\n\nGiven the high computing power needed to generate those proofs, however, the barrier for users to participate is quite high.\n\nThe latest upgrade will address precisely this.\n\nCalled Boojum, which, per Carroll, is the most dangerous variety of Snark (itself a fictionalized creature), the tech will lower the hardware barrier to help secure zkSync.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe new prover can be operated with as little as 8 gigabytes of hardware, whereas the average prover demands roughly 500 gigabytes on average, said zkSync CEO Alex Gluchowski.\n\n\u201cSo far, we've seen the benchmark competitors indicating something like north of 500 gigabytes of RAM for a prover,\u201d he told Decrypt. \u201cAnd as you can only run it on the cloud, it's not ready for this [wide adoption]. Our prover requires only eight gigabytes of GPU RAM and it can run on GPUs that are compatible with gaming computers.\u201d\n\nAlong with lowering the hardware demands, Boojum is also doing all its transaction compressing for much cheaper, too. Cutting costs here is crucial, even if it's only pennies.\n\n\u201cJust because a single transaction costs $1 to produce, or even 10 cents, or even less than that, getting through hundreds of thousands of transactions per second would mean massive expanding, and you will probably not have enough of the hardware in the vulnerable clusters to produce and sustain this load,\u201d said Gluchowski.\n\nInstead of several large data centers supporting a blockchain network, especially one executing such taxing computations as generating cryptographic proofs, the upgraded prover will make it accessible to anyone.\n\nJust like miners on Bitcoin and validators on Ethereum are paid for securing their networks, so too would provers on zkSync, he said.\n\nThe zkSync CEO even argued that it could be a viable way to repurpose the mining industry.\n\n\u201cI personally don't think the proof of work will be a sustainable source of business,\u201d he told Decrypt. \u201cThey will have to shift to something that actually provides normally redundant value, not like waste kind of work. Actually like doing some useful work.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWith this step in the decentralization step executed, Gluchowski said that the next step is to decentralize zkSync\u2019s sequencer. This piece of a blockchain is responsible for ordering transactions in each block.\n\nExecuting this step also suggests a token launch in the future, he told Decrypt.\n\n\u201cWhen you decentralized the sequencer, you will need some way to permissionlessly verify transactions,\u201d said Gluchowski."

Another example would be having a core decentralized autonomous organization smart contract on Ethereum while handling fully private voting on Sapphire, with the end results being sent back to the core DAO contract.\n\n\u201cIn this way, the privacy capabilities of Sapphire are exposed to any other chain.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Oasis Foundation director, the majority of DApps being developed on Oasis are privacy-centric and enable users to have full control over their on-chain data and how that gets shared and accessed. This is also evident in a list of different tools and platforms that have been built within the Oasis ecosystem.\n\nRelated: Oasis Foundation launches $160M development fund\n\nKos highlighted confidential decentralized exchanges, privacy-enabled blockchain gaming, account abstration, confidential nonfungible tokens, private voting, sealed-bid auctions, key management and decentralized identification as use cases that have come to the fore from builders on the Oasis chain.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: Here\u2019s how Ethereum\u2019s ZK-rollups can become interoperable"

At the same time, this is a viable alternative to banks whose transaction or conversion fees are considered too high\u2026\n\nBuying Ethereum with PayPal is an attractive option for the buyers facing banking restrictions in their countries of residence. At the same time, this is a convenient alternative to banks whose transaction or conversion fees are considered too high for one\u2019s taste or pocket. There are few quick legit ways how to buy Ethereum with PayPal.\n\nSince late 2020, you can buy cryptocurrencies using your PayPal e-wallet. All you need to do is have a funded PayPal account, choose the cryptocurrency you want to buy, and confirm your purchase.\n\nHowever, buying ether on PayPal has its own caveats. For instance, PayPal does not allow you to withdraw your crypto assets into a private self-hosted wallet, meaning that you won\u2019t be able to use it for anything else but selling it back to PayPal once its price goes up or down. The essence of cryptocurrency is the ability to own private digital cash without having to rely on any intermediaries and send or receive them in a censorship-resistant way. At least for now, getting cryptocurrency via PayPal is a safe way to get exposure to the asset class, but it does not let you use it in ways it was made to be used \u2013 as a free and open peer-to-peer (P2P) financial system without trusted intermediaries.\n\nLuckily for you, there actually are three other methods of how you can buy Ethereum with PayPal instantly via other platforms that give you full ownership of your digital assets.\n\nBuying Ethereum With PayPal via LocalEthereum\n\nAnother option is to visit LocalEthereum as an informal exchange platform on which you can find and get in touch with people who sell ether in various areas. Depending on their preferences, they may accept PayPal payment from you.\n\nLocalEthereum operates as a website which connects you with people who want to sell Ethereum in your local area or worldwide. It is like \u201ceBay of Ethereum.\u201d Depending on how thorough you are in your search, sooner or later you will find someone willing to accept PayPal payments. If you want to buy ETH with PayPal in this manner, you should pay attention to any aspect of a transaction in advance, as you alone will bear the risk of dealing with scammers. Some of them may claim that they never received your payment, so go for reputable traders only. Make sure you check their terms of trade and try to learn as much about them as possible before clicking on a payment button.\n\nThese are the most convenient ways to purchase Ethereum with PayPal. If you want to learn more about how to buy other cryptocurrencies, see our \u201cHow to get altcoins\u201d guide."

        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin provided an in-depth review of the ongoing development and challenges of the blockchain\u2019s \u201caccount abstraction\u201d at the EthCC in Paris on July 18.\n\nVitalik Buterin laid it all out there on the latest developments and roadblocks of Ethereum\u2019s \u201caccount abstraction\u201d \u2014 a concept aimed at increasing the platform\u2019s adaptability by enabling users to define their account security models \u2014 at the Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC) in Paris. He broke down the idea, explaining how it\u2019s all about adding flexibility to Ethereum by giving users the power to decide on their accounts\u2019 security.\n\nRecalling the origin story of account abstraction in Ethereum (ETH), Buterin shared, \u201cRight from the start, we were all about letting accounts be controlled by code, not just keys.\u201d Just like any good story, though, there were plot twists \u2013 technical difficulties like non-unique transaction hashes and sorting out miner fees from smart contract wallets became hurdles.\n\nHappening now at #EthCC Main Stage: @VitalikButerin\u2019s talk on account abstraction\n\n\n\nFull house & full excitement for the \ud83d\udc10\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udc99\ud83e\udd0d\u2764\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/QTD5sCuDwv \u2014 EthCC \u2013 Ethereum Community Conference (@EthCC) July 18, 2023\n\nProgress hasn\u2019t stopped, especially with the introduction of EIP-4337. This account abstraction standard plays it smart \u2013 it skips changing the base protocol by sticking to smart contracts. The big picture? It lets wallets connect via a trusted \u201centry point\u201d contract, rounds up meta-transactions via \u201cbundler\u201d contracts, and brings in MEV builders to handle fee markets.\n\nButerin painted a clear picture of what this modern account abstraction could mean for users. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about extensions, or \u2018paymasters,\u2019 that could let users pay their fees with the same coins they\u2019re moving around,\u201d he said.\n\nYou might also like: Buterin criticizes US crypto policy\u2019s detrimental impact on projects like Solana\n\nHe also pointed out the potential of signature aggregation, explaining, \u201cThis could be a game-changer, especially on rollups where the size of a transaction is mostly the signature.\u201d By pulling together signatures, developers could save a chunk on gas and data costs.\n\nBut it\u2019s not all smooth sailing. Buterin didn\u2019t skirt around the tough stuff. He talked about the need for an Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) to shift current Ethereum externally-owned accounts into smart contracts. There are also challenges like making sure everything works with layer-2 solutions and blends with existing technologies like biometrics and wallets.\n\nBut through all the ups and downs, Buterin stays optimistic about account abstraction\u2019s progress and future. He said, \u201cWe\u2019ve come a long way with account abstraction, and I can\u2019t wait to see where we\u2019ll go next.\u201d\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Image: Getty Images\n\nCelo, a blockchain platform, has proposed to return to the Ethereum ecosystem by transitioning from an independent layer-1 blockchain to an Ethereum layer-2 (L2) solution. The move aims to leverage OP Stack as the architecture for Celo's Ethereum L2 blockchain, enabling seamless integration with Ethereum's tooling and libraries.The proposal discussed on Celo's governance forum outlines critical elements of the transition. It includes establishing an off-chain data availability layer operated by Ethereum node operators and secured by restaked Ether (ETH). The existing validators would also be transformed into decentralised sequencers for the L2 solution.Layer-1 and Layer-2 blockchains differ in purpose and design. While layer-1 networks operate independently, layer-2 solutions enhance the performance of layer-1 blockchains. The transition to Ethereum L2 would offer benefits such as increased security and lower gas fees compared to other L2 solutions.The proposal assures end-users would not be affected by the migration, and CELO token holders would retain control over core contracts by voting on governance proposals. Moreover, CELO tokens would be used to pay for gas within the new L2 ecosystem.It is expected to facilitate increased liquidity flow between Celo and other chains. It may introduce additional costs for sequencers, including fees on the data availability layer and gas on Ethereum.The proposal is scheduled for discussion on a governance call on July 21, followed by a \"temperature check\" the following day. If adopted, the transition would enable Celo to benefit from Ethereum's robust tooling and libraries, enhancing compatibility and expanding possibilities for developers.Celo has been actively improving its mobile experience and incorporating features that target developing economies, where demand for technological payment solutions is high. By embracing the Ethereum L2 solution, Celo aims to unlock further potential and strengthen its position within the competitive blockchain landscape.As the governance discussions unfold and the technical details are finalised, the community eagerly awaits the outcome, which could mark a significant milestone in the evolution of Celo's blockchain ecosystem and its integration with the broader Ethereum network."

The pioneer crypto's rangebound movement suggests that volatility has dropped, which has held a majority of altcoin ecosystem hostage, including Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) prices.\n\nAlso Read: Whales are secretly accumulating these two DeFi coins: LINK, UNI\n\nBitcoin price eyes big changes\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price shows a shrinking volatility, suggesting a big incoming price change to either upside or downside. The price is moving within a short leash, capped at $31,500 and $29,872 to the upside and downside, respectively. A decisive break and subsequent candlestick close above or below the range will decide the next direction.\n\nWith momentum indicators pointing to declining buying pressure, Bitcoin price could break below the lower support level at $29,872. Notably, much uncollected liquidity is underneath this level, which acts as a downside pull for BTC as traders wait for ideal entry positions.\n\nTherefore, a decisive break below the crucial support at $29,872 could see Bitcoin price pull lower toward the $27,500 range. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicators both point south, suggesting falling momentum.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-Day Chart\n\nThe 50-, 100-, and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) at $29,235, $28,130, and $26,562 all provide entry positions for sidelined investors or those looking to grow their portfolios. As Bitcoin price slides below the critical support, the ensuing buying pressure from these levels could provide more hind winds for BTC to restore north, potentially shattering the $31,500 level to confirm an uptrend.\n\nAlso Read: BTC traders brace for $30K loss \u2013 Five things to know in Bitcoin this week.\n\nEthereum price tests critical support\n\nEthereum (ETH) price is testing crucial support as the downtrend continues. At the current price of $1,907, the largest altcoin by market capitalization is on the brink of breaking below its bullish consolidation along the uptrend line or continuing posting gains above it.\n\nMomentum indicators, comprising the RSI and MACD, point to a drop unless bulls seize the current low-risk buying opportunity to reject the downside. If conservative trading prevails and bulls sit on their hands, a confirmed break below the ascending trendline could open the drains for ETH. This could see the altcoin tag the 50-day EMA at $1,868 or, worse, re-register the July 7 lows around $1,824. This is marked by the support confluence between the 100-day EMA and the horizontal line, making it a robust buyer congestion zone.\n\nETH/USDT 1-Day Chart\n\nConversely, buying pressure from the EMAs could facilitate a north swing, sustaining ETH\u2019s move along the uptrend line and ultimately breaching the $1,959 resistance level. In highly ambitious cases, the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) token could reclaim the mid-April highs around the $2,120 mark.\n\nAlso Read: Why Ethereum\u2019s EIP-4844 could kickstart bull run for Optimism (OP), Arbitrum (ARB), Polygon (MATIC)\n\nRipple price trades marginally as consolidation climaxes\n\nRipple (XRP) price is filling up a pennant, trading in a steadily narrowing. With neither bulls nor bears giving way to their trading positions, the pennant decides which way this tug-of-war will go.\n\nNotably, however, there are already small spillages below the support offered by the uptrend line of the pennant. This suggests bears might have a better and tighter grip on Ripple price.\n\nThis gloomy outlook is reflected by the RSI, showing a bearish divergence against the Ripple price. This comes as XRP records higher highs along the lower boundary of the pennant, while on the other hand, the RSI is showing lower highs.\n\nThe odds, therefore, favor the downside suggesting an imminent retest of the mid-July lows around $0.697. A decisive 4-hour candlestick close below this level will confirm the downtrend.\n\nXRP/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nOn the other hand, if late investors buy the remittance token, the Ripple price could break the pennant to the north, making a run for the peak of the technical formation at $0.823. Such a move would denote a 15% climb from the current level.\n\nAlso Read: XRP ruling puts cryptocurrencies in nuanced position, industry experts weigh in."

Could it also affect the Ethereum price?\n\nScheduled for 17th to 20th July, the 2023 EthCC week will feature multiple events. There will be meetups, panels, parties, as well as other attractive side events as the Ethereum community engage to chart a prosperous course for the network championing the decentralized movement.\n\nA very important week for Ethereum\n\nThe need for industry insiders to come together from time to time cannot be overemphasized. A blockchain network like Ethereum, hosting thousands of projects will benefit immensely from community conferences. EthCC 2023 is a critical educational gathering with welcoming celebrations.\n\nWhile inclusive conversations are expected to be the hallmark of this conference, social interactions will play huge roles too. The conference will also provide ample opportunity for individuals and businesses to showcase their projects and make relevant announcements.\n\nA major international conference like EthCC also has the potential to influence the prices of digital assets. A positive outcome of the EthCC week in Paris, therefore, could provide a positive influence in the ETH markets.\n\nA pair of interesting announcements\n\nBarely 24 hours into the EthCC week, we\u2019re expecting a number of announcements that reiterate the importance of the event. Here are a couple of announcements that will reiterate the importance of the event:\n\nMantle Network unveils Mainnet Alpha and $200 million ecosystem fund\n\nEthereum Layer 2 project, Mantle Network, is one of the first projects to make a big announcement in the ongoing EthCC in Paris. The network announced its mainnet alpha yesterday, in addition to a $200 million ecosystem fund. This is coming barely after 6 months of testnet development.\n\nMantle Network used the opportunity provided by EthCC to intimate current and potential partners of its current position and targets. Thanks to a strategic merger with BitDAO in May, the project is now backed by one of the largest treasuries in the crypto sector.\n\nConsenSys launches Linea Network\n\nAnother announcement that will make waves in the EthCC will be the launch of the mainnet alpha of the Linea Network by Consensys. The Ethereum development company, which is behind such popular projects as MetaMask and Infura, has decided to join Ethereum scaling race in a remarkable way.\n\nSometime last week, Consensys onboarded ecosystem partners. The company will now leverage EthCC to open Linea Network, a zkEVM rollup to the public. Linea, according to a company statement, is an EVM equivalent. The implication is that Ethereum-native protocols can deploy on the Linea Network without much fuse.\n\nWrapping up\n\nThis is certainly a big week for Ethereum, and in extension, a big week for the decentralized movement. As participants from all over the world engage positively in Paris, relevant announcements that could shape the future of Ethereum will be made. In addition to the announcements, we expect that the event will yield the results necessary for building a sustaining a positive, fertile ecosystem."

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin sheds light on Ethereum's account abstraction journey at EthCC - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "At the Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC) in Paris, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin gave an insightful presentation on the history and evolution of \u201caccount abstraction\u201d on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nAccount abstraction is a feature in Ethereum that aims to make the system more flexible and easier to use. It essentially allows users to define the security model of their accounts, making Ethereum more adaptable for different use cases.\n\nFor instance, this feature allows users to set their own transaction validation rules, such as multi-signature requirements or spending limits. They can also make their accounts compatible with a future cryptographic algorithm.\n\nButerin described account abstraction as allowing Ethereum accounts to be controlled by smart contract code rather than private keys.\n\nEarly days of account abstraction\n\nAccording to Buterin, the idea of allowing accounts to be controlled by code rather than just keys was present in Ethereum from the beginning.\n\nThe Ethereum Yellow Paper outlined two types of accounts \u2013 Externally Owned Accounts (controlled by private keys) and Contract Accounts (managed by smart contract code). However, some challenges emerged in the early days of implementing account abstraction.\n\nIn the first Ethereum proof-of-concept release, there was optimism that users would adopt multi-signature wallets. However, this did not happen immediately, and exchange deposit detection became harder with multi-sig. There were also complexities with paying miner fees from smart contract wallets. The original vision was for all transactions to be simple \u201ccalls,\u201d but issues like non-unique transaction hashes made the problem difficult.\n\nEvolution of account abstraction\n\nThe Ethereum community iterated on many account abstraction ideas over the years. Proposals emerged around standardizing signatures, using \u201cbreakpoint\u201d opcodes, restricting access during transaction verification, and more. But progress was slow due to the complexities of changing the base protocol and the focus on delivering proof-of-stake. It wasn\u2019t until 2020 that a concrete account abstraction EIP was proposed.\n\nIndependent projects like Gas Station Network and Argent Wallet drove further innovation. They found creative ways to enable meta-transactions and abstract accounts using only smart contracts. However, solutions relying on \u201cwrapper\u201d transactions had downsides like high per-transaction overhead.\n\nMost recently, EIP-4337 was proposed to provide a universal account abstraction standard using only smart contracts, avoiding base protocol changes. This allows wallets to integrate through a trusted \u201centry point\u201d contract, uses \u201cbundler\u201d contracts to batch meta-transactions, and leverages MEV builders to provide fee markets. Extensions like paymaster contracts enable additional capabilities like token-based fee payment.\n\nFuture of account abstraction\n\nButerin acknowledged the increased desire to enshrine parts of account abstraction (like ERC-4337) directly into the protocol for efficiency and censorship resistance. He also noted the importance of ensuring a smooth transition for legacy EOA users and integrating innovations like biometric signers.\n\nOverall, Buterin\u2019s presentation provided a rare insight into Ethereum\u2019s historical struggles to enable advanced account structures. Through years of iteration and industry collaboration, substantial progress has been made on this complex but foundational problem.\n\nAs Buterin noted, the work of many talented Ethereum developers has brought the ecosystem much closer to the original vision of seamless and flexible account abstraction.\n\nInterestingly, other protocols like INTU provide an alternative approach to the Ethereum Foundation\u2018s concept of account abstraction. INTU retains EOAs through local cryptography in the form of distributed externally owned accounts (dEOAs,) thus opening up account sharing, threshold signatures, and private key abstraction without needing more gas-intensive smart contract accounts. INTU announced its public beta at EthCC\n\nThe innovation within the Ethereum ecosystem is arguably stronger than ever, with ETH making up 19% of the total crypto market cap, close to the all-time high of 24% set in 2018.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "As we kick off another week in July, Bitcoin and Ethereum\u2019s erratic price swings continue to enthrall investors. Bitcoin takes the stage with a confident stride while Ethereum also paints a vibrant picture, surging to new local heights at just over $2,1078.\n\nSo, the scene is set, and these digital behemoths are the center of attention. Will they maintain their upward trend, or will unexpected turns shape this week\u2019s NFT market drama? Let\u2019s plunge into the NFT Market and investigate the options!\n\n1) A Steady Week For NFT Trade Volume\n\nThe NFT market was consistent this week, maintaining a total trading volume of just under $85 million, holding steady from the previous week. While the market continues to face challenges and obstacles, there was no noticeable decrease in trading activity.\n\nHowever, It is crucial to remember that a stable trading volume does not necessarily designate traders becoming more interested or involved. On the contrary, it could be that the bottom is in, and the participants that remain are trading among themselves. It has been a while since new money has come in, and volume is being passed between collections and chains.\n\n2) Holders Are Holding Amidst The Mixed Circumstances\n\nNFTs continue to witness intriguing shifts in various aspects. It is evident that the NFT market goes on experiencing a mix of both positive and negative developments. On the one hand, the number of NFT holders continues to rise, reaching an impressive 4,580,186, indicating a tiny increase of 0.24%.\n\nHowever, there has been a considerable decline in active NFT traders, with a fall of 19.42%, accompanied by a significant decrease of 23.50% in the number of sellers.

        "content": "An environment of healthy competition is being fostered between the Ethereum ecosystem\u2019s top development firms building zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machines (zkEVMs) to scale the network, according to one of Polygon\u2019s co-founders.\n\nJordi Baylina, technical lead of Polygon Hermez zkEVM, spoke to Cointelegraph ahead of the start of EthCC in France. With builders from across the Ethereum ecosystem converging on Paris, zero-knowledge proof (ZK-proof) scaling tools are set to be a major focal point.\n\nPolygon\u2019s zkEVM uses ZK-proofs to reduce transaction costs and increase the throughput of the Ethereum network, while taking advantage of the security and finality of the layer-1 blockchain.\n\nZK-proofs have proved to be an important scaling tool for the Ethereum ecosystem. The technology allows protocols like Polygon\u2019s zkEVM to handle transaction computations off-chain before providing a resource-lite proof to the Ethereum mainnet without revealing any of the associated data.\n\nRelated: Ethereum scaling protocols drive zero-knowledge proof use in 2023\n\nBaylina, who is at the helm of Polygon\u2019s zkEVM, says the breadth of development being done with ZK technology has been hugely beneficial to the wider Ethereum ecosystem:\n\n\u201cHaving different projects adds a lot of experience, and it\u2019s also a way to test different approaches, ways of handling things or solving things.\u201d\n\nBaylina added that various projects emulate good advances and try to make them better, while failings act as a learning for all ZK-based projects in the space.\n\nPolygon zkEVM unique addresses. Source: Polygon zkEVM\n\nPolygon zkEVM is live on mainnet, and the network is closing in on 250,000 unique active addresses. Its daily active Polygon zkEVM addresses are also trending upward, with both metrics suggesting that user adoption is growing.\n\nRelated: ConsenSys launches Linea zkEVM to further scale Ethereum\n\nMeanwhile, Baylina highlighted the number of applications that are building on Polygon zkEVM as the most important metric for his team. This, in turn, leads to a wealth of information and feedback from developers, which is shaping changes to the protocol:\n\n\u201cHearing from developers the issues that they have, if they notice something that can be improved or the quality of the tooling that they have on top of that for me, these are the real metrics we are working hard on.\u201d\n\nBaylina provided a working example where developers had identified issues with timestamps that were critical for the operation of decentralized finance oracles. Bayina\u2019s team found a workaround solution while a long-term fix was being developed. Nevertheless, the input from builders is helping improve the protocol as more join the ecosystem.\n\n\u201cImportant projects are coming to the network, and we are getting a lot of experience and knowledge on the needs of different applications.\u201d\n\nPolygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal previously told Cointelegraph that Polygon\u2019s zkEVM is the \u201choly grail of Ethereum scaling,\u201d allowing the protocol to submit proofs to the Ethereum mainnet without the layer-1 blockchain having to rerun computations.\n\nThe technology is envisioned to drastically scale Ethereum, allowing developers to build decentralized applications while being unencumbered by the base blockchain\u2019s network performance.\n\nMagazine: Here\u2019s how Ethereum\u2019s ZK-rollups can become interoperable"

        "content": "ConsenSys is the leading global blockchain technology company behind a groundbreaking new solution that's helping address Ethereum's scalability challenge \u2014 Linea.\n\nTo date, ConsenSys has been pivotal in advancing the adoption and development of decentralized applications (DApps) on the Ethereum blockchain. Founded by Joseph Lubin, one of the co-founders of Ethereum, ConsenSys has emerged as a key player in the blockchain space.\n\nThe company provides a wide range of services and products catering to the blockchain ecosystem's different aspects. From infrastructure solutions to developer tools and enterprise platforms, ConsenSys offers a comprehensive suite of offerings to empower businesses and individuals to realize the potential of blockchain technology.\n\nOne of ConsenSys' core objectives is driving innovation and scalability on the Ethereum network. Ethereum, known for its smart contract functionality, has gained significant popularity and widespread usage. However, scalability has become a pressing challenge as more applications and users join the network. ConsenSys is actively developing and implementing solutions to address this scalability bottleneck.\n\nLinea is the latest advancement in ConsenSys zkEVM, enabling a new wave of cutting-edge DApps on the Ethereum blockchain. By leveraging zkEVM technology, Linea can help enhance the scalability of Ethereum-based DApps.\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum's scalability challenges\n\nDespite Ethereum's transition from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, it still encounters notable scalability challenges.\n\nNetwork congestion During periods of high activity, the Ethereum network can become congested, leading to slower transaction processing times and increased fees. This congestion limits the network's capacity to handle many transactions simultaneously.\n\nLimited transaction throughput Ethereum's current design restricts the number of transactions processed per second, resulting in scalability limitations. As demand increases, the network may struggle to accommodate all transaction requests promptly.\n\nHigh gas fees Gas fees are payments made by users to execute transactions and smart contracts on the Ethereum network. Gas fees can surge during peak times, making it expensive for users to interact with DApps and perform transactions.\n\nBlockchain size and synchronization As the Ethereum blockchain grows due to transaction history and smart contract execution, new network participants face challenges in synchronizing and storing the entire blockchain, impacting scalability.\n\nSmart contract execution Ethereum's sequential execution of smart contracts limits parallel processing capabilities. As a result, complex and resource-intensive smart contracts can cause delays, hindering overall scalability.\n\nScalability issues profoundly impact Ethereum's performance and user experience, hindering its ability to handle a growing user base and increasing transaction volumes.

        "title": "What Is Gnosis? How Decentralized Prediction Markets Work - Decrypt",
        "content": "In brief Gnosis started out in 2015 as a decentralized prediction market on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nEstablished at the end of 2020, GnosisDAO is the collective steward of the Gnosis ecosystem.\n\nThe CoW (Confidence of Wants) protocol is a permissionless decentralized exchange (DEX)\n\nYour Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nOriginally envisioned as a decentralized prediction market, Gnosis is a blockchain project running on top of the Ethereum network.\n\nGnosis started out in 2015 as a decentralized prediction market on the Ethereum blockchain. Originally, the team behind the project intended to develop a platform similar to the once promising betting platform Augur, with the now discontinued Gnosis Olympia becoming the project\u2019s first flagship decentralized application (dApp).\n\n\n\nThe idea of a prediction market is still very much alive though: while Gnosis itself serves as an open framework, prediction markets are realized in third-party dApps built on top the Gnosis Chain, such as Azuro, Omen, and Reality Card. These platforms allow users to bet on the outcome of sport events, cryptocurrency prices, technology developments and politics, among other categories.\n\nWith the realization of a greater need for infrastructure tools to expand the utility of the Ethereum ecosystem, Gnosis also moved to develop products such as a decentralized custody protocol and asset management platform Safe (previously known as Gnosis Safe) and the CoW Protocol (previously known as the xotocol), a permissionless trading protocol, which\u2014somewhat similar to the way Uniswap and 1inch work\u2014 finds the lowest price for trades across exchanges and aggregators.\n\n\n\nOther products developed by Gnosis include Conditional Tokens\u2014 a new asset class designed to facilitate the creation of highly liquid prediction markets, with the value of the assets directly correlated to the outcome of an event, as well as Gnosis Auction and Zodiac.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGnosis Auction helps projects discover a fair price for their token, whereas Zodiac is a collection of tools for composable Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs).\n\nIn November 2020, Gnosis announced the creation of GnosisDAO, described as a prediction market-driven collective with the mission to successfully steward the Gnosis ecosystem through futarchy\u2014a form of governance where prediction markets play a crucial role in determining which policies will have the most positive effect.\n\n\n\nNext year, the xDai and GnosisDAO communities voted to merge their ecosystems to create the Gnosis Chain\u2014 an EVM-based Ethereum sidechain for stable transactions that leverages the xDai token.\n\n\n\nSafe, in its turn, announced the launch of its SafeDAO and Safe Token in September 2022.\n\nThe Gnosis ecosystem overview\n\nThe Gnosis ecosystem is powered by a native token called GNO, which is used for staking on the Gnosis Beacon Chain and serves as the governance token for the GnosisDAO.\n\nTo improve the utility of the Ethereum blockchain, the Gnosis ecosystem relies on several components.\n\n\n\nCoW Protocol\n\nThe CoW (Confidence of Wants) protocol is a permissionless decentralized exchange (DEX), enabling users to exchange any ERC-20 token\u2014a token standard that allows developers to create their own tokens on the Ethereum network.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat sets the CoW protocol apart from other DEXs is its unique approach to matching and executing trades. Rather than using an automated market maker system that relies on user-provided liquidity, the CoW Protocol matches buyers and sellers through multi-token batch auctions and executes trades at the most favorable available price.\n\nThe batch auction mechanism functions by consolidating buy and sell orders every five minutes. Other users can then vie to offer the best order settlement for the group of trades, a process referred to as \"solving.\" Individuals who engage in this activity on the protocol are known as \"solvers.\"\n\nBy employing solving, traders on the CoW Protocol are shielded from miner extractable value (MEV), which refers to the process where individuals who create new ETH can further profit by manipulating their control over the network and prioritizing certain users\u2019 transactions.\n\nSafe\n\nSafe is a customizable multisignature wallet infrastructure that operates as a smart contract wallet on the Ethereum network, mandating a predetermined number of approvals before a transaction can be executed.\n\nSafe offers support for ETH, ERC-20 and ERC-721 (NFTs) tokens, as well as the ability to interact with various DeFi platforms.\n\n\n\nSafe is governed by SafeDAO, a decentralized collective of core contributors, backers, users and ecosystem contributors, collectively known as Safe Guardians.\n\nGnosis Chain\n\nThe Gnosis Chain is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) execution-layer chain that utilizes the xDAI stablecoin to enable transactions and cover fees. The network's security is ensured by the Gnosis Beacon Chain (GBC) consensus layer.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe GBC uses a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism, where users lock up a certain amount of GNO tokens to participate in the transaction validation process. By doing so, they can earn additional GNO tokens as a reward for aiding in securing the network.\n\nGnosisDAO\n\nEstablished at the end of 2020, GnosisDAO is the collective steward of the Gnosis ecosystem.\n\nAs a DAO, Gnosis uses the products it creates to guide decisions on the development, support and governance of its ecosystem.\n\nThe GnosisDAO governance process is primarily conducted on the Gnosis Forum, with every successful proposal required to pass three phases before being approved. The governance process is permissionless, meaning there\u2019s no single entity restricting access or controlling participation, with the only requirement that community members hold a minimum of 1 GNO to participate in the GnosisDAO Snapshot poll that makes a ruling on a proposal\u2019s outcome.\n\nToday, the GnosisDAO treasury controls over 150,000 ETH and 8 million GNO, with the GNO tokens vested over eight years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "The Ethereum Killers: a Comparative Look at Cardano (ADA), VC Spectra (SPCT), and Bitcoin Cash (BCH)\n\nThe crypto market witnesses a fierce battle for profitability among Cardano (ADA), VC Spectra (SPCT), and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). While Cardano (ADA) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) exhibit potential for an uptrend, VC Spectra (SPCT) brings a fresh perspective with its unique and sustainable investment opportunities.\n\nThis begs the question: Can VC Spectra (SPCT) outpace Cardano (ADA) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH)? Stay tuned to find out!\n\nBUY SPCT TOKENS NOW\n\nRallying Towards Success: Cardano (ADA) Shows Promising Signs of a Bull Run\n\nThe recent positive ruling in Ripple's XRP notably impacted various cryptocurrencies, including Cardano (ADA). Previously entangled in legal battles with the SEC, Cardano (ADA) witnessed substantial price increases as market sentiment turned bullish. In light of this ruling, Cardano\u2019s (ADA) trading volume jumped by 767.85%, with its price surging to $0.36 from $0.27, indicating a 44.44% spike over the past week.\n\nFurthermore, Cardano (ADA) aims to enhance its network capabilities and scalability. Cardano\u2019s (ADA) co-founder, Charles Hoskinson, unveiled Intersect to amplify community participation in Cardano\u2019s (ADA) governance and development. Intersect also empowers members to contribute to Cardano's (ADA) evolution and innovation.\n\nBy uniting Cardano (ADA) users, Intersect strives to establish a resilient, accountable, and forward-thinking ecosystem driven by community input.\n\nAs Cardano (ADA) bolsters its network, experts indicate Cardano\u2019s (ADA) price can increase from $0.36 to $0.54, translating to a 50% value surge in the coming weeks.\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) Benefits from Recent XRP Court Case\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) experienced a massive upward trend over the past week, increasing by 6.6% from $263.1 to $280.4. Analysts indicate Bitcoin Cash\u2019s (BCH) bullish momentum is linked to the recent XRP ruling. The court's decision challenges the SEC's assertion that there is no need for additional guidance on applying securities law to digital assets, such as XRP and Bitcoin Cash (BCH).\n\nOn the other hand, Binance US had a temporary disruption in BCH withdrawals due to a technical issue in the deposit transfer system, causing a brief shortage of BCH in the hot wallet.\n\nIn a testament to its technological prowess, the Binance US technical team restored Bitcoin Cash (BCH) deposit and withdrawal processes across all networks in just three days. The temporary suspension of withdrawals was solely due to technical difficulties and not indicative of any liquidity issues. Moreover, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) assured users of asset safety, backed by a 1:1 reserve for every token deposited or withdrawn.\n\nWith its robust security measures and commitment to user protection, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is projected to experience a price increase from $280.1 to $293.7 in the coming months, translating to a 4.86% surge.\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT) is the New Powerhouse\n\nAs we keep tabs on Cardano (ADA) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH), it\u2019s important to explore VC Specra\u2019s (SPCT) unique proposition and real-life utility. VC Spectra (SPCT) is an emerging decentralized hedge fund that allows people to invest in promising blockchain companies.\n\nThanks to VC Spectra (SPCT)'s rigorous selection procedure, investors can access pre-ICOs and diversified portfolios exclusively. VC Spectra (SPCT) also rewards its esteemed investors with buybacks and quarterly dividends, which are influenced by their investment performance.\n\nMoreover, VC Spectra's native token (SPCT) adherers to the BRC-20 standard, enabling seamless exchanges, decentralized trading, and asset management on the Spectra platform. SPCT is built on the Bitcoin blockchain and adopts a deflationary model with a burn mechanism that reduces token circulation over time, increasing VC Spectra's (SPCT) value.\n\nVC Spectra's (SPCT) public presale is in its initial stages, with its token valued at $0.008. Analysts indicate VC Spectra (SPCT) can skyrocket to $0.08 once it hits the exchanges, marking a 10x surge. Undoubtedly, VC Spectra (SPCT) can outpace Cardano (ADA) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH).\n\nLearn more about the VC Spectra presale here:\n\nPresale: https://invest.vcspectra.io/login\n\nWebsite: https://vcspectra.io/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/spectravcfund\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/VCSpectra\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article.

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction | Guide to Ripple SEC Lawsuit Victory and New Fast Growing Crypto ApeMax - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "This comprehensive guide offers a detailed overview of Ethereum price predictions and also discusses the ongoing legal challenges faced by Ripple in the Ripple vs SEC lawsuit. With insights gathered from multiple sources, this article provides fresh information and analysis for crypto enthusiasts interested in Ethereum\u2019s price outlook and the latest developments in the legal battle between Ripple and the SEC. Delve into this guide which discusses Ethereum\u2019s future prospects and the potential impact of the ongoing legal battle.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price History\n\nEthereum\u2019s price history reflects its many fluctuations over the years. In 2021, Ethereum experienced a notable surge in value driven by increased demand that might be attributable to technological advancements, including the introduction of the Berlin update and reduced transaction fees. However, the collapse of FTX in late 2022 had a significant impact on the cryptocurrency\u2019s price. As of July 10, 2023, Ethereum was valued at $1,864.58, a considerable decrease from its peak price of around $4,400 at the end of 2021. The crypto market is known for its volatility, and Ethereum\u2019s price history reflects the dynamic nature of the industry.\n\nWhat is ApeMax?\n\nApeMax has emerged as a highly interesting and innovative new cryptocurrency, garnering growing excitement within the crypto community. This project introduces a decentralized platform that allows holders to stake their tokens and earn rewards in a secure and transparent manner. ApeMax\u2019s could revolutionize the meme coin landscape as it combines entertaining and interactive elements with fun utility and staking functionalities, and all these features are accessible even during the presale period. With its interesting tokenomics, ApeMax is an intriguing contender in the realm of new meme coins, captivating the attention of crypto fans.\n\nWhat is the ApeMax Presale?\n\nThe ApeMax presale is currently open, presenting a limited-time opportunity for eligible buyers to acquire ApeMax tokens presale prices. ApeMax Coin stands out with its innovative tokenomics, enabling token holders to earn rewards by staking their coins on a diverse range of entities, including content creators, Web3 projects, influencers, and philanthropic organizations that align with their interests.\n\nBy participating in the ApeMax presale, eligible buyers can immediately engage in the rewards process of staking. This distinctive feature sets ApeMax apart from other cryptocurrencies, as users can start using the token\u2019s utility and start staking and earning rewards right from the initial stages, even during the presale period.\n\nTiming plays a pivotal role in the cryptocurrency landscape. The presale price of ApeMax undergoes gradual increments every 24 hours during the presale phase. Additionally, early-stage buyers of ApeMax have the exclusive opportunity to acquire Early Birds Loot Boxes, through which they can enjoy discounts of up to 50% on ApeMax tokens.\n\nCan Ethereum reach $100K?\n\nNo, it is unlikely that Ethereum will reach $100,000 per coin anytime soon. While Ethereum has shown strong growth and potential, achieving such a high value would require a significant increase in demand and adoption. Factors such as market dynamics, regulatory challenges, and competition from other cryptocurrencies make it improbable. It\u2019s essential to approach price predictions with caution and conduct thorough independent analysis before making crypto decisions.\n\nHow much will my Ethereum be worth in 2025?\n\nThe exact value of Ethereum in 2025 is uncertain and highly speculative. Predicting future prices of cryptocurrencies is challenging due to various factors that can influence the market. While Ethereum has shown promise and growth in the past, it\u2019s important to consider the volatility and unpredictability of the crypto market. It is advisable to conduct thorough research, analyze market trends, and consult with financial professionals before making any crypto purchases.\n\nWhat will Ethereum be worth in 2030?\n\nThe future value of Ethereum in 2030 is speculative and uncertain. Predicting the long-term price of cryptocurrencies is challenging due to the dynamic nature of the market and various factors that can influence prices. Ethereum has shown past potential for growth and adoption, but it\u2019s important to consider the volatility and unpredictable nature of the crypto market. Conducting thorough research, staying informed about market trends, and seeking advice from unbiased experts is essential prior to making any crypto related decisions.\n\nCan Ethereum crash to zero?\n\nWhile it is somewhat unlikely that Ethereum will crash to zero, it\u2019s important to acknowledge the inherent risks associated with cryptocurrencies, and even though this scenario may seem unlikely, it is possible for Ethereum and any crypto for that matter to crash to zero. Ethereum has established itself as one of the leading blockchain platforms with a wide range of use cases and strong community support. However, like any crypto, there are factors that can impact its value, including market volatility, regulatory changes, technological developments, and consumer sentiment. It\u2019s crucial to stay informed, and understand and assess the risks involved before making any crypto acquisitions.\n\nDoes Ethereum have a future?\n\nYes, according to some analysts, Ethereum could have an interesting future. As one of the leading blockchain platforms, Ethereum has established itself as a fundamental infrastructure for decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. Its robust developer community and ongoing improvements, such as the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, aim to address scalability and enhance the network\u2019s performance. Ethereum\u2019s versatility and wide range of use cases, including decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and more, position it for continued innovation. However, as with any cryptocurrency and blockchain, it\u2019s important to conduct thorough research and consider various factors before making any decisions. Like all cryptocurrencies, Etheruem remains highly volatile and risky, and may not be suitable for everyone.\n\nThe purchase of cryptocurrencies is not suitable for all individuals, and it is advised to exercise caution, conduct independent research, and carefully assess the considerable risks involved prior to engaging in any crypto acquisitions. People from the United States, Canada, countries that are under sanctions, and other blocked countries are not permitted to procure ApeMax coins. The official ApeMax website provides a complete list of the blocked countries.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

Discover SCENE\n\nWant to start buying and trading in cryptocurrency? You\u2019re going to need a cryptocurrency wallet first. In this guide you\u2019ll learn about what a wallet is, the different types, and how they might be used in future.\n\nA cryptocurrency wallet is a piece of software that stores your public and private keys. More on keys below.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt also allows you to send and receive digital currencies and monitor your balance. It\u2019s like a mini bank, just for you. What\u2019s more, you can have as many as you like, and move currencies between them.\n\nWhat are keys?\n\nWhen it comes to sending and receiving cryptocurrencies, you need a set of keys: one public, one private. These are typically 64-digit numbers. They are tied to each other - and you need both in order to send and receive currency on the network.\n\nDid you know?\n\nFun fact: the network can tell your public and private keys are connected without having to know what your private key is. Clever, huh?\n\n\n\nYour Public Key is what you share with your sender/recipient. You can share this key with as many people as you like.\n\nYour Private Key is the key you keep to yourself. This is connected to your public key using cryptography and acts as a digital signature for the transaction.\n\nIn order for you to access the information sent to you, you need both keys.\n\nNow we can talk about the different types of wallet.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDesktop wallets\n\nThese run on your computer, and can only be accessed on the computer you downloaded it on. If the computer is connected to the internet, these are referred to as hot wallets. This means they could be at risk if your computer gets hacked.\n\nMobile wallets\n\nThese are smaller, \u2018lighter\u2019 versions of their desktop cousins. Some mobile wallets only cater for certain currencies, but there are lots more currencies being added. You can download these from app stores.\n\nHardware wallets\n\nHardware wallets are physical wallets that you store somewhere safe. Many look like USB sticks and allow you to detach your private keys from the internet and keep them somewhere safe.\n\nPaper wallets\n\nGoing old school! You take your private key and physically write or print it out on a piece of paper and store it someplace safe, like a safe!\n\nThe future\n\nThe technology wallets and digital keys are built on has the potential to be used for all kinds of things. It could be used to prove your identity, store digital goods, or even run an entire state!"

        "content": "A crypto startup, Ethena, has recently secured $6 million in seed funding for its innovation stablecoin project. This funding round was led by Dragonfly, underscoring the increasing support for Ethena\u2019s venture.\n\nThe importance of this milestone stems from Ethena\u2019s unique approach to its stablecoin, called USDe.\n\nUnlike other stablecoins projects, Ethena has learned from the challenges faced by projects like Terra and has revised a fresh method to ensure that USDe maintains its peg to the US dollar.\n\nEthena\u2019s stablecoin achieves stability by using collateral provided by users and hedging price exposure through shorting Ethereum perpetual swaps.\n\nBy holding the equivalent amount of staked ETH and perpetual swaps, Ethena ensures that gains and losses from either asset effectively balance each other out.\n\nIn addition to the stablecoin, Ethena is also developing a digitally native internet savings bond denominated in USD. This bond generates yield by combining staked ETH and swapping margins, offering investors an opportunity to earn passive income.\n\nEthena aims to differentiate itself from previous attempts at building algorithmic stablecoin, such as Terra, which faced significant challenges and deviated from its peg to the US dollar.\n\nAdditionally, Ethena sets itself apart from established stablecoin leaders like USDC and USDT, which primarily rely on fiat-based assets like treasuries for backing.\n\nWhile this traditional approach is considered safer by many investors, it remains closely connected to the existing banking system.\n\nGuy Young, the founder of Ethena, emphasized that \u201cIn crypto, you\u2019re trying to create a parallel financial system, but the most important financial instrument in the entire space (the stablecoin) is still completely tethered to the existing system.\u201d\n\nThe inspiration for the creation of USDe came from a written piece by Hayes, which discussed the potential of a stablecoin supported by crypto derivatives, following the collapse of Terra.\n\nMoving forward, Ethena has set its sights on fully launching its stablecoin and bond asset in the upcoming months, following the completion of the testnet phase in the third quarter."

        "content": "zkSync Era has rolled out an upgrade dubbed Boojum.\n\nWith the upgrade, the network is transitioning to a STARK-based prover.\n\nThe transition has serious implications for zkSync Era\u2019s hyperchains vision and decentralization.\n\nThe race to develop the optimal Ethereum scaling solution is heating up. In recent weeks, several Layer-2 solutions have teased or launched upgrades.\n\nzkSync Era, a zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM), is the latest to release an upgrade. The recent upgrade, among other benefits, promises to encourage decentralization and cut down transaction costs.\n\n\u201cThe Most Fearsome Snark\u201d\n\nIn a long-form tweet on Monday, July 17, Matter Labs, the primary development team behind the zkSync Era protocol, announced the Boojum upgrade. Inspired by Lewis Carroll\u2019s \u201cThe Hunting of the Snark\u201d poem, the upgrade\u2019s name refers to \u201cthe most fearsome kind of snark.\u201d\n\nSay hello to Boojum \ud83d\udc4b: zkSync Era\u2019s new high-performance proof system for radical decentralization. Boojum is an upgrade that will transition zkSync Era to a STARK-powered proof system, providing world-class performance on consumer-grade hardware.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Learn more:\u2026 pic.twitter.com/1GrwJ5Y07A \u2014 zkSync \u220e (@zksync) July 17, 2023\n\nDespite this naming choice, it is worth noting that Boojum represents the network\u2019s transition from a SNARK-based proving system to a STARK-based system.\n\nThe Impact\n\nMatter Labs explains that while its current proving system is still functional, it can not scale for the volume expected in zkSync Era\u2019s hyperchains roadmap. The firm asserted that Boojum was better suited for zkSync Era\u2019s sequencer, capable of processing 100 transactions per second.\n\nAnother significant impact of the Boojum upgrade is that it significantly reduces the hardware requirement for proof generation. While the SNARK-based system requires high-end graphic processing units boasting at least 80 GB of RAM, the STARK-based system only requires GPUs with 16 GB of RAM. Additionally, Matter Labs reveals that central processing unit provers with 64 GB of RAM can also be used.\n\nAs highlighted by the team, this drastic reduction allows more users to be involved in maintaining the network, boosting decentralization. The less complex proving process also allows for cheaper transaction fees.\n\nFollowing the announcement of the Boojum upgrade, the zkSync Era network has processed an average of 11.32 TPS, more TPS than Ethereum and every other Ethereum Layer 2 solution, per data from L2Beat at the time of writing.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nzkSync Era\u2019s TVL has been on a steady decline since July 3, falling from over $735 million to $554 million at the time of writing, per data from L2Beat .\n\nThe bulk of the network\u2019s activity has been attributed to airdrop farming.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nzkSync Era is one of Ethereum\u2019s most popular scaling solutions. The continued dedication to improvements highlights the growing competitiveness within Ethereum\u2019s Layer-2 ecosystem.\n\nRead this to learn more about zkSync Era\u2019s growing popularity:\n\nzkSync Era Closes in on Ethereum in Transactions Per Second as TVL Hits Record\n\nIs trouble brewing for Binance?

        "content": "Celsius, the bankrupt crypto lender, has started selling its non-Bitcoin and non-Ethereum crypto assets, records on July 17 indicate. According to on-chain data from Lookonchain, Celsius has transferred approximately $23.5 million of various cryptocurrencies, including BNB, ZRX, LINK, BONE, and SNX, to FalconX and OKX, respectively.\n\nDifferent amounts of these tokens were transferred by Celsius, a move that, while it could be positive for creditors, may impact the token valuations of those projects.\n\nCelsius Selling Altcoins\n\nLookonchain revealed that Celsius moved $8.5 million worth of LINK, the native currency of Chainlink, a middleware protocol linking on-chain smart contracts to external but verified data. At the same time, it also moved $7.84 million worth of SNX, the native token of Synthetix, a protocol allowing users to trade derivatives called synths, was transferred.\n\nCelsius also went on to move $3 million worth of BNB, the coin behind the sprawling Binance ecosystem, $2.26 million worth of 1INCH, the token aggregator, and $1.9 million worth of ZRX, the token behind one of the first decentralized finance platforms, Ox Protocol.\n\nThe bankrupt lender also moved $709,678 worth of FTT, the token behind the collapsed FTX exchange, to FalconX. In response, FalconX has started depositing these tokens to Binance for selling.\n\nThe only token moved to a different exchange was BONE, where Celsius moved $235,000 of the meme token to the popular cryptocurrency exchange, OKX.\n\nWhile OKX caters to retail and institutional investors, FalconX serves institutional investors, offering diverse services, including liquidity provision and risk management. So far, a large tranche of tokens held by Celsius has moved through FalconX.\n\nIn late June, Judge Martin Glenn of the Southern District of New York allowed Celsius to start converting all their tokens to either Bitcoin or Ethereum, the two currencies that would be allowed to pay back creditors. All conversions were set to begin on July 1.\n\nAltcoins Taking A Hit\n\nThe transfer also comes amid a favorable ruling that saw a US Judge say XRP, one of the major altcoins, is not a security and can be traded like a commodity, just like Bitcoin. However, even though news pumped altcoins, mostly XRP, momentum tapered during the weekend, and most altcoins fell back from last week\u2019s highs.\n\nRelated Reading: XRP Whales Ride The Crypto Surge, As Ripple Token Notches 62% Price Spike\n\nAmong the impacted tokens included BNB, the native currency behind Binance, the world\u2019s largest ecosystem. The coin currently oscillates within a $30 range as bears dominate price action. From the daily chart, BNB has resistance at $260 and is down over 30% from April 2023 highs.\n\nLINK and SNX are seeing similar price actions, both recording losses on the 24-hour chart. LINK is down 2.97% to be trading at $6.63, while SNX is nursing 3.94% losses, bringing its price to $2.64.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

However, they believe that their approach has the potential to be more successful than previous attempts.\n\nEthena strives to become a pioneer in the crypto industry by developing a stablecoin and digital savings bond. These innovative financial products will be supported by derivatives and will maintain value, in relation to the US dollar without depending on the conventional financial system. Ethena is focusing on creating these offerings for investors outside of the United States.\n\nOne of their products is a stablecoin that has a mechanism to preserve its peg to the US dollar. Additionally they are working on introducing the worlds native savings bond.\n\nFormer BitMex CEO, Arthur Hayes will provide guidance and advice to Ethena. The project secured a $6 million seed funding from DragonFly, a venture capital firm specializing in investments, which was founded by Arthur Hayes himself. Notable participants in this round include crypto derivative exchanges like Deribit, ByBit, OKX, Gemini and Huobi.\n\nThe ultimate objective of Ethena is to establish an alternative to banking systems worldwide. They firmly believe that their stablecoin and savings bond will offer individuals a decentralized and accessible means of preserving and growing wealth.\n\nAccording to Guy Young, the Founder and CEO of Ethena their platform aims to address the immediate need within the crypto space: DeFi endeavors to create a parallel financial system; however stablecoins, which are vital financial instruments in this sector remain completely reliant, on traditional banking infrastructure.\n\n\n\nWe strongly believe that individuals worldwide should have access, to a financial tool, a dollar based savings instrument to securely store their wealth. With our stablecoin we are bringing to life our vision of a native stablecoin that does not rely on traditional banking systems. This enables the creation of an permissionless internet bond.\n\nA breakdown of what Ethena does:\n\n\n\nStablecoin: The Ethena stablecoin will be backed by derivatives holding equal amounts of staked ETH and perpetual swaps shorting Ethereum. This unique approach allows it to maintain its peg to the US dollar without depending on the infrastructure. This improvement addresses some of the limitations found in existing stablecoins which are often susceptible to manipulation and volatility.\n\n\n\nSavings bond: The Ethena savings bond will be a token that function similarly to a US treasury bond. However it distinguishes itself by being permissionless and accessible to individuals around the world. This means that anyone, regardless of their location or financial standing will have the opportunity to invest in the Ethena savings bond.\n\n\n\nDecentralized: Ethenas stablecoin and savings bond will be built on the Ethereum blockchain ensuring decentralization and transparency. This means that there won\u2019t be a single point of failure and people will have control over their funds.\n\nAccessible: Everyone around the world, regardless of their location or financial status, will have access to Ethenas stablecoin and savings bonds. This accessibility is made possible because they will be built on the Ethereum blockchain, a platform that\u2019s source and permissionless.\n\nThis Isn\u2019t The First Time Stablecoins Backed By Derivatives Have Been Created\n\nYou heard it right! In the past there has been attempts to create stablecoins backed by derivatives. One example is Basis Cash, which launched in 2020. Basis Cash tried to maintain its value by relying on a mix of derivatives linked to the US dollar, gold and oil. Unfortunately it failed to maintain its peg and therefore had to shut down in 2021.\n\nAnother failed attempt was IRON Finance, which was launched in 2021. IRON Finance used derivatives tied to the US dollar and Ethereum as its backing. IRON Finance was also shut down in 2021 after it even tually lost $150 million due to a hack.\n\nThe failures of Basis Cash and IRON Finance highlight the challenges in creating a stablecoin backed by derivatives that are both secure and dependable. Ethena presents an approach to leveraging derivatives for stabilizing a coin, which holds the potential, for success.\n\nIn the past there have been challenges, in understanding the complexities of derivatives. This has made it difficult for issuers to effectively manage the risks involved in using derivatives to support a stablecoin.\n\nThe trading costs associated with derivatives can be quite high. This poses a challenge for issuers who need to generate revenue to cover the expenses of maintaining the stablecoins value.\n\nDerivatives are subject to regulations in jurisdictions. This adds another layer of difficulty for issuers as they strive to comply with the rules and regulations.\n\nDespite these obstacles there are advantages in using derivatives as collateral for a stablecoin such as enhanced security, increased reliability and improved efficiency.\n\n\u201cEthena is building the holy grail of stablecoins: a coin that is truly stable, decentralized, and capital-efficient,\u201d said Tom Schmidt, General Partner at Dragonfly. \u201cStablecoins have grown massively in popularity over the past few years by providing access to USD-denominated savings and remittances for people around the world, but they\u2019ve always been handicapped by one of these three issues. Ethena has a breakthrough design that remedies these issues while also benefiting a broad user-base. We\u2019re thrilled to be partnering with them to bring their vision to life.\u201d\n\nEthena plans to utilize the initial investment to get ready for the release of their stablecoin and bond asset in the third quarter of 2023. This includes successfully finishing the testnet phase in Q3 of this year, establishing partnerships with prominent players in the industry and conducting thorough smart contract audits to guarantee the security and efficiency of the protocol."

        "content": "The recent ruling in favor of XRP has dispelled any negative regulatory challenges it had been facing, resulting in a head-turning rally over nearly 100% in 24 hours.\n\nEnough people are now paying attention to Ripple\u2019s cryptocurrency, that it\u2019s starting to pull capital from Bitcoin and Ethereum. And according to the charts of the three assets, XRP is poised to wildly outperform the two more dominant coins.\n\nXRP To Outperform Bitcoin and Ethereum After 6 Years Of Lagging\n\nUnlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, which enjoyed record-setting new highs in 2020 and 2021, XRP has yet to reach beyond its 2017 peak.\n\nThat\u2019s because in 2020 the United States Securities and Exchange Commission slapped Ripple and two of its top executives with a lawsuit alleging the sale of unregistered securities.\n\nWith those storm clouds now gone, it could be clear skies for XRP. The cryptocurrency, now ranked 4th by market cap, rallied nearly 100% in hours following the landmark ruling.\n\nThe fact it could have more catching up to do relative to Bitcoin and Ethereum is already attracting capital from BTC and ETH, according to each individual crypto-to-crypto trading pair.\n\nThe ADX is turning upward | XRPBTC on TradingView.com\n\nMajor Momentum Shift And Trend Change in BTC and ETH Trading Pairs\n\nMost cryptocurrencies are quoted in US dollars on exchanges through a crypto-to-fiat trading pair. But crypto assets also trade against other cryptocurrencies, for example, BTCETH. This pair represents Bitcoin quoted in Ethereum.\n\nOn the XRPBTC trading pair above and XRPETH pair below, a major downtrend line breakout is occurring. While this is happening, the Average Directional Index is strengthening and is above a reading of 20.\n\nMomentum is increasing | XRPETH on TradingView.com\n\nWhen the ADX rises above 20 it indicates an active trend. In addition, the LMACD shows momentum growing in XRP against both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Furthermore, XRP.D charts representing the coin\u2019s dominance against the rest of the market, is exhibiting similar signals.\n\nAll of these signs combined suggest that the cryptocurrency recently deemed not a security could wildly outperform BTC and ETH \u2014 much like it did in 2017. Is this time different?\n\nThis chart originally appeared in issue #12 of CoinChartist (VIP) alongside a dozen exclusive XRP, Bitcoin, and other charts. Subscribe for free."

        "content": "Home \u00bb Journal What Is Ethereum Rainbow Chart & How to Predict ETH Price? Journal What Is Ethereum Rainbow Chart & How to Predict ETH Price? Felix K\u00fcster\n\nMETA DESCRIPTION: The Ethereum Rainbow Chart can be a useful tool for analyzing ETH\u2019s price movements \u2013 learn how it can help you inform your investment decisions.\n\nThe Ethereum Rainbow Chart is a graphical representation of ETH price movements that uses color bands to indicate whether ETH is overvalued or overvalued at any given time. The chart draws data from historical Ethereum price data, presenting it in a logarithmic fashion.\n\nWith Ethereum showing robust bullish activity over the past couple of weeks and the movements in the broader crypto market driven by renewed investor optimism, many investors and Ethereum holders are wondering how ETH might perform in the coming weeks and months.\n\nIn this article, we are going to explain what is the Ethereum Rainbow Chart and how it can be used as a complementary tool to make informed investment decisions.\n\nWhat is the Ethereum Rainbow Chart?\n\nThe Ethereum Rainbow Chart is a graphical representation of Ethereum\u2019s past and potential future price trajectory, offering a streamlined view of the main resistance and support price levels. The chart is modeled using logarithmic regression and uses a color-coded spectrum to represent the different price zones.\n\nThe Ethereum Rainbow Chart allows you to easily analyze historical and future ETH price movements. Image source: CoinCodex\n\nThe colors in the Ethereum Rainbow Chart go from dark red to blue, like in a rainbow, hence the name. The red band is the most expensive, and the blue band is the cheapest. In total, there are nine distinct bands, each showing what a particular price level could mean in a historical context \u2013 if you see that Ethereum is trading in the dark red band, for instance, you can quickly deduce that ETH is heavily overbought and could see a big price correction going forward.\n\nIt is worth pointing out that the Ethereum Rainbow Chart shouldn\u2019t be used as a foolproof prediction tool due to its limitations. It can\u2019t take into account things like current events, software development, investment sentiment, or any other external data points that could have an impact on ETH price. Instead, it relies on historical price movement trends to model future price movements. For this reason, the Rainbow Chart works best as a complementary research tool and shouldn\u2019t be used as an exclusive source of information.\n\nHow to use the Ethereum Rainbow Chart to predict ETH price?\n\nThe idea behind the chart is to help you make better decisions about when to buy or sell Ethereum. For example, if the price of ETH is in the red band, it means that it is very high compared to its historical trend, and it might be a good time to sell some of your ETH and take some profits.\n\nOn the other hand, if the price of Ethereum is in the blue band, it means that it is very low compared to its historical trend, and it might be a good time to buy some Ethereum and hold it for the long term.\n\nEach band on the chart features a self-explanatory description of different ETH price levels. Image source: CoinCodex\n\nHere\u2019s an example of how using the Ethereum Rainbow Chart can come in handy in a real-world setting. Let\u2019s say you might be interested in knowing whether buying ETH at its current price might be worth it based on past price trends. With the price of ETH hovering around $1,850 at the time of writing, we can consult the chart to see how that price compares to historical movements.\n\nIn the image above, we can see that the current price of ETH positions it in the yellow band, which is right in the middle of the pack. This means that Ethereum markets are currently balanced, with no significant overselling or overbuying going on. However, if you are looking to hold ETH for a longer period of time \u2013 for example, till the end of the year \u2013 that same price of $1,850 would position ETH in the \u201cStill cheap\u201d band, signaling that it might be a good price level to enter the position.\n\nIf ETH is trading in one of the higher bands, you should consider selling it and taking profit. Image source. CoinCodex\n\nThese findings can inform your investment decisions and allow you to plan your trades accordingly. As a basic rule of thumb, you should be more willing to sell your ETH when it is in the higher bands and hold onto it or even buy some more when it is in the lower bands.\n\nEthereum Rainbow Chart is a great analytical tool, but make sure to consider its limitations\n\nThe Ethereum Rainbow Chart draws data from nearly 8 years of Ethereum historical price data, providing an easy-to-understand view of ETH\u2019s price movements and its support and resistance levels. Still, the Rainbow Chart relies on historical data exclusively, so it shouldn\u2019t be used as a primary investment resource.\n\nHowever, in combination with a prediction tool like CoinCodex\u2019s Ethereum price prediction algorithm, which takes into account additional technical indicators and the cyclic nature of crypto bull and bear markets, the Rainbow Chart can be a very powerful tool.\n\nGenerally speaking, the price peaks and valleys you can find on the Ethereum Rainbow Chart are largely correlated with Bitcoin\u2019s halving cycle. Usually, the cryptocurrency prices reach their peak about a year into each halving cycle and revisit it every four years. The next BTC halving, the fourth so far, is expected to happen in the spring of 2024. Check the video below to see which cryptocurrencies could be a good investment in light of the next halving event."

        "content": "Ripple\u2019s XRP has recently emerged as a strong contender with the potential to outperform the behemoths, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). A recent legal victory has cleared the regulatory uncertainty surrounding XRP, setting the stage for a remarkable rally while attracting attention from cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors alike.\n\nWhy XRP Is Poised To Wildly Outperform Bitcoin And Ethereum https://t.co/7r3SXGylVV \u2014 DJ Peter Vas (32k) (@PeterVas6) July 18, 2023\n\nThe Bitcoinist recently expressed its confidence that all the pieces are aligning together, which may drive XRP to outshine the OGs of the industry, namely BTC and ETH. In this article, we will delve into the factors that could propel the coin to outshine its competitors and its historic trajectory.\n\nClearing Regulatory Hurdles\n\nXRP, the crypto associated with Ripple, faced significant regulatory challenges in the past. One of them arises from the question as to whether or not it is a security. However, a favorable ruling in a lawsuit has now dispelled these clouds of uncertainty, instigating a jaw-dropping rally in the token\u2019s value. With its identity now put to rest, the potential for growth has never been stronger.\n\nXRP\u2019s Catch-Up Game\n\nWhile Bitcoin and Ethereum reached historic highs in 2020 and 2021, XRP lagged behind, unable to surpass its 2017 peak. Nevertheless, its recent surge suggests that XRP is prepared to bridge the gap. Market analysts expect this catch-up game to attract capital from the leading cryptocurrencies, as savvy investors recognize the potential for substantial returns.\n\nXRP to USD\n\nThe Crypto-to-Crypto Trading Advantage\n\nUnlike conventional crypto-to-fiat trading pairs, where most cryptocurrencies are quoted against the US dollar, XRP\u2019s advantage lies in its crypto-to-crypto trading pairs. This includes trading against Bitcoin (XRPBTC) and Ethereum (XRPETH).\n\nXRPBTC trajectory (Source: TradingView)\n\nXRP\u2019s upward momentum against these established competitors is undeniable, as indicated by the Average Directional Index (ADX) surging above 20, a signal of an active trend.\n\nXRPETH trajectory (Source: TradingView)\n\nBreaking Downtrend Resistance\n\nIn recent market movements, XRP has exhibited a significant breakout from its downtrend line. This event signifies a potential shift in the tide for the cryptocurrency. The strengthening ADX and the LMACD (Logarithmic Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicator suggest a growing momentum for XRP against both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Moreover, XRP\u2019s dominance charts against the rest of the market reveal similar promising signals.\n\nXRP\u2019s Previous Performance\n\nTo assess the potential for outperformance, one must revisit XRP\u2019s past achievements. In 2017, XRP experienced a historic rally, surpassing both Bitcoin and Ethereum in returns. Now, with the regulatory hurdles cleared and the crypto-to-crypto advantage on its side, XRP may have all the elements to replicate or even surpass its previous success.\n\nFinal Thoughts: Could This Time Be Different?\n\nWhile XRP\u2019s recent surge is reminiscent of its 2017 performance, many investors are asking whether this time will be different. The increased interest in XRP from the crypto community and the evident technical signals suggest a strong possibility of a sustained rally. However, it\u2019s essential to remember that the crypto market is inherently volatile and unpredictable, so investors should exercise caution."
