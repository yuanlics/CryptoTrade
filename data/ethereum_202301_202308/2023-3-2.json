        "title": "What Is the Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade? - Investopedia",
        "content": "The Ethereum Shanghai hard fork upgrade in March 2023 is designed to give Ethereum cryptocurrency network users access to their staked ether (ETH) funds for the first time, which is a major change for the platform.\n\nThese assets have been allocated toward Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake (PoS) Beacon Chain network backbone, so the move will allow ETH holders to stake the tokens without locking them up indefinitely, perform transaction validations, and receive rewards of newly created tokens.\n\nEthereum is a decentralized global software platform powered by blockchain technology that has been advancing at a steady pace since its launch in 2015. Now, the network is set to change significantly again with the Shanghai upgrade.\n\nKey Takeaways The Ethereum cryptocurrency network\u2019s so-called Shanghai upgrade is a hard fork slated to launch in March 2023.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade will let holders of ether (ETH), Ethereum\u2019s native token, unstake the assets for the first time, giving them greater access to their holdings.\n\nEthereum surpassed 500,000 validators on its network, which is a large number considering that stakers\u2019 ETH assets are locked up.\n\nEthereum\u2019s development team will focus its attention on sharding, or database partitioning, and other important changes after the Shanghai upgrade is completed.\n\nWhat Is the Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade?\n\nIt\u2019s important to understand the history of recent events at Ethereum before diving into the Shanghai upgrade. This major upgrade is, after all, the culmination of what came before.\n\nThe Ethereum network is designed to be scalable, programmable, secure, and decentralized. It is the blockchain of choice for developers and ventures creating technology based upon it to change how many industries operate and how we conduct our daily lives.\n\nEthereum started off with a proof-of-work (PoW) validation mechanism but began its journey toward PoS with the launch of the Beacon Chain in December 2020. This was a new era for Ethereum, with the Beacon Chain coordinating user staking, which is only possible on PoS systems, on Ethereum. The contract for the Beacon hit its target of 524,288 ETH a week before the launch.\n\nStaking gives crypto holders a way of putting their digital assets to work and earning passive income without selling the assets, similar to putting money in a high-yield savings account. When someone deposits funds, the bank takes the money and often lends it out. In return for locking up that money, the account holder is given a small portion of the interest earned from lending.\n\nIn September 2022, the Ethereum Merge joined Ethereum\u2019s PoS Beacon Chain with the Ethereum Mainnet to transition the Ethereum blockchain off the legacy PoW system. The merge gave birth to Ethereum 2.0, a new version of Ethereum that will lead to a 99.95% reduction in Ethereum\u2019s energy consumption and the ability to further scale its ecosystem.\n\nOver several months, the merge went through many testnet checks before eventually being completed\u2014a development that made the Ethereum network a PoS one. The event was covered in both the crypto industry and the mainstream media.\n\nHowever, one sizable issue remained: cost. The minimum amount of ETH required for staking to join the Beacon Chain was 32 ETH. The price of ETH, at the time, was about $4,000 (it traded around $1,550 on March 3, 2023). That $128,000-equivalent entry point was beyond the reach of most individuals, but at least it was the start of a more democratic PoS mechanism for Ethereum.\n\nAt that time, staked ETH couldn\u2019t be unstaked\u2014which is what the Shanghai upgrade changes. This left users\u2019 ETH funds locked until they could be released.\n\nSome teams in the crypto industry saw opportunities to address this issue. Several projects in the space began working on a more accessible way to stake on Ethereum. Called liquid staking, this allowed individuals to contribute smaller amounts of ETH, receiving a token that represents their staked ETH value. This token can be traded freely and used elsewhere, and in that sense is liquid.\n\nSome of the most popular liquid-staking options are offered on the platforms Lido, Coinbase, and Rocket Pool. Lido has especially been popular and accounts for the vast majority of the liquid-staked ETH.\n\nUnderstanding the Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade is actually a series of upgrades for the Ethereum network, and, collectively, their effects are significant.\n\nThe scheduled March 2023 launch was preceded by the Shandong network test, or testnet, in 2022. Shanghai comprises several upgrades, but the most impactful one allows ETH stakers to remove both their staked ETH and the rewards accrued. This has long been sought by Ethereum users and the crypto community at large. This change is established in the EIP-4895 proposal.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade also has several other proposals related to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Object Format (EOF), which is a software component of all EVM-compatible blockchains that contains more than 120 operation codes that give decentralized programmability to the networks. However, developers have said that if these can\u2019t be implemented in time, they will be postponed until later in the year to avoid delaying the unstaking of ETH.\n\nNotably, one of the proposals that won\u2019t be present in the March 2023 release is EIP-4844. This proposal introduces what the team calls \u201cproto-danksharding,\u201d which sets up the highly anticipated sharding upgrade for Ethereum due in 2024. This proposal will increase scalability by sharding data, which is a database-partitioning technique used to enable platforms to process more transactions per second.\n\nEthereum has been experiencing some heavy deposit activity in the lead-up to the Shanghai upgrade. The platform\u2019s total validators surpassed 500,000 validators in mid-January 2023\u2014a sizable figure, given that ETH can\u2019t yet be unstaked.\n\nMetaMask also has joined in, with the wallet integrating both Lido and Rocket Pool so that their users can stake ETH directly from their MetaMask wallets, once the Shanghai upgrade is complete.\n\nWhat Will Change with the Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade?\n\nMore than $17 million in ETH was staked after the Ethereum Merge, as of March 2023, so that likely means many individuals will want to unstake their ETH. However, there will be a cap of around 43,200 ETH per day for withdrawal amounts. That way, there won\u2019t be a large migration of validators out of the network.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see the price of ETH rise after a successful upgrade. This has happened in the past, and, so far, everything looks on track for the Shanghai hard fork.\n\nWhat Does the Future Hold for Ethereum?\n\nEthereum\u2019s future amounts to much more than its switch to proof of stake. The platform\u2019s developers have systematically analyzed the changes that the network needs, not rushing into alterations, in an attempt to ensure that everything is in place for a successful upgrade.\n\nAllowing stakers access to their ETH will eliminate this concern about Ethereum for the crypto community. The development team can then turn its attention to something even more important for Ethereum\u2019s success: the introduction of sharding. Ethereum\u2019s scalability goals ultimately will determine if the network becomes the future of finance, as many have projected.\n\nWhat is Ethereum? Ethereum is a decentralized global software platform powered by blockchain technology. It is most commonly known for its native cryptocurrency, ether (ETH).\n\nWhat is Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade? When is it scheduled to happen? The Ethereum Shanghai upgrade is actually a series of upgrades for the Ethereum network, and, collectively, their effects are significant. Perhaps most impactful is that this scheduled update will give ETH token holders access to their staked assets, a major change for the network and its users. It\u2019s set to launch in March 2023.\n\nWhat improvements will Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai update bring? The biggest improvement is that users will be allowed to unstake their ETH. The Shanghai upgrade also has several other proposed changes related to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Object Format (EOF), which is a software component of all EVM-compatible blockchains that gives decentralized programmability to the networks. And it sets the stage for sharding later, which should add scalability and faster transaction processing for Ethereum.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nEthereum enthusiasts and the crypto market in general should welcome the changes coming from the Shanghai upgrade. It is a relatively small step for the project, but it paves the way for many more major adjustments ahead.\n\nFor the crypto movement, the Shanghai upgrade stands as the next major milestone for Ethereum, forever altering how it operates and giving staking users new access to their ETH assets."

        "title": "On The Future Of Ethereum - Ledger",
        "content": "Charles Guillemet, CTO at Ledger, reflects on the future of Ethereum and the protocol\u2019s potential to support Web3\u2019s mainstream adoption.\n\n\n\nThings to know:\n\n\n\n\u2013 Ethereum, the world\u2019s second-largest blockchain by market cap, recently underwent a significant software upgrade called The Merge, shifting from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake consensus.\n\n\n\n\u2013 While a successful transition, questions remain about Ethereum\u2019s scalability and readiness for the next stage of Web3\u2019s development.\n\n\n\n\u2013 This article delves into Ethereum\u2019s scaling challenges and evaluates its ability to meet mainstream adoption needs. It argues that, while a flawless scaling solution does not exist yet, Layer 2s including Optimistic and Validity Rollups hold the most potential for increased scalability with a good tradeoff for the blockchain trilemma.\n\n\n\n\u2013 More precisely, optimistic and Validity Rollups, using ZKP technology, will be key in shaping the future of Ethereum by enabling trustless, complex, and permissionless transactions at scale.\n\n\n\n\n\nScaling Ethereum: The Quest For A Solution\n\nEthereum, like many blockchains, currently faces limited transaction processing capacity. Despite supporting ETH transfers and thousands of DApps, increased usage has resulted in slower and more expensive transactions.\n\nTo mitigate high fees, this situation drove insecure design decisions such as off-chain centralized services for NFT marketplaces. The introduction of EIP-1559 improved fee estimation and incentivization, but hasn\u2019t significantly improved scalability. The scalability challenge is well understood within the popular blockchain trilemma of Scalability, Decentralization, and Security.\n\nThe blockchain trilemma asserts that it\u2019s not possible to simultaneously achieve three properties: decentralization, security, and scalability. Sacrifice on decentralization, it\u2019s much easier to build a scalable and secure system, as Web2 has already proven. Prioritize scalability by sacrificing on your consensus mechanism and you have a pointless, unsafe, decentralized blockchain. Solving the Blockchain trilemma is incredibly complex and has been an ongoing challenge for the last decade.\n\nBoosting Throughput: Multiple Approaches\n\nOver the years, many solutions have been addressed to solve the Ethereum blockchain trilemma. A popular suggestion is to build bigger blocks or blocks per second. While it may seem like a good idea, it intensifies demands on blockchain nodes and validators/miners for consensus, leading to increased centralization. It also slows reorgs, increasing security risks.\n\nAn alternative is creating a side-chain to reduce the load of the main chain, as seen with the Polygon network. This system involves security tradeoffs as it relies on a weaker consensus than Ethereum (less market cap). While it may suit specific use cases, it often leads to centralization and does not fully address Ethereum\u2019s scalability issues. And anyway, it\u2019s still far away from the tens of thousands requests needed to run a Visa-like system.\n\nLayer 2s & Sharding: Solutions To Ethereum\u2019s Scalability Challenges?\n\nSharding and Layer 2s are widely seen as the best options for Ethereum to scale while preserving the blockchain trilemma.\n\nOn the one hand, blockchain sharding has long been considered as the key to scalability in the blockchain world. It was the main feature of Eth2.0 in 2019 with the move to the BLS signature scheme, PoS consensus mechanism, and the implementation of eWASM. On the other hand, Layer 2s have seen rapid advancement through ongoing research in roll-up mechanisms. Let\u2019s explore the current state of these two competing approaches and what their future may hold.\n\nHow Does Blockchain Sharding Work?\n\nThe term sharding stems from database science where we partition horizontally a database into smaller, manageable pieces called shards. Each shard is a separate database that contains a data subset. Sharding is used to scale databases by distributing data and queries across multiple servers, allowing the database to handle a larger volume of data without needing a single, powerful server.\n\nThis idea of leveraging sharding on blockchains quickly became popular among developers. Blockchain sharding divides the network into smaller sub-networks called shards, and shards enable processing transactions in parallel. In a sharded blockchain, each shard is a separate chain that operates independently. This means that each node, miner/validator can focus on a given shard to create a local consensus. First, it allows transactions to be processed in parallel. Second, each shard has fewer transactions to manage. Sounds perfect, so what\u2019s the catch?\n\nSharding Challenges: Consensus, Cross-Shard Communication & Security\n\nWith blockchain sharding, it\u2019s not easy to define the overall consensus. What is the network\u2019s global consensus? Is it the union of each local consensus? How and where do you anchor these local consensus to create a global one that anyone can trust? Such questions are not easy to answer.\n\nAnother significant challenge to implementing sharding is cross-shard communication. When it comes to databases, you don\u2019t have this issue since data is split over different shards, enabling you to read or write them independently without real problems. When it comes to blockchain shards executing code, this is much more complex. Each shard must be able to run its own code, consult the state of a different shard, and execute code on another. This is not trivial.\n\nThis sharding difficulty also relates to the problem of security. This issue has been studied by experts and different sharding schemes have been considered prone to many new forms of attacks. First of all, it simply questions the consensus mechanism. If you have 10 shards, and miners are distributed per shard, taking over one shard is 10 times less costly than taking over the overall blockchain. Schematically, the 51% attack translates into 5.1%. One solution to this is to change the consensus mechanism from Proof of Work to Proof Of Stake. This was the primary motivation for Ethereum\u2019s transition to Proof Of Stake.\n\nOn the security front, the effect of The Merge has been largely debated. On the decentralization front, the updated Ethereum consensus favored centralization, given that token ownership determines network control.\n\nRegarding Ethereum\u2019s new consensus, several parameters incentivized centralization:\n\nRunning your Ethereum node is not straightforward, requiring resources and uptime. It simply prevents your wallet from implementing it and running on your laptop or even your mobile.\n\nThe 32 ETH threshold and the fact it\u2019s not possible to unstake until an unknown date created a Pooling and liquid staking where Lido and exchanges took most of the market. Today 4 actors are controlling more than 55% of the coins staked on the Ethereum blockchain (Lido 29.2%, Coinbase 13.1%, Kraken 7.6%, and Binance 6.2%).\n\nAll in all, blockchain sharding is an interesting idea for increasing scalability, but requires complex architecture, specifically when it comes to defining the overall consensus and implementing an efficient cross-shard protocol. A lot of work has been done toward these goals, but we\u2019re still far from implementing them and seizing the impacts on the blockchain trilemma.\n\nRollups to the rescue\n\nRollups compress multiple transactions into a single transaction for Ethereum to execute, enabling off-chain execution of many transactions with Ethereum\u2019s security for settlements. There are two main implementations of this idea:\n\nOptimistic Rollups, allowing users to issue fraud proofs in case of dispute\n\nZK-Rollups where the L2 network issues validity proofs.\n\nOptimistic Rollups and finality issue:\n\nOptimistic Rollups have been designed as the most EVM-looking Rollups. They are optimistic since they assume that users are not submitting fraudulent transactions, allowing direct blockchain writing.\n\nThere is a mechanism using fraud proofs that L2 validators can initialize to check the off-chain transactions made within a few days (7 days on Optimism). A valid fraud-proof identifies fraudulent steps in the transaction process, leading to the reversal of the transaction and a penalty for the approving validator. This improves transaction throughput while preserving Ethereum\u2019s mainchain security.\n\nHowever, Optimistic Rollups bring a new challenge: finality. With blockchains, confirmed transactions are considered permanent and irreversible, but this depends on the consensus mechanism. For instance, PoW chains consider transactions final when the probability of a reorg is low, and Bitcoin transactions are final after 6 confirmations. With optimistic rollups, transactions can be reversed after several days, which creates a finality challenge and a different tradeoff.\n\nAnother kind of rollup: ZK-Rollups\n\nZK-Rollups, named for their use of Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) technology such as SNARKs or STARKs, are another type of Rollup. Since the Zero-knowledge property is not actually useful, calling them Validity Rollups could be more accurate.\n\nThe Rollup executes a batch of transactions and produces a validity proof, verified by a smart contract on Ethereum blockchain, that confirms the final outcome of the transactions. The cryptographic proof is generated using Zero Knowledge cryptographic primitives.\n\nMore broadly, zero-knowledge proofs allow one party (verifier) to demonstrate possession of certain information to another party (verifier) without revealing the actual information. The verifier can be confident in the truth of the verifier\u2019s statement without learning its content.\n\nOriginally designed for confidentiality, ZKRollups use zero-knowledge proofs for a very different purpose: compression and trusted computing. The two leading zero-knowledge technologies are zk-STARKs (stands for a zero-knowledge scalable transparent argument of knowledge) and zk-SNARKs (stands for a zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge).\n\nData availability problem for L2:\n\nAs we\u2019ve seen, ZKP technologies ensure the validity of the L2 state, but the proof alone doesn\u2019t provide access to the state. To increase throughput, execution is moved off-chain, but data must still be readily accessible for reconstruction. To achieve this, transactional data is submitted as calldata on Ethereum to ensure that the data is available for future reconstruction. This data could also be stored in trusted decentralized storage such as IPFS or Arweave allowing anyone to reconstruct the L2 and leveraging the inner incentives of decentralized storage.\n\nIt would be even better to have the capability to store this data on-chain, but the data only serves to reconstruct the state/truth of the L2 and isn\u2019t executed, making it an inefficient and expensive use of blockchain capacity.\n\nTo address this hurdle, Ethereum devs proposed two EIPs: EIP-4488 and EIP-4844 (good luck avoiding confusion). The first lowers the gas cost for calldata while the second creates a new transaction type for L2 data storage. This data is immutable and read-only, and cannot be accessed by the EVM and therefore cannot be executed.\n\nThese EIPs are exactly where the ZKRollup roadmap meets the Execution Sharding roadmap, both proposing the same concept for different purposes. EIP-4488 aims to store essential L2 data while EIP-4844, also known as Proto-Danksharding, is a step towards implementing Danksharding and execution sharding.\n\nDanksharding:\n\nDanksharding involves dividing large datasets into smaller parts for separation and processing, often in parallel. This method is used in big data and AI fields where training sets can be very large.\n\nProto-danksharding (EIP-4844) does not implement sharding but offers cheaper calldata storage that could be sharded. This cheaper calldata storage will greatly improve scalability for Ethereum on L2, potentially making sharding redundant.\n\nProto-danksharding:\n\nWith Proto-danksharding, the Ethereum blockchain will have non-scalable computation and scalable data. And ZkRollups essentially convert this scalable data and non-scalable but trusted computation into scalable computation.\n\nZKRollups in the blockchain trilemma:\n\nZKRollups have strong scalability benefits without changing underlying blockchain properties. To verify Zero-Knowledge proof on-chain is the main requirement, while data availability can be implemented off-chain. In the long run, one can expect that Layer-1s will become simple, secure, hopefully decentralized while Layer-2s will provide scalability.\n\nWhere\u2019s the catch?\n\nL2 can indeed scale a lot. Nonetheless, to be settled on-chain (on L1), one needs to produce a proof of validity for the overall state of the L2, causing centralization issues. Currently, L2 designs have only one prover, meaning that they can censor your transactions. They couldn\u2019t really freeze your L1 assets since native bridges are built. The research is ongoing to tackle this challenge, allowing other parties to be able to emit proofs, but some difficult questions remain for the arbitration between these proofs. In all cases this is an important problem to solve for the future.\n\nStarknet has identified this as an important topic on the roadmap, while Arbitrum divides responsibility between the sequencer inbox and the delayed inbox to ensure funds can be retrieved in case of censorship.\n\nClosing Thoughts\n\nAs we\u2019ve examined, scalability can come at a cost to security and decentralization, while Layer 2 solutions are seen as the most promising ways to increase scalability without compromising the other aspects of the blockchain trilemma.\n\nOptimistic and Validity Rollups, using ZKP technology, will be vital in shaping the future of Ethereum by enabling trustless, complex, and permissionless transactions at scale. Validity Rollups have a significant advantage over Optimistic Rollups: short finality. Ethereum\u2019s roadmap has recently shifted to support these rollups at the blockchain level.\n\nThe future of blockchain scalability includes complex DApps running on Layer 2s (or recursive rollups), allowing virtually infinite scalability, with decentralized and secure layer-1 being given. In the long-term, Layer 1 could become settlement layers, with the complexity of DApps moved to Layer 2s."

        "content": "The price of Ethereum\u2019s native token, Ether (ETH), shows a growing conflict among traders about the market direction for March. This uncertainty has resulted in ETH price consolidating inside a narrow sideways range between $1,600 and $1,700 since Feb. 15.\n\n25% ETH price correction on the table in March\n\nThe uncertainty stems from Ethereum\u2019s long-awaited Shanghai upgrade going live sometime in March.\n\nSeveral analysts predict the upgrade, which will enable stakers to withdraw their vested tokens from Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake (PoS) smart contract, will trigger a short-term sell-off event.\n\nThe Ethereum PoS smart contract has attracted more than 17.4 million ETH (~$28.35 billion at the current exchange rate) since its introduction in December 2020, per Etherscan.\n\nIn addition, Ether is finding it difficult to break above the technical resistance range.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum\u2019s eagerly anticipated Shanghai upgrade, which will enable the withdrawal of staked ETH, will likely occur in the first two weeks of April, the network\u2019s core developers determined on a call Thursday.\n\nThough the upgrade had been firmly slated for a March release, some Ethereum developers began doubting that timeline would stick as early as January, as previously reported by Decrypt.\n\nEthereum\u2019s developers now plan to launch the Goerli testnet, essentially a comprehensive dress rehearsal of the Shanghai upgrade, on or around March 14. About a month later, should everything proceed smoothly, the actual Shanghai software update will go live mid-April.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe exact timing of Shanghai\u2019s implementation has been particularly closely watched due to the upgrade\u2019s seismic financial implications. Ever since Ethereum began transitioning to a proof-of-stake model\u2014in which Ethereum transactions are validated by users who have staked ETH with the network\u2014those same users have accumulated rewards for their network participation in the form of newly generated ETH. Since ETH staking began in December 2020, a whopping $28.7 billion worth of ETH (and counting) has been deposited with Ethereum. That\u2019s about 14.5% of all ETH in circulation.\n\nThose funds and the rewards they\u2019ve spawned, however, are not yet available for withdrawal. Making it possible for Ethereum users to withdraw their staked ETH is the core component of Shanghai.\n\nBy far the largest entities currently staking with Ethereum are intermediary staking services like Lido and crypto exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance. Those four companies, which pool together customers\u2019 ETH to stake them and earn passive rewards, currently account for 56% of all ETH staked with the network, according to Dune Analytics.\n\nThose firms\u2014many of which have sagged in the current crypto winter\u2014have a clear incentive to start churning out staked ETH rewards to customers and skimming fees off the top. JP Morgan analysts predicted in January that the Shanghai upgrade alone could \u201cusher in a new era\u201d for struggling crypto exchange Coinbase. The investment bank estimates that staking could earn Coinbase between $225 million and $545 million in revenue per year.\n\nWith so much riding on the upgrade, Ethereum\u2019s core developers have scrambled to get Shanghai out the door as quickly as possible. The network\u2019s developers removed other anticipated and much-need improvements to the Ethereum network from Shanghai to hasten its release, and even avoided adding minor technical tweaks to Ethereum\u2019s encoding methods to the upgrade, in a decision that could create technical debt for the network in years to come.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt feels like we\u2019re not thinking about the long-term health of Ethereum,\u201d said core developer Micah Zoltu, who protested those decisions, during a developers\u2019 meeting on the subject in January. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking, \u2018How do we do what the public wants, today?\u2019\u201d\n\nSacrifices made to speed up Shanghai\u2019s release, however, may have been in vain\u2014now that the upgrade is slipping, even if slightly, from its original release schedule."

        "content": "Developers Launch Account Abstraction Via New ERC-4337 Standard\n\nBy: Samuel Haig \u2022 Loading...\n\nDeFi News\n\nEthereum developers announced the surprise deployment of the ERC-4337 standard at ETHDenver\u2019s WalletCon event on March 1.\n\nThe standard enables what\u2019s called \u201caccount abstraction,\u201d allowing wallets to operate as programmable smart contracts. The feature allows users to program wallet recovery options as a precaution protecting them against losing access to their private keys in the future.\n\nEthereum Foundation security researcher Yoav Weiss broke the news, noting that the code successfully passed a security audit from OpenZeppelin. ERC-4337 was deployed as a smart contract, meaning no major changes to the core Ethereum protocol were needed to launch the new standard.\n\nERC-4337 is now available on all blockchain networks offering compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine \u2014 Ethereum\u2019s core smart contract engine.\n\nERC-4337 was proposed by several of Ethereum\u2019s top researchers, including Weiss and Vitalik Buterin, in September 2021. Transactions involving ERC-4337 require specialized validators and are processed by an alternative mempool to other Ethereum transactions.\n\nLeading wallet applications like MetaMask and Coinbase provide users with Externally Owned Accounts, where only a person who controls the private keys for an account can initiate transactions.\n\nBy contrast, Contract Account wallets are programmed by smart contracts and provide greater flexibility in how private keys and transactions are managed, meaning users can program different mechanisms enabling wallet recovery.\n\nAccount Abstraction could allow users to do away with the common practice of backing up a set of words on a piece of paper, enabling new ways to secure wallets. For example, users could set up two-factor authentication to access a wallet via biometric data, or program multi-signature wallets providing shared access to a single account.\n\nVitalik Buterin, Ethereum\u2019s chief scientist and co-founder, also said ERC-4337 enables a fully decentralized fee market for smart contract wallet operations."

A hard fork is a permanent split between a new blockchain and its latest version, often adding or fixing features of a network.\n\nThe Shanghai fork will allow validators to withdraw their locked Ether for the first time since the staking feature went live in 2020. Over 17 million Ether (about US$26.7 billion) has since been staked.\n\nDuring the meeting, core developers agreed that the hard fork should occur at least two weeks after the \u201cGoerli testnet launch,\u201d which has been scheduled for March 14.\n\nThe \u201cShanghai Capella\u201d upgrade to Goerli, one of Ethereum\u2019s popular testnets, will be the last chance for Ethereum clients and staking providers to ensure the Shanghai hard fork can go through smoothly when the final \u201cmainnet\u201d version launches.\n\n\u201cSo imagine Goerli happens on the 14th, everything goes well, and on the 16th, we agree to move forward with mainnet \u2013 I think the earliest that puts us is like the first week of April,\u201d said Ethereum core developer and project coordinator Tim Beiko.\n\nBeiko noted in a Thursday Twitter thread that the Ethereum team did not explicitly agree to a mainnet date.

It provides a basis for various features such as account recovery and group-access wallets. Other possible applications include bundled and sponsored transactions for reduced transaction fees.\n\nIt will also allow platforms to provide crypto services without requiring users to set up a traditional wallet and manually store their seed phrase or private key. Account abstraction stores keys locally on the user\u2019s hardware security module (HSM) \u2060\u2014 not with any service provider \u2060\u2014 and therefore is as secure as a self-custodied crypto wallet.\n\nERC-4337 was added to Ethereum through a smart contract, which was introduced without forking the entire blockchain. The relevant smart contract was deployed on Feb. 28, several hours before the feature was officially announced.\n\nThe feature can also be introduced on any EVM-compatible blockchain, including BNB Smart Chain (BNB), Polygon (MATIC), Avalanche (AVAX), and many others.\n\nERC-4337 was notably endorsed by Visa last December. The company recognized account abstraction as a possible way for users to auto-schedule crypto payments.\n\nOther, more extensive Ethereum upgrades are also underway. The blockchain is preparing for its Shanghai upgrade, allowing validators to withdraw staked ETH. That feature was activated on a testnet this week and should be fully introduced this month."

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Shiba Inu Are Falling Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "What happened\n\nMany cryptocurrencies continued to slide today as investors digest the fallout from the crypto bank Silvergate Capital (SI -2.94%) and evaluate its ability to stay in business.\n\nThe price of the world's largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC 0.58%), is trading 4.3% lower than late yesterday afternoon as of 10 a.m. ET today. The price of the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum (ETH 0.33%), is roughly 4.1% lower, while the price of the meme token Shiba Inu (SHIB 0.09%) is down 5.8%.\n\nSo what\n\nAfter the market closed Wednesday, Silvergate submitted a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), stating that it would need to delay the filing of its annual report as it analyzed the impact of several events on its business.\n\nSilvergate operates a real-time payments network for U.S. dollars that crypto exchanges and institutional traders use to better facilitate crypto transactions. The network is very helpful for the crypto ecosystem because cryptocurrencies trade around the clock and the U.S. banking system operates on a lag.\n\nBut the scandal-laden bankruptcy of FTX, which had been a large client of Silvergate, prompted a bank run, and Silvergate saw nearly 70% of its digital-asset-related deposits leave the bank in the fourth quarter of 2022. The bank had to sell a big chunk of its bond portfolio, while it traded at a loss, to cover the deposit outflows, wiping out a big chunk of shareholder equity. Furthermore, many investors believed Silvergate could face some severe regulatory action due to its relationship with FTX, and media outlets have reported that the U.S. Department of Justice is looking into the bank.\n\nIn its filing with the SEC, Silvergate said it continued to sell bonds at a loss in January and February and that its capital levels could now be below regulatory requirements as a result. Furthermore, Silvergate is also currently assessing the impact of regulatory inquiries and investigations into the bank. All of this has led the bank to assess its \"ability to continue as a going concern.\"\n\nYesterday, some of Silvergate's major clients, such as Coinbase (COIN 0.78%), announced they would stop using the bank, and Silvergate's stock fell a whopping 58% and is down nearly an additional 11% today, trading around $5 per share. Although most cryptocurrencies fell yesterday, they held up decently given the news. Today, however, investors seem more worried.\n\n\"The bearish turn could certainly be a delayed reaction to Silvergate's ongoing issues,\" said Clara Medalie, director of research at Kaiko, according to CNBC. \"Many large exchanges and market makers partner with Silvergate for fast transactions between entities, and any halt in activity could have an impact on global crypto liquidity.\"\n\n\"In addition, there are now wider industry concerns that U.S. regulators are trying to cut off further banking relationships between crypto firms and FDIC-insured banks,\" Markus Thielen, the head of research at digital asset platform Matrixport, told Cointelegraph.\n\nNow what\n\nFederal banking regulators have issued multiple statements warning banks about the risks associated with certain crypto activities, and another large crypto bank, Signature Bank (SBNY), has also scaled back its crypto activities.\n\nThe news is of industrywide interest because services provided by Silvergate help exchanges, traders, and others easily change dollars to crypto and vice versa.\n\nI still think the largest cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, will be here for a long time and that people will continue to be able to swap them for fiat currencies. However, I have no interest in meme tokens like Shiba Inu right now."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price has been rejected from a significant resistance level following the turmoil surrounding Silvergate. However, there are still multiple support levels available to hold the price for now.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy: Edris\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nOn the daily timeframe, the price has been struggling to break above the $1800 level. The higher boundary of the large symmetrical triangle pattern and a bearish rejection has led to the breakdown of the 50-day moving average located around the $1600 mark.\n\nThe 200-day moving average, located around $1400, seems like the next probable support zone, followed by $1300, which could be tested if a deeper pullback occurs.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nOn the 4-hour chart, the price has been impulsively rejected from the $1650 level and is likely to test the $1500 support level soon. If this support level holds, ETH could once more target the $1650 level and the higher boundary of the triangle pattern.\n\nOn the other hand, a breakdown of the $1500 level would likely result in a deeper drop toward the $1350 area, as no significant support level exists between these 2 levels. The RSI indicator is also showing values below 50%, which points to the bears\u2019 dominance.\n\nHowever, the RSI is approaching the oversold zone, which could lead to a consolidation or bullish pullback in the short term.\n\nOnchain Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe following chart demonstrates the Estimated Leverage Ratio metric alongside ETH\u2019s price. The metric measures the average amount of leverage used by the futures market participants. Typically, increasing values indicate that more investors are taking high-leverage risk in the derivatives market.\n\nThe Estimated Leverage Ratio has slightly increased during the last few weeks, showing that the futures market might become overheated due to the recent bullish price moves.\n\nThe metric hasn\u2019t reached concerning levels yet, but if it continues spiking, participants should be wary due to the possibility of a short or perhaps even a long-squeeze event. In this case, a sudden impulsive move will occur in Ethereum\u2019s price.\n\nIn conclusion, the metric\u2019s behavior should be monitored in the upcoming weeks to prevent further losses."

In addition to supporting Ethereum mainnet, Stackup also supports Polygon mainnet, Polygon Mumbai testnet, and Goerli testnet.\n\nERC-4337 is a new standard for account abstraction, which enables user blockchain accounts to be smart contracts on EVM-based blockchains. This enables a simplified experience for users.\n\n\"Account abstraction has for a long time been a dream of the Ethereum developer community,\" said Vitalik Buterin, co-author of EIP-4337 and Chief Scientist of the Ethereum Foundation, in a blog post describing the proposal.\n\nStackup was founded by John and Hazim, who saw the need for automation of the hard parts of crypto for users, making it easy and accessible for everyone. The company's mission is to make the future of cryptocurrency accessible to all. With the launch of its node service, Stackup has taken a giant leap forward in giving the world access to a fair and open financial system.\n\n\"Accessibility is the biggest problem in blockchains, and we're proud to provide a critical part of the solution,\" said John, Co-founder of Stackup. \"Blockchain's biggest problem is that you basically have to be an expert to use it safely.

        "title": "Bitcoin is for Republicans, Ethereum is for Democrats - Fortune",
        "content": "Greetings from Colorado\u2019s capital, where more than 20,000 Ethereum enthusiasts have descended to celebrate ETHDenver, a multi-day extravaganza dedicated to demos, workshops, and a whole lot of hoopla related to their favorite blockchain. As usual, many of this year\u2019s attendees turned up wearing rainbows or outlandish animal costumes\u2014a colorful pageant that felt especially striking given that this year\u2019s ETHDenver is taking place at the city\u2019s fabled stockyard and rodeo grounds, which is adorned by images of cowboys, Budweiser, and other icons typically associated with red America.\n\nI remarked on the hippie-like vibe\u2014which included a \u201czen zone\u201d and an arena full of sleepings bags for 500 Ethereum scholarship attendees to stay overnight\u2014to a 50-something crypto industry professional, who was himself dressed in a vibrant shirt and hipster glasses. He nodded and observed, \u201cBitcoin is for Republicans, Ethereum is for Democrats.\u201d It\u2019s hard to disagree. While the hardcore Bitcoin crowd is fixated with hodling and suspicion of the government, the Ethereum set is more given over to radical experimentation and eccentricity.\n\nI put this characterization to Kevin Owocki, the founder of the open software promulgator Gitcoin, who has just launched Supermodular, a venture studio that aspires to commercialize a wide variety of Ethereum innovations. He described the political labels as \u201cvery reductionist,\u201d but conceded the broad strokes are correct. \u201cBitcoin is about red meat and guns\u2026Ethereum has rainbows and unicorns,\u201d Owocki noted.\n\nAll of this underscores the degree to which crypto culture has grown and become more diverse since the libertarian Satoshi published his famous white paper in 2008, and soon after embedded a warning about central bank profligacy in the first block of Bitcoin. Today, the two most important blockchains have come to embody very different political tribes, both of which offer new and distinct ideas, but also overlap with broader progressive and conservative cultural movements.\n\nFor the thousands of mostly young people packed into the stockyard building, however, politics was far from their minds. They were instead consumed by the prospects for the next phase of Ethereum, which successfully pulled off a very difficult switch to the environmentally friendly proof of stake last year, and is on track to introduce a host of other updates that will make the blockchain faster and easier to use. In May, it will be Bitcoin\u2019s turn to be the center of the crypto universe when its devotees gather in Miami Beach for an extravaganza of their own. We\u2019ll have a dispatch from there too, but for now, it\u2019s enough to observe that\u2014even after one of the industry\u2019s toughest years ever\u2014crypto and its colorful culture are more entrenched than ever.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nCoinbase purchased digital asset manager One River in a bet on future institutional demand for crypto.

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Shiba Inu are falling today - Seacoastonline.com",
        "content": "Bram Berkowitz\n\nThe Motley Fool\n\nMany cryptocurrencies continued to slide Friday as investors digest the fallout from the crypto bank Silvergate Capital (NYSE: SI) and evaluate its ability to stay in business.\n\nThe price of the world's largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), is trading 4.3% lower than late yesterday afternoon as of 10 a.m. ET today. The price of the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), is roughly 4.1% lower, while the price of the meme token Shiba Inu (CRYPTO: SHIB) is down 5.8%.\n\nSo what?\n\nAfter the market closed Wednesday, Silvergate submitted a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), stating that it would need to delay the filing of its annual report as it analyzed the impact of several events on its business.\n\nDo you have to report crypto on taxes? Yes. Here's what you should know about form 8949\n\nWondering how to avoid taxes?:Strategies used by super-rich Americans you can use, too\n\nSilvergate operates a real-time payments network for U.S. dollars that crypto exchanges and institutional traders use to better facilitate crypto transactions. The network is very helpful for the crypto ecosystem because cryptocurrencies trade around the clock and the U.S. banking system operates on a lag.\n\nMore:Sam Bankman-Fried, former FTX CEO, used straw donors to influence 2022 election, court filing says\n\nBut the scandal-laden bankruptcy of FTX, which had been a large client of Silvergate, prompted a bank run, and Silvergate saw nearly 70% of its digital-asset-related deposits leave the bank in the fourth quarter of 2022. The bank had to sell a big chunk of its bond portfolio, while it traded at a loss, to cover the deposit outflows, wiping out a big chunk of shareholder equity. Furthermore, many investors believed Silvergate could face some severe regulatory action due to its relationship with FTX, and media outlets have reported that the U.S. Department of Justice is looking into the bank.\n\nIn its filing with the SEC, Silvergate said it continued to sell bonds at a loss in January and February and that its capital levels could now be below regulatory requirements as a result. Furthermore, Silvergate is also currently assessing the impact of regulatory inquiries and investigations into the bank. All of this has led the bank to assess its \"ability to continue as a going concern.\"\n\nThursday, some of Silvergate's major clients, such as Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN), announced they would stop using the bank, and Silvergate's stock fell a whopping 58% and is down nearly an additional 11% Friday, trading around $5 per share. Although most cryptocurrencies fell Thursday, they held up decently given the news. On Friday, however, investors seem more worried.\n\n\"The bearish turn could certainly be a delayed reaction to Silvergate's ongoing issues,\" said Clara Medalie, director of research at Kaiko, according to CNBC. \"Many large exchanges and market makers partner with Silvergate for fast transactions between entities, and any halt in activity could have an impact on global crypto liquidity.\"\n\n\"In addition, there are now wider industry concerns that U.S. regulators are trying to cut off further banking relationships between crypto firms and FDIC-insured banks,\" Markus Thielen, the head of research at digital asset platform Matrixport, told Cointelegraph.\n\nNow what?\n\nFederal banking regulators have issued multiple statements warning banks about the risks associated with certain crypto activities, and another large crypto bank, Signature Bank (NASDAQ: SBNY), has also scaled back its crypto activities.\n\nThe news is of industrywide interest because services provided by Silvergate help exchanges, traders, and others easily change dollars to crypto and vice versa.\n\nI still think the largest cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, will be here for a long time and that people will continue to be able to swap them for fiat currencies. However, I have no interest in meme tokens like Shiba Inu right now.\n\nBram Berkowitz has positions in Bitcoin and Ethereum. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Bitcoin and Ethereum.

        "content": "Join the most important conversation in crypto and web3! Secure your seat today\n\nFlashbots, an Ethereum research and development firm, has made open source a new block builder operating in a trusted environment, in this case a private mempool, on Ethereum\u2019s Sepolia testnet, according to a press release shared exclusively with CoinDesk.\n\nThe research that Flashbots details will allow blocks to be built without revealing data on users\u2019 transactions, a step toward enhancing privacy.\n\nFlashbots has not given an immediate timeline when it will move out of the testnet.\n\nBlock builders are specialized third-party participants who construct blocks based on optimizing transactions. Block builders offer those blocks to relays, such as the relay Flashbots runs for MEV-Boost, in order to extract extra revenue made from reordering or including certain transactions.\n\nA mempool is like a waiting room, where pending transactions are sorted and stored before they are added to create a new block.\n\nRead more: What Is MEV, aka Maximal Extractable Value?\n\nFlashbots told CoinDesk the move aims to enable privacy features on Ethereum. The code was made open source in an effort to decentralize block building on the Ethereum protocol.\n\n\u201c\u200b\u200bImplementing block building inside encrypted enclaves brings us one step closer toward transaction confidentiality and decentralization of the block building role,\u201d Flashbots wrote in a blog post.\n\nExcited to announce that Flashbots is successfully running a block builder inside an SGX enclave!\n\nThis brings us a step closer toward transaction confidentiality and decentralization of the block building role.\n\nTons of open learnings, code and tooling! \u26a1\ufe0fhttps://t.co/rrlLq6jxLW \u2014 Chris Hager \u26a1\ud83e\udd16 (@metachris) March 3, 2023\n\nThis is not the first time that Flashbots has made its code open source. In August, when Tornado Cash was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Asset Control, Flashbots conveyed that its relay would also be censoring Tornado Cash transactions. As a result, Flashbots raced to open its code so others could decide whether to censor or not censor.\n\nOne reason open-source software is part of the Flashbots agenda is so others in the block-building space can \u201cbuild off the shared knowledge and test other solutions,\u201d the Flashbots team told CoinDesk. \u201cAnd, in reality, try to break it!\u201d\n\nRead more: Flashbots Proposes New Class of \u2018Matchmakers\u2019 to Share MEV Gains With Ethereum Users"

        "content": "Immutable continues its partnership with Warner Bros with the launch of the web3 mobile game Blocklete Golf from Discovery Sports on Immutable X.\n\nWarner Bros web3 adoption\n\nLast month, Warner Bros added a web3 quiz game to create the Bleacher Report Watch-to-Earn (B/R W2E game.) In addition, Warner is furthering its partnership with Immutable by migrating Blocklete Golf from the Flow blockchain to Immutable X. The migration is reportedly due to the \u201cfast transactions and gas-free NFTs minting backed by Ethereum\u2019s robust security and decentralization.\u201d\n\nAndrew Sorokovsky, VP of Global Business Development at Immutable, commented that,\n\n\u201c[Warner Bros]dedication to pushing the envelope and early adoption of web3 proves that decentralized solutions are on the fast track to mass adoption \u2014 offering millions of people new and exciting ways to interact with entertainment mediums while retaining full control over their digital assets.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Yang Adija, SVP of Digital Operations and Innovation for WBD Sports, called the move to Immutable \u201ca natural choice for us.\u201d\n\nBlocklete Golf\n\nBlocklete Golf is an interactive traditional mobile golf management game that allows players to guide golfing characters across virtual links in PvP matchups and tournaments. The game features the evolved Play-and-Earn model, which has become the default for many games looking to move away from the Play-to-Earn model, which saw Axie Infinity rise to stardom during the last bull run.\n\nCryptoSlate reported on the move away from \u2018Play-to-Earn\u2019 as far back as April 2022 in an interview with Polkastarter co-Founder Daniel Stockhaus who argued that web3 games should not focus on a purely \u2018Play-to-Earn\u2019 model. He said,\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it should be about earning for clicking within the game[\u2026] That\u2019s not providing value that\u2019s not creating a good world or good economy.\u201d\n\nBlocklete Golf looks to set the game apart from other web2 mobile games by allowing gamers to collect, train, and trade unique NFT-based avatars or use them to compete with others.\n\nBlockchain adoption\n\nThe Flow blockchain has been a first choice for several U.S.-based companies, such as the NBA and UFC. However, the surge of activity on the Immutable X blockchain, and adoption from companies such as Warner Bros, indicates a further appreciation of decentralized technologies by legacy web2 brands.\n\nWhile Flow introduced a permissionless smart contract offering in July 2022, it relies on an original scripting language called Cadence, unlike Immutable X, which uses the more widely used Solidity. In addition, inter-chain connectivity could be seen as a reason for exploring alternatives to Flow, given that Immutable X is an Ethereum layer-2 solution that can potentially integrate with other EVM chains.\n\nMentioned in this article"

The game is set to launch in Q2 of 2023.\n\nBaobab Studios is not a Web3 company, but it\u2019s exploring the possibilities of how NFTs can engage users in storytelling experiences.\n\n\u201cWe believe stories transcend mediums,\u201d Baobab Studios CEO and Cofounder Maureen Fan said in a statement.\n\n\u201cBaobab Studios\u2019 mission is to inspire you to dream and bring out your sense of wonder. Make YOU matter. This begins by creating great characters and stories, like Momoguro, where you can be part of the story,\u201d Fan added. \u201cWe aspire to bring the Momoguro IP to as many channels, streaming platforms, and widespread media as possible.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMomoguro\u2019s creators also believe their property\u2019s lore carries an important message.\n\n\u201cCommunity plays a big part in this,\u201d Momoguro\u2019s Cassavecchia said in a statement. \u201cInclusivity is paramount for the franchise, from ethnicities, genders and body-types, Momoguro\u2019s ethos is that everyone is welcomed.\u201d\n\nBaobab currently boasts having Pixar cofounder Ed Catmull and Twitch cofounder Kevin Lin on its board, and has raised over $31 million in total funding from the likes of Disney, Samsung, and Comcast, according to Crunchbase data.\n\nBaobab isn\u2019t the first Hollywood studio to release NFTs or Web3 content. Last fall, Warner Bros. released \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d NFTs which gave buyers a digital copy of the first film. Lionsgate, Netflix, and Paramount have also experimented with NFTs for some of their biggest properties.\n\nThis is the beginning of your journey to discover the Uno universe! \ud83c\udf44\ud83d\udc8e Momoguro introduces a fantastical world where you collect creatures with unique powers. Choose which ones fuse with your Holoself avatar & gain their abilities as you merge together to fight to save Uno. pic.twitter.com/NEimOd5XFe \u2014 Momoguro (@MomoguroNFT) November 28, 2022\n\nThat said, Baobab appears to be more interested in creating a sense of community than just raking in revenue\u2014it\u2019s already hosted Twitter Spaces for Momoguro fans, garnered a substantial Twitter following, and has nearly 50,000 members in its Discord server."

        "content": "Gas Prices Rise as NFTs Make a Resurgence on Ethereum\n\nEthereum network transaction volumes have begun to soar, bringing with them a rise in their relative gas prices. Data from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode indicates that the fees have more than tripled in size since the end of 2022.\n\nOver the past nine months, Ethereum transactions have cost an average of 10-20 gwei. However, due to large transactional volumes, this figure has now grown to 38 gwei. According to Glassnode, \u201cthe incremental nature of the gas demand suggests an early resurgence of network activity may be underway.\u201d\n\nEthereum gas fees normally rise and fall depending on network demand. Therefore, as more users attempt to add a transaction on the next block, the fees/cost will rise.\n\nNFT Trading Activity Has Helped Grow Ethereum Gas Fees\n\nUnlike previous spikes in Ethereum gas fees, the new figures are not the result of new wallets joining the Ethereum ecosystem. Data shows that the number of new addresses generated on the network is still 40% below what it was a year ago. Therefore, indicating that existing traders are the driving force behind the recent surge in transaction volumes.\n\nSpecifically, a new drive from Blur with its various incentives to attract users, as well as Yuga Labs\u2019 launch of a highly engaging and rewarding Dookey Dash game have spurred on collectors. In addition, prominent collections announcing the launch of new projects such as Doodles 2 have played a key role.\n\nGlassnode notes, \u201cThe recent attention surrounding Blur has led to a surge in demand for block space, resulting in increased fees for validators, and more ETH being burnt via EIP1559.\u201d\n\nBlur\u2019s rise to the top is proving controversial, as Julian Holguin, CEO of Doodle, highlights. The competition between the two leading NFT marketplaces has constricted the cash available to many NFT projects that have relied on secondary royalties for revenue.\n\nThat said, NFT transactions on Ethereum have risen by 97% for the past two consecutive months. They are approaching levels last seen during the NFT boom from mid-2021 to mid-2022.\n\nWant more?

        "title": "What Are Liquidity Pools? The Funds That Keep DeFi Running - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe world of finance runs on liquidity. Without available funds, financial systems grind to a halt. DeFi, or decentralized finance\u2014a catch-all term for financial services and products on the blockchain\u2014is no different.\n\nDeFi activities such as lending, borrowing, or token-swapping rely on smart contracts\u2014pieces of self-executing codes. Users of DeFi protocols \"lock\" crypto assets into these contracts, called liquidity pools, so others can use them.\n\nLiquidity pools are an innovation of the crypto industry, with no immediate equivalent in traditional finance. In addition to providing a lifeline to a DeFi protocol\u2019s core activities, liquidity pools also serve as hotbeds for investors with an appetite for high risk and high reward.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHow do liquidity pools work?\n\nLook beyond the technical language and you\u2019ll find that the basic rationale of liquidity pools is intuitive. For any economic activity to happen in DeFi, there needs to be crypto. And that crypto needs to be somehow supplied, which is exactly what liquidity pools are set to do. (That role is fulfilled by order books and market markers on centralized exchanges, but that\u2019s a different story.)\n\nWhen someone sells token A to buy token B on a decentralized exchange, they rely on tokens in the A/B liquidity pool provided by other users. When they buy B tokens, there will now be fewer B tokens in the pool, and the price of B will go up. That\u2019s simple supply/demand economics.\n\nLiquidity pools are smart contracts containing locked crypto tokens that have been supplied by the platform's users. They\u2019re self-executing and don\u2019t need intermediaries to make them work. They are supported by other pieces of code, such as automated market makers (AMMs), which help maintain the balance in liquidity pools through mathematical formulas.\n\nDid you know? Bancor pioneered the underlying concept of AMMs in 2017. And in 2018, Uniswap, now one of the largest decentralized exchanges, popularized the overall concept of liquidity pools.\n\nWhy is low liquidity a problem?\n\nLow liquidity leads to high slippage\u2014a large difference between the expected price of a token trade and the price at which it is actually executed. Low liquidity results in high slippage because token changes in a pool, as a result of a swap or any other activity, causes greater imbalances when there are so few tokens locked up in pools. When the pool is highly liquid, traders won\u2019t experience much slippage.\n\nBut high slippage isn\u2019t the worst possible scenario. If there's not enough liquidity for a given trading pair (say ETH to COMP) on all protocols, then users will be stuck with tokens they can\u2019t sell. This is pretty much what happens with rug pulls, but it can also happen naturally if the market doesn\u2019t provide enough liquidity.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHow much liquidity is there in DeFi?\n\nLiquidity in DeFi is typically expressed in terms of \u201ctotal value locked,\u201d which measures how much crypto is entrusted into protocols. As of March 2023, the TVL in all of DeFi was $50 billion, according to metrics site DeFi Llama.\n\nTVL also helps capture the fast growth of DeFi: In early 2020, Ethereum-based protocols recorded a TVL of only $1 billion.\n\nWhy provide liquidity to a pool?\n\nFor investors, liquidity provision can be lucrative. Protocols incentivize liquidity providers through token rewards.\n\nThis incentive structure has given rise to a crypto investment strategy known as yield farming, where users move assets across different protocols to benefit from yields before they dry up.\n\nMost liquidity pools also provide LP tokens, a sort of receipt, which can later be exchanged for rewards from the pool\u2014proportionate to the liquidity provided. Investors can sometimes stake LP tokens on other protocols to generate even more yields.\n\nBeware of risks, however. Liquidity pools are prone to impermanent loss, a term for when the ratio of tokens in a liquidity pool (for example, 50:50 split of ETH/USDT) becomes uneven due to significant price changes. That could result in losing your invested funds.\n\nWho's using liquidity pools?\n\n\ud83d\udccf 1inch - a decentralized exchange aggregator that works across multiple chains\n\n- a decentralized exchange aggregator that works across multiple chains \ud83d\udcb0 Aave - a decentralized lending platform\n\n- a decentralized lending platform \ud83d\udd04 Uniswap - a decentralized exchange for swapping Ethereum-based tokens\n\nHow can you add liquidity?\n\nBroadly, there are two ways of adding liquidity.\n\nIf you want to add funds directly to a liquidity pool, such as the ETH/USDC liquidity pool on SushiSwap, you will need to have equal amounts of ETH and USDC, which you can swap using any decentralized exchange.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYou generally need an equal pair of tokens because trading, borrowing, and most other DeFi activities are almost always two-sided\u2014you exchange ETH for USDC, you borrow DAI against ETH, and so on. As a result, most protocols require liquidity providers to pledge the equivalent value (50/50) of two crypto assets to available pools so that a balanced pair can be maintained. (Balancer has taken an innovative approach, allowing as many as eight tokens in a liquidity pool.)\n\nBut there\u2019s also a less cumbersome way.\n\nYou can \u201czap\u201d into a liquidity pool\u2014adding liquidity in just one transaction through platforms like Zapper, which invented the concept in 2020. Just go to zapper.fi and connect your wallet. Click \u201cpools\u201d to list the liquidity pools available for zapping in and out. Add liquidity to the pool using whatever asset you have. Zapper will exchange them into equal splits of the relevant pair. That saves a couple of separate transactions!\n\nHowever, Zapper doesn\u2019t list all liquidity pools on DeFi, restricting your options to the biggest ones.\n\nThe future of liquidity pools\n\nLiquidity pools operate in a competitive environment, and attracting liquidity is a tough game when investors constantly chase high yields elsewhere and take the liquidity.\n\nNansen, a blockchain analytics platform, found that 42% of yield farmers who provide liquidity to a pool on the launch day exit the pool within 24 hours. By the third day, 70% will be gone.\n\nTo tackle this problem, known as \u201cmercenary capital,\u201d OlympusDAO has experimented with \u201cprotocol-owned liquidity.\u201d Instead of setting up a liquidity pool, the protocol lets users sell their crypto into its treasury in exchange for its discounted protocol token, OHM. Users could stake OHM for high yields.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut the model has run into a similar problem\u2014investors who just want to cash out the token and leave for other opportunities, diminishing the confidence in the protocol\u2019s sustainability.\n\nUntil DeFi solves the transactional nature of liquidity, there isn't much change on the horizon for liquidity pools."

        "content": "The bear market rolls on with no signs of slowing down. But don\u2019t worry, there are still some gems in the crypto market to be found. Collateral Network (COLT), Ethereum (ETH), and VeChain (VET) are three such gems. With COLT available at $0.01 during phase 1 of the presale, this could be the perfect time to get involved.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nCollateral Network (COLT)\n\nCollateral Network (COLT) is pioneering the crowdlending industry with a platform that uses non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to represent digital assets. These NFTs are used as collateral to secure loans. Finally, borrowers can get the cash they need without having to beg banks for a loan.\n\nBy minting NFTs as collateral, Collateral Network (COLT) allows for fractional lending that expands the loan market. Collateral Network (COLT) also helps to create a more secure, transparent and efficient lending system that bridges traditional and digital economies.\n\nThe arrival of Collateral Network (COLT) means that anyone can become a lender, even if they have a small amount of capital. For borrowers, it means they can access funds quickly and without all the hassle of traditional financial institutions. In fact, they should receive cash within 24 hours of approval.\n\nCOLT is the fuel that drives the Collateral Network (COLT) platform, and Collateral Network (COLT) tokens are available at discounted prices during phase 1 of the presale. With the chance to flip the crowdlending market on its head, now\u2019s the perfect time to get involved, as experts predict a 35x price surge for Collateral Network (COLT) during the presale.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nCreated by Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum (ETH) is a decentralized open-source blockchain platform with smart contract functionality. It acts as the backbone of most crypto projects, hence why it has a market cap of over $140 billion.\n\nDespite losing 75% of its value since its peak in 2021, Ethereum (ETH) remains the go-to blockchain for developers and organizations. The recent launch of Ethereum (ETH) 2.0 should further improve scalability and performance, making it the leading blockchain for the future.\n\nIf Ethereum (ETH) can implement its sharding scaling solution, Plasma, it's expected that more traditional institutions will look to the Ethereum (ETH) platform for their blockchain-based solutions. Purchasing Ethereum (ETH) around the $1000 level could prove wise, especially with analysts predicting that Ethereum (ETH) will hit $10,000 within five years.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nVeChain (VET)\n\nVeChain (VET) is a layer-1 blockchain platform built for enterprise use cases. It is powered by a Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus algorithm and provides advanced smart contract functionality with the VeChainThor blockchain.\n\nVeChain (VET) is already being used by a number of enterprise organizations, including BMW and Walmart China. This is indicative of the VeChain (VET) platform\u2019s ability to provide real-world solutions to businesses in a variety of industries. With its ambitious roadmap and partnership with DNV GL, VeChain (VET) could be one of the top performers when the bear market subsides.\n\nVeChain (VET) is currently priced at $0.016 - 94% down from the all-time high of $0.2782 in April 2021. As such, even a 1000% gain from current prices would not take VeChain (VET) to an all-time high, which translates to this being an excellent time to invest in VeChain (VET).\n\nFind out more about the Collateral Network presale here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.collateralnetwork.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/collateralnwk\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Collateralnwk"

        "title": "What is QuickSwap, and how does it work? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "This allows QuickSwap users to enjoy the security benefit of Uniswap\u2019s audited code while also gaining from the high-speed transactions and near-zero gas fees offered by the Polygon Network.\n\nQuickSwap is a fork of Uniswap since it uses the same liquidity pool model. It has emerged as a quick, affordable and Ethereum-compatible alternative to Uniswap. The difference lies in the fact that QuickSwap is built on Polygon, while UniSwap is on Ethereum.\n\nQUICK (ERC-20 token) is the native cryptocurrency of QuickSwap.It has two use cases: governance and staking. QuickSwap\u2019s governance model grants QUICK tokenholders the power to propose changes to the protocol and cast votes on numerous issues affecting how it functions.\n\nQuickSwap is similar to Uniswap, the originator of AMMs , and provides the same functionality with similar liquidity protocols but a small cosmetic change: It is built on a layer-2 scaling solution (Polygon) unlike Uniswap, which is built on an layer 1, the Ethereum blockchain .\n\nBy supplying a token pair, anyone can launch a new liquidity pool and begin collecting transaction fees from other participants. This makes QuickSwap permissionless; anyone can launch a new pool without requiring permission.\n\nIt functions as an automated DeFi liquidity protocol where users add token pairs to the liquidity pool and earn transaction fees from those who use the pool for swapping tokens. Users can seamlessly exchange any combination of ERC-20 tokens without an order book. As long as there is a liquidity pool for it, users can trade any pair via QuickSwap.\n\nThe QuickSwap DEX uses an automated market maker (AMM) model for users to swap tokens. It was founded by Sameep Singhania in 2020 as a layer-2 DEX on the Polygon network . It fosters the decentralization ethos by ensuring trustless, permissionless and censorship-resistant cryptocurrency trading.\n\nQuickSwap is a layer-2 decentralized application built on the Polygon blockchain allowing users to swap ERC-20 tokens. Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are blockchain-based applications that form the fundamental cornerstones of the growing suite of decentralized finance (DeFi) tools.\n\nHow does QuickSwap work?\n\nQuickSwap uses an AMM model to provide token pools for users to swap, stake and supply liquidity for token assets.\n\nThe following key features of QuickSwap make up its DEX infrastructure:\n\nLiquidity pools\n\nLiquidity pools are a collection of digital assets that enable trading on a DEX. They are a crucial component in DeFi since they supply the much-needed liquidity required for traders to operate on DEXs.\n\nTo create liquidity pools on QuickSwap, users lock their cryptocurrency into the protocol\u2019s smart contracts, enabling others to use the locked assets. Consider it akin to a publicly accessible cryptocurrency reservoir. Those who fund this reservoir \u2014 aka liquidity providers \u2014 receive a portion of the transaction costs for each user interaction in exchange for supplying liquidity.\n\nOn QuickSwap, liquidity providers receive 0.25% of the trade fees proportional to their share of the pool.\n\nAnother interesting feature of QuickSwap is the change from the order book trade method. Traditionally, exchanges used order books for swap trades. Order books are a real-time collection of buy and sell orders where buyers decide the price that they are willing to pay, place their order price, and then wait for their order to be fulfilled. When a seller matches that price, the order is executed.\n\nThis order book method often creates a sub-optimal user experience with sometimes long wait times, low liquidity or lack of order execution, reliance on a third party to help fulfill orders, and higher chances of scams and hacks.\n\nQuickSwap automates this through smart contracts allowing users to swap ERC-20 tokens. When a user wants to exchange one token with another, they send their chosen tokens to the QuickSwap smart contract. The smart contract then calculates the amount of the second token that the user will receive based on the current market price without relying on third-party buy/sell requests for the token being traded. The price determination is done by QuickSwap\u2019s AMM model.\n\nAutomated market maker\n\nThe QuickSwap AMM model determines the asset prices and provides instant liquidity. It essentially democratizes access to liquidity through its algorithmic code. The QuickSwap AMM is like a financial robot or code that can propose a price between two assets. Instead of the traditional order book, it uses the assets in the liquidity pool to determine the price based on the percentage of tokens in the pool at that time.\n\nThis process is programmatic, allowing rapid access to liquidity since the algorithm can always quote a price for a user. With this approach, a transaction can be completed without waiting for the other side to show up. As long as there is sufficient liquidity in the specific pool, trades can be executed.\n\nThe formula for calculating each token\u2019s price is x*y=k, where \u201cx\u201d represents the financial quantity of Token A and \u201cy\u201d represents the financial quantity of Token B, with \u201ck\u201d being a constant value. QuickSwap uses an AMM called constant product market maker where \u201cx\u201d and \u201cy\u201d multiply to create \u201ck,\u201d which cannot change in value.\n\nFor example, Alice wants to trade Dai (DAI) for Ether (ETH) using the QuickSwap DAI-ETH pool. She added her Dai tokens to the pool for ETH. This increases the ratio of Dai in the pool, resulting in a rise in the price of ETH. But why? Because there is now less ETH in the pool after the transaction, and as per QuickSwap\u2019s AMM formula above, the total pool liquidity (k) must remain constant. To maintain \u201ck,\u201d ETH\u2019s price will rise.\n\nThis mechanism is what determines the pricing. So, the more Dai Alice puts in, the less ETH she gets in return because the price of ETH increases. Ultimately, the price paid for this ETH is based on how much a given trade shifts the ratio between the token pool.\n\nToken swapping\n\nWithout the need for a crypto-to-fiat exchange, cryptocurrency swapping enables users to instantaneously exchange one cryptocurrency for another. While saving time and money are clear advantages, they are by no means the only reasons users swap.\n\nSometimes, traders exchange tokens in an effort to profit from a market movement they anticipate. Other times, swaps are occasionally required to pay transaction fees that can only be paid in a particular blockchain\u2019s native coin. As a result, a user of The Sandbox (SAND) may need to make a swap for ETH or Polygon (MATIC) to access the Polygon network.\n\nQuickSwap charges a small transaction fee of 0.3% for every trade that takes place on the platform and near-zero gas fees. The liquidity providers receive payments from the swap-generated fees.\n\nImpermanent loss\n\nImpermanent loss is a possible risk faced by liquidity providers of AMMs like QuickSwap, Uniswap and other such DeFi platforms. Impermanent loss happens when a liquidity provider provides tokens to a liquidity pool, and the price of the deposited token changes compared to when they deposited them.\n\nLiquidity providers are required to place both assets of the trading pair into a liquidity pool. For instance, in an ETH-DAI pool, when trades lower the amount of ETH in the pool and its price rises, the liquidity provider suffers an impermanent loss, as they now hold less ETH since its value went up.\n\nThe loss is called impermanent, as the price of ETH may move back up to the original deposited value, and trading fees received may even outstrip the loss. Therefore, it is not permanent. However, it is a risk to be considered."

But Ethereum developers have been working hard on a solution they hope Feds will stay away from: Privacy Pools.\n\nA demo to be released tomorrow of the new coin mixing app lets people send and receive Ethereum, the second-biggest cryptocurrency, anonymously. Though this time round, there\u2019s a feature that proves the user is not a North Korean bad actor or some other type of criminal.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned Tornado Cash in August because they said criminals\u2014mainly North Korean state-sponsored hackers, Lazarus Group\u2014were using it to launder dirty cash.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Treasury Department\u2019s move, which essentially banned Americans from interacting with the app, was criticized not only by many in the crypto world but also politicians like Rep Tom Emmer. \u201cPrivacy is normal,\u201d he said at the time.\n\nTornado Cash\u2019s team was also targeted: Dutch police arrested the app\u2019s main developer Alexey Pertsev; he is set to remain in jail until an April hearing.\n\nNow, Privacy Pools (which is currently just a demo and has not been audited) aims to pick up where Tornado Cash left off\u2014but in a way that regulators and law enforcement will leave it alone.\n\nI sincerely hope no one thought we were finished pic.twitter.com/YVpSMtjeCd \u2014 ameen.eth (@ameensol) February 26, 2023\n\n\u201cIt is not meant to be a final replacement product\u2014it is meant to start a conversation,\u201d the man behind the new app Ameen Soleimani told Decrypt.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSoleimani is widely credited as an early contributor to Tornado, though he says he did not contribute to the project\u2019s code. Soleimani told Decrypt that he helped steer the project\u2019s direction during its early days, besides contributing to Tornado\u2019s initial funding through the developer\u2019s MolochDAO\n\n\u201cThe hope is that regulators are less interested in sanctioning [Privacy Pools], because it helps them accomplish their goals.\u201d\n\nPrivacy Pools\u2014a fork of Tornado Cash created by Soleimani and one other developer\u2014works by allowing users to show publicly that their withdrawals are not linked to bad actors.\n\nUsers can still make anonymous transactions but there is the option to make it clear that the money being moved is not from something criminal\u2014like a hack. The new app works just like Tornado Cash, but when users click the option to withdraw funds, they can generate a zero-knowledge proof which publicly shows they are not using a criminal blockchain address, but without revealing who they are.\n\nZero-knowledge proofs are used in cryptography to prove that something is known without revealing the known information directly.\n\nOne of the reasons the feds sanctioned the app last year was because hackers used Tornado Cash to launder funds from the massive attack on play-to-earn game Axie Affinity.\n\nA coin mixer allows users to obfuscate the origin and destination of cryptocurrency movements by grouping various transactions together.\n\nAuthorities initially said that over $7 billion in illegal funds passed through Tornado since its creation in 2019\u2014though blockchain data company Elliptic later said in a report that of the $7.6 billion that passed through the app, only $1.5 billion was dirty.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCoin mixers\u2014which are used for a number of reasons\u2014are just one of the things U.S. authorities are now paying attention to since launching a tough crackdown on the crypto world.\n\nA number of U.S. lawmakers claim the fast-moving industry\u2019s coins, tokens and apps are favored by criminals. And most politicians\u2014even those who like crypto\u2014are at the very least calling for clearer regulatory guidelines.\n\nMany in the digital asset space are hoping that with regulation, they can still build and use tools that will protect their privacy.\n\n\u201cThere is no guarantee that they [the authorities] won\u2019t sanction [Privacy Pools],\u201d added Ameen. \u201cWe live in a regulatory-by-enforcement regime.\u201d\n\nEditor's note: This article was updated after publication to clarify that the Privacy Pools demo is set to be released tomorrow, March 4."

        "content": "Bitcoin and other top crypto tokens were trading mixed during the early trading hours in Asia on Thursday, amid the subdued cues across the world. However, market analysts believe that any major shift in the crypto market in the near-future is unlikely.\n\nAlong with it, ongoing inflation and economy related buzz is likely to keep the traders hooked amid the sluggish move. However, stubborn inflation is likely to keep the interest rate elevated for time-being.\n\nBitcoin continued to hover around $23,500-mark as the largest crypto token rose a little more than half-a-per cent. Its largest peer, Ethereum, jumped near $1,650-level after rising 2 per cent in the last 24 hours. However, overall sentiment remained subdued majorly.\n\nPopular crypto tokens were trading mixed during the early Asian hours on Thursday. Ethereum and Litecoin jumped 2 per cent each, whereas Shiba Inu posted similar cuts. BNB and Polkadot dropped a per cent each, whereas XRP and Avalanche gained about a per cent.\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading slightly higher to $1.07 trillion mark, rising about a per cent in the last 24 hours. Similarly, the total trading volumes jumped more than 11 per cent to $48.79 billion.\n\nEthereum has come closer to its highly anticipated Shanghai Upgrade, with a second Ethereum testnet, known as Sepolia, after it successfully replicated withdrawals of staked ether. The Shanghai upgrade will be marking the complete transition to a fully functional PoS (Proof of Stake) network, said Parth Chaturvedi, Crypto Ecosystem Lead, CoinSwitch.\n\nCrypto updates\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia has revealed a set of projects that will develop use cases for a digital dollar, the eAUD, during its testing phase, currently underway.\n\nPolygon said it launched a new Polygon ID product based on Zero-Knowledge (ZK) technology that will allow users to verify their identities or credentials without revealing sensitive information.\n\nCoinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said the exchange decided to suspend trading of Binance USD (BUSD) because the company had concerns about its liquidity.\n\nTech View By WazirX Trade Desk\n\nSynthetix (SNX) is building a decentralised liquidity provisioning protocol that any protocol can tap into for various purposes. Its deep liquidity and low fees serve as a backend for many exciting protocols on both Optimism and Ethereum.\n\nThe current price of SNX token is 2.9USDT. The price chart has broken out of a descending trendline on a weekly time frame, moreover it is trading above 20-week exponential moving average and has recently formed a Pin Candle which indicates the dip has been bought.\n\nIt is up by more than 29 per cent for the day in comparison to BTC which is up by 1.27 per cent in a day. The immediate support could be expected around 1.7USDT and the next resistance is expected around 4.3USDT\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

        "content": "The year 2022 was a rather testing period for the cryptocurrency industry. The scandal surrounding the currency exchange FTX caused governments, consumers, and other stakeholders to question the credibility, transparency, and security of users in the industry. While the start of 2023 appeared to have indicated a remarkable turnaround, cryptocurrency still seems to be fighting old demons.\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market capitalization seemed to have recovered from $797 million when the year started to $1.12 trillion by February. Fresh scrutiny on the crypto industry however, has once again caused a decline in the global crypto market cap dropping to $1.07 trillion. The volatility, while it may seem gloomy to the naked eye, experts suggest that it is the calm before the storm, in the sense that the industry is poised to explode to new heights before the year is out.\n\nWhile Big Eyes Coin (BIG), being the new entry to the industry has shown a positive outlook to become the next big meme coin in the crypto market, how have Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) fared, and what does 2023 hold for these three currencies.\n\nBitcoin: Reeling from $80 Million Wipeout\n\nBitcoin (BTC), the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency has dropped 4.89% in the past week, down to $23,439.35. Bitcoin did post a marginal rise of 0.04% in the last 24 hours after a wipe-out of nearly $80m in leveraged crypto long positions caused a rippled effect across the board.\n\nBitcoin, which posted a 30-day high of $25,134.12, dipped to $22,910.99 over the weekend as investors remained cautious over persistent inflation concerns in the US, which have increased the possibility of the Federal Reserve implementing more aggressive interest rate hikes than previously anticipated.\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin held a market capitalization of $452 billion with a 24-hour trading volume of $22 billion.\n\nEthereum: Bearish Movement Ahead\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second most powerful cryptocurrency in the industry, has been following a similar pattern to that of Bitcoin in terms of price movement. Having posted a 30-day high of $1,732.80, Ethereum\u2019s price has shown a weekly decline of 2.53% on the weekly charts and currently trades at $1,634.67, a 0.73% drop from the day before.\n\nEthereum is currently trading just above the support level at $1,600 but a bearish movement has been established on the daily chart, so be warned. Big Eyes Coin: Packed and Ready to Take on the Next Bull Run\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG) is a new community-owned meme token created on the Ethereum Network to generate wealth and shift that wealth into the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) ecosystem while ensuring 5% of its total token supply is donated to ocean-saving charities.\n\nBig Eyes Coin believes in keeping its community on its toes with new and exciting offers. And in its latest initiative, Big Eyes Coin has launched the Big Eyes Coin Loot Boxes, which are mystery boxes featured in a video game and can be found during gameplay, earned as a reward, or paid for with real money.\n\nThe three loot boxes, Cute Box, Kitty Vault, and Super Saiyan Box will be available only during the presale stage of Big Eyes Coin and the results are always randomized. The Cute Box costs $100 to open with the largest prize of $5000 worth of BIG tokens. The Kitty Vault costs $500 and contains the grand prize of $25,000 worth of BIG tokens. The Super Saiyan Box which costs $1000 to open carries the ultimate prize of $100,000 worth of BIG tokens. The Loot Boxes only guarantee a win because, at the minimum, users will always get their money back and there are a very limited number of loot box drops before they run out.\n\nThe meme token is currently in its Initial Coin Offer (ICO) and in stage 12, Big Eyes Coin has raised $30.62 million in presale tokens and will go live on the market when it reaches its target of $50 million presale tokens.\n\nFind out more about Big Eyes Coin (BIG):\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Ethereum vs Ethereum Classic: Comparison Between ETH And ETC - ClearTax",
        "content": "The Ethereum blockchain came into existence in 2014. However, a massive hack forced the developers to go for a hard fork, resulting in a rollback of its DAO-related transactions. This led to the creation of the Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.\n\nThey are separate from each other and have their features and goals.\n\nHere's a detailed guide on Ethereum's history and the major differences between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.\n\nBackground to Ethereum's creation\n\nIn July 2014, Vitalik Buterin decided to raise funds for Ethereum via a crowd sale. He created the DAO (Decentralised Autonomous Organisation) that allowed probable investors to pitch and discuss ideas and reap the rewards when they got successful. In April 2016, this campaign raised over $150 million, making itself one of the world's largest crowdfunding campaigns.\n\nOne had to buy DAO tokens using Ether to invest in DAO. All was going well, except DAO had a major flaw in its coding. A 'Split Function' allows investors to withdraw their support from a project. Once withdrawn, the investor would get back Ether and have the option to create a 'Child DAO'. Also, the withdrawn funds can be accessed only after 28 days, and the public ledger will be updated by then.\n\nSome users found a loophole in DAO's code. The system refunded the same DAO tokens upon withdrawing their support without registering the transaction on the public ledger. The flaw was that the DAO smart contract returned the Ether before the public ledger got updated. Hackers drained 11.5 million Ether amounting to $50 million at that time.\n\nDue to the 28-day rule, the exploiters failed to get away with the money. To rectify this situation, Ethereum had to undergo a hard fork. Thus it was divided into two different coins. Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.\n\nEthereum aimed to return all the Ether that investors had lost. It has a lot of similarities and a few major differences that set them apart.\n\nEthereum vs Ethereum Classic: Parameters\n\nYou can understand the difference between these blockchains based on the following parameters. They are:\n\n1. Mining process\n\nEthereum Classic uses the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism for mining. In this process, miners use high-powered ASIC computers to find valid hashes to mine a block. The miners themselves act as validators of a block. The miner gets cryptocurrency and other fees as block rewards upon mining the block.\n\nEthereum currently uses Proof-of-Work (PoW) but plans to shift to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. This will make the network faster and more efficient and increase its scalability.\n\n2. Limit\n\nEthereum Classic has a total supply limit of approximately 210.70 million ETC. After mining all the tokens on the network is done, the miners will get transaction fees as rewards.\n\nEthereum, on the other hand, has an unlimited supply. However, the growth rate is limited to 4.5% per year.\n\n3. Immutability\n\nOn the Ethereum Classic network, you cannot change data after it is logged into the system. This system of immutability helps prevent the tampering of data on the blockchain.\n\nEthereum allows you to replace or cancel a pending transaction for a fee. This helps you when the transaction does not enter the block even after a long time has passed since its initiation.\n\n4. Value\n\nIf you consider market cap and individual token value, Ethereum is far ahead of Ethereum Classic. Ethereum's value is also based on the fact that investors trust it as a safe place to invest, and it is also because it offers a wide range of investment opportunities.\n\n5. Smart contracts\n\nEthereum and Ethereum Classic both use smart contracts. The former uses an advanced token called ERC-20 for creating and issuing smart contracts. Many digital currencies follow this standard, like Maker (MKR), Basic Attention Token (BAT), Augur (REP), OMG Network (OMG) and many more. You can use them to operate smart contracts on the Ethereum network.\n\n6. Wallets supported\n\nThe list of crypto wallets that supports Ethereum are:\n\nMetaMask\n\nLedger Nano S\n\nLedger Nano X\n\nRainbow Wallet\n\nTrezor\n\nArgent\n\nGuarda\n\nAtomic Wallet\n\nExodus\n\nMyEtherWallet and many more\n\nKeepKey\n\nJaxx\n\nThe list of crypto wallets that supports Ethereum Classic are:\n\nABRA\n\nAToken\n\nAtomic Wallet\n\nAlpha Wallet\n\nButton Wallet\n\nKobo\n\nCoin Wallet\n\nCoinomi\n\nEdge\n\nEmerald Wallet\n\nOwnbit\n\nTokenview and many more\n\n7. Supported exchange platforms\n\nThe following exchange platforms support Ethereum:\n\nCoinbase\n\nCrypto.com\n\nBinance\n\nShakepay\n\nKraken\n\nKuCoin\n\nBitpanda\n\nHuobi\n\nCoinmama and many more\n\nThe following exchange platforms support Ethereum Classic:\n\neToro\n\nCrypto.com\n\nCoinbase\n\nBinance and many more\n\n8. Decentralised applications\n\nWhen it comes to decentralised applications, Ethereum is the clear winner. It has the largest collection of dApps in the current market.\n\nSome dApps on Ethereum are:\n\nUniswap\n\nMatcha\n\n1inch\n\nAave\n\nCompound\n\nOasis\n\nDark Forest\n\nFoundation\n\nPoolTogether\n\nZapper\n\nRotki and many more\n\nA few dApps Of Ethereum Classic are:\n\nMultichain\n\nETC Swap\n\nNFT List\n\nCoinRabbit\n\nLazy Lions\n\nCelsius Network\n\nCryptwerk\n\nETC-to-wETC and many more\n\nThe future of Ethereum and Ethereum Classic\n\nThere are many similarities between these two blockchains. It is not something uncommon, as Ethereum originated from Ethereum Classic only. However, these two platforms' current scenarios and prospects are very different.\n\nEthereum is a very popular blockchain, and as Ethereum 2.0 is incoming, its popularity has reached new heights. Ethereum Classic, on the other hand, has lost popularity due to various factors. One was the 51% attacks on the network in July and August 2020. It is less likely that investors would like to put their money on Ethereum Classic.\n\nAlso, Ethereum has Layer-2 scaling that allows it to transfer its network load to other blockchains. Polygon is a good example in this regard.\n\nSo, whether you invest in Ethereum or Ethereum Classic, it's best to analyse the current market trends before you hatch your plan. Conducting research from credible sources is also essential.\n\nAlso, understanding the differences between these blockchains will help you make better investment-related decisions."

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is looking forward to the Shanghai upgrade on the Ethereum (ETH) network that would allow investors to withdraw their staked ETH. Ahead of the historical event, concerns have been raised over the possibility of the withdrawn ETH flooding the market, a factor that would likely impact the value of Ethereum.\n\nHowever, a review by crypto analysis platform CryptoQuant on March 1 indicates that based on onchain data, the possibility of Ethereum recording a surge in selling pressure after the upgrade is minimal.\n\nAccording to the platform, the analysis is backed by the fact that 60% of staked ETH, or 10.3 million ETH, remains at a loss, and investors are likely to hold on to the asset until market conditions improve. The staked Ether represents about 13% of the total Ethereum supply. Secondly, the analysis indicates that Lido Dao (LDO), the largest Ethereum staking pool at 30%, is also at a loss, while the staked ETH has an average loss of 24%.\n\n\u201cTypically, selling pressure arises when participants have extreme profits, which is not the case for staked ETH currently. Additionally, the most profitable staked ETH was staked less than a year ago and has not seen significant profit-taking events in the past,\u201d CryptoQuant said.\n\nStaked Ethereum price. Source: CryptoQuant\n\nPreparations for withdrawing staked ETH\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade remains among the highly anticipated Ethereum blockchain events after the Merge upgrade transitioned the network to the proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol. Ahead of the upgrade, investors simulated the withdrawal process after the Zhejiang testnet went live on February 1. Another test for the Shanghai upgrade on the Sepolia testnet also went live at the end of last month.\n\nAs different players continue to look forward to the staking withdrawal, the United States regulators are also increasing their crackdown on the space, a factor likely to influence the value of Ethereum.\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nOverall, the network upgrade has been touted to have a positive implication for the value of Ethereum in the long term. At the moment, Etheruem\u2019s price has been weighed by the overall market downturn. By press time, Ethereum was trading at $1,644 with weekly losses of about 2%.\n\nEhereum seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nBased on the outcome of the upgrade, if investors hold their ETH, it will give the second-ranked crypto by market cap a chance to break the $1,700 resistance and push for $2,000. Alternatively, Ethereum could drop below the $1,500 support level if high selling pressure is realized.\n\nThe decentralized finance (DeFi) asset also controls a market cap of about $200.8 billion.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "As the cryptocurrency market has taken a sharp turn for the worse, along with one of its largest assets by market capitalization \u2013 Ethereum (ETH) \u2013 crypto traders and investors are trying to narrow down the indicators pointing at its potential future movements.\n\nIn this context, the machine learning algorithms at the cryptocurrency tracking platform PricePredictions, which rely on moving averages (MA), moving average convergence divergence (MACD), Bollinger Bands (BB), relative strength index (RSI), and other indicators, suggest that Ethereum would trade at the price of $1,529 by March 31.\n\nEthereum 30-day price prediction. Source: PricePredictions\n\nBased on the above factors, the platform\u2019s algorithms expect the price of Ethereum to decrease by 2.39% by the end of the third month of 2023, in comparison to its price at the time of publication, according to the most recent data accessed by Finbold on March 3.\n\nMeanwhile, the sentiment on the 1-day gauges retrieved from the finance and crypto tracking website TradingView is generally bearish for Ethereum, suggesting \u2018sell\u2019 at 13, as summarized from the oscillators pointing toward \u2018sell\u2019 at 3 and moving averages also in the \u2018sell\u2019 zone at 10.\n\nEthereum 1-day sentiment gauges. Source: TradingView\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nLike the rest of the crypto market, Ethereum is currently facing strong selling pressure under the influence of multiple unfavorable developments, which have brought its price down to $1,566 at press time, as it declined 4.56% on the day, adding to the accumulated losses of 5.18% in the past week and 1.28% on its monthly chart.\n\nEthereum 7-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nWhether Ethereum manages to hold above the $1,500 support level or even breach the resistance at $1,700, will largely depend on further developments around the ecosystem itself, such as the Shanghai upgrade that will allow investors to withdraw their staked ETH.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "title": "Nasty surprise today for the price of Bitcoin and Ethereum - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "Today the day started with a nasty surprise for Bitcoin and Ethereum holders, with the price dropping more than 4%.\n\nIt all started yesterday, when after the US stock exchanges opened, news began to spread that crypto bank Silvergate was losing half of its market value in a single session.\n\nThe fact is that Silvergate was a supplier to many exchanges, primarily including Coinbase, and this put some fear into investors. Indeed, for example the same Coinbase stock on the exchange had opened with -11% in the first hour of trading alone.\n\nHowever, over the course of the day many exchanges, including Coinbase itself, distanced themselves from Silvergate, so much so that the problem seemed to be winding down, with the stock of the US-based exchange eventually closing with an unceremonious -1.5%.\n\nIndeed, up to that point Bitcoin and Ethereum prices had not reacted badly, with BTC at $23,400 and ETH at $1,640.\n\nThe statements of the SEC chairman bring down the price of Bitcoin and Ethereum today\n\nShortly after the US markets closed their daily session, news came out that SEC Chairman Gary Gensler had stated that crypto exchanges cannot be considered qualified custodians, in other words, secure.\n\nGensler was referring to all crypto exchanges, but particularly those that claim to be secure, such as major exchanges.\n\nHe wrote:\n\n\u201cMake no mistake, again: Based upon how crypto trading and lending platforms generally operate, investment advisers cannot rely on them today as qualified custodians. To be clear: just because a crypto trading platform claims to be a qualified custodian doesn\u2019t mean that it is. When these platforms fail\u2014something we\u2019ve seen time and again\u2014investors\u2019 assets often have become property of the failed company, leaving investors in line at the bankruptcy court.\u201d\n\nThese statements are indeed the reality of the current state of the crypto markets, and written by the SEC Chairman they carry their weight.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that the price of Bitcoin and Ethereum did not start falling as soon as this news was released, but about two hours later.\n\nThe cause of today\u2019s descent by the price of Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nThe fact that yesterday\u2019s descent of the price of Bitcoin and Ethereum happened practically within a quarter of an hour would suggest that some single event happened shortly before, and that it triggered sudden and massive selling.\n\nThe only event that would seem to have triggered the sales is the news of Gensler\u2019s statements, but the timing does not match.\n\nIt is therefore possible that the general trend was simply downward, but that some event was required to trigger some fear by convincing speculators to sell.\n\nAnd so within about 15 minutes, the price of Bitcoin fell from $23,400 to $22,400, and then even fell below $22,000 in the following half hour, but for very few minutes.\n\nEthereum\u2019s price in the same period fell from $1,640 to $1,560, before making a very quick hike to $1,540 and later returning again to around $1,560.\n\nIt is worth noting that in the next eleven hours virtually nothing more happened, in the sense that the two prices began to lateralize around $22,400 and $1,560, respectively.\n\nIt is as if they were waiting for nothing more than to fall to these levels, and they did so suddenly two hours after Gensler\u2019s statements were published.\n\nNot least because, to be fair, what the SEC chairman is calling for could be good, not bad, for the crypto markets, particularly for the very investors who may have panicked and sold out yesterday.\n\nGensler, referring to a new regulatory proposal for crypto markets, wrote that the new safeguard rule would expand the safeguards of the custody rule to cover all assets and would make important improvements to the protections provided by qualified custodians.\n\nIn other words, he called for greater protection for investors and speculators against, for example, fraudulent, or unsafe exchanges that can fail at any moment causing them huge potential losses.\n\nThe current cycle\n\nOver the medium term there seems to be a real cycle underway for the price of Bitcoin, which is also shared by the price of Ethereum.\n\nAt the beginning of the year there was an initial rise, from $17,000 to $21,000.\n\nStarting on 21 January there were four unsuccessful attempts to bring itself firmly back above $24,000, followed by ten days of lateralization below $23,000.\n\nAfter returning above $24,000 in mid-February, Bitcoin\u2019s price then failed four times to break above $25,000.\n\nStarting on 22 February, it began a phase of apparent lateralization below $24,000 that resembles that of early February.\n\nShould this phase end like the previous one, it is possible to imagine that after about a week below $23,000 the price of Bitcoin could return to try to attack $25,000."

But what makes them unique? To understand how it works and stands out among other Layer 2 technologies, it\u2019s important to know the structure of ZK-Rollups, which is based on Ethereum as a base layer for settlement.\n\nA typical ZK-rollup consists of two main components, both on-chain: the \u201cmain\u201d contract, responsible for storing rollup blocks, monitoring blockchain state, and tracking fund deposits/withdrawals; and a verifier contract that authenticates and confirms zero-knowledge proofs before they can be submitted to the base layer. Additionally, an off-chain virtual machine serves as the second layer for processing batches of transactions efficiently \u2013 making high throughput and scalability possible.\n\nFurthermore, a layer 2 operator and supernode handle transaction execution and batching \u2013 with some projects using only one operator while others use proof-of-stake validators who take on this duty in rotation. Finally, Ethereum provides security by enforcing correctness updates in each block while also verifying every transaction.\n\nOverall, understanding these core concepts can help further appreciate the power of ZK Rollup projects \u2013 boosting scalability without sacrificing privacy or security.\n\n\u2696\ufe0f ZK-Rollups vs. Other Layer 2 Scaling Solutions: How They Compare\n\n\ud83d\udc49 ZK-Rollups vs. Other Layer 2 Scaling Solutions\n\nLayer 2 scaling solutions like rollup protocols serve specific use cases within the blockchain ecosystem, but they all operate similarly.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 ZK-Rollups vs. Optimistic Rollups\n\nWhen it comes to Layer 2 Scaling Solutions, ZK-Rollups and Optimistic Rollups both offer scalability improvements at the cost of some security guarantees. While they may operate in similar ways, there are also critical differences between them.\n\nZK-Rollups validate transactions with complex cryptographic validity proofs that are posted to the Ethereum mainnet \u2013 this leads to longer confirmation times, but higher security guarantees. On the other hand, Optimistic Rollups trust all transactions as valid, thereby speeding up transaction speeds while sacrificing some security. The tradeoff here is that during a challenge period anyone can question the validity of any transaction \u2013 if something seems fishy a fraud proof will be used in order to determine if fraudulent activity has taken place.\n\nWhile ZK-Rollup\u2019s confirmation times may be far longer due to its verification methods, Optimistic Rollup\u2019s have challenge periods that can cause more delays than offered by regular ZK-Rollups. These challenges guarantee extra security since Sequencers who submit fraudulent data have their ETH stake slashed as punishment. Moreover, Optimistic Rollups provide Smart Contract capabilities impossible with ZK-Rollups \u2013 making them essential for dApp developers looking for absolute flexibility in Layer 2 scaling solutions.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 ZK-Rollups vs. Sidechains\n\nZK-Rollups and sidechains have some similarities but also distinct differences. ZK-Rollups utilize Ethereum mainnet security, making them more expensive than sidechains which don\u2019t need to validate the data they are receiving from the mainchain.\n\nIn terms of storing transaction data, Rollups batch transactions on layer two of the blockchain and then submit them to the mainchain. Meanwhile, Sidechains are their own separate entity which create entirely different chains and only submit deposits and withdrawals to the mainchain.\n\nThere are some security risks involved with sidechains as they rely on a set of operators that control bridge contracts, while ZK-Rollups rely solely on Ethereum\u2019s network security. In addition, any Sidechain could experience a 51% attack or its operators could limit withdrawals, making it less secure than an Ethereum-based ZK-Rollup.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 ZK-Rollups vs. Plasma Chains\n\nThe debate between ZK-Rollups and Plasma Chains can easily be summarized: both are Layer 2 scaling solutions for Ethereum. But there are some key differences between the two that make them better suited for different use cases.\n\nPlasma chains rely on a sidechain that is regularly committed to the mainnet with Merkle roots. Meanwhile, ZK-Rollups group hundreds of transfers into one transaction which is then verified via a zero-knowledge proof on the main chain. While both reduce transaction costs when compared to using Ethereum alone, ZK-Rollups require fewer resources and, as such, are better suited for most use cases when considering user friendliness.\n\nIn terms of security, both plasma chains and rollups utilize fraud proofs to ensure their safety. However, in plasma chains it\u2019s necessary to hold governance token holders votes if data unavailability errors occur in order to determine whether the ledger is correct and if the operator is trustworthy \u2014 this differs from rollups which assume a trusted state. Additionally, with either solution you can withdraw funds even if the exchange running it is down due to these fraud proofs on the public ledger.\n\nUltimately, plasma chains and ZK-Rollups both have advantages and disadvantages depending on your particular use case. It\u2019s important to do your research before deciding which route is best for you!\n\n\ud83d\udc49 ZK-Rollups vs. State Channels\n\nAs blockchain technologies advance, there is growing interest in scaling solutions like ZK-Rollups and State Channels. These two technologies are quite different, with unique advantages and disadvantages.\n\nIn a State Channel, two or more parties can transact off the Ethereum blockchain in a secure manner, without recourse to the mainchain. They do this by exchanging state updates between each other. When any of these parties decide to stop using the channel, an \u201cexit\u201d must be initiated in order for their final balances to be transferred from the mainchain. To avoid long wait times for withdrawal to the mainchain, they can also sign a \u2018finalization proof\u2019 which allows them to exit without waiting for a challenge period.\n\nZK-Rollups differ in that they require a rollup operator who processes all transactions in order for them to be finalized on the Ethereum blockchain. Finality is also slower than with State Channels; while these channels offer immediate finality where transfers of values are instant, ZK-Rollups take some time before transactions settle and become final on the mainchain.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s clear that State Channels have certain advantages over ZK-Rollups like privacy and faster transaction speeds\u2013but it\u2019s not a one-size-fits all solution; each technology has its own pros and cons depending on your individual needs.\n\n\ud83d\udcaa Benefits and Limitations of ZK-Rollups: Weighing the Pros and Cons\n\nWhen evaluating the potential of ZK-rollup projects, it\u2019s important to weigh their benefits and limitations in equal measure. On one hand, ZK-Rollups provide trustless cryptographic setups that eliminate reliance on honest validators, allowing for greater security. Similarly, validity proofs authenticate users\u2019 off-chain transactions and prevent operators from making changes to Ethereum\u2019s state. Plus, ZK-rollups expedite transaction finality periods since they need fewer confirmations than optimistic rollups.\n\nHowever, there are some drawbacks associated with ZK-rollups too. Despite their data compression techniques that reduce the cost of publishing data on-chain, they require significant capital investment to maintain their trustlessness and are therefore not ideal for smaller users. Additionally, since they do not depend on liveness assumptions like chains or sidechains do, it can be difficult to incentivize miners or validators as there is no major reward at stake as such.\n\nUltimately, you will have to decide what weight each benefit or limitation carries based on your own individual use case \u2013 but one thing is certain: if used correctly and efficiently enough,ZK-Rollups offer an upgraded layer of scalability compared to other Layer 1 mechanisms!\n\n\u274c Drawbacks\n\nThe potential benefits and limitations of ZK-Rollups need to be carefully weighed when deciding to use them in a project. ZK-Rollups make use of zero-knowledge proof systems, which can provide a great deal of security but may require trusted setups that can compromise the rollup\u2019s safety if mishandled.\n\nAdditionally, centralized structures such as the single operator or supernode sequencer employed by some ZK-Rollups can directly influence transaction order and potentially cause censorship. Furthermore, since specialized hardware is needed to complete the computational work associated with the proof system, high entry barriers reduce the position of participants profiting from participating in the network and leave it open to attacks from malicious operators as well as censorship.\n\nFinally, constructing zero-knowledge rollups compatible with Ethereum Virtual Machines (zkEVMs) is both costly and complex, making contracts a recent addition to the rollup framework.\n\nOverall, decisions about employing ZK-Rollups must take into account both the potential benefits, such as increased security and convenience for users, as well as the limitations presented by their hardware requirements, cost and complexity.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe bottom line is that ZK-Rollups offer a great solution for Ethereum\u2019s scalability challenges. With its innovative zero-knowledge-proof technology, ZK-Rollups can offer significant advantages in terms of transactions per second, gas fees, security, and privacy, as well as scalability.\n\nPlus, the technology behind ZK-Rollups is still fairly new and there are likely to be more technological advances in this field in the near future. For those looking for an efficient and secure way to scale their projects on the Ethereum network, ZK-Rollups are definitely worth a look."

Lido, for example, one of Rocket Pool's biggest competitors, is not permissionless, and it doesn't allow anyone to set up a node for staking The Oracle Dao, the entity that acts as a watchtower for the Rocket Pool ecosystem, consists of known members from the cryptocurrency community Decentralized - The Rocket Pool protocol is community-owned and focuses on decentralization, with important decisions taken through fair voting\n\nWhat is Rocket Pool?\n\nRocket Pool is a decentralized Ethereum 2.0 staking protocol that aims to make staking ETH 2.0 accessible to a large public by reducing the financial and hardware requirements for classically staking the cryptocurrency.\n\nOn other staking pools, to become a validator on the Ethereum network and start earning staking rewards, users are required to stake at least 32 ETH and need a good CPU (Intel i5-760 or above). This is where the community-owned Rocket Pool staking protocol becomes useful, as it allows users to stake ETH 2.0 in a trustless manner with lower requirements.\n\nRocket Pool was founded in 2016 by David Rugendyke, a senior developer with 18+ years of experience in the commercial field. Nowadays, it is one of the most popular platforms of its kind, with its Oracle DAO consisting of members that are big players in the ETH 2.0 staking sector, such as Lighthouse, Bankless, Blockchain Capital, Staked, Consensys, Nimbus, Codefi, and others.\n\nThe Oracle DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) consists of node operators in Rocket Pool that run oracle nodes. Aside from validating transactions on the Ethereum network like regular nodes, oracle nodes have extra oracle duties, such as validating oracle data sent to the protocol and reporting Beacon chain validator balances.\n\nRocket Pool\u2019s future developments and treasury are done via a different DAO called Protocol DAO, running on RPL, the governance token for the protocol. That means that RPL token holders get to decide the future path for the platform through voting, a key part of decentralization.\n\nWith an increased demand for ETH 2.0 staking services from the cryptocurrency community, Rocket Pool has become one of the largest ETH 2.0 staking pools, with over 323,840 staked ETH and over 1800 node operators around the world.\n\nHow does Rocket Pool work?\n\nRocket Pool allows users to stake ETH and earn staking rewards by either becoming a node operator, which requires a deposit of 16 ETH, or by using rETH, its liquidity token, with a minimum of 0.01 ETH required. Node operators are also required to deposit the equivalent amount of a minimum of 1.6 ETH in RPL tokens as collateral in case a penalty occurs and their staked balance goes below 16 ETH (insurance).\n\nGiven that a minimum of 32 ETH is required to stake Ethereum as a node operator and you only need 16 ETH on Rocket Pool, the other 16 ETH is allocated by the protocol from deposits made by normal stakers, who receive rETH for their ETH.\n\nNotably, the 16 extra ETH tokens assigned by the protocol will also generate commission rewards, so as a node operator you will also be paid for staking the network\u2019s ETH. Rocket Pool\u2019s commission rate is based on the supply and demand of ether on the platform, going up or down depending on how many node operators are available.\n\nWhat is a Rocket Pool node?\n\nA Rocket Pool node represents a computer that holds an Ethereum wallet and is registered in its smart contracts. With Ethereum Proof Of Stake technology (PoS), validators are required to maintain consistency and security of the Beacon Chain. Each validator receives randomized-scheduled computational calculations that verify if a proposed block contains valid transactions.\n\nA validator is an ETH address with a minimum of 32 ETH staked, or deposited to the execution layer and locked for some time. For securing the network and proposing new blocks, validators will receive what is known as \u201cstaking rewards\u201d. Rocket Pool creates validators for the Ethereum network by using \u201cminipools\u201d, which are smart contracts that merge the 16 ETH deposited by a user who wants to become a node operator with another 16 ETH assigned by the protocol.\n\nFor those who wish to set up a smart node Rocket Pool provides a globally available CLI Package with all the necessary documentation. The install package contains the Ethereum Mainnet client (Geth), the Beacon Chain client, and the Rocket Pool client. Some of the useful features of the Rocket Pool service include automatic restart after an application crash or auto-start when the server is restarted.\n\nHow to stake ETH with Rocket Pool?\n\nTo start staking ether (ETH) using Rocket Pool, visit its official staking page, connect your Metamask or other wallets to the protocol, and choose one of the two staking options, stake + run node, or stake ETH. After selecting the amount of ETH you want to stake, make sure to check all the details such as exchange rate, average return, APR, or transaction cost, then click the stake button and confirm the transaction in your wallet.\n\nRPL and rETH tokens\n\nThe Rocket Pool protocol uses two tokens, namely RPL (its governance, insurance, and utility token), and rETH, a liquid staking token pegged to ether which represents the ETH amount staked plus the rewards earned by staking.\n\nRPL can be traded on major cryptocurrency exchanges, both decentralized (Uniswap V3) and centralized (Kraken, BKEX, CoinW). rETH is available on Balancer V2, Uniswap V3, or Curve Finance, and can be exchanged back to native ETH at any time or used for Defi activities such as lending.\n\nWhat can you do with rETH?\n\nrETH is an ERC-20 token that works similarly to Wrapped Ethereum and can be used like any other ERC-20 token. You can lend it, use it as collateral, or trade it. You can also change rETH back to ETH by burning it, however that operation is only possible if the pool has enough native ETH available at that moment, which means in some cases you may have to wait until ETH becomes available.\n\nTokenomics of RPL token\n\nThe RPL token is used as the governance token for the Rocket Pool protocol, which can also be staked on a node as insurance, to earn extra rewards. When setting up an operator node, aside from 16 ETH required, the equivalent of 10% of that ETH in RPL tokens is also required.\n\nTo maximize your rewards, you can stake up to 150% of your staked ETH in RPL. Insurance makes sure the amount in your staked balance doesn\u2019t go below 16 ETH in case of a penalty that may occur if your node goes offline.\n\nAt the time of writing, RPL trades at $20.2, with a circulating supply of 10,279,742 RPL out of a total of 17,922,515. The daily trading volume of RPL is over $1M. The main purpose of the RPL token is to provide staking rewards for participants of the staking pool. Rewards are sent to node operators on the network according to their staking amount, at checkpoint intervals of 28 days. The reward rate is 5% inflation per year, of which 70% is distributed to node operators.\n\nDo you know how to report staking rewards on your tax returns? Click here to learn more.\n\nHow do I claim my Rocket Pool rewards?\n\nRocket Pool rewards or RPL tokens are minted in intervals of 28 days. You don\u2019t need to claim your rewards at a specific date, rather they will accumulate in your balance and can be staked for extra rewards or claimed at any given time. RPL tokens are automatically sent to your ETH address and can be swapped, used as collateral, or traded for other cryptocurrencies.\n\nAs a normal ETH 2.0 staker who doesn\u2019t run a node, your rETH balance will reflect the rewards earned for staking your ETH. You can unstake or convert your accumulated rETH to native ETH after a waiting period of 24 hours, for security reasons.\n\nWhich would you choose to stake your ETH Rocket Pool or lido and why?\n\nRocket Pool is a better alternative because unlike Lido, it is permissionless, meaning that anyone can become a node operator or validator. The permissionless nature of the protocol makes Rocket Pool stand out from the crowd, as it is based on the principle of decentralization.\n\nIs Rocket Pool secure?\n\nYes. Rocket Pool has been online for a long time and has a good reputation in terms of security, as its smart contracts have been audited by leading security companies such as Sigma Prime, Trail of Bits, Consensys Diligence, and Immunefi.\n\nCan you withdraw from Rocket Pool?\n\nNo. Although there are ways to claim your ETH staking rewards as explained above, withdrawals will be available on Rocket Pool as soon as ETH 2.0 enables withdrawals, which is supposed to happen six months after the Ethereum \u201cMerge\u201d.\n\nFAQs\n\nIs Rocketpool decentralized\u2753 Yes, the Rocket Pool is a community-owned decentralized ETH 2.0 staking protocol that manages operations through its Oracle Dao and Protocol Dao and RPL, its governance token. It is based on ETH 2.0 PoS (Proof of Stake) technology, which was designed to be permissionless, trustless, and decentralized. Can you Unstake from Rocket Pool\u2753 Yes. You can unstake your ETH from your Rocket Pool dashboard after a 24 hours waiting period from your deposit. The ETH claiming process will burn your rETH tokens for native ETH tokens. The unstaking feature is available via the platform\u2019s dashboard for both node operators and regular stakers at any given time. Does Ledger support Rocket Pool\u2753 Yes, the Ledger Live app supports staking ETH 2.0 using the Rocket Pool protocol. Is Rocket Pool a non-custodial protocol\u2753 Yes. When you use Rocket Pool, it does not have access to your private keys, which are kept safe on your device by your Metamask or another wallet. Can you stake less than 32 ETH\u2753 Yes. As a node operator on Rocket Pool, you can stake a minimum of 16 ETH + 1.6 ETH in RPL tokens (10% for insurance). Regular stakers can stake a minimum of 0.01 ETH. Is staking on Rocketpool a taxable event\u2753 Yes. Earning rewards from regular or liquid staking is usually considered a taxable event and should be treated accordingly by reporting your earnings to the IRS. How much interest can you earn with staking ether\u2753 You can earn an average of 4% to 10% APY (annual percentage yield) by staking ETH 2.0 Can you stake RPL\u2753 Yes. You can stake RPL tokens as collateral on your node and earn extra rewards. However, the maximum RPL tokens amount you can stake is 150% of your staked ETH.\n\n8.5 Total Score Rocketpool PROS Rocket Pool makes staking ETH accessible to the large public by lowering the minimum amount needed to start staking to 0.01 ETH\n\nPermissionless - the staking platform uses a permissionless smart contract that allows anyone to become a node operator, from regular users to SaaS (Software as a service) providers. Lido, for example, one of Rocket Pool's biggest competitors, is not permissionless, and it doesn't allow anyone to set up a node for staking\n\nThe Oracle Dao, the entity that acts as a watchtower for the Rocket Pool ecosystem, consists of known members from the cryptocurrency community\n\nDecentralized - The Rocket Pool protocol is community-owned and focuses on decentralization, with important decisions taken through fair voting CONS Rocket Pool doesn't currently have a mobile app that you can use for staking ETH 2.0\n\nNo backstop mechanism - Due to how the ecosystem uses the RPL token, it might be prone to node slashing, since security bonding exists but isn't mandatory. When not enough RPL is staked as insurance, node slashing can lead to insolvency, putting the entire system at risk"
