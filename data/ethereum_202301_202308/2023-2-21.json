        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) Supply In Deflation, As Circulation Has Decreased Every Day So Far In 2023\n\nEthereum Ether (ETH) cryptocurrency, and the burning of the crypto asset with each mined block, has led to a reduction in supply in every day in 2023 today date\u201452 days total.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain, which supports smart contracts and is now the world\u2019s largest blockchain in terms of the scale to connected ecosystem of decentralized applications, is powered by the Ether token. By market capitalization, Ether is the second-largest cryptocurrency.\n\nAccording to data derived from the website ultrasound.money, circulation has decreased by almost 31,500 ETH since The Merge, which occurred in September 2022. This effectively shifted the network\u2019s move to the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus from its current proof-of-work. The concept of staking was introduced via the new Ethereum consensus engine, The Beacon Chain, a PoS chain released in 2020 that coexists with the Ethereum Mainnet, which is still a proof-of-work network.\n\nHad The Merge not occurred, the amount of ETH in circulation would have actually increased by approximately 1.8 million\u2014over and above the current supply 120,489,978 ETH units.\n\nIn addition to having reduced its issuance, Ethereum benefits from EIP-1559, which determines that the base rate of commissions in each block of the network is burned. Since its implementation in August 2021, a total of 2,928,514 ethers have been burned, with an average of 3.6 ETH per minute.\n\nThis network activity is a key point to reach deflation. The more transactions there are on Ethereum, the more ETH will be burned.\n\nReduced Supply Intended To Prop-Up ETH Value\n\nOne of the main purposes for developers who came up with The Merge is for ether to become a deflationary, rather than inflationary, asset. The idea is to withdraw the amount of ethers in circulation to promote and increase in value of the cryptocurrency. This is opposite in the way that modern fiat currency systems work.\n\nThis also differs from the monetary policy of Bitcoin (BTC) , the only cryptocurrency above ETH in terms of market capitalization. Bitcoin has a rising supply of BTC being mined, although at some point in the future mined supply will reach zero.\n\nKeep in mind, the rate of issuance since its genesis in 2015 has been greater than that of Bitcoin, reflected in its circulating volume of 120 million ETH. This is approximately 578% more than the 19 million BTC that have already been mined."

        "content": "Ether (ETH) fell short of a bullish breakout based on technical and on-chain analysis, suggesting that the consolidation below the $2,000 price level could continue in the medium term. At the same time, a lack of sellers and strong fundamentals will likely protect Ether from steep declines.\n\nEther encounters resistance at long-term bullish reversal points\n\nETH/USD has increased by 42.80% since the start of 2023 thanks to a short squeeze in the altcoin market, negative investor sentiment and low liquidity conditions. Based on on-chain and technical levels, the rally has paused at a crucial bull-bear pivot.\n\nGlassnode\u2019s Relative Unrealized Loss metric measures the loss scale on Ether holders\u2019 books. The orange line represents the bull-bear pivot line, where consolidation above this level signifies bear trends and vice versa. Usually, the market begins bullish trends after a breakout from previous all-time highs or consolidation over long periods, signified by a steep decline in the Unrealized Loss metric.\n\nEthereum unrealized loss metric. Source: glassnode\n\nSimilarly, from a technical perspective, Ether bulls failed to overcome the resistance at 0.082 Bitcoin (BTC), bringing the price back to the parallel trading range between 0.053 BTC and 0.082 BTC.\n\nETH/BTC weekly price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nWill this time be different?\n\nBased on historic levels, Ether missed the previous bottom levels by a huge margin; the minimum percentage of supply in profit extended to 42.1% compared to the 20%\u201330% tapped during previous bear markets. It suggests the likelihood of more pain ahead for ETH holders. However, on-chain trends show robust activity and buying, reducing the downside risk significantly.\n\nEthereum\u2019s percentage supply in profit. Source: glassnode\n\nThe net position change of Ether on exchanges shows a stark difference between the current and previous bear markets. Between 2018 and 2020, Ether inflows to exchanges were significantly higher than outflows, indicating that many holders moved their coins to exchanges to sell. However, during the negative period of 2022, although the price dropped, exchange outflows remained strong, suggesting that the selling pressure is weaker in the current bear market.\n\nETH net exchange position change. Source: glassnode\n\nThe percentage supply of Ether locked in smart contracts tells a similar story, with no significant declines in Ether locked in smart contracts. The uptrend that began in late 2020 held strong through the downturns of 2022, suggesting that withdrawals are unlikely anytime soon.\n\nThe percentage supply of ETH locked in smart contracts. Source: glassnode\n\nEther has a lot going on as the network continues to evolve to support sustainable usage and yields for Ether holders. Ethereum\u2019s shift from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake in September 2022 was a momentous event for the network, as it became environmentally friendly and, more importantly, reduced inflation.\n\nMoreover, the Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1559 proposal implemented earlier in 2022 introduced burning of Etherum fees, which, combined with reduced issuance after the Merge, contributed to making the asset deflationary. The total Ether supply is down around 0.015% since the Merge.\n\nHowever, CoinShares\u2019 data of institutional flow into digital asset investment products shows that more sophisticated investors have yet to warm up to Ether, sticking primarily to Bitcoin. The year-to-date investment in Ether in 2023 has been only $8 million, compared to $158 million in Bitcoin and $23 million in Bitcoin shorts.\n\nInstitutional flows into digital asset investment products. Source: CoinShares\n\nRegulatory clarity and Ethereum\u2019s scalability challenges are likely the key reasons behind reluctance among institutional investors. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission recently fined Kraken $30 million for offering ETH staking, which the regulatory body deemed as being a security.\n\nAs centralized service providers like Kraken and possibly Coinbase are prohibited from offering these services, institutions may be reluctant to try decentralized liquid staking platforms, such as Lido and Rocket Pool.\n\nThe exuberant gas fees on Ethereum remains a prolonged challenge that is limiting mass adoption. The average transfer fee for ERC-20 assets on Ethereum ranges between $2 and $5, with simple swaps costing around $5\u2013$20.\n\nThese charges are considerably high compared to other chains and centralized exchange fees. While development has happened across the layer-2 space, the institutions appear to be in a \u201cwait and see\u201d mode as they analyze the development of the crypto space.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The Ottomans also confiscated his family\u2019s heirloom rugs and other personal belongings.\n\nAs such, Ohanian has become a huge supporter of assets that centralized institutions can not seize:\n\n\u201cAny group of people who have in their consciousness, or in their collective history, some idea of persecution, especially by a state, makes the idea of a store of value that is not controlled by any single state very attractive. And so, in some ways, it was hardwired in me then and made me, in a way, receptive to the idea of a decentralized currency.\u201d\n\nOhanian understood that a blockchain protocol called Ethereum was about to be launched almost a decade ago and invested $15,000 in its native token \u2013 ETH. This means he bought the cryptocurrency for roughly $0.30 per token.\n\nHis investment is now worth approximately $82 million, a staggering 546,000% return. However, Ohanian wished he could have bought more at the time:\n\n\u201cIn hindsight, I didn\u2019t invest nearly as much as I should have.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed in 2021 that he has \u201ca lot\u201d of Ethereum without providing further details.\n\nHis Other Crypto Forays\n\nApart from co-creating Reddit, Ohanian has founded another entity \u2013 the venture capital firm Seven Seven Six. It raised $500 million at the beginning of 2022 to invest in cryptocurrency start-ups and doubled down with another $177 million fundraiser several months later.\n\nOhanian is also a proponent of non-fungible tokens. He purchased an NFT from the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) collection last summer and gifted it to his wife \u2013 the tennis superstar Serena Williams."

        "content": "NFT marketplaces typically have restrictions on which cryptocurrencies can be used to purchase assets\u2014but Uniswap\u2019s NFT marketplace has just launched a new feature that changes all that.\n\nUniswap NFT traders can now use any token on the Ethereum blockchain, such as stablecoins like USDC or Tether, or even a meme coin like Shiba Inu, to purchase their NFTs through a simplified interface.\n\nHow does it work? According to the crypto startup, Uniswap\u2019s new Universal Router contract \u201cfinds the most cost-efficient route\u201d to complete a swap from any Ethereum-based token into the required token for the NFT sales (in most cases, Ethereum) and then pushes that crypto to OpenSea\u2019s Seaport protocol to finalize the transaction.\n\nUnder the hood, Uniswap is dramatically simplifying the NFT purchasing process for those who might need to swap one cryptocurrency for another before buying an NFT.\n\nThe firm also said it plans to support combined sums of multiple different cryptocurrencies for a single NFT sale soon as well, meaning that if an NFT costs 1 ETH, a trader could buy it with a combination of USDC and Tether, or DAI and SHIB, or Uniswap\u2019s native token UNI and Chainlink, for instance.\n\nWhat does this mean for NFT traders? The new tool is meant for existing Uniswap traders who swap high volumes of tokens already on the platform. It could also help users juggling liquidity to lock in sales they want faster without having to manually swap the tokens first themselves. And for those concerned about the tax implications of NFT trading, one fewer transaction before making an NFT purchase also means one fewer taxable event.\n\nSince Uniswap acquired NFT aggregator Genie last year and launched its NFT marketplace feature on its platform in November, it\u2019s seen less than 10,000 total transactions and roughly $7.6 million in total volume traded. It has about 16,600 total sellers and 5,400 total buyers, per a dashboard from Dune Analytics Data Scientist MarcoV.\n\nStory continues\n\nConsidering the fact that its broader DeFi platform has nearly 4.8 million total users, according to a Dune Analytics dashboard, Uniswap hasn\u2019t exactly been able to bring its legacy users en masse to its new NFT product just yet.\n\nUniswap\u2019s latest advancements on its NFT platform may improve its user experience, but it\u2019s unclear whether it will be enough to drive traffic away from rivals like the Paradigm-backed Blur, which offers token incentives and airdrops for high-volume traders.\n\nBlur Overtakes OpenSea as Ethereum NFT Trading Skyrockets\n\nAt time of writing, Blur activity makes up 80.6% of NFT market share by volume in the past week, while OpenSea takes about 14.5%. Uniswap\u2019s NFT platform is still a small blip on the graphs. It doesn\u2019t yet even make it into the top 10 NFT marketplaces by total trader count, according to a Dune Analytics dashboard.\n\nWhen asked for comment on Blur and OpenSea\u2019s market dominance, Uniswap Labs told Decrypt via email that its products are \u201cbuilt to last.\u201d\n\n\u201cNFTs bring new users to crypto and self-custody. That continues to be the case, and it is why we launched an NFT aggregator\u2014which has zero fees and is part of our effort to develop products that are built to last.\u201d"

        "title": "Uniswap Traders Can Now Buy NFTs With UNI, SHIB or Any Ethereum Token - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nNFT marketplaces typically have restrictions on which cryptocurrencies can be used to purchase assets\u2014but Uniswap\u2019s NFT marketplace has just launched a new feature that changes all that.\n\nUniswap NFT traders can now use any token on the Ethereum blockchain, such as stablecoins like USDC or Tether, or even a meme coin like Shiba Inu, to purchase their NFTs through a simplified interface.\n\nHow does it work? According to the crypto startup, Uniswap\u2019s new Universal Router contract \u201cfinds the most cost-efficient route\u201d to complete a swap from any Ethereum-based token into the required token for the NFT sales (in most cases, Ethereum) and then pushes that crypto to OpenSea\u2019s Seaport protocol to finalize the transaction.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nUnder the hood, Uniswap is dramatically simplifying the NFT purchasing process for those who might need to swap one cryptocurrency for another before buying an NFT.\n\nThe firm also said it plans to support combined sums of multiple different cryptocurrencies for a single NFT sale soon as well, meaning that if an NFT costs 1 ETH, a trader could buy it with a combination of USDC and Tether, or DAI and SHIB, or Uniswap\u2019s native token UNI and Chainlink, for instance.\n\nWhat does this mean for NFT traders? The new tool is meant for existing Uniswap traders who swap high volumes of tokens already on the platform. It could also help users juggling liquidity to lock in sales they want faster without having to manually swap the tokens first themselves. And for those concerned about the tax implications of NFT trading, one fewer transaction before making an NFT purchase also means one fewer taxable event.\n\nSince Uniswap acquired NFT aggregator Genie last year and launched its NFT marketplace feature on its platform in November, it\u2019s seen less than 10,000 total transactions and roughly $7.6 million in total volume traded. It has about 16,600 total sellers and 5,400 total buyers, per a dashboard from Dune Analytics Data Scientist MarcoV.\n\nConsidering the fact that its broader DeFi platform has nearly 4.8 million total users, according to a Dune Analytics dashboard, Uniswap hasn\u2019t exactly been able to bring its legacy users en masse to its new NFT product just yet.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nUniswap\u2019s latest advancements on its NFT platform may improve its user experience, but it\u2019s unclear whether it will be enough to drive traffic away from rivals like the Paradigm-backed Blur, which offers token incentives and airdrops for high-volume traders.\n\nAt time of writing, Blur activity makes up 80.6% of NFT market share by volume in the past week, while OpenSea takes about 14.5%. Uniswap\u2019s NFT platform is still a small blip on the graphs. It doesn\u2019t yet even make it into the top 10 NFT marketplaces by total trader count, according to a Dune Analytics dashboard.\n\nWhen asked for comment on Blur and OpenSea\u2019s market dominance, Uniswap Labs told Decrypt via email that its products are \u201cbuilt to last.\u201d\n\n\u201cNFTs bring new users to crypto and self-custody. That continues to be the case, and it is why we launched an NFT aggregator\u2014which has zero fees and is part of our effort to develop products that are built to last.\u201d"

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAccording to an Ethereum Foundation blog post, after months of testing and an ephemeral devnet launch, the Shanghai/Capella or Shapella network upgrade is now scheduled for deployment on the Sepolia testnet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Shapella upgrade will activate on the Sepolia network at epoch 56832, which is estimated to be Feb. 28, 2023, at 4:04:48 a.m. UTC.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade will activate on the ETH testnet Sepolia network at epoch 56832, scheduled for 4:04:48 AM UTC on Feb. 28. This upgrade follows the Merge and enables validators to withdraw their stake from the Beacon Chain back to the execution layer. https://t.co/8NGPw8nkV8 \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) February 22, 2023\n\nThis upgrade follows the mid-September merge that ushered in the proof-of-stake transition and enables validators to withdraw. Users would be able to withdraw their stake ETH from the Beacon Chain back to the execution layer. It also introduces new functionality to both the execution and consensus layer. The Shapella upgrade combines changes to the execution layer (Shanghai), consensus layer (Capella) and engine API.\n\nThe Zhejiang testnet, which went live at the start of February, could be used to test Shapella functionality before the Sepolia upgrade. It urges stakers and nonstakers who operate nodes to upgrade their nodes to the most recent Ethereum client versions to take advantage of the Sepolia upgrade.\n\nEthereum price action\n\nAt the time of publication, Ethereum was down 1.66% at $1,647. On the upside, Ethereum could target the $1,800 mark next before continuing its journey toward the $2,000 range. Bears may mount a defense in the range between $2,000 and $2,200.\n\nOn the other hand, a strong support is envisaged near the $1,460 mark if declines continue ahead of the $1,350 mark."

        "content": "Ethereum core developer Tim Beiko announced the Shapella upgrade is scheduled for Feb. 28. The Shapella network upgrade will activate on the Sepolia network at epoch 56832.\n\nShanghai and Capella (Shapella) are the upcoming Ethereum hard fork names. Shanghai is the fork\u2019s name on the execution layer client side, and Capella is the upgrade name on the consensus layer client side.\n\nEthereum Sepolia upgrade schedule. Source: GitHub\n\nSome key Ethereum improvement proposal (EIP) changes on the execution layer include warm coinbase (not to be confused with the crypto exchange) and Beacon Chain push withdrawals. The push withdrawals will allow validator withdrawals from the Beacon Chain to the Ethereum Virtual Machine via a new \u201csystem-level\u201d operation type. On the other hand, warm coinbase could be a game changer that reduces network fees for builders.\n\nCoinbase is the name of the software that builders use to receive new tokens on the network. Every new platform transaction must interact with the coinbase software multiple times. The first interaction costs more as the software needs to \u201cwarm\u201d up, with fees declining as the interactions increase. However, with the introduction of EIP-3651, the coinbase software will remain warm to begin with, requiring a lower gas fee to access it.\n\nRelated: Ethereum on-chain data suggests ETH sell pressure could be a non-event after the Shanghai upgrade\n\nMajor changes to the consensus layer include full and partial withdrawals for validators and independent state and block historical accumulators, replacing the original singular historical roots.\n\nPartial withdrawal means validators can withdraw Ether (ETH) rewards in excess of 32 Ether and keep validating. If they want a full withdrawal, validators can fully exit, take all 32 Ether and rewards, and stop doing the work.\n\nThe upcoming upgrade would enable validators to withdraw their staked Ether (stETH) from the Beacon Chain to the execution layer. Moreover, the upgrade would bring changes to the execution and consensus layers, adding new features, making it a key upgrade following the Merge.\n\nStakers and non-stakers who operate nodes must, however, upgrade their nodes to the most recent Ethereum client versions to take advantage of the Sepolia upgrade. After the deployment of the Sepolia upgrade, the next step would be the release of the Shanghai upgrade on the Ethereum Goerli test network, expected to commence in March."

        "content": "The price of Ether (ETH) rallied 18% between Feb. 13 and Feb. 16 but has since been range trading near the $1,700 level. Despite the recent price improvement, Ether derivatives metrics remain neutral-to-bullish as investors ponder the tighter regulatory environment and the potential impact of Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade.\n\nInvestors\u2019 biggest concern right now is regulation, especially after the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Stability Board recently stated that most stablecoins fail to meet international standards. The FSB was created by the G20 and is affiliated with the Bank of International Settlements. FSB chair Klaas Knot stated that the appropriate regulation of crypto-assets should be \u201cbased on the principle of same activity, same risk, same regulation.\u201d\n\nIn more positive news, there has been some improvement in China after the government is reportedly taking a softer approach to Hong Kong\u2019s crypto hub aspirations. According to a Feb. 20 Bloomberg report, representatives from China have been frequenting Hong Kong crypto gatherings seeking to understand local crypto business operations.\n\nA recent Binance report detailed the status of Ether staking and explored why the Shanghai upgrade may not result in the ETH sell pressure that some traders have predicted. Their rationale is based on liquid staking derivatives, which allow users to benefit from staked Ether while retaining the ability to sell the derivative token.\n\nLet's look at Ether derivatives data to understand if the $1,700 price rejection has impacted crypto investors\u2019 sentiment.\n\nETH futures show higher demand for leverage longs\n\nThe two-month futures annualized premium should trade between 4% to 8% in healthy markets to cover costs and associated risks. However, when the contract trades at a discount versus regular spot markets, it shows a lack of confidence from traders and is a bearish indicator.\n\nEther 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe chart above shows that derivatives traders are no longer neutral-to-bearish after the Ether futures premium exceeded the 4% threshold. More importantly, it shows resilience even as ETH failed to sustain the $1,700 support on Feb. 21.\n\nThe lessened demand for leverage shorts (bears) does not necessarily translate to an expectation of positive price action. Traders should analyze Ether\u2019s options markets to understand how whales and market makers are pricing the odds of future price movements.\n\nOptions risk metrics move away from bearish sentiment\n\nThe 25% delta skew is a telling sign when market makers and arbitrage desks are overcharging for upside or downside protection.\n\nIn bear markets, options investors give higher odds for a price dump, causing the skew indicator to rise above 10%. On the other hand, bullish markets tend to drive the skew metric below -10%, meaning the bearish put options are in less demand.\n\nEther 30-day options 25% delta skew: Source: Laevitas.ch\n\nThe delta skew flirted with the bearish 10% level on Feb. 14, signaling stress from professional traders. However, the situation improved through the week as the index moved close to 0 \u2014 indicating similar upside and downside risk appetite.\n\nCurrently, options and futures markets point to pro traders moving to a neutral-to-bullish sentiment, displaying higher odds of ETH breaking above the $1,700 resistance. Consequently, the odds favor Ether bulls as investors remained calm despite the regulatory pressure and negative emotions associated with the upcoming Shanghai upgrade.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "The co-founder of the social media website Reddit, Alexis Ohanian, reportedly bought 50,000 Ether (ETH) for just $15,000 during the cryptocurrency\u2019s presale in 2014, costing just 30 cents per coin.\n\nOhanian, who left the social media giant in 2020, told Forbes on Feb. 21 that he found the idea of a decentralized store of value very attractive, partly due to his Armenian heritage, prompting him to take an early gamble on Ethereum.\n\n\u201cAny group of people who have in their consciousness, or in their collective history, some idea of persecution, especially by a state, makes the idea of a store of value that is not controlled by any single state very attractive. And so, in some ways it was hardwired in me then, and made me in a way receptive to the idea of a decentralized currency.\u201d\n\nAt current prices, this investment is worth a whopping $82.5 million, according to CoinMarketCap, representing an increase of 549,589%.\n\nHe continued to explain how Turkish soldiers seized his family\u2019s inheritance of heirloom rugs during the Armenian genocide in World War I, which led to his interest in \u201cunseizable property.\u201d\n\nDue to his aversion to seizable property, Ohanian is a big proponent of self-custody. He manages the private keys to some of his most valuable crypto-related investments, keeping them off exchanges that are more vulnerable to the prying arms of governments.\n\nWhen he heard about Ethereum in a meeting with cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, Ohanian claimed he saw the potential for developers to build a wide range of potentially unseizable assets on top of it, such as nonfungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nAs a result, he made his initial investment in Ether but noted in the interview that \u201cin hindsight, I didn\u2019t invest nearly as much as I should have.\u201d\n\nRelated: Ethereum derivatives data suggests $1,700 might not remain a resistance level for long\n\nOhanian founded venture capitalist firm 776 in 2020 using the proceeds from his early investments in Ether and Coinbase. The firm has invested in 29 crypto-related startups and raised $500 million in February 2022 to finance similar investments.\n\nIn line with Ohanian\u2019s views that bear markets allow investors to buy assets at discounted prices, the firm has regarded the latest market downturn as the perfect time to make long-term bets on the crypto industry.\n\nThe firm currently boasts over $750 million in assets under management.\n\nOhanian noted that although crypto is extremely volatile, \u201cthere are plenty of people who have that generational consciousness of seeing massive inflation,\u201d which makes crypto\u2019s volatility much more palatable."

        "content": "Ethereum developers are raising concerns over the creation of a marketplace for Ethereum tokens on the blockchain\u2019s sandbox called Goerli.\n\nLayerZero, a protocol that connects blockchains, has defended its new Goerli ETH marketplace as a solution for fixing a problem that has hobbled Ethereum development, but developers accuse it of choking access to a key tool and monetising a valueless token.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bad idea because you are incentivising people to spend real money on something that has no value,\u201d William Mitsuda, an Ethereum developer and founder of Ethereum block explorer Otterscan, told DL News.\n\nGoerli is one of Ethereum\u2019s most prominent \u201ctestnets,\u201d a blockchain where developers test their code before launching applications on the so-called \u201cmainnet,\u201d Ethereum\u2019s main blockchain.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\n\u201cWe made the market simply because the experience sucked for us and we asked ourselves \u2018what can we build to make life for Ethereum devs easier.\u201d\n\nGoerli ETH, the native token of the testnet, is normally a valueless token, but it is needed to deploy and test applications in the sandbox. Many Ethereum developers rely on Goerli to ensure their applications work properly before deploying them for real on mainnet.\n\nHowever, the Goerli testnet has been held back in recent months by a limited supply of tokens. While that scarcity has been created by design to better mirror the mainnet, it has meant that around 80% of the token is locked up in applications and cannot be used.\n\nFor testing most other applications, developers usually use the newer Sepolia testnet, where users can mint an infinite number of testnet tokens.\n\nLayerZero launched a new Testnet Bridge on Tuesday, which lets users directly swap valuable mainnet ETH, the usual token for Ethereum, for Goerli ETH, the normally valueless testnet version.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\n\u201cWe made the market simply because the experience sucked for us and we asked ourselves \u2018what can we build to make life for Ethereum devs easier,\u2019\u201d Bryan Pellegrino, co-founder and CEO at LayerZero Labs, told DL News. \u201cThis was near the top of our list. Every single person in our company has felt this exact need so it got proposed and we said \u2018yeah absolutely, let\u2019s build that.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut many developers are outraged that the bridge places a monetary value on something that, in their eyes, should be free.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a short-term relief that\u2019s not good in the long term,\u201d Mudit Gupta, chief information security officer at Polygon, told DL News. \u201cAccess to educational material and testnets should ideally be free and not gated.\u201d\n\nOthers suggest that putting a price on Goerli ETH may discourage developers from building on Ethereum.\n\nHudson Jameson, a former support lead at the Ethereum Foundation, told DL News that testnets have always been operated as public goods to welcome new developers and allow testing contracts for free.\n\n\u201cThere were already instances of people making small paid deals to get Goerli ETH, they just formalised this.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven if it looks like the issue is solved, [it] comes at the cost of new devs getting the impression they will be priced out of trying Ethereum development and instil a sense that testnet tokens have economic value similar to regular ETH tokens,\u201d he said.\n\nSome developers have rushed to defend LayerZero\u2019s Goerli ETH market.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen the argument that making Goerli ETH tradable creates a barrier to entry for new devs but I don\u2019t believe this is the case because it\u2019s extremely cheap, hovering between two [and] 10 cents,\u201d pseudonymous Ethereum developer Philogy told DL News.\n\nNOW READ: Harmony execs mismanaged funds and bullied workers, ex-staff claim\n\nOthers highlighted previous difficulty in getting enough Goerli ETH tokens for testing. Most faucets \u2013 bots that distribute tokens on request \u2013 require users to solve CAPTCHA puzzles to prove they\u2019re humans and post their wallet address on Twitter \u2013 a problem for those trying to develop quietly. Even after jumping through these hoops, users only received small amounts of Goerli ETH.\n\nAnother alternative was using over-the-counter providers of Goerli ETH.\n\nAndrey Shevchenko, co-founder at DeFi protocol Zircon Finance, told DL News that LayerZero\u2019s move is good because \u201cthere were already instances of people making small paid deals to get Goerli ETH, they just formalised this.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou literally had to hunt for it, random discords, Twitter, etc. Basically play find-a-whale,\u201d Pellegrino told DL News.\n\nGoerli ETH traded for $0.10 at Testnet Bridge\u2019s launch yesterday but has fluctuated downward since then.\n\n\u201cOverall I think it\u2019ll dump to zero quite quickly,\u201d Shevchenko said."

        "content": "Ethereum whales move away from ETH as MVRV ratio increased.\n\nValidators and retail investors continued to support Ethereum.\n\nAccording to a 22 February tweet by Glassnode, large addresses have started selling their Ethereum [ETH]. New data suggested that addresses holding over 1000 ETH reached a one-month low.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nSelling pressure rises\n\nLarge addresses selling their Ethereum may be a good thing, as it could make the network more decentralized. However, if this trend of large addresses exiting their positions was to continue, it could impact ETH\u2019s prices negatively.\n\nOne reason why whales were observed to be selling their ETH could be due to the high MVRV ratio of Ethereum at press time. According to Glassnode\u2019s data, the MVRV ratio for Ethereum reached a one-month-high.\n\nA high MVRV ratio suggested that most ETH holders would make a profit if they sold their holdings. This would create selling pressure on a lot of addresses. Even though the selling pressure was high, retail investors continued to HODL.\n\nAlong with that, there was high activity on the network as well. This was showcased by the increasing fees paid off on the Ethereum network.\n\nETH investors stay hopeful\n\nAnother reason why the retail investors were interested in Ethereum could be due to its negative issuance. A negative net issuance indicates that the total supply of the cryptocurrency has decreased over a time period. A negative net issuance may lead to a scarcity of coins and potentially increase the value of the cryptocurrency in the future.\n\nAlong with the retail investors, the number of validators on the Ethereum network increased as well. According to Staking Rewards, the number of validators on the Ethereum network grew by 3.89% in the last 30 days. The high number of validators on the network would be due to the revenue being generated by them.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nOver the last month, the revenue generated by Ethereum validators increased by 38.08%, which translated to $1.91 billion worth of revenue at press time.\n\nOverall, despite whales moving away from ETH, retail and staker interest continued to stay strong."

        "title": "Solana (SOL): Native scalability - Coinbase",
        "content": "Introduction Solana rose to prominence after launching its blockchain in March 2020, surpassing US$77B in market capitalization at its peak on November 6, 2021. Since then, a confluence of headwinds have impaired the value of the ecosystem, reducing its market cap by ~87% and total value locked by ~97%. Some of these challenges (such as network outages and bugs) could be considered growing pains of an early stage technology platform still technically in beta, while others (such as tightening financial conditions and crypto-specific insolvencies) are better characterized as exogenous factors. Perhaps most notably, the sentiment shockwaves emanating from the recent collapse of FTX have had an outsized impact on Solana, given the network\u2019s historical association with (and funding from) the now-defunct exchange. While the Solana community was rightfully surprised by these events, this former association has nonetheless contributed to dampened perceptions of the network. Taking a step back, the fundamental characteristics which make Solana an architecturally differentiated layer-1 blockchain remain intact. While many of its competitors \u2013 including Ethereum \u2013 have been forced to scale their networks\u2019 transactional capacity through second- and third-layers, Solana was intentionally designed for native scalability at the base layer. By augmenting its proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism with a unique timestamping function called proof-of-history (PoH), Solana has been able to process as many as 65,000 transactions per second (TPS)(achieved on testnet), making it one of the highest throughput blockchains in the industry. Because these technical capabilities are possible within a single global state (as opposed to multiple layers), Solana offers enhanced composability to developers building applications on the protocol. These sources of differentiation represent important catalyzing forces that can attract and retain developer talent, an area where the protocol has historically shown strength (a sentiment recently echoed by Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum). In this report, we assess the mechanics of the Solana protocol and its competitive positioning in the layer-1 blockchain space. Despite a significant decline in value from its prior peak, user activity on Solana and its pipeline of development initiatives remain relatively robust. Further, Solana has maintained a focus on improving the resiliency of its infrastructure, implementing upgrades targeted at reducing spam transactions and eliminating network outages. In our view, the technological differentiation exhibited by Solana will continue to act as a foundational element of the protocol\u2019s value proposition. The ecosystem\u2019s focus on performance for users and composability for developers may play an important role in driving future adoption and network growth.\n\nTokenomics The native asset of Solana is SOL. Validators can participate in network security by staking SOL in order to receive rewards in the form of newly issued SOL as well as a portion of transaction fees (50% of transaction fees are burned, with the remaining 50% awarded to the leading validator processing the given transaction). While Solana has recently introduced local fee markets allowing for transaction prioritization, the standard fee is fixed at a low rate (0.000005 SOL per signature, or ~1/100th of a cent in USD). In terms of new issuance, Solana set the initial annualized inflation rate at 8% in February 2021, scheduled to decline by 15% every 180 epochs (roughly one calendar year) until it reaches its long-term inflation target of 1.5% (estimated to occur in 2031). The initial supply of SOL (detailed in Chart 1) was 500M tokens and since inception, new issuance awarded to validators has grown the total outstanding supply of SOL to 540M tokens at current. The annualized issuance rate of SOL is currently ~6.36% and will vary depending on network performance. Because of the low static fee structure, the vast majority of a given validator\u2019s staking rewards come from new issuance, meaning the potential staking yield is primarily a function of the (1) current issuance rate and (2) total amount of staked SOL as a percentage of total supply. Staking yields will also vary depending on commission rates (charged by validators to delegators) as well as a given validator\u2019s uptime during the period. At current, ~70.36% of all eligible SOL is staked, equating to an average annualized staking yield of ~6.92% (per Staking Rewards ). As the rate of new issuance continues to decline according to the aforementioned schedule, validators will increasingly rely on transaction fees for compensation which suggests network activity will need to increase meaningfully over time in order to foster a more robust fee market. Chart 1. Initial SOL supply Prior to the public auction in March 2020, Solana held four separate funding rounds (as detailed in Table 1). Since inception (inclusive of fundraising rounds subsequent to the public auction) Solana has raised a total of ~US$376M from private investors. While Solana has historically garnered a reputation for being a heavily \u201cVC-backed\u201d blockchain, the reality is that there are not many legally-compliant alternative fundraising mechanisms for this type of early stage protocol. Moreover, some layer-1 competitors have raised even more money than Solana, including NEAR, which has raised a total of ~US$524M from private investors since inception. Table 1. Solana fundraising summary (pre-public auction) It is worth mentioning that ~31% of the SOL supply is not yet circulating. It consists of SOL to be unlocked according to various vesting schedules associated with early investors as well as SOL owned by Solana Labs and the Solana Foundation (which are not subject to lockups but are not considered circulating). Perhaps most notably, the largest holder of locked SOL is the now-defunct Alameda Research, which holds over 47M SOL (~28% of all non-circulating supply) that is scheduled to be unlocked between March and July of 2025.\n\nLayer-1 landscape In a certain sense, the advent of the Solana protocol helped catalyze the proliferation of alternative layer-1 smart contract platforms observed in recent years. A technically ambitious project, Solana was able to gain initial traction by offering a differentiated environment for both users and developers that could theoretically challenge the network effects of established incumbents, namely Ethereum. During the bull run of 2021, for example, the network\u2019s capacity for cheap and fast transactions attracted new users as other blockchains became prohibitively expensive to use. Ultimately, while it is possible that a \u201cmulti-chain\u201d future for crypto will consist of several interoperable, specialized blockchains that can effectively co-exist from a market share perspective, the current state of affairs is more directly competitive. Layer-1 blockchains are currently competing to capture as much mindshare as possible from a common, albeit growing, pool of capital and users. While the intensity of this competition may be less apparent in the midst of an ongoing bear market, Solana has seemingly captured a surprisingly sticky amount of mindshare since its inception and the ecosystem is aptly focused on bolstering their technological advantages. It is worth reiterating that the Solana community was just as stunned by the collapse of FTX as the broader market. Founder Anatoly Yakovenko believes Solana\u2019s perceived linkages with FTX have historically been overstated, recently noting that their largest contribution to Solana was the development of the decentralized order book called Serum, which has since been forked and is now a community-led effort called OpenBook . That said, we believe that the network\u2019s historical growth and subsequent decline in market capitalization and total-value-locked (TVL) are perhaps less relevant to the forward-looking analysis of Solana than they otherwise would be. Accordingly, the competitive positioning of Solana is better understood by focusing on activity-driven metrics such as transactions and active users, in relation to aggregate network value (note that these metrics are not resistant to Sybil attacks which can result in multiple fake addresses and thus may overstate activity). Chart 2. Ratio of market capitalization to daily transactions (rolling 30D average, US$) Chart 3. Ratio of market capitalization to daily active users (rolling 30D average, US$) As shown in Charts 2 and 3, the activity on Solana in terms of transactions and active users (adjusted for market capitalization) compares favorably to that of Ethereum at current. This data suggests that Solana may be undervalued relative to Ethereum with respect to the level of underlying activity on the network. Said another way, while Solana\u2019s current market capitalization is just ~4.3% of Ethereum\u2019s current market capitalization, the amount of daily active users on the network represents ~43.7% of Ethereum\u2019s daily active user base (~150k for Solana versus ~344k for Ethereum). Furthermore, Solana processes roughly ~17x the amount of daily transactions as processed by Ethereum (~17.7M for Solana versus ~1.0M for Ethereum), which may be largely attributable to its overtly low-cost fee structure which creates a more frictionless environment for user activity. Zooming out, it is important to recognize that the overarching investment thesis for Solana is largely predicated on the technological merit of the protocol. Unparalleled transaction throughput (at very low cost) combined with an architectural design allowing for native scalability on the base layer represents a legitimate alternative to the layered approach taken by Ethereum and its EVM clones. In order to be successful over the long-term, however, we believe the Solana ecosystem must maintain a focus on the technical capabilities of the platform and aim to offer products and services that simply cannot be executed on other blockchains due to higher latency or less composability. By leaning into the differentiation of their technologies, Solana may be better positioned to attract and retain developer talent which could help drive future user adoption and network activity.\n\nDeveloper activity Outside of metrics related to network activity, another important barometer for gauging the forward-looking potential of Solana is the level of developer activity across the ecosystem. Chart 4 details a comparison of developer activity between Solana and Ethereum, based on data from Github. Following a period of outsized growth for Solana in late 2021/early 2022 (that meaningfully surpassed that of Ethereum), developer activity on Solana subsequently declined back below that of Ethereum in May 2022. Currently, Github data suggests there are 63 active developers working on Solana, versus 133 active developers working on Ethereum (according to The Tie, where \u201cactive\u201d is defined as developers who commit code 5+ days of a month). That being said, Solana itself has recently disputed this data , making the argument that the entirety of the developer community working within the ecosystem is not captured by Solana-specific Github repositories. By their calculations, the number of active developers working on Solana full-time (defined as developers who commit code 5+ days of a month) is 120. They also noted that certain repositories and organizations on Github are private, and thus would not be captured by these metrics. Additionally, a recent developer activity report released by Electric Capital takes a broader approach and suggests higher totals for both networks \u2013 383 full-time developers for Solana versus 1,873 for Ethereum as of mid-December (full-time defined as developers who commit code 10+ days of a month). Nevertheless, even the potentially conservative lower bound of 63 active developers for Solana would again suggest relative strength versus Ethereum after adjusting for the large discrepancy in market capitalization of the networks. Chart 4. Developer activity trends (Solana versus Ethereum)\n\nKey protocol initiatives As previously mentioned, the technological differentiation of Solana is at the core of its forward-looking value proposition. To the ecosystem\u2019s credit, they have continued to build innovative products, services and pieces of infrastructure to support the capabilities of the protocol despite a plethora of headwinds and negative sentiment. Some of Solana\u2019s key protocol initiatives which could help bolster the network\u2019s technical advantages are detailed below. Deployed QUIC : a new version of Solana\u2019s data transfer protocol (previously the user datagram protocol, UDP) which provides validators greater flexibility in organizing transaction data and promises to reduce the frequency of spam transactions Local fee markets : allows users to prioritize transactions with higher fees paid to validators and could help foster a more robust fee market, which could disincentivize spam transactions Stake-weighted Quality of Service : ensures validators will be able to transmit transaction data in proportion to their share of stake Jito-Solana : a modified validator client created by Jito Labs, analogous to Flashbot\u2019s MEV-boost on Ethereum (also introduced a liquid staking derivative called JitoSOL)\n\nIn testing Token-22 : a new token standard that will facilitate enhanced functionality like embedded royalties for NFTs and confidential payments Firedancer : an independent, C++ validator client created by Jump Crypto aimed at increasing the efficiency of the Solana network and creating a more redundant/diverse validator environment (to be deployed gradually throughout 2023) Concurrent Merkle trees / account compression : an account data compression method developed by Solana Labs that aims to decrease data storage requirements and costs\n\nProposed Runtime v2 : a new version of Solana\u2019s runtime (the environment where smart contracts are executed) that will support the Move programming language and help foster a more efficient, auditable and cost-effective programming environment for developers\n\nAnother notable initiative for Solana is their forthcoming mobile phone, Solana Saga. The development of a crypto-specific mobile stack promises to allow users to securely store private keys and seamlessly navigate decentralized applications, all from a singular device. Importantly, this infrastructure will allow developers to build applications outside the purview of incumbents that extract value from the web2 application environment. Early versions of the device were sent to interested developers in mid-December for testing, ahead of the public release anticipated for 1Q23."

        "title": "Friendsies NFT Collection Rug Pulled After Raising $5 Million - Ethereum World News",
        "content": "Friendsies founders have abruptly shut down the NFT collection and all associated projects.\n\nThe rug pull was confirmed after the project\u2019s Twitter account was deleted.\n\nThe collection had raised $5 million at Christie\u2019s auction on OpenSea less than a year ago.\n\nFounders of the NFT collection blamed their decision to shut down on volatility and challenges in the market.\n\nFounders of the Friendsies (fRiENDSiES) NFT collection have pulled the rug on the project. The rug pull, which was announced on the project\u2019s official Twitter account earlier today, comes less than a year after the Ethereum-based collection raised a whopping $5 million at an auction hosted by popular auction house Christie\u2019s on OpenSea.\n\nFriendsies founders blame market volatility for pulling the rug\n\nIn a now-deleted Twitter thread, the founders of Friendsies blamed the volatility and challenges of the crypto market for their decision to pull the rug. They claimed that the current market conditions prevented them from developing the project in a way that they could be \u201cproud of\u201d.\n\nFor now, we have decided that it\u2019s best to allow the space to further mature. The fRiENDSiES IP is important to the team and we will be waiting for the right time and opportunities to see the full vision become reality.\u201d Friendsies founders\n\nI was quite outspoken about friendsies.\n\n\n\nDutch Auction except they didn\u2019t sell it at the lowest price for everybody. Started at 4.2eth and quite a few ppl paid absurd prices like this.\n\n\n\nThen after raking in millions they collected royalties for months until rugging yesterday.\n\n\n\ngg pic.twitter.com/Gu3as5hhf3 \u2014 0xBiZzy.eth \ud83d\udc7e (@0xBiZzy) February 21, 2023\n\nThe early signs of trouble emerged when community members started alleging last year that the project\u2019s founders had turned their back on the roadmap that was initially laid out. According to on-chain sleuth ZackXBT, there have been no announcements from the project since September 2022. Furthermore, several aspects of the roadmap, including a community treasury and a play-to-earn game, remain undelivered.\n\nZachXBT further revealed that the founders of the project had not distributed 1.25% of all royalties (47 ETH) to holders, as claimed in the project\u2019s official Discord server in March 2022. The rug pull has caused uproar in the NFT community on Twitter, with many victims calling out the crypto influencers who aggressively promoted the Friendsies collection last year.\n\nMastercard Product Lead Satvik Sethi has publicly offered to take over Friendsies. According to him, the project\u2019s IP has good potential and by installing a new team and leading with a different vision, the holders could be made whole."

        "content": "Cronos is a layer 1 blockchain built in the Cosmos ecosystem. As a result, it connects to the IBC (the Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol). These are quite a few blockchains that are also built on Cosmos. However, Cronos is also EVM compatible.\n\nAs a result, it connects the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems. To achieve this, it needs bridges. So, we are going to look at the top 4 bridges for Cronos.\n\n3 more days till Cronos mainnet launch where multiple DeFi protocols will go live. Are you ready? \ud83c\udf09Bridging assets into a new chain is always tricky. We have prepared a guide on the multiple ways you can safely bridge your assets into Cronos on Day 1 \u2013 https://t.co/cWpaHBK2en pic.twitter.com/vuZ6AlpRPg \u2014 Cronos (@cronos_chain) November 5, 2021\n\n1) Cronos Bridge\n\nThe Cronos bridge can transfer digital assets between selected chains. Currently, these are the Crypto.org chain, Cosmos, Akash, and Cronos. The bridge to Terra is currently paused, and an Ethereum bridge option is coming soon.\n\nSo, the cronos bridge is a decentralized bridge built on IBC and the Gravity Bridge. As we just saw, the Cronos bridge works in the IBC ecosystem. On the other hand, Gravity Bridge is a blockchain. It bridges between the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems.\n\nTo use the Cronos Bridge, you use the CRO token to pay all related fees. However, for your first transaction from Cronos to another chain, you get a free token. There\u2019s a faucet that airdrops on the destination chain. Cronos currently supports three tokens and three wallets. For instance:\n\nTokens : CRO, ATOM, and AKT. Wallets : Metamask, Keplr, Crypto.com DeFi Wallet.\n\nSource: Cronos Bridge app\n\n2) Multichain\n\nMultichain used to be Anyswap. This project has backing from well-known industry leaders. For example, Binance invested $350,000 as part of their accelerator program. Furthermore, Binance Labs led a $60 million investment round.\n\nCurrently, Multichain connects over 70 chains. Of course, Cronos is one of them. Other chains are, for example, Aptos, Cardano, Fantom, Litecoin, Near, or Solana.\n\nFor native tokens, Multichain uses liquidity pools and swaps cryptocurrencies across chains. When there is no native token, Multichain locks the token in a smart contract. At the destination chain, it will mint a pegged token. This is a wrapped token. Multichain can also bridge NFTs.\n\nThe bridging can take up to 30 minutes. However, Multichain boasts that there\u2019s no slippage. This is the difference between the expected and real price of a trade. The team keeps on top of new developments and recently released a new whitepaper. They based this on zero knowledge proof.\n\n\ud83d\udc41\u200d\ud83d\udde8#zkRouter Whitepaper Released\n\nA trustless, general cross-chain infrastructure is born! As #Multichain's latest development, #zkRouter based on zero-knowledge proof would be the next evolution in bridging area. Whitepaper \u27a1\ufe0fhttps://t.co/tUBsJ12c2i pic.twitter.com/akEmdAvVq7 \u2014 Multichain (Previously Anyswap) (@MultichainOrg) January 13, 2023\n\n3) XY Finance\n\nXY Finance aggregates not only DEXes but also bridges. Their XY token fuels their protocol. The protocol looks for the best possible route, for your assets. Furthermore, it looks for the best rate, speed, and security. Using the XY Finance bridge, you can bridge 15 chains and all their tokens to Cronos. For instance:\n\nArbitrum.\n\nAvalanche.\n\nBinance Chain.\n\nEthereum.\n\nFantom.\n\nOptimism.\n\nPolygon.\n\nYou can use a variety of wallets to bridge tokens with XY Finance. As you can see, by the supported chains, you will need an Ethereum compatible wallet. Rabby, Trust Wallet, Rainbow Wallet, or MetaMask will work fine. Multichain uses two features for bridging:\n\nX Swap: Uses the fastest and cheapest route to swap tokens. Y Pool: Is the bridge.\n\n#XYFinance lowered the #crosschain transaction fee \ud83d\udd25 \u2705 14 Supported #Blockchain\n\n\u2705 270+ Supported #DEXs\n\n\u2705 120K+ Supported Tokens\n\n\u2705 Best routing\n\n\u2705 Best price\n\n\u2705 Lower risk to price impact\n\n\u2705 Swap tokens across 14 chains More details \ud83d\udc47 https://t.co/eXeulDaOF8 pic.twitter.com/68q5lEwtO6 \u2014 XY Finance | DEX & Bridge | (@xyfinance) December 23, 2022\n\n4) Cosmos IBC Hub\n\nThe Cosmos Hub are all the interconnected blockchains in the Cosmos ecosystem. Cosmos has the ATOM token, but each chain has its own token. It\u2019s the Internet of Blockchains. There are many blockchains in the IBC system that cover different grounds, for example:\n\nOsmosis is a DEX.\n\nSecret Network emphasizes privacy.\n\nAxelar offers cross-chain communication.\n\nStargaze is an NFT marketplace.\n\nKava is a DeFi landing platform.\n\nGravity Bridge connects the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems.\n\nCronos connects EVM chains with the Cosmos ecosystem.\n\nWith Cosmos IBC Hub, you can transfer the ATOM token cross-chain now. Because Cronos has a built-in IBC module, it can connect with other IBC chains. On the other hand, it also supports EVM chains.\n\nAs a result, it supports both IBC tokens and ERC20 tokens. It has a built-in module that converts the two tokens. You can use the Keplr wallet for the Cosmos side and MetaMask for the Cronos side. The Crypto.com DeFi wallet works for both sides. Below is a picture of the Cosmos zones. These are the hubs and zones of the Cosmos Network.\n\nSource: Map of Zones\n\nConclusion\n\nWe showed you four different bridge options for the Cronos blockchain. These are the Cronos Bridge, Multichain, XY Finance, and the main Cosmos IBC Hub.\n\nThe current price of the Cronos token is $0.086294. CRO has a market cap of $2.17 billion. Out of the 30 billion total supply of CRO tokens, 25 billion already circulate.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f For more cryptocurrency news, check out the Altcoin Buzz YouTube channel.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f Our popular Altcoin Buzz Access group generates tons of alpha for our subscribers.

        "content": "Ethereum, the most commercial blockchain in existence, is often looked at as a benchmark for other blockchains seeking competition. In a fresh development, the daily transactions on Arbitrum have surpassed those on Ethereum. Developed by New York City-based Offchain Labs, Arbitrum is a layer-2 scaling solution, built upon the Ethereum blockchain that improves the efficiency of the mother blockchain. Among other layer-2 solutions built on Ethereum, Polygon is also a notable name.\n\nBetween January 1 and February 20, the number of daily transactions on Arbitrum rose by an impressive 590 percent, data by Arbiscan showed.\n\n\u201cThe highest number of 1,103,398 transactions on Arbitrum was recorded on Tuesday, February 21, 2023,\u201d Arbiscan said.\n\nIn comparison, with 1,084,290 transactions, Ethereum recorded only a 46 percent rise in daily transactions in the same period, Etherscan reported.\n\nIn the backdrop of Arbitrum recording an all-time high in the number of registered unique addresses at 2.95 million, protocols built on the layer-2 have also shown promise among industry insiders.\n\nFactor, a decentralised asset management platform built on Arbitrum recently bagged over $4.3 million (roughly Rs. 35 crore) from traders in less than 12 hours, Coindesk reported. Camelot, a new decentralised exchange, also built on Arbitrum, witnessed a 369 percent spike in activities since February 1.\n\nAnalytics platform Nansen also showed that other financial applications based on Arbitrum recorded a 100 percent increase in transactions and userbase in the last 24 hours. These include Vela Exchange and Radiant Capital.\n\nIt is however noteworthy that Ethereum is still ahead of Arbitrum in terms of generating network fees. Ethereum's per-day fees amount to around $6.7 million (roughly Rs. 55 crore). Arbitrum, on the other hand, gathers around $154,000 (roughly Rs. 1.2 crore) per day.\n\nThe growth in this layer-2 blockchain solution is being triggered by some rather positive speculations making the rounds in the market. The crypto community is reportedly expecting Arbitrum to soon announce a potential airdrop.\n\nThere have been no official announcements from Arbitrum developers about the same. Arbitrum does not have a native crypto token.\n\nGaana, JioSaavn, Google Podcasts, Apple Podcasts, The iQoo Neo 7 packs a lot of power at an affordable price. But did the company cut the right corners to keep the price low? We discuss this and more on Orbital , the Gadgets 360 podcast.

BLUR is currently trading at $0.99, according to CoinGecko.\n\n\u201cSeason 1,\u201d which culminated with the debut of its native token BLUR last week, saw Blur dole out \u201ccare packages\u201d of BLUR to traders who transitioned to the platform from a competing NFT marketplace, listed NFTs on the platform immediately following its October launch, or used Blur to bid on NFTs.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSeason 2\u201d will see tokens distributed to traders in a more fixedly gamified program, according to the company. Blur customers will be assigned a \u201cloyalty score\u201d based on their interaction with and commitment to the trading platform, and buyers and sellers who refrain from using any other NFT marketplace will receive a 100% loyalty score, for example.\n\nA user\u2019s loyalty score, in combination with the quantity of NFTs they list, will determine how many BLUR tokens they will ultimately gain in a later airdrop.\n\n300M+ BLUR will be distributed to the community in Season 2. What\u2019s the secret to maximizing rewards? Loyalty. Users with 100% loyalty have the highest chances of Mythical Care Packages, which are worth 100x Uncommon Care Packages. Here are 3 ways to maximize your loyalty\ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/Cgiemrvpxh \u2014 Blur (@blur_io) February 21, 2023\n\nUnder this new loyalty system, even minor actions can potentially boost a user\u2019s odds of receiving more BLUR. The company implied Tuesday that even quote-tweeting its Twitter announcement regarding Season 2 could increase a user\u2019s loyalty score.\n\nP.S. You can contribute to the Blur community in many ways, including quote tweeting this thread with a reason for why you use Blur \ud83d\ude42 https://t.co/Lxy3mOjdPt \u2014 Blur (@blur_io) February 21, 2023\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt is unclear, though, what technical mechanisms Blur has in place to link activity on separate platforms like Twitter with metrics on its own site. The company did not immediately respond to Decrypt\u2019s request for clarification.\n\nTuesday\u2019s announcement marks the latest escalation in an all-out war that has erupted between NFT platforms to attract and hold customers. $13.3 billion behemoth OpenSea, long considered the sole dominant Ethereum NFT marketplace, has in recent months bled users to Blur, largely thanks to the latter\u2019s lucrative token-backed incentives program. Both companies have offered perks to users who blocklist the other.\n\nLast week, likely prompted by Blur\u2019s sharp ascension and lack of marketplace fees, OpenSea eliminated its own 2.5% fee\u2014the company\u2019s primary source of revenue\u2014for a \u201climited time.\u201d It also cut down creator royalty protections, once a hallmark of the NFT model, which previously guaranteed creators a royalty fee\u2014typically 5-10%\u2014on secondary NFT sales. Such royalty fees are how NFT projects generate ongoing revenue following an initial drop or sale.\n\nWhile the sustainability of Blur\u2019s aggressive incentives program is unclear, its immediate impact on competitors like OpenSea is all but certain to reinforce current trends.\n\nThough Blur does currently boast markedly higher trading volumes than OpenSea, the majority of that activity appears to have been generated by a smaller number of whale traders flipping NFTs to game Blur\u2019s rewards program to accrue as much BLUR as possible.\n\nThe popularity of that rewards program is contingent on the value of Blur\u2019s native token, however. In the last 24 hours, BLUR has shed some 24% in value, down from $1.28."

Before now, it was hard for EV drivers to know what charging stations were available and working in advance of pulling in \u2013 or even what the price of the charges would be. This great new crypto app is helping to provide that transparency and information to EV drivers."

        "content": "Algorand stands as one of the most functional Layer 1 blockchains in the crypto world.\n\nAnalysis of the Layer 1 Algorand and how it compares with leading competitors\n\nLayer 1 blockchains in the amazing world of crypto have a special place and these are all those chains that are very similar to Ethereum.\n\nThere are many competitors who would like to claim the title \u201cEthereum killer,\u201d but to date none has succeeded.\n\nIt is a segment full of competitors trying to offer ever-improving speed and efficiency.\n\nEthereum is the most widely used and emblazoned chain, but even Vitalik Buterin himself knows that it is a slow network and more expensive than others.\n\nResearch firm CoinCodex tried to analyze six Layer 1 blockchains including Ethereum, Cardano, Solana, Avalanche, Algorand and Internet Computer to understand their differences and merits.\n\nAlgorand placed well, in third place in the special ranking, and one of its strengths was certainly its speed.\n\nAlgorand manages to process as many as 20 TPS every 4.5 seconds and has a processing of 1,200 TPS with instantaneous finality that it wants to increase to 3,000 TPS.\n\nIn terms of speed the company placed third just behind Avalanche with 4500 TPS in 2.5 seconds and Internet Computer, 11500 TPS per second.\n\nAlgorand: PPOS\n\nAlgorand is based on Pure Proof-of-Stake; those who propose blocks and those who verify them are selected by the VRF (Verifiable Random Function) algorithm.\n\nIn contrast to classical Proof-of-Stake protocols doing so speeds up the computational process and Algorand is in fact more scalable.\n\nAlgorand boasts more or less 2,000 nodes on a central server and relies on AWS to scale its network.\n\nOn chain, on the other hand, the company uses the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) as its data storage.\n\nThe same problem of Avalanche and Cardano occurs with Algorand, which is forced to manage its own keys leading to problems with wallets.\n\nIn the overall ranking, as mentioned above, Algorand ranks third tied with Avalanche.\n\nOne of Algorand\u2019s strengths is the certification of its components so as to attract institutional investors, which is taken care of specifically by researcher Silvio Micali.\n\nInvestors Observer gives the crypto company a fairly low volatility rating (32) among the 30% of crypto assets that are less volatile.\n\nALGO is considered low volatility, as a result of risk and return analysis that revealed low fluctuations and difficult to attack by speculation.\n\nThe trend of the ALGO crypto\n\nAlgorand (ALGO) starts to slow its growth on Thursday but analysts say it is only a momentary setback.\n\nIn November 2021, ALGO\u2019s price touched its All Time High (ATH) of $2,990.\n\nFrom the day of the peak two years ago to today, the token has been on an inexorably downward parabola.\n\nOnce it touched $0.16, Algorand began to climb back up.\n\nThe value falls but if the resistance at 0.410 is breached, the token will go on to test the next resistance at $0.170.\n\nToken value fell from a negative parabola and then validated it as resistance.\n\nThe loss in value had been somewhat predictable from the bearish difference in the RSI.\n\nIf we were to rely on probability calculations the bearish movement is given 3 to 1.\n\nAt that point, the resistances set as targets would be those at 0.5-0.618 Fib.\n\nBasically, most analysts believe that Algorand this month-end will continue its descent right towards the above areas.\n\nIf the token succeeds in making the ascending support line its own in the short term then the correction may have ended and ALGO could target $0.410."
