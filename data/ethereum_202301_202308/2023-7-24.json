We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nThe quest for dominance between Ethereum (ETH) and its most obvious rival, Cardano (ADA), is taking a whole new shape, with new metrics defining how well each protocol is faring. A sneak peek into both protocols' decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, per data gleaned from DeFiLlama, especially as it relates to the Total Value Locked (TVL) metric, shows that Cardano has a clear lead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPer the DeFiLlama data, there is a significant plunge in the total ETH tokens locked within its smart contract; however, the reverse is the case as concerns ADA. For a better perspective, while the total ETH locked in its DeFi protocol as far back as January was pegged at 18.28 million units, the current figure has now plummeted back to 13.33 million units at the time of writing.\n\nCardano, on the other hand, saw the total TVL in its DeFi smart contracts pegged at 198.65 million ADA tokens as of Jan. 1, and today, this ADA lockup has grown to 571.92 million, an indication of consistent growth and embrace of new applications making their way onto the Cardano blockchain.\n\nMore upsides for Cardano\n\nWhile the individual token lockup in DeFi smart contracts is in favor of Cardano, the protocol still lags behind in other significant areas. These areas include the exact market capitalization of Ethereum when compared to that of Cardano. This wide disparity in token market capitalization also compliments the overall dollar value of TVL on both protocols.\n\nHowever, amid all these, Cardano has a significant upside that investors can watch out for. The effort to consistently upgrade the Cardano network remains a very promising push that can attract more Web3.0 developers who can build dApps to rival those on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nIt may take some time, but overall, Cardano has the chance to become as big, or even bigger, than Ethereum."

        "title": "Staying optimistic about Ethereum's optimistic rollups - Blockworks",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s layer-2 ecosystems are growing.\n\nTo date, nearly 30 different layer-2, or L2, networks have deployed on Ethereum. Recent entrants include Mantle Network and Consensys\u2019 Linea. Projects like Scroll, Taiko and Honeypot are geared up to enter the game.\n\nThese second-layer protocols are intended to help scale the network by shifting some of the computational processes off Ethereum itself. For users, this means cheaper and faster transactions compared to how they might proceed on the mainnet.\n\nL2 networks have, over time, become economies of their own, collecting billions of dollars worth of digital assets in locked-up deposits along the way.\n\nToday\u2019s crop of L2 networks chiefly break down into two categories: optimistic rollups and zero-knowledge (ZK) rollups.\n\nOptimistic rollups move user transactions off-chain and then post the data back to Ethereum as \u201ccalldata.\u201d Zero-knowledge rollups, on the other hand, also post their transactions off-chain, but they can validate that it is accurate without revealing the information inside.\n\nOf those building optimistic rollups, prominent players in the game are Arbitrum, Optimism, Base and Mantle. The first two, Arbitrum and Optimism, have amassed nearly $9 billion in total value locked (TVL) between the two protocols.\n\nToday\u2019s zkSync-centric rollups include Polygon zkEVM, Starknet, Scroll and Linea.\n\nSo optimistic\n\nToday, optimistic rollups are the dominant protocols in the L2 space, according to data from L2BEAT, an information portal for the ecosystem.\n\nArbitrum currently possesses the highest market share, with a TVL of $5.82 billion.\n\nArbitrum developer Offchain Labs is still exploring ways for the protocol to become a stage-3 optimistic rollup, according to co-founder and Chief Technology Officer Harry Kalodner. Under that framework, the rollup would be completely run via smart contracts.\n\n\u201cI firmly believe that ZK rollups are much more complicated than optimistic rollups, and the amount of people who actually understand the tech is very tiny,\u201d Kalodner said.\n\nIn conversation, Kalodner noted that L2 growth often involves a trade-off between permissionless and accessibility of the technology.\n\n\u201cWe want to see everybody who wants to have an Arbitrum chain, have an Arbitrum chain, and we\u2019re balancing that with the competitive realities of the market and being the technical leader,\u201d Kalodner said.\n\nOptimism is the second-biggest rollup, with a TVL of $2.42 billion. Unlike Arbitrum, Optimism\u2019s source code is completely open-source, meaning that anyone can use the code to build their own L2.\n\nOf those, Base Protocol, Coinbase\u2019s decentralized L2 network, has most prominently used the Optimism stack to help build out its so-called superchain vision.\n\nJesse Pollak, head of protocols at Coinbase, believes that on-chain computation will compete directly with the likes of Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud over the next decade. In his view, future apps will be able to run their own infrastructure at a much higher rate.\n\n\u201cThe mental model I have for this is you can think of Base and OP mainnet as a shared compute model where you\u2019re in the same compute environment, then certain apps will scale out of the compute environment\u2026they\u2019re going to be app chains or L3s,\u201d he said.\n\nPollak notes that Base is focused on maximizing decentralization and security for as cheap as possible.\n\n\u201cThe strategy for us is to create an open source code base, that\u2019s standardized, configurable, modular, creates decentralized governance and funding infrastructure that attracts developers and makes them feel like they\u2019re part of something bigger than themselves,\u201d Pollak said.\n\nPollak added: \u201cThis way we have a bottoms-up groundswell of technology that even if it looks a little bit chaotic in the beginning, and maybe a bit slower. In the long run, it ends up being way faster and way bigger.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "How To Check An Ethereum Transaction: A Comprehensive Guide\n\n\n\nNavigating the world of blockchain can be challenging, especially when you\u2019re trying to keep track of your transactions.\n\nIn this guide, we\u2019ll explain how to check an Ethereum transaction by walking you through the process step-by-step.\n\nWe\u2019ll also answer common questions like \u201cHow do I track an Ethereum address?\u201d, \u201cHow do I check my crypto transaction?\u201d, and \u201cHow long does an Ethereum transaction take?\u201d.\n\nAlso read: Investor Poll Shows 47% Confidence in Ethereum\u2019s Rise Above Bitcoin\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum Transactions\n\nBefore we delve into how to check an Ethereum transaction, it\u2019s essential to grasp what Ethereum transactions are.\n\nEthereum is a decentralized platform that permits users to conduct transactions with digital assets.\n\nEach Ethereum transaction is recorded on the blockchain network, providing transparency and public accessibility. Validators or miners on the network verify these transactions, making Ethereum a truly decentralized system.\n\nYou initiate a transaction when you send Ether (ETH) from one address to another. This transaction is then broadcast to the Ethereum network, where it is checked and verified.\n\nOnce the transaction gets a confirmation, it is added to a new block and permanently recorded on the blockchain.\n\nHow Ethereum Transactions Work\n\nEthereum transactions function through a series of steps:\n\nAn external account initiates a transaction, such as sending ETH to another user. The transaction request is broadcast to the Ethereum network. Validators on the network execute the transaction and propagate the change to the entire network. A transaction fee is deducted during the validation process. The validated transaction is included in a block.\n\nThere are different types of transactions on the Ethereum network, including regular transactions (from one account to another), contract-execution transactions (interactions with deployed smart contracts), and contract-deployment transactions (deploying the code of a smart contract).\n\nAlso read: Ethereum: Users Holding 1000+ ETH, Drops to 5-Year Low\n\nTracking an Ethereum Transaction: A Step-by-Step Guide\n\nNow that we\u2019ve covered the basics, let\u2019s dive into the steps on how to check an Ethereum transaction:\n\nStep 1: Acquiring the Transaction Hash\n\nYour journey to tracking your Ethereum transaction starts with obtaining the transaction hash. This unique identifier is given to every transaction on the Ethereum network. You can find this hash in the history or activity section of the crypto wallet or exchange platform you used to conduct the transaction.\n\nStep 2: Using an Ethereum Blockchain Explorer\n\nWith your transaction hash at hand, the next step is to visit an Ethereum blockchain explorer. These are online tools that allow you to view information about transactions, blocks, and addresses on the Ethereum blockchain. Some popular Ethereum blockchain explorers include Etherscan and Etherchain.\n\nStep 3: Input the Transaction Hash\n\nOn the blockchain explorer website, you\u2019ll find a search field. Paste the transaction hash you obtained in Step 1 into this field and initiate the search. The explorer will then retrieve and display the transaction details.\n\nStep 4: Review the Transaction Details\n\nOnce you input the transaction hash, the transaction details will display. This information includes the sender and recipient addresses, the transaction amount, the gas fee paid, and the transaction\u2019s current status. You can use these details to verify if the transaction was successful.\n\nBesides blockchain explorers, several tools can help you monitor your Ethereum transactions. These tools provide real-time updates and additional features for your transactions. Some popular options include:\n\nMetamask: Metamask is a renowned Ethereum wallet and browser extension that lets you manage your Ether and interact with decentralized applications. It also provides a transaction history and notifications for your transactions.\n\nMetamask is a renowned Ethereum wallet and browser extension that lets you manage your Ether and interact with decentralized applications.

Typically, Ethereum transactions can take anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes. However, during periods of high network activity, your transaction might take longer to process.\n\nConclusion: How To Check An Ethereum Transaction?\n\nIn conclusion, checking an Ethereum transaction involves using a hash and a blockchain explorer to review the details of the transaction.\n\nBlockchain explorers like Etherscan offer transparency and enable users to track their transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nAlso, tools like Metamask, MyEtherWallet, and the Etherscan Mobile App provide convenient ways to manage and monitor your Ethereum transactions.\n\nBy understanding and utilizing these tools, you can ensure smooth and successful transactions on the Ethereum network."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nDecentralized ID platform Worldcoin releases its native token.\n\nProtocol provides digital passports tied to a physical iris scan.\n\nWeb3 divided over pros and cons.\n\nDecentralized identity platform Worldcoin launched its ecosystem token, grabbing headlines as opinions remain divided about the potential positives and negatives of the blockchain-based digital passport project.\n\nMajor cryptocurrency exchanges including Binance and Crypto.com announced support for the WLD token upon its launch. The token is tied to the Worldcoin ecosystem, which users receive upon creation of a privacy-preserving digital identity (World ID).\n\nIn order to create a World ID, users have to have their biometric data captured. This is taken in the form of an iris scan carried out by Worldcoin\u2019s proprietary, high-tech optic Orb hardware.\n\nThe long term vision of the project would see Orb\u2019s being built and distributed around the world, allowing users to create their own World ID\u2019s which can be used for a myriad of use cases.\n\nWorld ID\u2019s act as a \u201cproof of personhood\u201d that make use of zero-knowledge proofs (ZK-proofs) to protect the underlying data, including biometric, KYC and AML data. WorldCoin will also enable users to \u201creserve\u201d their respective IDs with a phone number in select countries, with an iris scan required to complete the process and receive a World ID.\n\nThe concept of proof of personhood is not new to the blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystem, as Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin addressed at length in a thought-provoking essay centered around the use case.\n\nWhat do I think about biometric proof of personhood?https://t.co/yozo1buW24 \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) July 24, 2023\n\nUnpacking Worldcoin\n\nButerin delves into the technicalities of proof of personhood blockchain protocols and the potential benefits and pitfalls of projects that are blazing a trail for the use case.\n\nThe Ethereum co-founder highlighted two key focal points of proof of personhood protocols, namely proving human identity and potential being a means to distribute universal basic income in the future.\n\n\u201cWorldcoin is unique in that it relies on highly sophisticated biometrics, scanning each user\u2019s iris using a piece of specialized hardware called \u201cthe Orb\u201d.\u201d\n\nAs Buterin explains, WorldCoin Orbs are set to be distributed around the world to allow users to create their respective digital ID. He also highlighted privacy and security concerns around the Orb, design issues regarding its native token and some ethical concerns around whether biometrics \u201care a good ideal at all\u201d.\n\nThe protocol was originally deployed on Polygon in its beta phase, while the current version runs on the Ethereum mainnet using a scalable batching architecture through layer 2 protocol Optimism. The project has over two millions users enrolled.\n\nSocioeconomic Considerations\n\nAs Buterin continues to explain, Worldcoin aims to produce Orbs to be widely distributed around the world in public spaces that will make digital IDs accessible for anyone to get.\n\nButeriun crediting Worldcoin for committing to decentralizing through a variety of technical aspects , including its architecture as a layer on Ethereum using Optimism\u2019s scaling SDK. Worldcoin also makes use of privacy centric zero-knowledge proofs, which allow a person to prove ownership of a credential without revealing any of the underlying data.\n\nNevertheless, efforts to ensure decentralization do not detract from criticisms against the protocol which Buterin highlighted, including privacy and security concerns around the Orb, issues with its WLD tokens and ethical issues relating to company decisions.\n\nButerin opined that broader considerations around biometrics and proof of personhood projects are \u201ca good idea at all\u201d:\n\n\u201cRisks include unavoidable privacy leaks, further erosion of people\u2019s ability to navigate the internet anonymously, coercion by authoritarian governments, and the potential impossibility of being secure at the same time as being decentralized.\u201d\n\nFour Major Risks\n\nButerin\u2019s essay outlines four major risks that come to mind when considering Worldcoin\u2019s approach to proof of personhood.\n\nThe first is privacy and whether the registry that contains human iris scans may reveal information:\n\n\u201cAt the very least, if someone else scans your iris, they can check it against the database to determine whether or not you have a World ID. Potentially, iris scans might reveal more information.\u201d\n\nWorld IDs are not easily accessible and may not be reliably accessible around the world unless the hardware is mass produced and easily accessible.\n\nButerin highlights centralization as another risk, considering that the Orb is a hardware device which leaves users with no way of verifying that it was built properly and doesn\u2019t have \u201cbackdoors\u201d:\n\n\u201cHence, even if the software layer is perfect and fully decentralized, the Worldcoin Foundation still has the ability to insert a backdoor into the system, letting it create arbitrarily many fake human identities.\u201d\n\nSecurity is the fourth risk, with Buterin pointing to scenarios like mobile device hacks or social engineering schemes:\n\n\u201cUsers could be coerced into scanning their irises while showing a public key that belongs to someone else, and there is the possibility of 3D-printing \u201cfake people\u201d that can pass the iris scan and get World IDs.\u201d\n\nButerin also joked that despite the \u201cdystopian vibez\u201d of staring into an Orb to scan your eyeballs, the specialized hardware systems \u201ccan do quite a decent job of protecting privacy\u201d. However this comes with the caveat of the centralization required to produce and manage the hardware.\n\nSecurity Issues of Proof of Personhood\n\nAs a gauge of where the proof of personhood ecosystem is at, Buterin also provides a handful of concerns that affect projects of similar designs.\n\nThis included the possibility of 3D-printed fake people, where a user could use AI to generate photographs or even 3D prints of fake people that are convincing enough to get accepted by the Orb software.\n\n\u201cIf even one group does this, they can generate an unlimited number of identities.\u201d\n\nButerin also suggested the possibility of selling IDs, where one user provides someone else\u2019s public key instead of their own when registering, giving that person control of their registered ID, in exchange for money.\n\n\u201cThis seems to be happening already. In addition to selling, there\u2019s also the possibility of renting IDs to use for a short time in one application.\u201d\n\nPhone hacking is another risk, giving an attacker full control of a users World ID. Lastly Butering also says there\u2019s a risk of a government forcing citizens to get verified while showing a QR code belonging to the government.\n\n\u201cIn this way, a malicious government could gain access to millions of IDs. In a biometric system, this could even be done covertly: governments could use obfuscated Orbs to extract World IDs from everyone entering their country at the passport control booth.\u201d\n\nWhile some of these dystopian risks sound far-fetched, Buterin believes they are points that have to be carefully considered as the drive to create proof of personhood protocols that are beneficial, secure and privacy-preserving"

        "title": "Ethereum Name Service (ENS): The Decentralized Domain System - Crypto Times",
        "content": "In the rapidly evolving landscape of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, navigating through complex hexadecimal wallet addresses has been a major challenge for users. However, the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) emerges as a beacon of convenience and user-friendliness, revolutionizing the way we interact with blockchain networks. ENS is a decentralized naming system that simplifies cumbersome wallet addresses, replacing them with human-readable names.\n\nIn addition to exploring the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), readers can also discover the convenience of Ethereum Code, an automated bot that streamlines various processes within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nWhat is Ethereum Name Service (ENS)?\n\nThe Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a decentralized domain naming system built on the Ethereum blockchain. Similar to the traditional Domain Name System (DNS) used for mapping website domain names to IP addresses, ENS provides the same functionality but for blockchain addresses. It enables users to associate human-readable names with complex Ethereum addresses, making transactions and interactions more user-friendly and accessible.\n\nHow Ethereum Name Service (ENS) Works\n\nThe Ethereum Name Service (ENS) operates through a well-defined architecture consisting of three main components: the Registrar, Resolver, and Registry. These components work together to provide a seamless and efficient naming system on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nAt the core of ENS is the Registrar, which acts as the gateway for registering names. Users can go through a simple and straightforward process to secure a name of their choice on the ENS. This involves submitting a bid for the desired name, followed by a reveal phase to prevent front-running. Once the name is successfully registered, the user becomes the owner and gains control over it.\n\nThe Resolver component plays a crucial role in the ENS ecosystem by mapping names to the corresponding Ethereum addresses. When someone wants to interact with an ENS name, the Resolver provides the necessary information to locate the associated address. This allows users to send transactions, interact with smart contracts, and access decentralized applications using user-friendly names rather than complex hexadecimal addresses.\n\nLastly, the Registry serves as the decentralized database that stores and maintains the records of registered names and their ownership. It ensures the integrity and security of the ENS by recording ownership information on the Ethereum blockchain, making it tamper-proof and transparent.\n\nTo register a name on the ENS, users need to interact with the Registrar, following the specified process and meeting the required criteria. Once registered, users can manage their ENS names, making updates or transferring ownership as needed. The ENS management interface provides a user-friendly platform to perform these actions, empowering individuals and organizations to have full control over their digital identities on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe Ethereum Name Service simplifies the user experience by enabling human-readable and memorable names for blockchain addresses. It eliminates the need to rely on long and complicated hexadecimal addresses, making it easier for individuals and businesses to interact with the Ethereum network.\n\nBenefits and Use Cases of Ethereum Name Service\n\nOne of the primary benefits of ENS is its ability to simplify the user experience. Traditionally, interacting with blockchain addresses required users to deal with long and complex hexadecimal addresses, which can be prone to human error. With ENS, users can associate their addresses with human-readable and memorable domain names. This makes it much easier to share addresses, receive payments, and engage in transactions, especially for non-technical users.\n\nENS also provides a solution for secure and immutable identity management on the blockchain. By linking verified identities to ENS names, users can establish trust and authenticity in their online interactions. This is particularly valuable in situations where identity verification is crucial, such as in financial transactions, decentralized marketplaces, or social platforms.\n\nDecentralized websites are another compelling use case for ENS. With ENS, domain names can point to decentralized content hosted on platforms like IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) or other decentralized storage networks. This enables the creation of censorship-resistant websites, where content cannot be easily removed or tampered with by centralized authorities. ENS-powered decentralized websites foster a more open and inclusive internet, giving individuals the power to publish and share information without relying on centralized entities.\n\nFurthermore, ENS plays a vital role in enabling decentralized applications (DApps) to deliver a more user-friendly experience. By integrating ENS, DApps can offer simplified interfaces that allow users to interact with the blockchain using familiar domain names instead of complex addresses. This not only enhances usability but also reduces the barrier to entry for non-technical users who may be intimidated by the technical intricacies of blockchain transactions.\n\nAdditionally, ENS has practical applications in the field of decentralized finance (DeFi). DeFi protocols often rely on Ethereum addresses for various operations, such as lending, borrowing, or yield farming. By utilizing ENS, DeFi platforms can enhance the user experience by enabling users to interact with their services using human-readable names. This simplifies the process of interacting with DeFi protocols, potentially attracting a broader audience and driving further adoption in the DeFi space.\n\nUnderstanding ENS Integration: How to Use Ethereum Name Service?\n\nIntegrating ENS into your Ethereum wallet or application is a straightforward process. Most modern wallets and dApps are ENS-compatible by default, allowing users to leverage the service effortlessly. Here\u2019s a simple guide to get started:\n\nSet Up an Ethereum Wallet: If you don\u2019t already have an Ethereum wallet, choose a reputable one that supports ENS integration. MetaMask and MyEtherWallet are popular choices. Check ENS Availability: Before registering a domain, check if the desired name is available using ENS domain search tools. Register Your Domain: Once you find an available domain, use the ENS Registrar to register it under your Ethereum address. Link Your Address: After registration, associate your Ethereum address with the newly acquired domain. Update ENS Records: If you ever need to change your Ethereum address or transfer ownership, update the ENS records accordingly.\n\nConclusion\n\nWith its user-friendly approach, ENS simplifies address interactions, provides secure and immutable identities, facilitates decentralized websites, and enhances the usability of decentralized applications. As blockchain adoption continues to grow, ENS plays a vital role in bridging the gap between complex blockchain addresses and mainstream usability, making Ethereum more accessible and inclusive for all."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Charts Signals 18% Upside; Liquid Staking Hits ATH in 2023 - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum price bulls are doing everything within their power to mitigate losses after support at $1,900 caved in. The token powering the largest smart contracts token has in the last 24 hours, remained barely unchanged, and trading at $1,870. Despite the narrowing trading range, a $6.5 billion trading volume has been posted, with the market cap dropping slightly to $224 billion.\n\nEthereum Price Charts Show 18% Bullish Move\n\nEthereum price has formed an inverse head-and-shoulders (H&S) on the daily chart, with the possibility of an 18% breakout to $2,372.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAs a technical chart pattern, the inverse H&S presents a bullish signal to Ethereum traders. It\u2019s born via three troughs, with the middle one deepest \u2013 the \u2018head\u2019, and the \u2018shoulders\u2019 flanking shallower.\n\nA bullish move would be confirmed when this \u2018neckline\u2019 breaks, investors often anticipate an upward price swing, equal to the height of the pattern extrapolated above the breakout point, $2,000 in Ethereum\u2019s case.\n\nThe path with the least resistance is to the downside for now with greater risk lurking in the shadows if bulls lose the support provided by the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (in red).\n\nWhile those declines may bounce off the 100-day EMA (in blue), the current technical picture suggests that overhead pressure may soar in the coming days.\n\nNotably, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) adds credence to the bearish outlook after sending a sell signal. Ethereum\u2019s drop below $1,900 might have accentuated the call to sell, which manifested with the MACD line in blue crossing below the signal line in red.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) reinforces the bearish outlook as it slides below the midline.\n\nWith that in mind, shorts traders would be looking forward to lower profit targets, for instance, the 200-day EMA (purple) and the primary support between $1,630 and $1,700.\n\nEthereum Staking Stays Attractive\n\nInvestors have in recent months wholesomely embraced Ethereum staking both on the primary blockchain and liquid staking platforms. According to on-chain insights shared by Token Terminal Intern on Twitter, \u201ctotal assets through liquid staking protocols are hitting ATH, despite Ethereum bringing -61% from the top.\u201d\n\nEthereum staking eventually started to gain traction after the initial withdrawals which followed the Shapella Upgrade. Liquid staking platforms like Lido continue their dominance following the protocol upgrade that allowed investors to withdraw their staked Ether for the first time since the transition to the PoS consensus algorithm.\n\nThe increase in staking implies that investors are optimistic about the future of Ethereum and are willing to HODL the token with the hope of a rally back to the ATH. Staking also contributes to reducing Ethereum\u2019s supply on exchanges, which has been shrinking significantly. If demand for Ethereum rises, we are likely to witness a breakout above $30,000."

        "content": "Buy and sell Bitcoin the easy way Start your crypto portfolio today! Get started\n\nEthereum (ETH) is one of the largest blockchains in the world, so investors naturally consider it one of the best investments in the market. Its recent performance has been strong, but investors believe VC Spectra (SPCT) can become a strong challenger to Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) dominance.\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT) has already raised $2.4 million in its private sale, showing strong signs of what\u2019s to come. So, are investors accurate in their predictions about VC Spectra (SPCT)? Let\u2019s find out.\n\n>>BUY SPCT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT): A Viable Challenger To Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) (ETH) Dominance?\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT) is poised to become a top token in 2023 because it caters to the deep-seated desires of investors. The platform is perfectly suited to creating investment opportunities for users in new sectors of the crypto industry. With VC Spectra (SPCT), the fear of missing out on new projects with strong potential is non-existent.\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT) bears the burden of analyzing new startups and investment opportunities to find the most secure and profitable. The platform combines the expertise of experienced venture capitalists alongside modern risk management strategies, which help identify reliable opportunities.\n\nAs for benefits, VC Spectra (SPCT) users earn interest from the platform\u2019s investments through buybacks and dividends. Users also enjoy access to exclusive projects in the seed and presale phases. Holding the VC Spectra (SPCT) token will also grant investors voting rights.\n\nThe SPCT token is considered valuable because of its several uses. Its overall design is also eye-catching. The VC Spectra (SPCT) token is built on the Bitcoin blockchain but is also available on Ethereum (ETH). Being a deflationary token, it employs a burn mechanism to reduce token supply and increase value.\n\nThe market is already abuzz over the recent 37.5% increase in VC Spectra\u2019s (SPCT) price. It rose from $0.008 to $0.011. Now in Stage 2 of its public presale, VC Spectra (SPCT) is expected to rise by 121.27%, reaching $0.025 by the next stage.\n\n>>BUY SPCT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nEthereum (ETH) Remains on A Strong Rally Since Q1 2023 Despite Regulatory Challenges\n\nEthereum (ETH) was trading at $1,420 by mid-March after a relatively slow movement in the year\u2019s first quarter. On March 20, Ethereum (ETH) jumped by 23%, reaching $1,760. On May 17, Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) bullish momentum skyrocketed, taking its price to $2,120 \u2013 a further 20.4% increase. Admittedly, Ethereum (ETH) was a bit overpriced then, so the 11.9% correction that took it back to $1,866 two weeks later didn\u2019t shock anyone.\n\nEthereum (ETH) then dropped sharply in mid-June. It fell by 10.7%, reaching $1,665 on June 16. It then picked up its bullish, rising by $14% to reach $1899 on June 22. At the time of this writing, Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $1,886.\n\nSome investors expect Ethereum (ETH) to grow by 6.04%, reaching the $2,000 mark once its regulatory issues clear up. However, bearish investors predict a 20% decline taking ETH to $1,500. These bearish investors say Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) decline will be due to skyrocketing gas fees. It is also worth noting that Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) gas fees have been on the rise in recent times.\n\nLearn more about the VC Spectra (SPCT) presale:\n\nBuy Presale: https://invest.vcspectra.io/login\n\nWebsite: https://vcspectra.io\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/VCSpectra\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/spectravcfund\n\nDisclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the author should not be considered as financial advice.

        "title": "Ether death cross threatens more downside as ETH price trades at a key support level - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ether\u2019s price fell this week, and several data points are beginning to suggest that further downside could be in store.\n\nOn July 24, Ether (ETH) experienced a drop close to its monthly low, reaching $1,825 amid Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) negative price action, as uncertainty loomed over macroeconomic conditions and a potential whale sell-off.\n\nSeveral on-chain and technical indicators point to further downside in ETH prices. However, the extent of this downward movement could be limited, considering the profit levels of existing holders and the decrease in ETH\u2019s liquid supply.\n\nETH on-chain analysis suggests more downside\n\nSince the beginning of 2023, Ethereum\u2019s network value-to-transaction value (NVT) metric has indicated that the asset may have been overpriced.\n\nGlassnode\u2019s NVT signal gauges the relative value of the Ethereum network by comparing the market price to the volume of on-chain transactions. A higher NVT reading implies that ETH could be trading at a premium.\n\nThe NVT chart from Glassnode reveals that the metric typically fluctuates between 30 and 80. However, at the start of 2023, it surged to three-year highs of 120 and has maintained higher levels since then. This suggests that either a pullback in price or an increase in Ethereum\u2019s on-chain activity would be necessary to trigger a reset in this metric.\n\nEthereum NVT signal. Source: Glassnode\n\nNevertheless, the profit levels of short- and long-term holders suggest that the downturn could be restricted.\n\nEther\u2019s negative price action usually reverses when the net unrealized profit/loss (NUPL) metric of short-term holders is negative, meaning short-term holders are in losses. It causes some weak hands to panic sell, allowing buyers to scoop up coins at a cheaper price.\n\nCurrently, the short-term NUPL ratio is close to neutral levels. However, there\u2019s room for some downside based on historic levels.\n\nEther\u2019s net unrealized profit/loss metric for short-term holders. Source: Glassnode\n\nThe realized profit/loss metric, which evaluates the relative profitability of ETH transfers, paints a similar picture. On-chain analytics firm Santiment wrote in its latest analysis that \u201cthe ratio of on-chain transaction volume in profit to loss is still favoring profit takes,\u201d but not by much.\n\nSantiment analyst Brian Quinlivan added:\n\n\u201cIf ETH drops a bit more from here and threatens the $1,700-$1,800 level again, panic sells would come pouring in to justify the buys.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the NUPL ratio of long-term holders is also ranging near 2019 and early 2020 peak levels, suggesting that a pullback is likely.\n\nEther\u2019s NUPL metric for long-term holders. Source: Glassnode\n\nThe ETH supply on exchanges has dropped drastically since the Shapella upgrade in April. At the same time, the amount staked for validation of the proof-of-stake network has increased. The locked ETH in staking contracts decreased its liquid supply on exchanges, which is more susceptible to selling than staked ETH.\n\nETH\u2019s realized price, which represents the fair value of the token based on the daily value moved on-chain, is currently at $1,507. In 2022, ETH quickly recovered below the realized price metric as the profit levels of long-term holders dropped into negative territory.\n\nThe on-chain metrics show that the price could suffer some selling pressure from short-term holders and panic selling from investors spooked by relatively lower levels of activity in 2023.\n\nNevertheless, the profit levels of short- and long-term holders suggest that the slump may not stretch far enough and the price could find support above the $1,500 level.\n\nRelated: Crypto investors cool on Bitcoin funds, turning to Ether and XRP\n\nETH/USD price analysis\n\nTechnically, the ETH/USD pair shows bearish risk in the short term with an impending death cross on the weekly scale.\n\nEther has witnessed only one death cross between the 50- and 200-period moving averages (MAs) on a weekly scale in the past in June 2019, after which its price dropped 60%.\n\nETH/USD weekly price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nOn the daily chart, the ETH/USD pair threatens a fall toward the 200-day MA at $1,761, which also coincides with the lower highs from November 2022.\n\nETH/USD daily charts. Source: TradingView\n\nThe derivatives data for ETH indicates that there has been no significant change in the open interest volume for futures contracts, which reflects the demand for these contracts. This suggests that traders are currently not showing much interest in the recent lackluster price action.\n\nLooking at the options data from Deribit reveals that contracts worth $1.1 billion are set to expire on July 28. The positioning in the options market indicates a bullish bias, with a notable concentration of call options between $1,900 and $2,400.\n\nAs the expiration date approaches, it is likely that the price will remain subdued around the maximum pain level for options buyers, which is at $1,850.\n\nBased on the on-chain and market indicators, it appears that Ether\u2019s negative selling pressure could persist for a couple of weeks. However, there is potential for a strong influx of buyers, particularly at support levels of $1,700 and $1,500.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe team behind the NFT-driven game franchise Aurory announced today that it is expanding beyond the Solana blockchain, adding cross-chain support for Aurory NFTs and its AURY token with the Ethereum scaling network, Arbitrum.\n\nWhile Aurory is not the first Solana-native NFT or game project to embrace other chains, this particular move is being branded as an expansion rather than a migration.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not leaving Solana necessarily,\u201d Aurory Executive Producer Jonathan Campeau told Decrypt ahead of the official Arbitrum announcement. \u201cFor us, really, we need to branch out a little bit in terms of from a pure business point of view.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAurory\u2019s SyncSpace tech will allow users to move their assets between Solana and Arbitrum and into the games.\n\nBecause Solana is not an Ethereum Virtual Machine-native or Ethereum-compatible chain, it typically means users have to create a new wallet via options like Phantom or Solflare, which can add friction to the user experience for those only familiar with the Ethereum ecosystem and wallets like MetaMask. Aurory also offers users the option to sign into their game accounts with just an email address, and connect a crypto wallet at a later time.\n\n\u201cWe just want to open more doors for players, because we understand that Solana has a specific audience,\u201d Campeau said. \u201cArbitrum developed their own culture, their own audience as well.\u201d\n\nAlthough SyncSpace effectively works like a bridge between blockchains and into the company's games, Aurory Head of Marketing and Business Development Michael Natoli told Decrypt that the goal isn't primarily to let NFT and token holders move from one chain to another\u2014it's to create new kinds of on-ramps into the game, to tap into other crypto communities and their own liquidity.\n\nNatoli added that if a Solana NFT is moved over to Arbitrum, the original NFT will be held within SyncSpace and can eventually be moved back from Arbitrum to Solana at some point. The on-ramps will let players bring Aurory NFTs and USDC stablecoins into the game via either chain, and then USDC can be swapped for the game's AURY token for use in Aurory.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nUltimately, Aurory NFT items on Solana or Arbitrum will act the same inside the games.\n\n\"There is no 'upside' of moving them from one chain to the other, aside from people now having the option to withdraw their Aurory assets on the chain that they prefer between the two,\" said Natoli. \"We ultimately want to expand our community and bring the Aurory experience to another growing and committed Web3 ecosystem in Arbitrum.\"\n\nThere could be functional in-game benefits to exploring the chains, however. Adding support for more blockchains could open up avenues for new experiences with non-playable characters (NPCs), Campeau suggested, which could be tied to specific chains to encourage cross-chain exploration.\n\n\u201cYou could definitely see an NPC, particularly in the game, really heavily in crypto or really heavily on Solana, and be able to trade with them or to do quest items,\u201d Campeau shared. \u201cHe\u2019s only going to be asking for items that will be on the Solana blockchain for you to move forward, for example.\u201d\n\nAurory has two games currently in development. One is Aurory Adventures, the player-versus-environment (PvE) role-playing game (RPG). The other is Aurory Tactics, a player-versus-player (PvP) battle arena game.\n\nAurory offers playable character NFTs called Aurorians, as well as Pokemon-like animal NFTs called Nefties. The game also has character skins and Neftie eggs on-chain as NFTs, and has one on-chain token, AURY. In 2021, Aurory collaborated with esports organization TSM and the now-shuttered crypto exchange FTX on limited edition NFTs.\n\nArbitrum marks the first step out of the Solana ecosystem for Aurory, but it may not be the last.\n\n\u201cIn the future, it\u2019s not unrealistic for us to start looking at Polygon, to start looking at Avalanche,\u201d Campeau said. \u201cBNB is another one that we\u2019ve been looking into.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "As Sreeram Kannan describes it, EigenLayer is a \u201cmarketplace for raw, decentralized trust\u201d \u2014 the fundamental resource at the heart of blockchain technology.\n\nEthereum has already created such a marketplace and acts as the \u201cnatural source\u201d for the \u201craw material,\u201d Kannan says, but it has limitations. \u201cI can only consume it if I write a smart contract on top of this platform.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor many reasons, I may want to access more raw, decentralized trust,\u201d he explains. To do this, one would normally need to create \u201ca whole new network of nodes as well as a staking token of value.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were forced to actually think about, do we want to start a whole new layer-1 with its own economics underpinning it?\u201d\n\nSpeaking to Blockworks on the Bell Curve podcast (Spotify/Apple), the CEO and founder delves into details of the smart contract middleware and what he foresees as EigenLayer\u2019s \u201cendgame.\u201d\n\nAnatomy of EigenLayer\n\nEigenLayer is not a new chain or a new layer-1, Kannan explains. Instead, it is a system of smart contracts that allow ETH stakers to \u201copt in\u201d to serve other systems, called \u201cactively validated services.\u201d\n\nAny protocol that needs nodes to talk to each other and come to consensus can be built as an actively validated service, Kannan says. Such a service would \u201ctalk to the EigenLayer contracts,\u201d he says, specifying who can register, payment structure, slashing conditions and other selected parameters.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re claiming that you\u2019re storing data relative to this hash,\u201d for example, \u201cI may ask you randomly to reveal portions of the data on the Ethereum chain and if you don\u2019t, then you may lose your ETH,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re working with the raw aspect of decentralized trust and you can allow people to build arbitrary protocols on top.\u201d\n\nKannan envisions a crypto world that operates similarly to modern web application development. \u201cYou have AWS, which is the cloud,\u201d he says, \u201con top of which, there are a lot of SaaS services,\u201d for functions such as authorization, payment, and databases.\n\nSaaS, or software-as-a-service, apps in the Web2 world allow for \u201copen innovation,\u201d he says. Anyone can be \u201chyper-focused and specialized in creating a certain utility\u201d instead of needing to build out a \u201cwhole new world\u201d from scratch.\n\n\u201cWe all become more specialized in what we create and more general in what we consume.\u201d\n\nKannan points out that any given Web2 application might integrate 15 or more SaaS solutions. Crypto applications reflect a similar need for a range of services, he says, from trusted execution environments to private messaging, data storage and availability, oracles and bridges, guardian networks, and so forth.\n\n\u201cYou can dream up whatever you want and build on top of it,\u201d he says. \u201cOpen innovation is our core value.\u201d\n\nEigenLayer\u2019s endgame\n\nWith the focus on decentralization, Kannan says \u201cprotocols should minimize subjective decisions.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf protocols are not expressing subjective decisions \u2014 and there are definitely subjective decisions to be made \u2014 then who expresses these subjective decisions?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want to be as close as possible to the Ethereum staking layer,\u201d he says. Ideally, Kannan says EigenLayer would become part of Ethereum\u2019s staking layer, whether through a protocol upgrade or an Ethereum improvement protocol, or EIP.\n\nWhile the platform is currently undergoing an \u201cinitial shepherding process\u201d with whitelisting for \u201ccautionary\u201d purposes, he says, it will eventually be a completely permissionless platform.\n\n\u201cOur platform minimizes its own subjectivity. We are not going to be playing this role of deciding, is this good or not good? It is up to the market to figure that out,\u201d Kannan says.\n\n\u201cOpen innovation is best built on top of a credibly neutral layer. This is why we like Ethereum, and this is why we want ourselves to be as similar as possible to Ethereum and even at one point, dissolve into Ethereum itself.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin Discusses Worldcoin Risks And Issues - CoinGape",
        "content": "Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, has expressed his opinions on Worldcoin\u2019s biometric identity verification mechanism. Buterin claimed that personality-proof systems raise concerns about privacy and security but that they are still necessary and that continued development of these systems may take years. He pointed out that Worldcoin is distinctive in that it uses highly advanced biometrics to scan each user\u2019s iris using specialized gear known as \u201cthe Orb.\u201d\n\nThe Risks And Issues With Worldcoin (WLD)\n\nButerin noted that Worldcoin\u2019s guiding idea is simple, that is AI will benefit humanity much in terms of abundance and wealth, but it can also lead to the loss of many jobs and make it almost impossible to tell the difference between a human and a robot.\n\nadvertisement\n\nTherefore, he highlighted that the gap must be addressed by creating a highly effective system for personality evidence that enables people to show their actual humanity and by offering a UBI to everyone. Using specialized hardware known as the \u201cOrb\u201d to scan each user\u2019s iris, Worldcoin\u2019s dependence on cutting-edge biometric technology sets it apart from other cryptocurrencies.\n\nHowever, Worldcoin has drawn criticism, for its \u201ccoin\u201d\u2018s poor design, privacy, and security concerns around the Orb, and some of the company\u2019s business decisions, Butrin said. Some of the comments are very detailed, focusing on choices the project made that could have been made differently and that the Worldcoin project itself may be prepared to amend.\n\nOthers, however, question whether biometrics in general. They doubt that the eye-scanning biometrics of Worldcoin and the more straightforward face-video-uploads and verification games employed in Proof of Humanity and Idena are even smart ideas. Others criticize any evidence of personhood in general, the Ethereum founder noted.\n\nIn fact, due to these drawbacks, a few analysts have started to bad mouth Worldcoin and called the company fraud. Crypto analyst Dylan LeClair took to Twitter to inform its followers, not to buy Worldcoin or visit Orb. He asked the people to also stop sharing their biometrics data.\n\nAlso Read: What Is Worldcoin Token And Where Can You Buy It?\n\nOther Issues On Worldcoin (WLD) To Look Out For\n\nAccording to Vitalik, the registry of iris scans may provide information when it comes to privacy. If someone else scans your iris, they can at the very least verify it against the database to see if you have a World ID. Iris scans could perhaps give more details.\n\nRegarding accessibility, planet IDs won\u2019t be dependably accessible unless there are a sufficient number of Orbs that anybody on the planet can reach with ease.\n\nThe WLD token is up by more than 50% in the last day and holds a global market cap of $265 million. It is trading at $2.54 at the time of writing.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin (BTC) Price Remains Rangebound, Hold On Before Making the Next Move"

        "content": "Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal says that Solana (SOL) is likely to sustain its uptrend against its smart contract rival Ethereum (ETH).\n\nIn a new blog post, the former Goldman Sachs executive says that he\u2019s keeping a close watch on the Solana versus Ethereum (SOL/ETH) pair.\n\nAccording to Pal, he sees Solana outperforming Ethereum after the pair broke out from a descending channel.\n\n\u201cLastly, SOL is up over 30% on the month (+150% year-to-date!) and has broken the downtrend versus ETH. This is something that we\u2019ve been expecting for a while now and we think this trend will continue higher.\u201d\n\nSolana is trading for $23.25 at time of writing, down over 5% during the last 24 hours.\n\nIn a new strategy session, the macro guru says that he believes the broader crypto markets are likely to outperform other asset classes in the current cycle, citing wider global adoption and continued fiat currency debasement.\n\nPal also says that the approval of a spot-based Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) will likely push the crypto markets to greater heights.\n\n\u201c[Crypto] outperforms everything in this type of cycle. Like, technology, it is driven by the debasement of central banks, of the fiat currency market, particularly the world\u2019s reserve currency of the dollar, but all of them together really.\n\nAnd in addition, it\u2019s driven by the secular trend. The adoption trend of crypto is huge. It is now 421 million wallets. It keeps going up every single year. Even last year in a bear market, it grew 40%. So in the coming years, we will probably get that number up to a billion pretty fast.\n\nSo we\u2019ve got a huge change to come. The ongoing adoption. We\u2019ve got central bank digital currencies to come which is, whether you like it or not, still an adoption of blockchain technologies.\n\nWe also have payments rails and all of that kind of thing going on. Plus people are looking at tokenizing asset prices like bonds and stuff like that. So the financial world is moving onto blockchain, which is a core thesis of mine.\n\nIn addition to that, we have now the onramps for the average punter which is the ETF. I think ARK (Invest) gets the first one across on August 13th, 18th or whatever it is. That will open the floodgates. I think prices will be rising into that anyway, my forecast forwards to much higher prices anyway.\u201d\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Fidelity Backs Ethereum: Wall Street\u2019s Biggest Players Bet On Crypto\u2019s Number 2 - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Fidelity, a leading financial services provider, has recently released a report on Ethereum (ETH) that sheds light on some key metrics to watch for the cryptocurrency in the coming months.\n\nThe report highlights several important indicators, including the 50-day and 200-day moving averages (MA), the realized price, the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) ratio, Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Z-Score, percent in profit, and the Pi Cycle indicators, all of which can provide valuable insights into market sentiment and potential price movements.\n\nEthereum Holds Strong Above Key Support Levels\n\nPer the report, Ethereum has remained above key support levels, with the realized price serving as a strong support level since January 10th.\n\nAdditionally, the NUPL ratio suggests that Ethereum is currently in a neutral zone, while the MVRV Z-Score indicates that the cryptocurrency\u2019s market value is estimated to be just over the \u201cfair\u201d zone, potentially setting the stage for a bull run or at least sideways price action, according to Fidelity.\n\nAnother interesting metric highlighted in the report is the percent of unique addresses in profit, which currently sits at nearly 66%. While this metric has not touched the green zone since January 2020, it suggests that Ethereum owners may be using the cryptocurrency for trading, DeFi, staking, or buying other digital assets.\n\nFurthermore, the Pi Cycle indicators, which have historically been a good cycle top indicator, are showing that Ethereum is currently in a neutral zone. As the long-term moving average continues to follow the sunken price downward, it may be setting the stage for more volatility shortly.\n\nHowever, whether this volatility will be to the upside or downside remains to be seen and could depend on a variety of macro factors.\n\nETH Adoption On The Rise\n\nOn the other hand, Fidelity\u2019s report highlights that while monthly active addresses and the monthly transaction count have fallen by 1%, the number of monthly new Ethereum addresses has slowly increased by 9% in Q2 2023.\n\nNew addresses are defined as unique addresses that appeared for the first time in a transaction. This metric for momentum may not show direct network usage, but it does indicate a clearer picture of Ethereum adoption.\n\nThe short-term moving average of new addresses is shown to be rising back above that of the longer-term moving average, indicating that the rate of new users joining the network is increasing. New and existing projects are likely incentivizing new users and helping to drive this increase.\n\nAnother significant metric highlighted in the report is the net issuance of new supply issued by the network minus burned supply from transactions since The Merge.\n\nThis has driven a supply decrease for over five months now, with net issuance surpassing -700,000 Ether. The report notes that this is important because, in theory, as Ethereum\u2019s supply is destroyed, it raises the relative ownership level of all remaining token holders.\n\nAs of writing, ETH\u2019s price is at $1,849, which has decreased by 2% within the last 24 hours. Similar to Bitcoin\u2019s situation, Ethereum has also lost its 50-day MA, which is currently positioned at $1,869.\n\nIf the market continues to decline, ETH can anticipate several key support levels that may help prevent a further bearish trend.\n\nThe closest support level is situated at $1,840, followed by another support level of $1,792. However, the most crucial support floor is the 200-day MA, which is located at $1,780. This will be a significant factor in determining who will dominate in the upcoming months.\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Ethereum Whale Transfers To Exchanges Suggest More Selling Pressure For ETH - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Currently, the crypto market is under fire from bears, and coins like Ethereum (ETH) are already starting to feel the heat. Amid the struggle to recover, there have been massive inflows of ETH into centralized exchanges, which could spell further struggles for the digital asset going forward.\n\nEthereum Whales Move Millions To Centralized Exchanges\n\nMultiple reports from the on-chain whale tracking platform Whale Alert have shown that Ethereum whales could be exiting their positions in large volumes. The reports started on Saturday, July 22, when the first transaction was first picked up on the blockchain.\n\nIn the first transaction, Whale Alert shows that the whale had moved 15,000 ETH to Gate.io. And at the time, the transaction was worth around $28.28 million. However, this was only the first of many as the whale tracker would go on to report even larger movements to centralized exchanges.\n\nThe next was a transaction carrying 19,328 ETH worth $36.5 million at the time to Coinbase. Moving forward, the tracker also reported another transaction of 15,000 ETH ($28.1 million) being moved to the Gate.io crypto exchange once more.\n\nThe fourth transaction was one carrying 19,328 ETH valued at $36.12 million, transferred from another unknown wallet to Coinbase. And last but not least, a large ETH transaction carrying 12,000 ETH ($22.5 million) popped up in the early hours of Monday.\n\nETH price falls following large whale inflows to exchanges | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nWhat Do These Transactions Mean For ETH?\n\nThese movements by Ethereum whales could have negative implications for the price of ETH going forward. This is because when crypto investors send coins to exchanges, it is usually because they are looking to sell their coins and take advantage of the deep liquidity that centralized exchanges provide.\n\nIf this is the case and these whales begin to sell such large amounts of ETH in one go, then it could significantly impact the price of ETH. This could see the altcoin which is already struggling in the market fall even further as the selling pressure climbs.\n\nAlready, ETH is seeing a decline in its prices, falling toward $1,830 in the early hours of Monday before making a brisk recovery. Such sharp declines could have been triggered by the whales selling, and if there is not enough demand in the market to soak up this new supply, then ETH\u2019s price could return to the low $1,800s once more.\n\nFor now, the digital asset seems to be holding up against the bears but it has already lost its footing at the $1,850 support. Right now, the next major support lies at $1,800, unless the bulls are able to retain control and reclaim $1,900.\n\nFollow Best Owie on Twitter for market insights, updates, and the occasional funny tweet\u2026 Featured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin explores Worldcoin's biometric proof-of-personhood, discussing its potential value, applications, and challenges such as privacy, accessibility, and centralization.\n\nCo-founder of Ethereum Vitalik Buterin explored the idea of biometric evidence of personhood, a subject that is gaining popularity in the Ethereum community, in a blog post from July 24, 2023. The article \"What do I think about biometric proof of personhood?\" examines the possible benefits and difficulties of decentralized proof-of-personhood solutions.\n\nAccording to Buterin, proof of personhood is a kind of real-world identification that claims a certain registered account is run by a real person, preferably without disclosing whose actual person it is. The \"unique-human problem\" is addressed by this idea, which has become the subject of various initiatives, including Proof of Humanity, BrightID, Idena, and Circles.\n\nOne of the most ambitious projects in this space is Worldcoin, co-founded by Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI. Worldcoin's approach to proof of personhood is unique as it relies on sophisticated biometrics, scanning each user's iris using a specialized hardware called \"the Orb\". The goal is to distribute these Orbs globally, making it easy for anyone to get an ID.\n\nButerin acknowledges the criticisms Worldcoin has faced, including privacy and security concerns around the Orb, design issues in its \"coin\", and ethical issues around some choices the company has made. He also discusses the broader concerns about whether biometrics are a good idea at all and the potential risks of proof of personhood in general, such as privacy leaks, coercion by authoritarian governments, and the challenge of maintaining security while being decentralized.\n\nThe blog post also explores the importance of proof of personhood, stating that it is valuable because it solves anti-spam and anti-concentration-of-power problems, avoids dependence on centralized authorities, and reveals minimal information. Without proof of personhood, decentralized governance becomes easier to capture by wealthy actors, including hostile governments.\n\nButerin also discusses the potential applications of proof of personhood, which include airdrops for token distributions, voting in DAOs, protection against bots/sybil attacks in social media, and an alternative to captchas for preventing DoS attacks, among others.\n\nDespite the potential benefits, Buterin acknowledges the challenges that biometric proof-of-personhood systems face, including privacy concerns, accessibility issues, and centralization risks. He also explains Worldcoin's solutions to these problems, including as its long-term dedication to decentralization , its use of ZK-SNARKs and other cryptographic tools to safeguard users' anonymity, and its possibility for auditing Orbs to make sure they are constructed appropriately.\n\nIn conclusion, Buterin's paper offers a thorough examination of the idea of biometric evidence of personhood, as well as its possible advantages and drawbacks. It presents a fair viewpoint, taking into account both the necessity for major issues to be addressed as well as the potential for these systems to tackle important problems.\n\nImage source: Shutterstock"

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nOpenAI Inc. CEO Sam Altman's new cryptocurrency project, Worldcoin, has caught the attention of Ethereum's co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, and sparked conversations about the advent of decentralized proof-of-personhood solutions in the cryptocurrency realm. Buterin recently discussed the potential of biometric technology in the context of blockchain and Ethereum, focusing on Worldcoin's unique approach.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWorldcoin aims to address the \"unique-human problem\" or proof of personhood by creating a decentralized system where each registered account is controlled by a unique human individual. This system is expected to preserve the anonymity of individuals while confirming their human identity. Worldcoin is unique in its application of biometrics, employing an advanced iris-scanning device, known as \"the Orb,\" to confirm user identities.\n\nHowever, the novelty of this approach has not been without criticism. Questions have been raised about privacy and security concerns related to biometric technology, specifically Worldcoin's Orb. Concerns have also been raised about whether or not biometrics are a suitable solution for proof of personhood at all. The risks associated with privacy leaks, coercive governments and the potential impossibility of maintaining both security and decentralization are some of the highlighted issues.\n\nIn his breakdown, Buterin argued that there is not an ideal proof of personhood form. Instead, we have different paradigms, each with unique strengths and weaknesses. He suggested that these techniques should be seen as complementary and combined. He proposed that biometrics might provide a good short-term solution, while social-graph-based systems could prove more robust in the long term.\n\nWhile acknowledging the potential pitfalls of proof-of-personhood systems, Buterin also recognized the work done so far by various teams taking privacy seriously. He called for vigilance from the community, emphasizing the need for open-source tech, third-party audits and a balance of checks to ensure accountability. He also emphasized the need for more alternatives in each of the three proof-of-personhood categories."

        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin price could fall 5% to $27,500 after breaking crucial support at $29,872 ahead of the FOMC.\n\nEthereum price to test the $1,824 as bears become active below the 200-day EMA at $1,883 on the 4-hour timeframe.\n\nRipple price could correct back to move within range after collecting liquidity under $0.711.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price continues south after breaking the crucial support. The slump has harmed altcoins, with Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) prices bearing the brunt. Meanwhile, the crypto market looks to the oncoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on Wednesday without much expectation, seeing as its influence on crypto market prices has been rather limited of late.\n\nAlso Read: Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and ApeCoin trade volume spikes as correlation to Bitcoin dwindles\n\nBitcoin price slides sideways, harming altcoins\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price has lost crucial support at $29,872 to extend almost 5% lower to a price of $29,090 at the time of writing. The move has seen the king of crypto flip the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) support into resistance at $29,363 (red). As BTC heads toward the 100-day EMA at $28,344 (green), the bearish outlook points to a retest of the $27,500 level.\n\nThe pessimistic outlook is unfortunate considering the oncoming FOMC report, a macroeconomic event that would normally bode well for Bitcoin price if it came as expected. Noteworthy, the previous FOMC indicated the likelihood of a mild recession after the Federal Reserve (Fed) noted a decline in the US Dollar (USD).\n\nBTC and the USD trading inversely to one another, there is a possibility the Fed meeting could impact BTC \u2013 even though of late it has had less of an influence. Nevertheless, as reported, a loss of the crucial support at $29,872 would expose Bitcoin price to further losses, potentially tagging the $27,500 support. Such a move would constitute a 5% drop from current levels.\n\nBoth the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Awesome Oscillators (AO) are headed south, pointing to falling momentum, which augurs well for the bears.\n\nBTC/USDT 12-hour chart\n\nNevertheless, similar to April 21 and April 25, sidelined investors could choose the $27,500 support as an entry point. The ensuing buying pressure could see the Bitcoin price correct north.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Traders Cautious Despite Spot ETF Optimism, Leverage Indicators Suggest\n\nEthereum price drops as sellers rouse\n\nEthereum (ETH) price suffers the aftermath of awakened sellers below the 200-day EMA at $1,883 (blue) on the four-hour timeframe. The subsequent selling pressure sent ETH toward $1,824, a crucial multi-month support level.\n\nIf the support at $1,824 gives way, Ethereum price could fall 7% to the $1,720 range or lower in the dire case to tag the support floor around the psychological $1,640.\n\nETH/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nHowever, a resurgence by the bulls could see Ethereum price bounce from the $1,824 support akin to what happened during late June and early July. Such a move could see ETH regain the ground lost, potentially shattering the $1,959 resistance level. This would constitute a $6 rally north from current levels.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum, Tron, and Bitcoin worth $23 million drained from Alphapo hot wallets\n\nRipple price could pull back after collecting liquidity\n\nRipple (XRP) price has broken below the support at $0.711, a move that appears to be a successful attempt to collect buy-side liquidity hanging after volatility following the July 13 rally. Liquidity collection often stabilizes the market for a few days before the asset continues its overall trend.\n\nAccordingly, Ripple price could restore north to move within range. However, XRP could extend even further north in a highly bullish case, breaching the $0.823 resistance level. This would denote a 20% rise from current levels.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-Day Chart\n\nNevertheless, with the RSI heading south and AO histograms soaked red, bears are gaining ground, and Ripple price could rally south toward the $0.544 level.\n\nAlso Read: Pro-XRP John Deaton argues SEC vs. Ripple ruling is sound, cites Celsius bankruptcy example"

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of the Ethereum network, released a long-form essay with his thoughts on the recently launched Worldcoin human identity verification system.\n\nOn July 24th, Buterin tweeted his response to Worldcoin which launched on the same day.\n\nWhat do I think about biometric proof of personhood?https://t.co/yozo1buW24 \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) July 24, 2023\n\nIn his article, along with an explanation of Worldcoin and how it intends to work, Buterin addressed the larger concept in discussion within the release of the Worldcoin token \u2014 proof of personhood.\n\nWorldcoin, along with similar identity solutions, such as Proof of Humanity, BrightID, Idenam and Circles, believe that as artificial intelligence (AI) advances, it will become increasingly difficult to distinguish between humans and machines.\n\nMost of these systems that supply a token type, such as Worldcoin, also see human utility being endangered by bots and therefore needing a universal basic income.\n\nButerin writes that these factors combined beckon the need for digital verification of humans. He argues that this system of proof of personhood is valuable to solving \u201canti-spam and anti-concentration-of-power problems.\u201d\n\nRelated: OpenAI CEO Sam Altman testifies in \u2018historic\u2019 Senate hearing on AI safety\n\nAdditionally, the Ethereum co-founder also highlights that systems like Worldcoin, if it continues to decentralize as promised, will avoid \u201cdependence on centralized authorities and reveal the minimal information possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf proof of personhood is not solved, decentralized governance becomes much easier to capture by very wealthy actors, including hostile governments.\u201d\n\nButerin also addressed the major concerns looming over such solutions, which he summarized into four main points of privacy, accessibility, centralization within the Worldcoin Foundation and security.\n\nOn June 27, Worldcoin had a small scare that it immediately clarified after thousands of Safe deployments to Optimism caused speculation of an attack.\n\nSteve Dakh, a developer working on the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS), which is the network\u2019s own service that creates, verifies and revokes on/off-chain attestations, commented on Buterin\u2019s post saying systems like Worldcoin could be complimentary with EAS.\n\nI think Worldcoin can just be an attester of proof of personhood using a protocol like EAS and other entities can decide whether or not they value those attestations. \u2014 Steve Dakh (@stevedakh) July 24, 2023\n\nIn conclusion, Buterin said there is currently \u201cno ideal form of proof of personhood\u201d and envisions three different approaches to the problem that could become a hybrid of each other.\n\nHe called for community accountability in the process with audits, checks and balances. Although saying he does not envy those whose task it is to design and implement such systems, his point is simple:\n\n\u201cA world with no proof-of-personhood seems more likely to be a world dominated by centralized identity solutions, money, small closed communities, or some combination of all three.\u201d\n\nAs of July 14, a week before the system\u2019s launch, sign-ups for Worldcoin World ID surpassed 2 million in less than half the time it took to reach the first million.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: Tokenizing music royalties as NFTs could help the next Taylor Swift"

For instance, a credential issued on the Polygon network could only be used on Polygon. To use it on Ethereum, users needed to issue credentials separately on the Ethereum network.\n\nWith the integration, Polygon ID will soon be available on EVM chains and other networks such as BNB Chain and Avalanche. Rarimo said, \u201cA range of additional chains will be added with time,\u201d stating the number of networks it can scale to is limitless.\n\nPolygon ID was launched in March 2022 with its tech stack made open-source this year.

        "content": "Exchange.art, the popular Solana-based digital art marketplace, is soon taking its platform multichain and integrating support for Ethereum.\n\nThe integration will go live on August 1 with more than 80 Ethereum-based artists including Sotheby\u2019s \u201cGlitch Art\u201d sale artist Patrick Amadon and creator Amber Vittoria.\n\nAccording to data from analytics platform CryptoSlam!, Ethereum's non-fungible token (NFT) trading volume takes first place at $10.2 million in the past 24 hours, while Solana trails behind in second place with just over $920,000. Larisa Barbu, COO of Exchange.art told CoinDesk that Exchange.art always had the plan to expand beyond Solana, and aims to onboarding new creators and collectors in doing so.\n\n\u201cThe vision of Exchange.art is to be a hub for digital art and then slowly, build out solutions for traditional art as well,\u201d said Barbu. \u201cSo because that's the vision, and that's where we aim to go\u2026being multichain is just kind of the next step in this direction.\u201d\n\nShe also added that many artists struggle to sell their work across different ecosystems and marketplaces, and doing so on Exchange.art helps them leverage the two largest NFT ecosystems in one place.\n\n\u201c[Artists] would very much prefer to actually maintain only one platform and one community, instead of [always] juggling between two or three platforms, two or three communities, always updating information between the three of them, communicating with people on all of those platforms, and so on.\u201d said Barbu. \u201cIt was actually a decision that we took because we had demand for it, from an artist perspective \u2013 and it will help quite a lot of artists.\u201d\n\nAfter releasing in 2021, Exchange.art has onboarded 16,000 Solana-based artists, helping them earn a collective $13 million in sales. With a mission to stand by artists in a time of uncertainty around royalty payments, Exchange.art introduced a royalties protection standard to help creators earn a consistent percentage across marketplaces. In March, Exchange.art released Code Canvas, a derivative platform to help Solana-based creators mint generative art NFT collections.\n\nAdditionally, Exchange.art isn\u2019t the first Solana-based NFT marketplace to introduce Ethereum. In August, Solana-based NFT marketplace Magic Eden integrated Ethereum to make its ecosystem multi-chain."

        "content": "The investors favor crypto projects that add value to the industry. A new project, Tradecurve, is one such project that has multiple utilities and solves complex real-world problems. Even the growth rate of Aptos (APT) and Ethereum (ETH) seem smaller when compared with the rise of Tradecurve (TCRV).\n\nWhile all crypto projects aim to make a big impact on the market, only a few of them are able to do so. Considering its growth prospect, whales have been pouring money into its ongoing presale round.\n\n>>Register For The Tradecurve Presale<<\n\nAptos (APT) Becomes 9th Most-Tweeted Crypto Project\n\nThe first quarter of 2023 has been beneficial for Aptos (APT), barring the month of March. While Aptos was able to soar by about 400% in January, it forged many new strategic partnerships in February. Aptos was also able to record its all-time high of $19.90 in January.\n\nHowever, bears suppressed Aptos in March, and the token lost about 48% value from its ATH. Currently, Aptos is changing hands at $10.26, with a market capitalization of $1.9 billion. In the meantime, Streamr has ranked Aptos 9th on the list of most-tweeted cryptocurrencies.\n\nAccording to experts, the ranking is a sign of investors\u2019 confidence in Aptos (APT), which has increased in the past three months.\n\n>>Register For The Tradecurve Presale<<\n\nWhales Increase Their Ethereum (ETH) Accumulation\n\nEthereum (ETH) launched Shanghai Upgrade on its mainnet in April. Since it was one of the most-awaited developments of this year, the market sentiments around Ethereum have become bullish after the launch of the Shanghai Upgrade.\n\nHowever, the market value of Ethereum has plunged by 12% in the past week. Ethereum has risen by 2% on the monthly chart. According to the latest data from Santiment, whales have increased their Ethereum accumulation by 0.5% in recent weeks. Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai Upgrade has enabled users to withdraw their staked Ethereum. Currently, Ethereum is changing hands at $1,854.82.\n\n>>Register For The Tradecurve Presale<<\n\nTradecurve (TCRV) Becomes the Market Star of 2023\n\nThere are thousands of trading exchanges in the world, but all of them are tunnel-visioned. For instance, exchanges like Binance and Huobi are limited to cryptocurrency-related assets, while platforms like Upstox and Webull restrict their users to traditional derivatives. However, the entry of Tradecurve (TCRV) has changed the entire landscape.\n\nIt is a first-of-its-kind platform that allows the trading of a wide range of assets, including cryptocurrency, Forex, stocks, bonds, OTC derivatives, and ETFs without FIAT payments. Since the crypto market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 12.8% from 2021 to 2030, experts believe that Tradecurve has massive growth potential.\n\nThe USP of this platform is that traders hold their own keys, and control their own assets, unlike established projects like Coinbase. It also protects users\u2019 privacy through DeFi capabilities. TCRV token owners will be given bonuses on their trades, discounts on trading fees, and subscription fees for using AI trading bots.\n\nIts presale phase has begun, and is currently in stage 1. TCRV tokens are currently available to purchase at $0.018. Since only 40% of the total 1.8 billion tokens will be supplied during the presale phase, bulls have pounced on the project to get the maximum benefits.\n\nTo find more information about Tradecurve and the TCRV token, visit the links below:\n\nWebsite: https://tradecurve.io/\n\nBuy presale: https://app.tradecurve.io/sign-up\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Tradecurveapp\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/tradecurve_official"

        "title": "Top Layer-1 Protocols for Crypto Investors - Bitcoin Market Journal",
        "content": "Investor Takeaway: Layer-1 blockchains are central to the growth of the cryptocurrency and DeFi markets. While there\u2019s been a massive boost in investor interest (and subsequent boom/bust cycles), the SEC\u2019s recent labeling of some Layer-1s as securities means some caution might be prudent.\n\nThe modern cryptocurrency ecosystem is based around Layer-1 blockchains. Scalable blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano have played, and continue to play, a vital role in the development of notable DeFi technology like NFTs. As such, billions of dollars from investors have flowed into the industry in the last five years.\n\nThere\u2019s always some give-and-take, however. The inherent volatility of native Layer-1 tokens has also drawn the attention of regulators in the US and EU. In 2023, the SEC is taking a tough stance against all prominent Layer-1 blockchains apart from the big two \u2013 Ethereum and Bitcoin.\n\nIn this sector report, we will focus on the broad trends in the industry around Layer-1 blockchains, along with a closer look at the potential impact of the recent SEC decisions regarding Layer-1 tokens like Cardano, Solana, and BNB Coin.\n\nIndustry Overview\n\nLayer-1 (L1) blockchains are the true backbone of the nascent cryptocurrency markets. Bitcoin led the way with the first-ever viable Layer-1 protocol. However, its technology and architecture have since been overtaken by more innovative and scalable networks like Ethereum.\n\nAlthough bitcoin is still the king of Layer-1 protocols, its utility is largely limited to being a highly lucrative speculative asset. Other protocols like Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano offer a host of other benefits.\n\nMany experts think blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize finance, payments, banking, and other economic spheres. Through their support for smart contracts and decentralized apps, the newer Layer-1 protocols are actively contributing to the evolution of the blockchain space.\n\nAs of Q2 2023, over $270 billion is invested in the top 9 Layer-1 blockchains below bitcoin. The latter dwarfs them all with a market cap of $500 billion, but it has also been around for over 12 years.\n\nApart from Ethereum, which launched in 2015, all other Layer-1 blockchains started after 2017. In a relatively short time frame, many of these projects have managed to attract upwards of $5 billion each in market cap.\n\nThe top players in the descending order of magnitude are Ethereum, BNB Chain, Cardano, Tron, Solana, Polkadot, and Avalanche. Ethereum dwarfs them all with a total market cap of $209 billion, nearly three times the combined market cap of all other L1 blockchains (besides bitcoin).\n\nAll these blockchains, including bitcoin and Ethereum, have suffered heavy losses in the crypto bear market of 2022. The entire blockchain sector suffered a collective loss of $2 trillion in market cap from January 1, 2022 through June 2023.\n\nDespite these losses, we believe the industry still has an upbeat future, at least in the case of the two main blockchains \u2013 bitcoin and Ethereum. Both are firmly established, with stable ecosystems and global user bases, and are least likely to suffer a catastrophic collapse.\n\nHowever, the fate of the remaining players in the market is less clear, largely due to factors like increased competition, internal weaknesses, and above all, increasing regulatory pressure. This vital point will be discussed in greater detail in our investor thesis below.\n\nTop Layer-1 Projects\n\nProject Market Cap Annualized Revenue Assets Staked (market cap) Total Daily Transactions Daily Active Addresses Ethereum $209.2b $2.51b $34.4b $474k 527.6k BNB Chain $37.1b $20.12m $5.39b 3.49 2.0m Cardano $9.6b $0 $6.47b 66,791 54,977 Solana $6.0b $561k $6.02b 29m 143.3k Polkadot $5.7b $222.75k $2.62b 8.82k 4.3k Tron $6.5b $89.4m $2.69b 12m 2.7m Avalanche $4.1b $1.3m $3.14b 457.9k 161k\n\nInvestment Thesis\n\nBlockchain proposes a radically different way of handling large volumes of sensitive data in a secure yet highly decentralized manner. This model has massive ramifications for our modern economy, where data is traditionally stored in centralized databases.\n\nIn sectors as diverse as finance, health care, real estate, business, and logistics, organizations are forced to spend vast amounts of resources to maintain database security. This often comes at the cost of efficiency, economy, and privacy.\n\nBlockchain technology has the power to change all that. And Layer-1 blockchains are the building blocks of this decentralized future, particularly in the space of payments, finance, and banking. L1s are like the operating system for the blockchain ecosystem. They provide the base layer upon which everything else is being built.\n\nThis is particularly true for Ethereum. It\u2019s smart contracts allow developers to build all sorts of interesting (and potentially profitable) dApps on top of the base Ethereum layer. Investors can also use DeFi apps and smart contracts on Ethereum and other L1 ecosystems to put their crypto assets to work in yield farming and crypto lending. You can also hold the coins native to the blockchain for speculative trades.\n\nLayer-1 blockchains are popular among investors because they open the doors to a wide range of investment opportunities with varying levels of risk. However, because of the very nature of the L1s, that is to provide the base layer for everything, it\u2019s not likely that they can all survive. In order to survive, Layer-1 relies on a growing developer community, and the associated network effects. This means that in the future it is likely that we will see 1 or two dominant L1s and perhaps another 1-2 more \u201cniche\u201d and smaller L1s take over the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nInvestor Alert: The Potential Impact of SEC Regulations in 2023\n\nWhile they hold an immense promise of high ROI, investments in Layer-1 blockchains do present risks. Market volatility is a major threat in the crypto space. Bear markets and flash crashes routinely wipe out billions of dollars in market cap in a matter of days or weeks.\n\nHowever, many of the Layer-1 blockchains face another threat from agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the United States: more stringent regulations. In the aftermath of the collapse of Terra/LUNA and FTX, regulators are cracking down on the crypto space.\n\nLeading the charge, the SEC has classified the tokens of more than 12 major blockchains as securities. Under current US regulations, entities selling securities to the public have to be registered with the SEC.\n\nIt also brings stringent compliance rules regarding the disclosure of information, and other extensive financial regulations, audits, and oversight. The SEC has also filed lawsuits against the two major centralized exchanges \u2013 Binance and Coinbase \u2013 for selling Layer-1 tokens and other crypto products in the US.\n\nThe SEC has classified all the major Layer-1 tokens, except Bitcoin and Ethereum, as securities. Trading or selling these tokens may incur penalties for cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nFor investors, the Layer-1 blockchain landscape has become a lot more complicated outside of ETH and BTC. The recent SEC regulations could also hurt the price and liquidity of all L1s.\n\nWe strongly recommend all investors think carefully before investing in any of the other L1 tokens targeted by the SEC. It could be a while before we get further clarity on the matter since multiple lawsuits are pending in the courts, and could take years to settle. In addition, it seems Congress is weighing in on the recent SEC actions, and looking to push back with new regulatory frameworks, which could be a win for the crypto industry.\n\nWho\u2019s Investing: Institutional Backing\n\nThe Layer-1 blockchain space has probably seen the largest influx of institutional capital in the entire crypto space. Bitcoin leads due to its unique status as a high ROI speculative asset. Major investors holding bitcoin worth hundreds of millions of dollars include companies like MicroStrategy, Tesla, Galaxy Digital Holdings, Block, Coinbase Global, and Riot Blockchain.\n\nDue to its highly scalable and environmentally-friendly technology, Ethereum has also attracted considerable interest from companies like Tesla, Alphabet, Square, and Paypal. Hedge Funds like Fortress Investment Group, Ark Investment Management, and Renaissance Technologies have also bet on Ethereum since 2021.\n\nAnd all that is just an investment into buying the native tokens of these blockchains. Some projects have also raised cash over time through multiple avenues like initial coin offerings (ICOs) and subsequent funding rounds.\n\nFor instance, Solana\u2019s ICO invited interest from investors like Coin Shares, Multicoin Capital, Buck Stash, and the now-defunct Alameda Research. Major investors in Polygon include Disney Accelerator, Crown Venture Capital, Celsius Network, SoftBank Vision Fund, and Steadview Capital.\n\nTop Layer-1 Protocols by Market Cap\n\nEthereum\n\nPrice: $1,738.66\n\nAnnualized Revenues: $2.51b\n\nDaily Active Users: 338k\n\nTwitter Followers: 3.08m\n\nAs the second largest blockchain by market cap behind bitcoin, Ethereum requires no introduction. The project was launched in 2015 as a Proof of Work blockchain by several developers, including Vitalik Buterin.\n\nEthereum is incredibly popular due to its excellent support for smart contracts and decentralized apps that can solve real-world problems. The native asset of the blockchain is Ether (ETH), the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap.\n\nDue to increasing network congestion and high transaction fees (gas), Ethereum began a switch from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake (PoS) in 2020. The final network update (the Merge) was completed in April 2023.\n\nFurther updates will bring other features like sharding to solve the problem of network congestion. Among all the blockchains on this list, Ethereum undoubtedly has the most well-developed Layer-1 ecosystem and \u2013 in our opinion \u2013 the best growth prospects.\n\nThanks to the promise of additional rewards through staking and other DeFi projects, demand for ETH remains quite high in 2023. The risk of regulatory sanctions are also lower as the SEC considers ETH to be a commodity, not a security.\n\nBNB Chain (BNB)\n\nPrice: $237.46\n\nAnnualized Revenues:\n\nDaily Active Users: 1.2m\n\nTwitter Followers: 10.5m\n\nBNB Chain was originally called Binance Smart Chain. It was launched in 2020 by Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world. Although Binance is a centralized exchange, BNB Chain is designed to be a decentralized and permissionless blockchain.\n\nBNB began life as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain before it was elevated to a proper cryptocurrency on its native Layer-1 protocol. Think of BNB Chain as a competitor to Ethereum, and BNB as a competitor to ETH.\n\nLike Ethereum, BNB Chain supports DeFi, smart contracts, and scalable Layer-2 chains. The Layer-1 protocol also uses a PoS, with validators receiving rewards in the form of Binance Coin for providing liquidity and processing transactions.\n\nBNB Chain enjoys massive popularity in key markets outside the United States due to its association with the Binance exchange. However, the company has been hit hard by regulatory action in the US.\n\nA 2023 lawsuit by the SEC has severely affected Binance\u2019s ability to serve US customers. Pending the outcome, both the exchange and the BNB chain could face higher operating costs and compliance burdens in the United States. Other countries have followed suit.\n\nDue to the ongoing regulatory uncertainty in a key market like the US, it is hard to comment on the long-term growth prospects and viability of BNB Chain.\n\nCardano\n\nPrice: $0.276\n\nAnnualized Revenues: $0\n\nDaily Active Users: 50k\n\nTwitter Followers: 844k\n\nBetween 2017 and 2020, several new blockchains were launched with highly scalable PoS consensus mechanisms. These Layer-1 protocols rose in popularity as alternatives to Ethereum, as the latter was getting bogged down by network congestion and high transaction charges.\n\nCardano was a leading contender among these protocols for the title \u201cEthereum Killer.\u201d It is named after an Italian genius from the 16th century \u2013 Gerolamo Cardano. And the native token is named ADA in honor of Ada Lovelace, a pioneer of computer programming.\n\nOver the years, Cardano added various innovative features including support for NFTs and smart contracts. However, despite a thriving Layer-1 ecosystem, the blockchain has largely failed to live up to the name of \u201cEthereum Killer.\u201d\n\nAs a further blow, Cardano is among the 13 cryptos labeled as securities by the SEC. In the long term, this has the potential to severely restrict the trade of ADA on US exchanges. As of this writing, Cardano\u2019s long-term growth potential looks rather bleak due to the high level of regulatory uncertainties.\n\nSolana (SOL)\n\nPrice: $15.20\n\nAnnualized Revenues: $6.83m\n\nDaily Active Users: 150k\n\nTwitter Followers: 2.25m\n\nSolana is a Layer-1 protocol with a heavy focus on DeFi, smart contracts, and NFTs. The blockchain has its bases in Geneva and San Francisco and was launched in 2020. In its early years, Solana was touted as a promising Ethereum killer due to its scalability and speed.\n\nHowever, the blockchain has endured a stunning fall from grace since 2022. The native SOL token tanked in value by 94% in a single year. Solana was heavily affected by its association with Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced founder of the FTX exchange.\n\nHis investment firm had a major stake in SOL and he was also an early backer of the Solana protocol. There is even a suspicion among some quarters that Bankman-Fried\u2019s involvement may have contributed at least indirectly to SOL\u2019s meteoric rise.\n\nDespite its promise of speed and scalability, Solana has struggled to live up to its billing in the contest with Ethereum. With the latter\u2019s switch to PoS, Solana faces an even steeper climb for future relevance and growth.\n\nProbably the biggest setback to the protocol after the FTX debacle is its listing by the SEC as a security. Lower trading opportunities in the US market could severely affect Solana\u2019s popularity at a time when the token is already facing internal challenges and stiff competition.\n\nPolkadot (DOT)\n\nPrice: $4.63\n\nAnnualized Revenues: $222.75k\n\nDaily Active Users: 3.61k\n\nTwitter Followers: 1.4m\n\nPolkadot is technically not a Layer-1 blockchain. Unlike most other protocols on this list, it operates at a much deeper level and is called a Layer-0 protocol. Polkadot was launched with the ambitious plan to act as a \u201cblockchain for all blockchains.\u201d\n\nIt serves as a platform where all other blockchains can exist as interconnected protocols. In other words, it is a \u201cmeta protocol.\u201d Layer-0 protocols provide the infrastructure that facilitates secure and easy interactions between Layer-1 protocols like Ethereum and bitcoin.\n\nIn the highly fragmented blockchain ecosystem, Layer-1 protocols exist as independent silos. Launched in 2020, Polkadot has the potential to revolutionize the entire space. However, due to its complex nature, the blockchain is more oriented toward developers than retail users.\n\nThe Polkadot system has a central protocol called the relay chain. Users can create additional chains in parallel to the relay chain. These \u201cparachains\u201d can connect among themselves and with other popular blockchains using a connecting layer or bridge.\n\nThe native token on the protocol is called DOT. It acts as the governance token and can also be used to earn staking rewards. Polkadot had a rough year in 2022, as many of its associated NFT and DeFi projects failed to gain traction due to the market crash.\n\nAnother major setback was the de-pegging of the algorithmic stablecoin Acala. The Acala network was a major source of revenue for the Polkadot platform. The subsequent crash of major CEXs and stablecoins in the market has also contributed to a steep fall in DOT prices.\n\nIn the ongoing bear market, Polkadot faces an uncertain future. However, there is no doubt that the parachain concept has immense utility in a diverse crypto market filled with multiple Layer-1 protocols. Polkadot\u2019s growth prospects are tied to the wider prospects of the crypto/NFT/DeFi markets.\n\nTron (TRX)\n\nPrice: $0.0724\n\nAnnualized Revenues: $1.09b\n\nDaily Active Users: 2.03m\n\nTwitter Followers: 1.4m\n\nTron is a Layer-1 blockchain launched in 2017 with a heavy focus on content creation and media consumption. It aims to act as a platform where creators \u2013 musicians, designers, artists \u2013 can remove intermediaries and claim full ownership of their creations and deal directly with their audience.\n\nThe blockchain is extremely popular among users because it does not charge any fees on transactions. This has allowed the protocol to remain viable despite a long series of controversies and scandals.\n\nTron\u2019s founder Justin Sun is one of the most outspoken and controversial figures in the cryptocurrency industry. Despite (or maybe because of) this, Tron has retained a significant following in Asia. In its early years, the protocol developers focused heavily on the Asian crypto markets.\n\nDue to its absurdly low transaction fees and heavy involvement in DeFi/NFT space, Tron still has robust growth prospects in its overseas markets. However, inside the US, its chances are much bleaker given the regulatory stance.\n\nTron\u2019s native token TRX was labeled a security by the SEC in early 2023. In a lawsuit, the regulator charged founder Justin Sun and eight others with a wide range of charges including securities fraud.\n\nAvalanche (AVAX)\n\nPrice: $11.81\n\nAnnualized Revenues: $15.92m\n\nDaily Active Users: 70k\n\nTwitter Followers: 954k\n\nLike Cardano and Solana, Avalanche is another Layer-1 blockchain designed to provide a better user experience than Ethereum. The protocol was launched in 2019 when Ethereum was going through one of its worst phases of network congestion.\n\nThe native token on Avalanche is called AVAX. It can be staked for passive rewards. Owners also get governance rights on the protocol. With a circulating market cap of $4 billion, AVAX is nowhere close to ETH in terms of adoption. But among L1 protocols, it easily slots into the top 5 lists.\n\nAnd over the years, AVAX has remained relatively free of major scandals and controversies. The protocol has a unique network architecture with three separate chains handling different functions and use cases.\n\nThe protocol has steadily cultivated a layer-ecosystem filled with DeFi projects, NFTs, and other decentralized apps. It also offers excellent integration with Ethereum through a bridge that is under constant development.\n\nAVAX has not been labeled a security by the SEC as of this writing. If things hold, this could be a major boost for the blockchain against its direct rivals like Solana, Cardano, and Polygon. The project is probably never going to overtake the post-PoS switch Ethereum. But it still has quite a lot of staying power in its present condition.\n\nInvestor Takeaway\n\nLayer-1 blockchains are central to the growth of the cryptocurrency and DeFi markets. Over the years, the sector has attracted massive investor inflows while undergoing frequent boom and bust cycles.\n\nThe most recent crash in 2022 was particularly severe, wiping out nearly two trillion dollars in investor funds. That, and the high-profile collapse of major entities like Terra/LUNA and FTX has increased regulatory scrutiny over the entire space.\n\nOutside of the top two blockchains \u2013 bitcoin and Ethereum \u2013 all other Layer-1 blockchains are on the radar of the SEC in the United States. These tokens have all been labeled as securities. Any sale or trading of unregistered securities could attract regulatory penalties.\n\nMany US-based exchanges and platforms have already stopped offering trades or sales on the affected layer-1 blockchain tokens. If you are already an investor, we strongly suggest that you think carefully before investing in other L1s, outside of bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nSubscribe to Bitcoin Market Journal to learn more about blockchain investing in Layer 1 protocols."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe digital asset market may be on the whole sleepy today, but one cryptocurrency is surging: Dogecoin.\n\nDOGE was at the time of writing up more than 9% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko, trading for $0.08. And in the past week, it's up 19%, making it one of the best-performing coins.\n\nThe original meme coin shot up in price as Twitter CEO\u2014and the world's richest man\u2014Elon Musk tweeted a promo of the social media site's new logo, originally shared by a Dogecoin designer. Musk appears to have also added the Dogecoin symbol to the location field in his Twitter bio.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDogecoin was invented in 2013 by a group of engineers as a joke. But it is now the eighth biggest digital asset with a market cap of $11.2 billion. It was eventually revealed that Musk has been advising the developers behind Dogecoin since 2019.\n\nMusk started pumping the coin on Twitter in 2020 by posting memes, and it in turn shot up in value and gained a cult following. His electric car company Tesla also accepts the cryptocurrency. Tesla has never revealed whether any customers have used Dogecoin or, if they have, how much it's received. But Musk's affinity for the meme coin has garnered some negative attention.\n\nIn June 2022, a group of Dogecoin investors filed a $258 billion class action lawsuit against Musk, Tesla, and SpaceX. The suit alleges he's been part of a racketeering scheme to pump the cryptocurrency. Last month, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that also accuses the Tesla CEO of insider trading.\n\nRumors have been circulating for some time now that Dogecoin could be integrated into the social media platform as a form of payment. And in January, news dropped that the company was working on a product in a way that was supportive of crypto payments.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMusk took over Twitter in October 2022. Since then, he has since fired a lot of staff, brought back former banned controversial users and, most recently, rebranded the company to X.com.\n\nMusk and fellow billionaire investor Mark Cuban have previously said that Dogecoin could be used one day as a serious cryptocurrency for payments.\n\nAnd Dogecoin developers exclusively told Decrypt in 2021 that they had been working with Musk for years to make the cryptocurrency a cheaper, greener alternative to Bitcoin."

        "title": "5 Cryptos to Follow Ripple's Victory: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB) DigiToads (TOADS), Cardano ... - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The favorable decision in the Ripple vs SEC legal case has renewed bulls\u2019 energy in the crypto market. Following Ripple\u2019s victory, several cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), DigiToads (TOADS), and Cardano (ADA), have joined the rally. Here are the latest market updates about the best cryptos to buy now.\n\nDigiToads Presale Records a New High\n\nAmidst the market excitement, DigiToads (TOADS) has achieved a significant milestone with its presale reaching new heights. Currently in its ninth stage, the project has raised over $6.2 million, demonstrating strong growth potential.\n\nDigiToads created a buzz in the meme coin, offering a captivating play-to-earn gaming experience that combines blockchain technology, stake-to-earn features, and a highly competitive environment for traders, gamers, and investors.\n\nGamers are attracted by the unique Swamp where they engage in battles with NFT-backed digital toads, and can also join gaming competitions to earn TOADS tokens. At the same time, the ecosystem offers unique income-generation avenues for TOADS holders, who not only receive monthly airdrops but can also buy and stake NFTs to receive passive income.\n\nThe DigiToads community has grown rapidly, driven by gaming enthusiasts, crypto investors, and individuals seeking unique opportunities for wealth generation. Hence, the presale success reflects the growing interest in DigiToads and its potential for substantial growth as it redefines the meme coin market by providing real value and use cases. Renewed Interest in Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin (BTC), the oldest and most renowned cryptocurrency, has experienced a resurgence of interest following Ripple\u2019s win but has since cooled off as it currently hovers just below $30,000. Yet, this marked a yearly peak for the oldest crypto on the market.\n\nThanks to Ripple\u2019s win, investors demonstrated renewed confidence, but there are new developments that could pave the way for a new bull run. While BTC lacks DigiToads\u2019 potential for tremendous growth as it is already a mature crypto, it remains a prominent contender in the space and could surge above $30,000 if the SEC approves BlackRock\u2019s spot BTC ETF.\n\nEthereum Jumps After Ripple\u2019s Win\n\nRipple\u2019s victory hasn\u2019t failed to touch Ethereum, either. The second leading cryptocurrency jumped above $2,000 in the aftermath of the court\u2019s ruling. This is because ETH is one of the many other assets the SEC alleged were securities, so the win for XRP renewed optimism for ETH as well.\n\nYet, Ethereum is trading sideways at press time, but there are some bullish signs. For instance, ETH staking has broken a new record, registering 24 million staked ETH, which means 20% of the total supply.\n\nBinance Coin Could Reach New Highs After This Feature\n\nBinance, the largest crypto exchange in the world, is on track to potential gains after announcing a new feature that allows individuals to use multiple deposit addresses for a network. It will be available for ERC20 coins (tokens on the Ethereum network) and alternative ones, such as BNB smart chain, but the feature will be developed to include more blockchains in the future.\n\nCardano Capitalizes on Ripple\u2019s Victory\n\nCardano (ADA) emerged as one of the biggest gainers following Ripple\u2019s legal victory, driven by renewed hope among investors that ADA will also be exempt from SEC threats due to the SEC\u2019s loss against XRP. As investors seek to benefit from the ongoing crypto rally, holding onto ADA may be an attractive option, as the coin has the potential to establish new support levels. Summary\n\nThe favorable outcome of the Ripple vs SEC case has revitalized the crypto market, leading to a rally in various coins. The ongoing developments in these cryptocurrencies indicate an evolving landscape with new opportunities for investors to explore.\n\nWhile Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Coin, and Cardano have each seen positive price movements, DigiToads stands out as the best DeFi crypto with its unique play-to-earn gaming concept and potential for significant growth.\n\nVisit DigiToads Presale\n\nMint DigiToads NFTs Here\n\nBuy DigiToads NFTs on OpenSea\n\nJoin the community\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "DOGE became one of the top gainers today after Elon Musk rebranded Twitter as X.\n\nThe meme token gained as much as 10%, topping a two-month high of $0.077.\n\nThe demand for Dogecoin increased after Musk briefly displayed its dog-themed logo in his Twitter bio.\n\nTraders also rushed to invest in multiple namesake tokens leading to triple-digit gains.\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) witnessed double-digit gains earlier today after Elon Musk rebranded Twitter as X. Musk, who bought Twitter in October last year, has owned the domain name X.com since 2017 and previously revealed his plans to turn it into \u201cthe everything app\u201d. The domain name now redirects users to Twitter and is part of the billionaire businessman\u2019s broader plan to turn the social networking platform into what he envisions as \u201cthe most valuable financial institution in the world.\u201d\n\nDogecoin Reaches Two-Month High Of $0.77\n\nElon Musk took to Twitter recently to announce his social networking platform\u2019s new identity. The rebranding included the X logo featured on Twitter\u2019s homepage, replacing the iconic blue bird logo.\n\nX is the future state of unlimited interactivity \u2013 centered in audio, video, messaging, payments/banking \u2013 creating a global marketplace for ideas, goods, services, and opportunities. Powered by AI, X will connect us all in ways we\u2019re just beginning to imagine.\u201d Linda Yaccarino, CEO of Twitter\n\nShortly after the announcement, traders scrambled to buy up DOGE, anticipating some role for the meme token in Twitter\u2019s overhaul. The memecoin gained as much as 10%, reaching a two-month high of $0.77. At the time of writing, DOGE was trading at $0.75. The buying frenzy led to a 374% increase in the memecoin\u2019s daily trading volume, which topped $1.38 billion.\n\nhttps://t.co/bOUOek5Cvy now points to https://t.co/AYBszklpkE.\n\n\n\nInterim X logo goes live later today. \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 23, 2023\n\nThe rebranding to X also led to several namesake tokens witnessing triple-digit gains. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that the price of one X token increased by a whopping 313%. Another token, X AI, which didn\u2019t even exist till last week, gained more than 166%.\n\nMusk has been vocal in his support for Dogecoin, going as far as enabling DOGE payments on The Boring Company, an online store that previously sold flamethrowers, perfumes, and even Tequila. Several of his cryptic tweets with a subtle hint of the dog-themed memecoin have sent its price soaring in the past.\n\nFollowing the announcement of X, he even displayed Dogecoin\u2019s logo in his Twitter bio briefly. In early April, members of the crypto community on Twitter reported that they could see the dog mascot of the meme coin instead of Twitter\u2019s logo on their homepage."

        "title": "TVL Of Coinbase-Backed Base, A Layer-2 Scaling Solution, Rockets 53% - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "According to data from L2Beat, the total value locked (TVL) of Base, a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum utilizing optimistic rollups, is up 53%. As of the latest figures, the TVL stands at $952,000 as various assets, mainly Ethereum (ETH), are tied up in the layer-2 protocol.\n\nBase Rapidly Growing\n\nThe platform\u2019s rising popularity among users can be attributed partly to the backing of Coinbase, one of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, which lends credibility. At its current pace of growth, Base has emerged as the fastest-expanding layer-2 protocol within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nOnly Zora Network, another layer-2 competitor backed by Coinbase, matches Base\u2019s growth with a TVL of $1.8 million as of July 24. Additionally, Starknet, a layer-2 platform utilizing zk Rollups, has experienced rapid growth, recording a 28% surge in TVL, now at $128 million.\n\nBase\u2019s increasing TVL coincides with a sharp contraction in Arbitrum, the most popular layer-2 platform on Ethereum by assets under management. At the time of writing, Arbitrum\u2019s TVL has fallen by 4% to $5.8 billion. At the same time, growth in Optimism, another optimistic rollup, and general-purpose layer-2 platform, has been slower.\n\nAlthough Base\u2019s growth has been impressive, looking at the TVL trends, the layer-2 platform remains under development. For instance, data shows that Base\u2019s developers are still building a \u201cstate validation system.\u201d However, while work continues, the platform\u2019s sequencer is upgradable, a feature that provides flexibility and is advantageous for protocols launching on Base.\n\nOptimism Releases Bedrock\n\nThe rapid growth in Base\u2019s TVL occurred just a few weeks after the upgrade of Optimism via Bedrock. The Bedrock hard fork in early June tagged several improvements improving performance.\n\nFor instance, by introducing optimized batch compression, Bedrock reduces the already low layer-2 transaction fees. In all platforms reliant on rollups, all transactions are batched before being confirmed on the mainnet. Bedrock brought changes by optimizing how it compresses these batched transactions translating to lower fees.\n\nAt the same time, Optimism, whose tech is used by Base, now relies on Ethereum\u2019s data availability layer. Considering the decentralized nature of Ethereum, the mainnet has higher uptime than Optimism, a layer-2 protocol that relies on a sequencer. Other improvements via Bedrock included reduced delays in including layer-1 transactions in rollups due to better re-organizations.\n\nEthereum developers are presently exploring more ways of scaling the platform on-chain with sharding on the table. Sharding, which will splinter Ethereum into small, interlinked segments called \u201cshards,\u201d would improve throughput, ultimately reducing gas fees and drawing more users and dapps to the pioneer smart contract platform.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView"

        "title": "Tokenized BTC On Ethereum Plunges 44% in 1 Year, What Happened? - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "According to data from Dune Analytics on July 24, the amount of Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC), a synthetic form of Bitcoin, circulating on Ethereum has fallen by 44% since May 2022. In July 2023, wBTC circulating on Ethereum stood at approximately 158,000 BTC, a sharp decline from 282,000 BTC recorded in May 2022.\n\nInterestingly, on-chain records also showed that the amount of wBTC minted and circulated in Ethereum, primarily for decentralized finance (DeFi) purposes, continued to rise in the first five months of 2022. It peaked in May 2022 amid a market-wide contraction of crypto prices that saw Bitcoin cool off from 2021 peaks of over $69,000.\n\nBTC On Ethereum Falls\n\nBitcoin holders often tokenize their coins, converting them into ERC-20 tokens in Ethereum to participate in various DeFi activities. These engagements may include staking to increase returns, yield farming to maximize returns, lending, and borrowing to receive USDT or DAI and other coins through platforms like MakerDAO.\n\nAmong the popular tokenized Bitcoin are wBTC, renBTC, tBTC, and others. However, as of July 24, a significant percentage of tokenized Bitcoin in Ethereum was wBTC, with over 158,000 tokens circulating. Users also chose other platforms to mint hBTC and renBTC.\n\nThe decline in tokenized Bitcoin highlights the general state of DeFi in Ethereum and other platforms, including BNB Chain, Avalanche, and Polygon. As of July, there has been a marked decline in DeFi activity over the past year from the number of assets locked in various protocols across the ecosystem.\n\nDeFi Activity Decimated By Bears\n\nDeFiLlama data on July 24 shows that the total value locked (TVL), an indicator of demand, has contracted from over $177 billion registered in November 2021 to less than $50 billion. Even so, while DeFi TVL has remained below $50 billion in 2023, most DeFi activity still revolves around Ethereum, highlighting its dominant position in the DeFi space. Data shows that Ethereum\u2019s share of the total TVL is over $24 billion, a more than 50% share.\n\nThe drop in DeFi activity can be primarily attributed to the crypto winter of 2022, a period of bearish market sentiment and reduced overall crypto market activity, which forced most asset prices to lower. Among the coins adversely affected by bears was ETH, the native currency of Ethereum, which fell from around $4,800 to as low as $1,100.\n\nDuring this time, tokens of top DeFi protocols, including Uniswap, posted deep losses. After peaking at around $45, UNI, the governance token of Uniswap, crashed to as low as $3 in the last bearish cycle.\n\nBeyond the effects of falling crypto prices in 2022, the relatively high fees in Ethereum have also impacted DeFi activity. Trackers on July 24 show that sending a simple ETH transaction attracts a $1.86 fee. Meanwhile, the same transaction costs cents in competing protocols like Polygon or Avalanche. Presently, a simple transfer via Polygon zkEVM, for instance, is $0.09.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView"

        "title": "Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple\u2019s XRP Price Prediction: BTC Breaks Crucial Support Ahead of FOMC Meeting \u2013 What\u2019s Next for The Apex Coins? - Crypto News Flash",
        "content": "As Bitcoin approaches the 100-day EMA at $28,344, the bearish outlook suggests a potential retest of the $27,500 level.\n\nRipple\u2019s XRP could potentially start the upward journey after collecting enough liquidity at $0.70.\n\nBitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market have come under strong selling pressure just ahead of the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on Wednesday, July 26.\n\nEarlier today, the BTC price collapsed all the way to $29,000 losing its crucial support at $29,872. Bitcoin\u2019s recent movement caused it to change the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) support at $29,363 into resistance (shown in red). As Bitcoin approaches the 100-day EMA at $28,344 (shown in green), the bearish outlook suggests a potential retest of the $27,500 level.\n\nThe negative outlook is unfortunate, especially with the upcoming FOMC report, an important economic event that could affect Bitcoin\u2019s price if it goes as expected. In the past, when the Federal Reserve (Fed) mentioned a decline in the US Dollar (USD), Bitcoin and USD often moved in opposite directions.\n\nThis time, the Fed meeting could still influence Bitcoin, although lately, it has had less impact. If Bitcoin loses the crucial support at $29,000, it may experience further losses and possibly reach the $27,500 support level. This could mean a 5 percent drop from its current price.\n\nBoth the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Awesome Oscillators (AO) are showing decreasing momentum, which is a positive sign for the bears. For investors willing to make any fresh entry, they can consider waiting up to the support levels of $27,500.\n\nEthereum Price Drops, A Pullback In XRP Possible\n\nEthereum (ETH) is facing challenges as sellers have become more active. The ETH price dropped below the 200-day EMA at $1,883 on the four-hour chart. This selling pressure caused ETH to reach the important support level of $1,824, which has been significant for several months. If the support at $1,824 is broken, Ethereum\u2019s price could decrease by 7 percent to around $1,720 or even lower, reaching the psychological support at $1,640.\n\nOn the positive side, if the bulls make a comeback, Ethereum\u2019s price could bounce back from the $1,824 support, just like what happened in late June and early July. In that case, ETH might recover the lost ground and potentially break through the resistance at $1,959. This could lead to a price increase of $6 from its current levels.\n\nOn the other hand, Ripple\u2019s XRP has registered a partial retracement to $0.70 after a solid price rally last week. The price of Ripple (XRP) has dropped below the support level of $0.711. This seems to be a deliberate move to gather buying interest after the volatility that followed the rally on July 13. When liquidity is collected, it usually stabilizes the market for a few days before the asset resumes its overall trend.\n\nAs a result, Ripple\u2019s price could potentially start moving upward again and stay within a certain range. However, if the market is highly bullish, XRP could go even higher, breaking through the resistance level at $0.823. This would represent a significant 20 percent increase from its current levels.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

        "title": "Revenue analysis of L1 blockchains: Ethereum and Tron dominate volumes thanks to crypto Pepe - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "In the second quarter of 2023, the memecoin mania unleashed by the PEPE crypto led the layer1s Ethereum and Tron to record a surge in volumes and revenue, up sharply from the previous quarter.\n\nEspecially in May, Ethereum validators thanked crypto frog Pepe for creating the conditions for stellar revenues.\n\nLet\u2019s look at all the details together.\n\nEthereum and Tron top the list of most profitable L1s: Pepe crypto triggers volume boom\n\nBlockchain research firm Messari highlighted how the memecoin mania triggered by the advent of the PEPE crypto created many benefits for Ethereum and Tron infrastructures during Q2 2023\n\nThe two blockchain networks saw their respective revenues increase especially during May, propelled by the large volumes generated on the DeFi platforms.\n\nOverall, revenue from Ethereum and Tron validators reached 93% of all L1 industry revenue in the second quarter.\n\nThe amount of net fees recorded on Vitalik Buterin\u2018s chain grew 83% on a QoQ basis, peaking at $32 million on 5 May, at the height of the hype caused by the Pepe crypto.\n\nIn the four-month reporting period, competitors BNB Chain, Polygon, Avalanche and the other smaller chains achieved a total gain of $74 million, 11 times less than that of Ethereum.\n\nAlso very interesting to note is that over the weekend of 6-7 May, the profits of validators reached 3,006.78 ETH, amounting to a counter value of $5.6 million, almost equal to what was recorded when the FTX exchange collapsed.\n\nThe flashboats dashboard shows how the gain was boosted enormously by MEV-boost payments, which in November 2022, during the exchange crash, came to 2,505.69 ETH, for a combined validators\u2019 revenue of 3,929.68 ETH ($6.1 million).\n\nIn all of this, insiders validating transactions on the two networks thanked Pepe and the traders who traded it relentlessly on DEXs like Uniswap.\n\nIt is amazing to observe how the trend of a memecoin like the Pepe crypto has created such fertile ground that Tron and Ethereum have been able to achieve these numbers.\n\nAlso noteworthy is how during 6-7 May, about 600 ETH were burned through the memecoin, which is more than Coinbase, Optimism, or Blur generated individually.\n\nMeme coins generating nice revenue for Ethereum.\n\n\n\nAround $1.1m of eth burnt this week for Pepe alone. pic.twitter.com/JWpg1KLtGX \u2014 Elie Steinbock (@elie2222) May 7, 2023\n\nThe general situation in the DeFi world\n\nLet\u2019s now try to broaden the horizon of analysis by looking at the overall situation of DeFi and the revenue it has generated so far, without focusing too much on Pepe or the individual Ethereum and Tron chains.\n\nIt is worth recalling that the decentralized finance sector, unlike the centralized counterpart run by cryptocurrency exchanges, is much younger and with a reduced history that sees the first results coming only in late 2020.\n\nIn just a few years, DeFi has grown a lot, both in terms of technologies and decentralized applications that can make sense of this industry, and in terms of volumes and revenue generated.\n\nCurrently the cumulative revenue of this financial environment is at $957 million, poised to reach the round figure of $1 billion by the end of the year.\n\nIts success stems not from the advent of crypto memes like Pepe, but from the enthusiasm of libertarian movements and new generations who do not want to delegate ownership of their crypto assets to third-party infrastructures and prefer self custody and decentralized exchanges on chains like Ethereum and Tron.\n\nThen again, if we think about it, it is absurd to think that Bitcoin and all other cryptocurrencies were born at the time to avoid financial intermediary situations, and then the same conditions with the spread of CEXs allowed the early years development of the industry.\n\nDeFi basically aims to offer a world where financial services are untethered from central entities, in which users can preserve their privacy without offering their personal data to the first competitor.\n\nUnfortunately, however, the market share of decentralized finance compared to CEXs is still very low with a value that currently stands at about 4%.\n\nAs for the most popular and most profitable protocols that populate the DeFi world we can mention the performance of Lido, Uniswap and MakerDAO, which generated fees of $52.18 mln $36.28 mln and $9.47mln in the last 30 days, respectively.\n\nThis is followed by projects such as Convex Finance, Aave, Gmx, Maestro, Blur, and Synthetix.\n\nIt is obvious how the Uniswap and Lido protocols represent the main benchmarks across the industry, with a respective TVL of $3.78bn and $14.67bn."

        "title": "Ethereum Classic Price Prediction: ETC Price Hovers Near $18.40 - The Coin Republic",
        "content": "The bullish rally for ETC price started during the middle of June 2023 as the price formed support near the $14.70 level. The surge was due to BlackRock filing for the Bitcoin Spot ETF.\n\nThis move led to the creation of a high at $23.30. The cryptocurrency price faced strong rejection from the $23.30 level due to the presence of bears above $23, which pushed the price below $21.\n\nAfter the rejection, the price shifted its trend to bearish and melted to form a support at $18.40. Recently, the price retested $20 and fell back to the same support level. The surge of 10% was due to the partial victory of Ripple (XRP).\n\nIf bears can shatter the support level of $18.40, the price might fall toward the major support level of $17, causing a downfall of approximately 7.53%.\n\nSource: ETC/USDT By TradingView.\n\nOn the other hand, if the price can sustain above $18.40 and gain bullish momentum, it might rise toward $20.20 in hopes of shattering it. For the price to retest the annual high of 24.95, it needs to break and close above $23.\n\nETC price action was praiseworthy during the first quarter of 2023 but the second quarter showed shabby performance.\n\nThe transactions have reached $5.03 Million with a transaction volume of 268,863. The daily active addresses are 13,052. The year-to-date return of Ethereum Classic is 18.23%.\n\nWill ETC Price Retest $20 Level?\n\nSource: ETC/USDT By TradingView.\n\nThe cryptocurrency price trades below 20,100 and 200-day EMAs. The 50-day EMAs have been acting as a support for the price. Currently, the price is facing rejection from the 50-day EMA.\n\nChaikin money flow score is -0.01, suggesting a slight weakness in the market. The relative strength index is 49.17 implying that the price is in neutral territory and the possibility of consolidation.\n\nLower time frames exhibit that price is currently in a narrow consolidation zone. The Bollinger bands have contracted hinting at low volatility in the market. The price is currently trading below the 20-day SMA of Bollinger and residing near the lower band with no certain signs of bullishness.\n\nIf the price can rise above $19, it can head toward the upper band. The long/short ratio is 0.86 with 46.34% longs and 53.66% shorts indicating a higher number of selling positions in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe market capitalization has also decreased by 0.43% to $115,048,222.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe market structure and price action of Ethereum Classic is currently indecisive as the price does not have momentum. The market leader Bitcoin is hovering near $30,000. There is a possibility that the price might consolidate in the current region for a while before making any moves. The longer the price consolidates, the more intense the breakout will be.\n\nTechnical Levels\n\nMajor Support: $18.40 and $17\n\nMajor Resistance: $20.20 and $21\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe views and opinions stated by the author, or any people named in this article, are for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Elon Musk\u2019s interest in creating the ambitious \u201ceverything app\u201d called \u201cX\u201d was evident even before he acquired Twitter in October 2022 for a staggering $44 billion.\n\nAt the time of writing, after Twitter\u2019s official rebranding to X, Musk\u2019s bio now includes a \u201cD\u201d resembling the DOGE logo.\n\nElon Musk\u2019s rebranding of Twitter as X has sparked anticipation within the crypto industry, leading many to wonder if this move will pave the way for the adoption of cryptocurrencies as a payment method on the newly branded platform.\n\nElon Musk\u2019s interest in creating the ambitious \u201ceverything app\u201d called \u201cX\u201d was evident even before he acquired Twitter in October 2022 for a staggering $44 billion. He has further stated that if executed effectively, the X app, integrating various features from payments to shopping, could potentially encompass a significant portion of the global financial system.\n\nBy renaming Twitter as X, Musk reaffirms his long-standing commitment to creating an all-encompassing super app comparable to China\u2019s WeChat, India\u2019s PayTM, and Indonesia\u2019s GoJek, which cater to diverse services and functionalities. The big question remains whether cryptocurrencies will play a crucial role in this transformative journey.\n\nTwitter\u2019s new CEO, Linda Yaccarino, unveiled the company\u2019s fresh logo and enthusiastically announced the arrival of \u201cX!\u201d in a recent post. In her earlier tweets, Yaccarino hinted at incorporating Artificial Intelligence into the new super app, emphasizing that \u201cX\u201d symbolizes the future of limitless interactivity, encompassing audio, video, messaging, payments, and banking. The ultimate goal is to establish a global marketplace where ideas, goods, services, and opportunities can thrive.\n\nExploring Potential Payment Tokens\n\nConsidering the Twitter owner\u2019s close ties to the cryptocurrency industry, it is conceivable that crypto payments might find a place in the super app\u2019s future. Elon Musk\u2019s extensive involvement with the popular meme coin, DOGE, also suggests the possibility of cryptocurrencies playing a significant role in \u201cX\u2019s\u201d payment system.\n\nWith Musk\u2019s new move to revolutionize users\u2019 financial transactions. Which tokens are likely to be the approved payment methods by X? At the top of the list, we can expect Bitcoin and Dogecoin, given their prominence and popularity. Other potential tokens include Ripple\u2019s XRP and Stellar (XLM).\n\nDogecoin (DOGE)\n\nThis is the obvious token that Musk will integrate on \u2018X.\u2019 At the time of writing, after Twitter\u2019s official rebranding to X, Musk\u2019s bio now includes a \u201cD\u201d resembling the DOGE logo.\n\nAdditionally, Elon Musk is closely linked to Dogecoin, often regarded as the \u201cfather of DOGE\u201d by the crypto community. Whenever Musk discusses, tweets about, or shares pictures of his Shiba Inu dog, the price of Dogecoin experiences a significant surge.\n\nIn addition to Dogecoin\u2019s strong association with the Twitter CEO, the blockchain presents several compelling reasons why it could be a suitable payment platform for X. Firstly, its fast transaction time (33 TPS) and low fees make it a promising payment system. Secondly, its widespread popularity ensures high liquidity, facilitating easy buying and selling and appealing to X users who may require swift asset liquidation when necessary.\n\nBitcoin (BTC)\n\nDue to its popularity, widespread adoption, and status as the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Bitcoin ranks as a preferred choice for those seeking to utilize it as a payment platform.\n\nAdditionally, X can utilize the Lightning Network, which operates on the Bitcoin blockchain and employs multi-signature wallets to establish off-chain payment channels. This implementation allows quicker transactions (1,000,000 TPS) at lower costs, enabling users to make transactions without waiting for block confirmations on the blockchain.\n\nRipple (XRP)\n\nRipple operates as a money transfer network tailored to meet the financial services industry\u2019s requirements. XRP serves as the native cryptocurrency of the Ripple network. With its scalability at 1,500 transactions per second (TPS) and its eco-friendly characteristics that render it carbon-neutral and energy-efficient, XRP becomes a potential candidate for consideration by Musk.\n\nStellar Lumens (XLM)\n\nStellar may be a straightforward choice for Elon Musk due to its primary purpose of facilitating swift and dependable movement of financial resources at a minimal expense. Notably, each cross-border payment platform transaction requires only 0.00001 XLM (equivalent to $0.000014 at current rates).\n\nAdditionally, Stellar\u2019s network can handle up to 4,000 transactions per second (TPS), with settlements occurring within 3 to 5 seconds, rendering it notably faster than numerous other blockchain platforms.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nEthereum is the most extensively utilized blockchain platform globally, benefiting from its high demand and widespread adoption, contributing to its liquidity. This indicates a strong willingness among crypto users to continue using Ethereum.\n\nNevertheless, Ethereum\u2019s transaction speeds of just 15 TPS and high gas fees might not position it as the preferred platform for Musk and X.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.
