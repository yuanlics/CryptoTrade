        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today. The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nCryptocurrency markets often undergo significant price fluctuations, leading to unique buying opportunities known as \"fire sales.\" The term refers to situations when an asset is perceived to be oversold, prompting interested investors to buy in at relatively low prices. For Ethereum (ETH), one of the leading indicators that tracks these opportunities is the rainbow chart, and it is currently signaling a \"fire sale.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo understand what this means, let's first examine the rainbow chart concept, typically used in Bitcoin (BTC) analysis. The Bitcoin rainbow chart is a logarithmic price chart that applies color-coded bands to represent the predicted price growth of BTC over time. Each color corresponds to different levels of price action, from the red \"maximum bubble territory\" to the dark blue \"basically a fire sale.\"\n\nThese charts are based on the assumption that Bitcoin's price will follow a predictable exponential growth pattern over the long term, with periodic boom-and-bust cycles.\n\nTranslating this to Ethereum, the rainbow chart concept suggests that Ethereum is currently in \"fire sale\" territory, indicating that ETH could be significantly undervalued at its current price levels.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to remember that these charts require different calculations when applied to Ethereum. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a capped supply and predictable inflation, Ethereum's monetary policy is more complex, particularly with its transition from proof of work (PoW) to proof of stake (PoS).\n\nThis shift alters Ethereum's inflation rate and introduces a new deflationary mechanism through the burning of transaction fees, fundamentally changing the dynamics that the rainbow chart seeks to model.\n\nWhile Ethereum's rainbow chart may currently indicate a \"fire sale,\" these metrics should not be used in isolation. Investors should account for Ethereum's unique monetary policy changes, market conditions and other technical indicators when making investment decisions."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nJust shy of $45 billion or 20% of Ethereum in circulation has been staked\u2014a milestone reached on Monday that captures coins at work like never before.\n\nPeople pledge tokens to the network to keep it secure and receive rewards for doing so. And close to 24 million Ethereum is currently locked up across 744,000 validators that process transactions, according to a dashboard on Dune Analytics created by a user named hildobby.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEthereum is one of many blockchains that utilizes a proof-of-stake consensus model, which, in the case of Ethereum, involves validators pledging at least 32 Ethereum for the chance to validate transactions and receive associated fees.\n\nBut that hasn\u2019t always been the case. In September of last year, after much anticipation, Ethereum transitioned from proof-of-work\u2014an energy-intensive process used by networks like Bitcoin\u2014to proof-of-stake. And for months, staked Ethereum couldn\u2019t be withdrawn until an upgrade this past April enabled it.\n\nFor reference, around $29 billion worth of Ethereum, or 14.5% of ETH in circulation, was pledged leading up to the pivotal Shanghai upgrade that enabled staking withdrawals.\n\nMonday\u2019s milestone represents a noteworthy achievement and captures the success of Ethereum\u2019s journey toward a consensus model that\u2019s ultimately friendlier on the environment, prominent venture capitalist and crypto analyst Adam Cochran told Decrypt.\n\n\u201cThis is a huge point of progress for the network, aligning economic incentives with security goals works and is critical for a decentralized network,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should all be proud of this milestone.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen it comes to how people stake their Ethereum, Lido Finance, the crypto market\u2019s largest liquid staking protocol, is by far the most popular choice. Allowing users to stake ETH in any amount and receive a staked Ethereum token called \u201cstETH\u201d in exchange, it accounts for nearly 32% of all staked Ethereum, according to Dune.\n\nCryptocurrency exchanges are also big players. Coinbase, Kraken, Binance, and OKX account for around 19% of all staked Ethereum, according to Dune. In a bear market, where trading volumes are depressed, staking has helped exchanges find an alternative source of revenue.\n\nYet regulators in the U.S. have their qualms with how staking services are offered to customers, alleging they run afoul of securities laws. Both Kraken and Coinbase have faced regulatory heat for staking products this year\u2014Kraken settled a lawsuit in February and Coinbase\u2019s is ongoing.\n\nFinancial institutions are paying attention to staking and exploring how it can bolster the products they offer, in Canada, at least. Two weeks ago, the digital asset manager 3iQ said two of its exchange-traded funds (ETFs) will offer staking to clients in August."

Considering long tail candles near $1800, if the altcoin manages to reclaim the bullish momentum, the buyers could break above the previous swing high of $1962.

This buying pressure reflects the price trend sustaining the recent resistance trendline breakout.\n\nBy the press time, the ETH price trades at $1879 and projects a potential double-bottom reversal. With sustained buying, the price trend is expected to return to the resistance trendline projecting a 4.5% gain and reclaiming the $1960 mark.\n\nOn a larger scale, the price trend maintains a sustained recovery within a rising channel pattern. In theory, a bullish upswing in the channel leads a rally back to the overhead trendline near $2500.\n\nWill ETH Price Lose $1730?\n\nThe ETH price upswing fails to create a significant higher high that displays a weakness in the underlying bullishness. Considering a pessimistic outlook, if the Ethereum price continues to face overhead supply near the $1960 mark. The sellers may lead a downfall to $1730 and retest the combined support of two trendline confluence.

        "content": "Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal is outlining the best-case scenario for Ethereum (ETH) rival Solana (SOL), saying that the smart contract platform could see a massive price increase.\n\nIn a new interview with the host of InvestAnswers, the macro guru says that Solana could follow in the footsteps of the leading altcoin when it skyrocketed after hitting a low in 2018.\n\nAt the time, Ethereum saw about a 47x increase. However, Pal says that he anticipates Solana seeing at least a 20x increase from current prices.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a potential, a possibility [of] a dream scenario that Solana does what ETH did from the 2018 low, which was a 47x. And so [the] Solana low was $9, so you could do the math, the numbers are potentially very interesting \u2013 that it\u2019ll be 20-something X from here for Solana.\u201d\n\nSolana is trading for $21.84 at time of writing, a 1.48% increase during the last 24 hours. If Pal\u2019s prediction comes to light, SOL could be worth about $436.\n\nPal goes on to say that he believes Bitcoin (BTC) could double or triple up from its all-time high, adding that such a rise would be modest and the worst bull run in the crypto king\u2019s history.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to predict where it actually goes, but what we can say is it\u2019s reasonable that Bitcoin, from all-time highs, doubles or triples. That\u2019s not asking a lot. That will be the worst bull market in Bitcoin\u2019s history\u2026\n\nIt probably triples from the all-time high and currently it\u2019s at $30,000 so that\u2019s a 6x from here. That\u2019s pretty good. And the upside is maybe I\u2019m totally wrong and it gets complete panic to the upside\u2026\n\nWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to be happening in the economy in 2025, what could be driving prices, so I think you [can] get the upside for free.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is trading for $30,321 at time of writing, a fractional increase during the last 24 hours.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum are trading at an enticing discount on Binance.US, but not all users will be able to leverage it.\n\nAt nearly $27,500, Bitcoin is trading about $2,500 lower on Binance.US compared to global spot markets. Ethereum, on the other hand, was trading at $1,700 \u2013 a discount of $200, offering market participants a better price than other crypto exchanges.\n\nDiscount Concerns\n\nCrypto users took to Twitter to address the situation and termed it a \u201cdepeg\u201d of cryptocurrencies, a term denoting a significant divergence from the global spot prices.\n\nBut it\u2019s not easy to take advantage of the disparity since discounted cryptocurrencies can only be purchased via USD holdings. However, Binance.US suspended USD deposits into the platform on June 9. This essentially leaves only those users with USD already sitting on the exchange to grab the arbitrage opportunity.\n\nAnother instance of price anomaly on a Binance platform was observed in late May when the Australian branch of the crypto giant witnessed a massive decline in Bitcoin\u2019s price compared to global spot prices.\n\nThe event unfolded after the termination of fiat on- and off-ramps by the company\u2019s third-party payments provider. Subsequently, Bitcoin\u2019s price on Binance\u2019s Australian platform plummeted by 20% against the AUD relative to global prices.\n\nTether CTO Chimes in\n\nBesides Bitcoin and Ethereum, the world\u2019s largest stablecoin \u2013 USDT \u2013 was also trading below $1 on the exchange, which fueled FUD in the community. In an attempt to alleviate concerns, Paolo Ardoino, the CTO of the stablecoin issuer, explained that the lack of many market makers willing to arbitrage could be behind the disparity considering Binance.US is embroiled in legal challenges.\n\nThe exec further added that Tether is in charge of its primary market, while arbitrageurs and market-making professionals are responsible for market-making secondary markets i.e., crypto exchanges.\n\n\u201cBTC/USD trades at 27600 there (30.1k on other exchanges). seems there is a general spread of ~8%. does it mean that BTC is also worth less globally? Of course not. The same logic applies. do the math on the spread for BTC/USD and USDt/USD and you get pretty much the same percentage.\u201d"

This collaboration aims to minimize the costs associated with operating a node.\n\nThe company will also be setting a limit of 22% share on all staked ETH. This decision is made to prevent centralization of staking, Amitej Gajjala, the CEO and cofounder of Stader Labs explained. Noting that Lido, the most predominant liquid staking protocol, holds over 90% of the entire market share.\n\n\u201cTo help alleviate these challenges and maintain our pledge to keep Ethereum decentralized, Stader has imposed a self-limit of 22% share of all staked ETH to mitigate centralization and promote a fair and balanced distribution of power among Ethereum staking solutions,\u201d Gajjala said in a statement.\n\nFollowing the Shapella upgrade which enabled withdrawals on Ethereum, staking ETH has risen in popularity.

The crypto market will have its eye on inflation numbers and jobless claims, two figures that the Fed will consider when making its next moves on rates.\n\n\n\nBitcoin continued to weaken further on Monday. The largest crypto token dropped further but managed to hold around $30,000-mark. Its largest peer, Ethereum, also declined slightly and slipped below $1,900-level. However, price action in other altcoins was majorly on the downside.\n\n\n\nBitcoin entered the new week with a sideways trading pattern, maintaining its position above the $30,000 mark. It has been trading between the level $30,000 and $31,400 since the past few days. This range suggests that both bullish and bearish forces are actively participating in the market, said Edul Patel, Co-founder and CEO at Mudrex.\n\n\n\n\"There is a decrease in volatility since last week, indicating a consolidation phase for its next move. If bulls fail to sustain the US$30,000 support level, the next key support level to monitor would be around $29,500, potentially triggering a breakout,\" he added.\n\n\n\nAll of the top crypto token were trading lower on Monday. Litecoin dropped as much as 4 per cent, while Tron declined 3 per cent each. Polkadot, Dogecoin, Solana and Cardano shed 3 per cent each during the early trade. XRP and BNB were also among the top laggards.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading lower, dropping to $1.17 trillion-mark as it declined almost a per cent in the last 24 hours.

        "content": "Shiba Inu enthusiasts are eagerly anticipating the upcoming launch of Shibarium. The Layer 2 solution designed for the Shiba Inu ecosystem.\n\nShibarium is anticipated to have a significant impact on reducing gas fees on the Shiba Inu network ultimately making it more accessible and affordable for users. This development has attracted investors who are already showing interest in SHIB prior to the Shibarium launch over recent weeks.\n\nThe price of SHIB has been steadily rising and was trading as high as $0.0000085 according to TradingView. Experts predict that following the Shibarium launch there is a possibility that the price could even reach $0.0000100, if not higher.\n\nThe Shibarium launch is scheduled to take place in August 2023; although an exact date hasn\u2019t been disclosed yet. Developers assure that they remain on track with their schedule.\n\nOnce Launched Shibarium will mark a significant milestone for the Shiba Inu ecosystem by introducing improved scalability and efficiency for better user interaction with the network. Consequently this highly anticipated event is also expected to positively influence SHIBs price and potentially lead to wider token adoption. The following are key benefits associated with Shibarium:\n\n1) Reduced gas fees: By implementing a proof of stake consensus mechanism instead of Ethereums current proof of work mechanism. Shibarium will substantially lower gas fees on the Shiba Inu network.\n\n2) Increased scalability: Compared to Ethereum. Shibarium will be capable of processing a higher number of transactions per second. This enhancement will greatly improve scalability and overall efficiency for the Shiba Inu network.\n\n3) Enhanced user experience: With reduced gas fees and increased scalability provided by Shibarium users will find it more convenient and cost effective to interact within the Shiba Inu ecosystem. The much anticipated launch of Shibarium is undoubtedly poised to be a major catalyst within the Shiba Inu community.\n\nFurther driving growth and development in the ecosystem. The launch of Shibarium is an important development for the Shiba Inu ecosystem. By making the network more scalable, efficient and user friendly it has the potential to increase adoption of the token and raise the price of SHIB. However. It is important to be aware of the risks associated with this project.\n\nThere is a possibility that the project could be delayed or canceled despite the good track record of the Shibarium developers. Additionally, there is always a risk that the project may not meet expectations or could be vulnerable to hacking. If hacking were to occur, it could negatively impact the reputation of the Shiba Inu ecosystem and potentially cause a decline in SHIBs price."

        "content": "Several Bitcoin NFT collections registered higher volumes than Ethereum.\n\nSince BRC-69 came into play, Ordinals Inscriptions have increased.\n\nBitcoin Ordinals, which represent the NFTs created on the Bitcoin [BTC] network, seems to be closing in on their Ethereum [ETH] counterparts in terms of dominance. By looking at CryptoSlam\u2019s data, Bitcoin NFT sales have grown by 8301% in the last 24 hours.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC terms\n\nThis was in high contrast to the volume on the Ethereum blockchain which only registered a 1.33% increase within the same period. However, it was worth noting that Ethereum\u2019s sales were way above Bitcoin\u2019s.\n\nThe flipping could be in motion\n\nAt the time of writing, overall sales of digital collectibles on Ethereum were $14.75 million. On the other hand, Bitcoin NFTs recorded $6.69 million. But that\u2019s not all.\n\nOne eye-catching occurrence in the sector was how Bitcoin Ordinals had sent the blue-chip Ethereum NFTs off the top of sales.\n\nAccording to the NFT aggregator, collections including $INSC BRC-20 NFTs, Uncategorized Ordinals, and $ BRC-20 NFTs had much more volume than the likes of Azuki, BAYC, and MAYC.\n\nThis flip suggests that traders\u2019 interest in Bitcoin NFTs surpassed that of Ethereum. And one reason linked to the latter\u2019s inability to claim traction was the falling floor prices of the top collections.\n\nEarlier Ethereum held the mantle as the king of volume when it comes to NFTs. This was because of the traction it gained during the mass adoption of 2021. But since the year began, collections under the blockchain have struggled to witness a steady long-period climb.\n\nAnd it was during this same period that Bitcoin Ordinals emerged. While there have been controversies about its operation on the Bitcoin network, the development backed by the Taproot network has continued to gain adoption.\n\nAnother high on the cards\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin Ordinals has not only limited its potency to its initial application. Lately, the introduction of Inscriptions has led to the rise of BRC-20 fungible tokens.\n\nHowever, it was also important to highlight that these developments have caused some issues on the Bitcoin network.\n\nIn May, at the height of Ordinals\u2019 adoption, Bitcoin experienced a slowdown in block confirmation and transactions. And this was one of the reasons there was a conflict of interest among Bitcoin developers.\n\nBut last week, Luminex, a Bitcoin Ordinals\u2019 launch pad, proposed the BRC-69 standard to curb this challenge.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 BTCs worth today?\n\nAccording to Luminex, BRC-69, with the integration of Recursive Inscriptions, would help with the high demand for Bitcoin Ordinals while avoiding any case of transaction delay.\n\nSince the introduction, other Ordinals inscriptions besides texts, audio, or applications have emerged. This has also resulted in the total daily Inscriptions reaching the highest since 7 May. According to Dune Analytics, the total number of Inscription minted on 9 July was 385,920."

        "title": "What Are Ethscriptions? A Beginner's Guide - Unchained - Unchained",
        "content": "Ethscriptions provide a new way to create image-based NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain, taking inspiration from the emergence of Bitcoin Ordinals.\n\nThe rise of Bitcoin Ordinals in January 2023 has presented Ethereum and Solana-based projects with serious competition. Ethscriptions draw inspiration from Ordinals but are built on the Ethereum blockchain. In this article, we\u2019ll explore how Ethscriptions work and differ from traditional Ethereum NFTs.\n\nWhat Are Ethscriptions?\n\nEthscriptions (Ethereum Inscriptions) are digital artifacts onto the Ethereum blockchain, enabling a new type of on-chain NFT on Ethereum through the inscription of image data.\n\nWhile NFTs use the ERC-721 protocol that utilizes smart contracts, Ethscriptions rely on transaction calldata (the data contained in an Ethereum transaction). Creators ensure the immutability of each asset through a uniform resource identifier (URI) within the data. The URI helps ensure the lack of identical content in prior or current blocks.\n\nHow Do Ethscriptions Work?\n\nEthscriptions allow users to inscribe non-financial data on the Ethereum blockchain. According to the creator, the protocol ensures cheaper costs and a more decentralized approach than smart contract storage.\n\nThree critical rules guide the workings of Ethscriptions:\n\nThe input data of a successful Ethereum transaction must comprise a valid data URI that is unique.\n\nA valid Ethscription transfer requires the sender to be its owner and the Ethereum transaction to contain a valid Ethscription transaction hash in its input data.\n\nThe URI\u2019s uniqueness requires the content not to match the content of an Ethscription from a previous block or a transaction in the same block.\n\nA key feature of Ethscriptions is the 96KB file requirement for a single asset. According to the creator, Tom Lehman, Ethscriptions can only store images currently. However, there are plans to advance beyond images and include other file formats.\n\nHow Are Ethscriptions Created?\n\nThere are four steps in creating an Ethscription:\n\nEnsure your chosen image is 96KB or smaller and convert it into a base64-encoded data URI. Various online tools offer this service. Using online tools such as Hexhero, convert the data URI to hex. In a 0 ETH transaction, add the hex data in the \u201chex data\u201d field to the desired recipient. Wait a few moments for the information on the new owner to appear on the ethscriptions.com website. If it doesn\u2019t, that means it\u2019s duplicate content of data someone else had already ethscribed.\n\nOnce the process is complete, you can track the Ethscription on ethscriptions.com. Indexer platforms, such as Etherscan, also come in handy for users who find them convenient.\n\nHow Are Ethscriptions Different From (Traditional) Ethereum NFTs?\n\nThe storage mechanism is the most significant difference between Ethscriptions and traditional NFTs. Ethscriptions are stored on-chain, whereas traditional Ethereum-based NFTs store data off-chain.\n\nThe idea behind on-chain storage is that it saves on costs since there is no off-chain storage like in traditional NFTs.\n\nThe Ethscriptions protocol only reinterprets existing Ethereum data. The decentralized nature of that data implies that no party can control the usage through banning and granting permissions. For traditional NFTs, specific contracts store the data, creating the possibility of individual parties claiming control.\n\nWhen creating an Ethereum NFT, the creator links their file to the block. The NFTs value comes from the proof of ownership with the actual file stored off-chain. With Ethscriptions, calldata allows for on-chain information storage on the Ethereum network.\n\nHow Do Ethscriptions Compare To Bitcoin Ordinals?\n\nAt this point, you might be wondering how Ethscriptions compare to Bitcoin Ordinals, given some fundamental similarities.\n\nOrdinals support various file types, including games, images, music, and video. Ethscriptions only support images with indications that this may change in the future. The 4MB file capacity per Ordinal allows versatility, with Ethscriptions being limited to 96KB.\n\nStorage of Ethscriptions in the calldata field leaves them vulnerable to pruning via EIP-4444. The data pruning module proposes the purging of specific data that is more than a year old. For Ordinals, storage on the block header ensures security from any pruning.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe introduction of Ethscriptions in June 2023 shifts the conversation around NFT innovation back to the Ethereum network. With Ethereum boasting its position as the go-to NFT chain, a project that runs on the same principles as Bitcoin Ordinals may offer Ethereum a chance to maintain its leading position in the NFT market.\n\nWhether Ethscriptions have the staying power largely depends on the improvements the creator has hinted at. With file size and type limitations, concerns about utility and scalability linger."

Optimism and Arbitrum are two successful examples of \u201crollups\u201d that could serve as case studies for Bitcoin, he said, adding that it would \u201cbe good to have an open mind\u201d with regards to ZK-snark based solutions\u2014indicating a clear preference.\n\nEthereum has been experimenting with a wide variety of scaling solutions over the years, and is in the process of its latest update, EIP-4844, which introduces blob blocks\u2013enabling up to 100,000 transactions per second.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWall pushed the idea that Bitcoin should be studying these trials, fearing that the ecosystem will be left with less secure rollups. Buterin responded that the proposal will likely draw \u201ccontroversy with security hawks.\u201d\n\nWall, who has been taking center stage as of late with the Taproot Wizards, brought up Bitcoin\u2019s security model, and the 21 million hard cap. It\u2019s a question that Buterin said he has grappled with, although he pointed to Ordinals as providing a reasonable fee market to cover the reducing block subsidies as well as subsequent security concerns.\n\nButerin also thinks Ordinals have brought a \u201creturn to builder culture\u201d which in his words \u201cis very good.\u201d He added that he \u201cdefinitely see signs of hope now that we have Ordinals,\u201d calling them a \u201creal pushback to laser eyed maximalism.\u201d\n\nButerin also tried to find ten things that both ecosystems shared. He pointed to claims of immutability by both chains, along with the fact they both have issues with layer-1 privacy. Buterin also mentioned that both Ethereum and Bitcoin have showcased how difficult it is to do things in decentralized consensus models.\n\nThe Ethereum co-founder ended on a rather optimistic note, trying possibly to bring together both communities.\n\n\u201cI think a world where there is at least one of these chains is better than one with none,\u201d he concluded."

        "content": "Bitcoin's native non-fungible tokens (NFTs), known as \"Ordinals,\" are on the verge of surpassing Ethereum in the NFT market, according to data from Crypto Slam.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOrdinals have seen a significant surge in both sales and active buyers, achieving an impressive 129.50% growth in USD sales and attracting close to 10% of the buyer market.\n\nEthereum still currently leads the NFT sector with a sales total of over $24 million, however, the rapid rise of Bitcoin's Ordinals suggests that a \"flip\" could be imminent.\n\nOrdinals, which have been rapidly gaining traction since their inception in April 2023, are unique digital assets inscribed on a satoshi, the smallest unit of Bitcoin.\n\nTheir creation was facilitated by the Taproot upgrade, launched on the Bitcoin network in November 2021, which made it possible to inscribe data on the Bitcoin network in a way that's similar to creating NFTs on other blockchain platforms. Since their launch, Ordinals have been creating a stir in the Bitcoin community, setting record numbers of inscriptions on multiple occasions.\n\nApart from Bitcoin's Ordinals and Ethereum's NFTs, several other blockchains have also made significant strides in the NFT market. Solana holds the third spot, showing robust sales growth of 44.61% with total sales of $1.2 million and attracting 31.40% of buyers, a number that surpasses even Ethereum's buyer market share.\n\nPolygon follows closely behind in the fourth position, with a sales increase of 30.75% amounting to $1.3 million.

        "content": "Crypto.com launches on-chain staking for Ethereum, Solana, and Polkadot\n\nSingapore-based cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.com has added support for on-chain staking, which allows clients in select markets to tap into rewards offered by certain types of cryptocurrencies running on proof-of-stake networks.\n\nStaking, the company explained, enables users to earn dividends or interest on their digital assets for validating transactions and also allows them to vote on changes in the blockchain. Users are rewarded for simply depositing and holding coins on Crypto.com App as they normally would.\n\nMoreover, users have the flexibility to stake or unstake their assets without being subjected to a mandatory lockup period. Initially, the Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Polkadot (DOT) blockchains will be available for staking within the Crypto.com platform, with plans to include more protocols in the future.\n\nOn-chain staking is a process specific to Proof-of-Stake blockchains that involves staking cryptocurrency directly on the blockchain itself. Conversely, off-chain staking, also known as lending, does not require staking your crypto directly on the blockchain.\n\nThe key difference between on-chain and off-chain staking is that on-chain staking supports the network and is rewarded, while off-chain staking is purely financially motivated and does not have any technical purpose for the blockchain. Both types of staking carry their own risks, with off-chain staking being the riskiest since it occurs outside the blockchain.\n\nWe last reported on Crypto.com in June when it announced plans to discontinue its institutional exchange service for professional customers in the United States.\n\nThe Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange cited a decline in demand, likely influenced by the current market conditions in the US, including the ongoing legal actions against prominent exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase.\n\nAccording to a statement from Crypto.com, the platform provided advance notice to its institutional users regarding the suspension of its institutional service. The exchange also stressed that its retail mobile application and platform will continue to operate as usual for users in the United States.\n\nFurthermore, Crypto.com continues to offer cryptocurrency derivatives trading that is regulated by the CFTC. Additionally, retail users have been assured that the UpDown Options product remains accessible in the United States.\n\nThe crypto exchange stated that it might consider reopening its institutional trading platform in the future if there is a shift in market conditions. However, it refrained from divulging further details regarding the specific changes that would need to resume operations."

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin says BTC's 'really weird politics' holding back adoption - CoinGeek",
        "content": "Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin believes BTC really needs to address its scaling limitations but the \u2018laser-eye\u2019 crowd won\u2019t let that happen.\n\nLast week, Buterin participated in a nearly two-hour long Twitter Space, taking questions from Eric Wall and Udi Wertheimer, the self-identified \u2018Taproot Wizards\u2019 who recently started completely filling individual BTC blocks with large JPEGs to test the viability of the new Ordinals protocol.\n\nThis activity was hugely controversial in the BTC space, mainly because of the protocol\u2019s notoriously constrained transaction capacity. One side viewed Ordinals as a sorely needed expansion beyond the protocol\u2019s limited functionality as \u2018digital gold,\u2019 while purists complained about NFT transactions delaying pure payment transactions from making it into the next blocks on the chain.\n\nAsked by the hosts about this divide, Buterin said his own experience with Ethereum taught him that \u201cdoing things in consensus is hard \u2026 it\u2019s a property of social systems in general.\u201d Buterin likened it to congested city traffic woes, saying it\u2019s easier to for a small team to create Uber than for multiple committees to figure out the best way to solve public transit.\n\nButerin lamented the fact that BTC has effectively merged its technical and cultural systems, resulting in \u201creally weird politics holding it back.\u201d Buterin believes \u201cmaximalism is crazy. Sometimes people in [BTC-land] say things that go way too extreme, crazy and factually incorrect and falsifiable six months later. I wasn\u2019t really into being part of that.\u201d\n\nButerin turned the tables on his hosts, asking what the top-five arguments would be if he were a BTC Core developer who proposed an expansion of BTC\u2019s block-size to 32Mb. The hosts acknowledged there simply wasn\u2019t the political will within BTC for such a step, saying \u201cit will be the first thing people reject, just as an instinct.\u201d\n\nLightning in a very small bottle with a stubborn cork\n\nThe hosts suggested there was a mindset within BTC to \u201cfully exhaust\u201d second-layer (L2) solutions before being forced to admit that increasing the main layer\u2019s block-size is the only way forward. \u201cThat would be a big failure case for BTC culture.\u201d The hosts added that BTC has effectively \u201ctied itself to the Lightning Network mast,\u201d with the BTC Core developers having \u201cbasically given up on main layer\u201d tinkering.\n\nButerin said \u201cthe Lightning Network criticism that made the most sense to me was that it doesn\u2019t do enough.\u201d Citing the BTC main layer\u2019s seven-transactions-per-second limit, Buterin said it would take 80 years to onboard the global population onto Lightning, and that\u2019s without factoring in existing Lightning users looking to do other transactions like rebalancing.\n\nThe hosts added that \u201ceven medium-sized Lightning payments fail so frequently that they\u2019re looking to use AI to find better ways to predict which payment routes will work and which will fail. When someone tells me they need AI to make a transaction, then I feel something architecturally is too complex.\u201d\n\nEthereum has dealt with its own scaling issues\u2014which can result in transaction fees occasionally soaring to punitive heights\u2014by imposing an ever greater array of L2 solutions, including Plasma, various types of roll-ups and sharding, which splits Ethereum\u2019s main layer into multiple parallel-processing chains.\n\nButerin suggested a similar Rube Goldberg scenario might alleviate BTC\u2019s concerns, saying \u201cyou could stack these things on top of each other, make Lightning on top of Plasma, a system in which all three exist as payment options,\u201d leaving it up to the system \u201cto find automatically which one actually works.\u201d (Nothing like trying to solve a problem by creating ever more attack vectors and potential points of failure.)\n\nThe hosts wondered if this would just be \u201cturning BTC into Ethereum,\u201d suggesting that this was BTC\u2019s \u201cplan all along: observe Ethereum, let them deal with the growth pains and if it works, we\u2019ll write a [BTC improvement proposal] and see if it gets consensus.\u201d\n\nNaturally, all this public shaming of Lightning\u2019s numerous flaws didn\u2019t sit well with Blockstream\u2019s Adam Back, who tweeted that \u201cwe already told [Ethereum devs] things to avoid for security/complexity \u2026 in 2014 and they ignored us and did the opposite, so I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s that much to learn.\u201d\n\nBear in mind that this is the same Back who has insisted for years that Lightning is perennially 18 months away from reaching critical mass. Despite Lightning\u2019s original chest-thumping about eventually surpassing Visa and Mastercard in transaction volume, it remains a transaction cul-de-sac, in part because most BTC users bought their tokens as \u2018digital gold,\u2019 not the peer-to-peer electronic cash described in Bitcoin\u2019s 2008 white paper.\n\nStill, Lightning\u2019s recent adoption by the compliance-averse Binance exchange will no doubt boost transaction volume, although the purpose of those transactions will likely be exposed as criminal/fraudulent once the U.S. Department of Justice completes its ongoing probe of Binance\u2019s shady dealings.\n\nProof of crime\n\nKeeping law enforcement in the dark re blockchain transactions was a key plank of Tornado Cash, Ethereum\u2019s primary \u2018mixing service\u2019 that allowed users to obfuscate the origin of ETH tokens. The service was blacklisted last August by the U.S. Treasury Department, citing its use in aiding North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program and its developers\u2019 alleged ties to Russian security services.\n\nWell and Wertheimer suggested that both BTC and Ethereum were \u201cvery far today from achieving base-layer privacy\u201d for users, although they fingered Ethereum as even less private, because of the network\u2019s embrace of smart contracts.\n\nButerin admitted that other blockchains have far greater privacy benefits but these chains\u2019 tokens \u201cend up getting delisted from exchanges\u201d under pressure from financial watchdogs. Buterin somewhat grandiosely suggested that both BTC and Ethereum are \u201ctoo big to fail. We have weight and so we shouldn\u2019t be afraid to throw that weight around to protect people\u2019s privacy.\u201d\n\nHowever, Buterin acknowledged that, despite the chains\u2019 alleged \u2018weight,\u2019 achieving this goal would be \u201ca tough political game, man.\u201d He longed for a world in which governments and regulators \u201cdon\u2019t ban the money, [instead] ban the things the money is being used for,\u201d although he admitted that this cryptopian fantasy was a \u201cvery unrealistic longshot.\u201d\n\nButerin offered a potential workaround that would permit coin-mixers to continue operating via a concept he called \u2018proof of innocence.\u2019 The general idea is that coins you funnel into a mixer could be distinguished from crime-connected coins by a \u201ccentral party\u201d who would be tasked with flagging coins/wallets of dubious character. This would \u201cexclude large classes of bad people but still give backdoor-free actual privacy for everyone else.\u201d\n\nButerin suggested Chainalysis and MetaMask as potentially filling these centralized coin-flagging roles, notably dodging any responsibility for the Ethereum Foundation. That\u2019s a significant departure from 2016, when Buterin and the other major Ethereum developers intervened to hard-fork the network following the infamous hack of a decentralized (in name only) autonomous organization.\n\nNonetheless, Buterin bristled at the notion that Ethereum was considered \u201cthe intervention chain,\u201d pointing out that other chains have occasionally taken steps to freeze or recover lost or stolen tokens.\n\nButerin further qualified his commitment to justice by noting that it would be up to chain users to decide whether or not they wanted to implement this \u2018proof of innocence,\u2019 and that there would be no \u201centrenched rules or authorities\u201d on which to rely in times of need. Unless, of course, it\u2019s the Foundation devs\u2019 coins that are in need of rescue.\n\nThings change quickly\n\nThe discussion wrapped with Buterin claiming that BTC\u2019s Ordinals flirtation was \u201cstarting to bring back a culture of actually doing things \u2026 some kind of organic return to builder culture\u201d that was a \u201creal pushback to the laser-eye movement.\u201d\n\nOkay, but the BTC fundamentalists have fiercely resisted nearly every proposal to expand their one true faith beyond its current function-free \u2018store of value\u2019 state and there\u2019s no guarantee that Ordinals will be able to shift that dial. And Buterin suggested there was \u201cvalue\u201d in BTC \u201cmaking choices different from Ethereum so the two aren\u2019t taken down by the same thing.\u201d\n\nThat is, unless that \u2018thing\u2019 is regulatory authorities publicly acknowledging that both BTC and ETH are unregistered securities. The fact that current legal actions against U.S.-facing exchanges like Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN) and Binance.US have yet to cite BTC or ETH as securities doesn\u2019t rule out the possibility that more actions are in the pipeline.\n\nAs Buterin himself put it while describing the pace of change in the digital asset space, \u201cthings change quickly.\u201d And depending on where you\u2019re sitting, not always for the better.\n\nFollow CoinGeek\u2019s Crypto Crime Cartel series, which delves into the stream of groups\u2014from BitMEX to Binance, Bitcoin.com, Blockstream, ShapeShift, Coinbase, Ripple,\n\nEthereum, FTX and Tether\u2014who have co-opted the digital asset revolution and turned the industry into a minefield for na\u00efve (and even experienced) players in the market.\n\nNew to blockchain?

        "content": "After a long and difficult period, it seems that Ethereum ($ETH) is finally ready for a recovery. $ETH has finally started to show chances for approaching the long-desired value of $2000, which is fantastic news for all those who have either invested in $ETH or are planning to do so. But the question arises: how long will it take for Ethereum to reach this value?\n\nWill Ethereum reach this value soon or will some other coins manage to reach their milestones faster? And what can we expect first: that $ETH reaches $2000 or, for example, that the much younger Wall Street Memes ($WSM) reaches the $14 million milestone? Let\u2019s see which one of these two cryptos, according to the analysis of the experts, shows chances for faster success!\n\nBuy Wall Street Memes Now!\n\nEthereum ($ETH) is approaching the long-desired value of $2,000!\n\nAfter a long and challenging period that befell the entire crypto world, one of the most famous cryptocurrencies, Ethereum ($ETH), finally started to show an upward trend. Although Ethereum did not \u201csuffer\u201d to the extent that some other cryptos did, it is still a fact that this crypto also faced problems and that in the previous period, it experienced quite a price drop.\n\nBut it seems the summer is bringing Ethereum a noticeable improvement. In mid-June, $ETH started to experience value growth and managed to bring its value to $1,951.71. This jump in value has made investors wonder if and when $ETH could reach the long-desired $2000. Crypto experts believe that $ETH could reach this value at the end of the year, to be more precise, in December. So, for Ethereum to reach $2K, it will take several months.\n\nThe fact that the further development of this crypto will happen slowly, has \u201cforced\u201d investors to look for another crypto which is predicted to achieve success much faster. And just one look at the situation in the crypto world is enough to find such a coin. It is, of course, Wall Street Memes ($WSM), currently the most popular meme coin that will manage not only to raise a fantastic $14 million but also very likely to complete its presale, far before Ethereum manages to reach the aforementioned $2K. So let\u2019s see what makes Wall Street Memes ($WSM) so special!\n\nWall Street Memes ($WSM): An unstoppable meme coin that is set for massive gains!\n\nYou may be wondering what has influenced the lightning success of the Wall Street Memes ($WSM) presale, and the growing demand for $WSM tokens.\n\nFirst of all, the success that the creators of this meme coin achieved in 2021 is \u201cresponsible\u201d for the initial interest of investors during the first days of the Wall Street Memes ($WSM) presale. It could be said that then the Wall Street Memes \u201cbrand\u201d was established. Then, the creators of this meme coin managed to sell out their Wall St Bulls NFT collection in just 32 minutes. Therefore, the initial interest of users is certainly partly based on that.\n\nBut now, it seems that the user\u2019s interest in investing in this meme coin is based on the predictions of experts, who are convinced that $WSM is the next 100X coin! According to their analysis, thanks to the huge Wall Street Memes community (which has more than an incredible million members), $WSM will manage to secure a place in the top-tier crypto exchanges! And that, of course, will leave a positive effect on the further increase in the value of the $WSM tokens.\n\nNot only is it predicted that $WSM will achieve massive gains and thus bring profit to all early investors, but 30% of the token supply will be reserved for rewarding the community, which is an additional plus, and an additional incentive for everyone to join the Wall Street Memes ($WSM) presale as soon as possible!\n\nFrom the first day of the presale, it seemed that the $WSM token was unstoppable, and as the presale goes on, as the interest in this meme coin grows, and as its community becomes bigger and bigger, that seems to be true. So grab this meme coin in time. The earlier you join the presale, the better!\n\nBuy Wall Street Memes Now!\n\nDon\u2019t miss the opportunity to join the Wall Street Memes ($WSM) presale!\n\nAt this moment, Wall Street Memes ($WSM) can boast of more than $13 million raised, which means that it is approaching the next milestone with sure steps. So, it\u2019s a matter of time before 14 million will be raised, but also, if such great interest continues, it\u2019s a matter of the day when the presale will be completed!\n\nThe end of the Wall Street Memes ($WSM) presale can be expected after a bit more than $14.5 million is raised, and as things stand, that is very likely to happen very soon. So, don\u2019t waste your time, use these last moments to join the Wall Street Memes ($WSM) presale!\n\nNow you have a unique opportunity to invest in $WSM at a price of only $0.031! Already during the next presale phase, the price of the $WSM token will jump to $0.0313. So, don\u2019t wait for the price to go up, but grab this coin ASAP!\n\nBuy Wall Street Memes Now\n\nConclusion\n\nThe chances of Ethereum ($ETH) reaching $2000 exist. But, according to crypto experts, we will most likely witness this at the end of the year. On the other hand, much sooner, another crypto will be able to achieve much more significant success, and not only reach the $14 million milestone but certainly complete its presale, get listed on top-tier exchanges and achieve massive gains! So, for now, put Ethereum aside, and turn your attention and your funds to promising Wall Street Memes ($WSM), a meme coin that will shine in full glory for days and months to come!"

        "content": "From Tron to Arbitrum: Exploring Ethereum\u2019s Layer-2 Rivals & The Rise Of BEASTS Coin\n\nIn the vast and ever-evolving world of cryptocurrencies, two prominent players, Tron (TRX) and Arbitrum (ARB), are pushing the boundaries of blockchain technology. Tron has established itself as a powerhouse with its lightning-fast transaction speeds and impressive Total Value Locked (TVL), while Arbitrum has emerged as a rising star, promising to enhance Ethereum\u2019s scalability.\n\nAmidst this landscape, a new contender, BEASTS Coin (BEASTS), enters the stage, ready to shake up the meme coin market. Let\u2019s embark on a thought-provoking journey as we explore the potential outcomes and implications of these intriguing developments.\n\nTron: Revolutionizing the Web\n\nLed by the visionary Justin Sun, Tron (TRX) aims to decentralize the web by leveraging blockchain technology. It has gained recognition for its ability to handle high transaction volumes and provides efficient decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts.\n\nTron\u2019s strengths lie in its fast transaction speeds and low fees, attracting users seeking seamless and cost-effective blockchain solutions. With an established user base and robust infrastructure, Tron has cemented its position as a significant player in the crypto space.\n\nArbitrum: Scaling Ethereum\u2019s Potential\n\nArbitrum, developed by Offchain Labs, introduces a Layer-2 solution that addresses Ethereum\u2019s scalability challenges. By leveraging optimistic rollup technology, Arbitrum aims to reduce congestion on the Ethereum network, enabling faster and more cost-efficient transactions.\n\nWhat sets Arbitrum apart is its compatibility with Ethereum\u2019s existing infrastructure, making it an attractive option for developers and users looking for seamless integration. While still in its early stages, Arbitrum shows great promise in enhancing the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nTron vs. Arbitrum \u2013 Who Will Rule Ethereum\u2019s Layer-2 Kingdom?\n\nCan Tron maintain its stronghold as Ethereum\u2019s Layer-2 solution, or will Arbitrum steal the spotlight in the Ethereum narrative? The answer lies within the dynamic nature of the crypto space. Tron has amassed a significant user base and boasts impressive transaction speeds, positioning itself as a formidable competitor. However, Arbitrum\u2019s compatibility with Ethereum\u2019s existing infrastructure provides a compelling advantage, attracting developers and users seeking seamless integration.\n\nThe outcome will depend on various factors, including technological advancements, user preferences, and market dynamics. Tron\u2019s established presence and robust infrastructure offer stability, while Arbitrum\u2019s potential to enhance Ethereum\u2019s scalability presents an intriguing alternative. Both platforms possess unique strengths and cater to different needs, fueling a healthy competition that drives innovation and pushes the boundaries of blockchain technology.\n\nIn this ever-evolving landscape, predicting the outcome with certainty is a challenge. The crypto space is known for its surprises and twists, where underdogs can rise and incumbents can stumble. The ultimate victor will be determined by the market\u2019s response, user adoption, and the ability to deliver on the promises made. Only time will reveal the destiny of Tron and Arbitrum in the Ethereum layer-2 realm.\n\nThe Rise of BEASTS Coin: Embracing the Meme Coin Market\n\nAmidst the innovations brought by Tron and Arbitrum, we encounter the emergence of BEASTS Coin (BEASTS), a fresh and exciting meme coin that aims to disrupt the market. BEASTS Coin sets itself apart by introducing decentralization and locked liquidity, ensuring transparency and integrity.

However, it\u2019s crucial to approach these opportunities with caution and a comprehensive understanding of the risks involved, ensuring you only spend what you can afford to lose.\n\nWhen is the crypto Bull Run?\n\nThe timing of the next bull run in the crypto market remains a topic of speculation, with various opinions suggesting potential time frames ranging from summer 2023 to the end of 2024. The introduction of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) in the Chinese market is considered a potential catalyst for market activity. However, it\u2019s important to approach predictions about the bull run with caution, as accurately predicting its timing is extremely challenging.\n\nAttempting to predict the future and the exact timing of a bull run is a daunting task. While experts and analysts provide their insights, it\u2019s crucial to exercise skepticism and not solely rely on these predictions. The crypto market is dynamic and influenced by numerous factors, making it unpredictable. A prudent approach involves conducting thorough research, staying informed about market trends, and making informed decisions based on individual risk tolerance and goals.\n\nWhat is the ApeMax presale?\n\nThe ApeMax presale is an enticing opportunity for cryptocurrency enthusiasts to acquire ApeMax coins at great presale prices.

As the bull run gains momentum, the crypto industry receives more media coverage and attention, leading to greater adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.\n\nHowever, it is important to remember that the dynamics of a bull run are unpredictable. While historical trends can provide insights, accurately predicting specific outcomes or which cryptocurrencies will experience significant price increases is impossible. Therefore, it is crucial to approach claims about specific coins or guaranteed gains during the bull run with caution. Instead, individuals should focus on exploring the innovative developments within the crypto space while maintaining a balanced perspective on the potential risks and rewards of cryptocurrency investments.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, the anticipation surrounding the next bull run in the cryptocurrency market has generated excitement and speculation. While potential timelines have been proposed, the exact timing remains uncertain. During a bull run, we can expect increased network activity, the emergence of new projects like NFTs and altcoins, and greater adoption of cryptocurrencies.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to approach claims about guaranteed gains and specific price predictions with caution, given the market\u2019s inherent volatility and unpredictability.\n\nAmidst this dynamic landscape, opportunities like the ApeMax presale offer discounted token acquisition, leveraging the potential of early adoption. It is important to conduct thorough research, exercise skepticism, and make informed decisions and conduct independent research before participating in the crypto market.\n\nPlease note that ApeMax\u2019s availability may be restricted in certain countries, and the full list of blocked countries is detailed on the ApeMax website.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Ethereum Node Locations Raise Concerns About US Government Involvement | Bitcoinist.com - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Ethereum is currently the largest proof of stake (P0S) network after transitioning from a proof of work (PoW) mechanism late last year. This means that the network now uses validators to carry out transactions as opposed to miners using energy-intensive computers to solve complex mathematical problems to do the same thing \u2013 something that has been applauded as a step in the right direction by many in the space.\n\nHowever, the location of Ethereum nodes worldwide, particularly their concentration in a particular location, has raised concerns among participants after a Twitter user pointed out a disturbing fact.\n\nMore Than 50% Of Ethereum Nodes Are In The United States\n\nOn Sunday, a Twitter user that goes by Hamzah Khan made a post revealing that over 50% of Ethereum\u2019s nodes are being hosted in datacenters in the United States.\n\nThere are currently about 5,500 nodes running Ethereum, and about half are based in the US. Of these, over half are in a single data center in Virginia, 20 minutes away from the white house and the CIA headquarters. FUD Morning \ud83d\ude4f \u2014 Hamzah Khan (@_khanhamzah) July 9, 2023\n\nMore interestingly though was that of this massive share of the node distribution being hosted in the country, more than 50% were being hosted in a single datacenter.\n\nThe location of this particular datacenter was of the most interest. The datacenter which is located in the state of Virginia is reportedly only 20 minutes away from the headquarters of the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), as well as the White House.\n\nNow, while the location has been pointed out, it shows no participation of the US government in the running of Ethereum. Rather, as the Ether.fi website points out, it shows that Ethereum is not as decentralized as participants would like.\n\nETH price falls below $1,900 support | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nAdditionally, Mike Silagadze, CEO of Ether.fi, also responded to the tweet to clarify that the number of nodes on its website needed to be updated. Compared to the 5,500 on the website, Silagadze said there were now around 6,800 Ethereum nodes running. But as another Twitter user pointed out, it doesn\u2019t change the \u2018distribution\u2019 of the nodes already pointed out above.\n\nThe Rise Of Liquid Staking\n\nBecoming a validator on Ethereum carries a high barrier to entry because valuators are required to have a total of 32 ETH. At current prices, this translates to around $60,000 to run a single validator node. And since a large percentage of users cannot afford this, liquid staking protocols have seen a lot of success for the services they offer.\n\nLiquid staking protocols such as Lido Finance and Rocket Pool allow investors to still become validators even if they don\u2019t have up to 32 ETH. Users are able to pool their ETH together to make a validator. This way, they are able to earn rewards without operating a full node themselves.\n\nLido leads ETH liquid staking | Source: DeFiLlama\n\nOver the last year, protocols such as Lido Finance have seen sharp growth, propelling them to the forefront of ETH staking. Currently, there is over $14 billion staked on the Lido liquid staking protocol, accounting for around 30% of the total staked ETH. In total, liquid staking now accounts for more than 37% of the total staked ETH, and rising.\n\nThis growth was born out of the need for more decentralization in the Ethereum network as nodes become more spread out. However, despite the rise in liquid staking, Ethereum nodes are still highly concentrated, mainly in the United States."

        "content": "A new crypto hack was discovered today: this time the DeFi Arcadia Finance protocol on the Ethereum and Optimism chains was successfully attacked.\n\nPeckShieldAlert broke the news on Twitter, reporting that the hack netted the attackers about $455,000.\n\nThe hack was also later confirmed by the operators of Arcadia Finance themselves.\n\nWe are aware of a potential exploit in our protocol.\n\nWe have paused the contracts and are investigating the root-cause with security experts as we speak. More info will follow as it comes available. \u2014 Arcadia Finance (@ArcadiaFi) July 10, 2023\n\nAfter a few hours, they reported that they were able to make contact with the hacker, and that they were working together with their security partners, law enforcement, and the community to solve the problem as best they could in an effort to recover funds for protocol users.\n\nThe bug that led to the crypto hack\n\nAccording to PeckShield, the hack to Arcadia Finance\u2019s smart contract was due to untrusted input validation being exploited to drain funds from darcWETH and darcUSDC reserves.\n\ndarcWETH and darcUSDC are two wrapped Arcadia Finance tokens, so they each hold reserves.\n\nTheoretically for every darcWETH token there should be a WETH token in the reserves, and for every darcUSDC token there should be a USDC token.\n\nEvidently the smart contract that manages the reserves of these two wrapped tokens had a bug that attackers were able to exploit.\n\nFurthermore, PeckShield discovered a lack of re-entry protection in these smart contracts, which in this way allowed the instant settlement to bypass the internal state check of the reserves manager.\n\nIn addition, there is a lack of reentrancy protection, which allows for the instant liquidation to bypass the internal vault health check. pic.twitter.com/Am58ZOvgQJ \u2014 PeckShield Inc. (@peckshield) July 10, 2023\n\nTo be fair, Arcadia later refuted this reconstruction, but was unable to provide an alternative explanation.\n\nMost of the funds were stolen from Optimism\u2019s chain, and they were then moved thanks to Tornado Cash in order to lose track of them.\n\nThe Arcadia Finance protocol\n\nArcadia Finance is a DeFi protocol on Ethereum and Optimism that does not have its own native token.\n\nBefore the hack, its TVL was about $600,000, while after the theft it plummeted to $145,000.\n\nThis is a non-custodial protocol that allows for the composition of on-chain cross-margin accounts.\n\nUsers of these margin accounts can collateralize entire wallets, access up to 10 times more capital than their initial collateral value, and use the deposited collateral and borrowed capital to interact with any other DeFi protocol in a permissionless manner.\n\nLenders provide liquidity to Arcadia\u2019s loan pools, earning passive returns.\n\nBeing non-custodial, the hackers were not able to steal funds directly from users\u2019 wallets, but rather from those used as reserves for issuing the wrapped tokens darcWETH and darcUSDC.\n\nThus, no darcWETH or darcUSDC were stolen directly from users\u2019 wallets, but WETH and USDC were stolen from the wallets on which the reserves were held. This means that there is no longer 1 WETH for every darcWETH issued, and 1 USDC for every darcUSDC issued, so effectively users still have all their wrapped tokens but can no longer redeem them.\n\nThe problem with wrapped tokens\n\nIt is often said that non-custodial wallets are safe, if stored and maintained properly, but sometimes the risks lie upstream.\n\nIndeed, for any non-custodial wallet there is little difference in storing original tokens, such as USDC, or wrapped tokens, such as darcUSDC.\n\nHowever, wrapped tokens have an additional layer of risk. In fact, the custody of the collateral is not done by the users themselves on their non-custodial wallets, but by the managers of the wrapped tokens.\n\nIn fact, this is not very different from a custodial wallet, since custody of the collateral is in some ways equivalent to custody of the wrapped tokens.\n\nTherefore even if the wallets of users holding wrapped tokens are not breached, in the event of a breach of the reserve wallets, users can still lose their funds, simply because while they still have the wrapped tokens they can no longer redeem them. Their actual value in this way effectively goes to zero.\n\nThis actually applies to USDC as well, because while it is not a wrapped token it is a collateralized stablecoin, meaning it has reserves as collateral, which is held and managed by a single entity (Circle).\n\nThe impact on crypto markets of the hack that occurred\n\nThe impact on the crypto markets of this hack has been almost zero, if we exclude the wrapped tokens darcWETH and darcUSDC.\n\nOP, which is Optimism\u2019s native token, has also not suffered serious losses, so much so that its price today moved in line with those of many other similar tokens.\n\nThen again, $455,000 is not that much, and by now the crypto markets have developed a habit of this kind of theft on DeFi protocols.\n\nMoreover, DeFi is not about Bitcoin, and right now it is Bitcoin that is dictating the trend in the crypto markets.\n\nSituations like this one only serve to provide a better understanding of the risks involved when using DeFi protocols, especially when they are hidden as in the case of wrapped tokens.\n\nSomething much worse had happened in March, when it was discovered that Circle held a significant portion of USDC reserves on the failed Silvergate bank, so much so that for a moment it was feared that the stablecoin might lose its peg with the dollar.\n\nBut then the US central bank intervened directly to cover all the shortfalls, thereby giving all Silvergate depositors back all their funds."
