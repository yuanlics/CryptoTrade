For example, if you buy a particular token, an MEV searcher could order transactions to buy it before you and also sell after you.

This was due to spikes in demand at certain times such as NFT launches and other gas-guzzling events such as XEN minting.\n\nEthereum\u2019s heftier transaction volumes have continued into the new year, with the Ethereum transaction count on Jan. 2 reaching 924,614, a 300% increase compared to Bitcoin\u2019s 229,191 on the same day, according to Bitinfocharts.\n\nETH vs BTC transaction volumes \u2014 Bitinfocharts\n\nThe analyst who posted the metrics said he was \u201cskeptical about people saying that a flippening could happen someday,\u201d adding that those advocating for it have reason to do so now.\n\nA flippening occurs when one chain surpasses a higher-ranked one for the same metric, in this case, transactions and activity.\n\nThe charts also do not include layer 2 transactions, which would put Ethereum even further ahead of Bitcoin for this metric. According to L2beat, the number of L2 transactions per second actually surpassed those on layer 1 Ethereum in mid-October and has remained above it ever since.\n\nRelated: Why the battle for low or no transaction fees really matters\n\nHowever, while Ethereum may be ahead in transaction and activity terms, Bitcoin remains the most-searched cryptocurrency online.\n\nOn Jan. 1, a newsletter from \u201cIn Bitcoin We Trust\u201d revealed that BTC attracted the most attention on the Google search engine in 2022, with 28.4 million monthly Google searches across the world.\n\nThe report concurred with Cointelegraph, which reported on Dec. 23 that Ethereum did not make second or even third place for search popularity. These spots were occupied by memecoins Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) respectively.\n\nEthereum, in fourth place, had 3.8 million global monthly searches, according to the data."

        "content": "Ether (ETH -0.41%), the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, hit an all-time high of more than $4,800 in November 2021. That represented a whopping gain of more than 550% from the beginning of the year. At the time, many analysts believed it could go even higher. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Mike McGlone predicted Ether's price could reach $4,000 to $4,500 by the end of 2022. The crypto news outlet Coinpedia predicted its price could hit $6,500 to $7,500.\n\nHowever, Ether actually ended 2022 at about $1,200. Rising interest rates drove investors away from cryptocurrencies and other riskier investments, while the failures of several high-profile tokens and exchanges tarnished the industry's reputation. Many analysts have reined in their near-term forecasts for Ether, but the bulls still believe it could bounce back in 2023.\n\nFor example, CoinLedger CEO David Kemmerer recently predicted Ether could still rise to $2,500 in the first half of 2023 even as the crypto winter freezes other cryptocurrencies. Let's see if that target is realistic, and if investors who buy Ether right now can potentially double their gains within a year.\n\nWhy should investors pay attention to Ether?\n\nEther differs from Bitcoin (BTC -0.25%) in three major ways. First, miners can only mine for Bitcoin on the Bitcoin blockchain. But on Ethereum, miners can mine Ether as well as other tokens. That open-source flexibility has facilitated the creation of many smaller altcoins. Ether can also still be effectively mined with high-end gaming GPUs, but Bitcoin now requires the usage of high-end ASIC miners.\n\nSecond, developers can create non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized apps (dApps) on the Ethereum blockchain. That makes Ethereum a central pillar of the Web3 (also known as Web 3.0) movement -- which believes dApps will eventually disrupt centralized app ecosystems like Apple's App Store and Alphabet's Google Play -- and support the expansion of a decentralized metaverse of applications and services. As the largest token on the Ethereum blockchain, Ether is the default currency of that universe, and its price could stabilize as the token is used to purchase more goods and services.\n\nLastly, Ether is a more environmentally friendly alternative to Bitcoin. Ethereum previously used the same energy-intensive proof-of-work mining method as Bitcoin, but it transitioned to the more energy-efficient proof-of-stake method last September. That transition, known as The Merge, reduced Ethereum's energy consumption by about 99.95%. This could make it easier to scale up the Ethereum blockchain and support the development of more tokens, apps, and services. Meanwhile, Bitcoin's carbon output already rose 126 times between 2016 and 2021, according to Scientific Reports, as it became increasingly difficult to mine new coins. In 2020 alone, Bitcoin mining consumed more electricity than all of Austria.\n\nWhat's the bullish case for Ether?\n\nAt the end of 2021, the bulls believed The Merge would drive Ether's price to new highs. Instead, its price has actually dropped nearly 30%. The bulls believe that pullback is unjustified, and that Ether is merely being dragged down with the broader crypto market as interest rates continue to rise. They believe that Ether's current price doesn't reflect the benefits of The Merge or the long-term growth potential of the Web3 industry yet.\n\nThere's also the possibility that Ether and Bitcoin will remain the only two cryptocurrencies left standing when the crypto winter finally ends. If that happens, their prices could finally stabilize and become viable assets for institutional investors. Those tailwinds suggest that $2,500 might be a realistic year-end target.\n\nHowever, the crypto winter could also easily turn into an ice age. The failures of the Terra blockchain, the FTX cryptocurrency exchange, and other smaller altcoins are driving regulators to quickly tighten their grip on the cryptocurrency market.\n\nA global recession could also finish off the entire cryptocurrency market, including Bitcoin and Ether, as investors completely lose their appetite for speculative investments. If that happens, Ether's price could easily stumble below $1,000 again. Unlike stocks, there's no clear way to fundamentally value Ether (beyond its last trade) to set a floor under its price.\n\nCan Ether double by the end of 2023?\n\nEther's price might stabilize this year as some investors cautiously return to the crypto market. But I also don't expect its price to more than double to $2,500. The macro headwinds should remain intense and cause investors to broadly shun the crypto, Web3, and metaverse markets while stashing their cash in government bonds and safe haven blue chip stocks. Ether's technological advances are impressive, but I don't expect investors to get excited about NFTs or dApps again until the macroeconomic situation improves and a new bull market begins."

        "content": "A popular crypto analyst says layer-2 projects built on Ethereum (ETH) will likely dominate the crypto payments space in 2023.\n\nIn a new YouTube strategy session, pseudonymous Coin Bureau host Guy tells his 2.19 million subscribers that using crypto for payments will become more popular this year.\n\n\u201cMy fifth crypto prediction for 2023\u2026 that\u2019s that crypto payments will become more common. This will again be due to a combination of better frontends, regulatory clarity increasing liquidity and, most importantly, an increase in scalability that finally makes crypto payments feasible.\u201d\n\nGuy says layer-2s will play a critical role in the increasing adoption of crypto payments. Layer-2s are crypto projects designed to increase the number of transactions per second (TPS) that a smart contract platform can process.\n\n\u201cThis prediction comes from a series of headlines I saw over the summer about Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin saying how layer-2s on Ethereum will power crypto payments. This makes sense given that Ethereum is the most secure base layer to have for a payment system besides Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nHe says the rise of layer-2 dominance with crypto payments is more likely with an upcoming upgrade to the smart contract platform Ethereum. The planned Ethereum Improvement Proposal 4844 (EIP 4844) is meant to improve the blockchain\u2019s scalability using \u201cshard blob transactions.\u201d\n\n\u201cMoreover, developers will be implementing Ethereum improvement proposal, or EIP-4844 sometime next summer. For those unfamiliar, EIP 4844 will increase the scalability of Layer-2s on Ethereum by between 10x and 100x. Given that most Layer-2s already processed thousands of TPS, such an increase will put them on a par with Visa.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Ethereum is changing hands at $1,212.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Read preview\n\nCrypto did not have the best year in 2022. While the rest of the economy was on a downward slide, crypto was in a freefall.\n\n\n\nThe average value of bitcoin \u2014 the largest held and most well-known cryptocurrency \u2014 dropped 64% based on figures from Google Finance. And then came the implosion of FTX, a company that had plastered ads across America for most of 2022. Wall Street banks \u2014 which previously sought partnerships with crypto firms to offer access to customers \u2014 are newly skeptical about the space. And FTX cofounder Sam Bankman-Fried pleading not guilty to federal charges promises the fallen crypto bro will stay in the public eye.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nSo, yes, there are many reasons to be pessimistic about crypto in 2023. But Bernstein analysts Gautam Chhugani and Manas Agarwal offer crypto true believers a few reasons to keep the faith.\n\nIn a note published on January 3, they wrote that despite a catastrophic 2022, the larger crypto ecosystem still has potential. Its decentralized nature allows it to bounce back even after debacles like FTX, it has a strong foundation in Ethereum, and crypto will likely benefit from the regulation it will be unable to avoid.\n\nIn their words, crypto has a \"survival instinct.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCrypto keeps bouncing back\n\nThe past year was not the first \"crypto winter.\" Bitcoin saw large price drops in 2014, when annual returns fell by 58%, and prices stayed depressed until 2017. In 2018, Bitcoin plunged in value for nearly 18 months. But it managed to rally both times.\n\nEthereum \u2014 the other large crypto token \u2014 followed nearly the same pattern of steep declines followed by a sharp rally from 2018 to 2020.\n\nAs Ross Gerber put in during a 2021 appearance on Yahoo Finance Live: \"Bitcoin and Ethereum are like cockroaches. They're just not going to die.\"\n\nOne reason cyrpto is a cockroach is it's a largely decentralized system. Chhugani and Agarwal point out the contagion impact from FTX has not spread widely.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"FTX was terrible for the reputation of the sector and affected the faith of institutional investors, who invested in FTX,\" the analysts said. \"But FTX was 10% of the global trading volume and used mainly by wholesale participants such as brokers, trading firms, and large traders.\"\n\nMuch of the crypto space remains decentralized. Take decentralized finance, or DeFi, which uses the same distributed network of computers to provide financial services to people.\n\nChhugani and Agarwal said FTX's collapse had hastened DeFi adoption, which makes DeFi a bright spot in crypto investing, according to crypto VCs.\n\nDeFi's rise\n\nWith DeFi projects largely insulated from FTX's impact, the Bernstein analysts noted investor interest might shift towards Ethereum and its mainly application-based ecosystem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum forms the basis of many crypto applications like NFT-based gaming, decentralized social media, and some commerce. These tend to use either the Ethereum blockchain to build or use the Ethereum currency to power transactions. Chhugani and Agarwal said crypto only touches 5% of total internet users, and the primary way of growing the space is through applications.\n\n\"We believe value within crypto will migrate from the speculative crypto assets to more utility and application-driven ecosystems such as Ethereum,\" they said.\n\nThe benefits of regulating the wild west of finance\n\nAgarwal and Chhugani believe regulation is coming for the crypto space and see it benefiting the market.\n\nCrypto enthusiasts typically deride moves to regulate their space. The blockchain and bitcoin began as a reaction to the 2008 financial crisis, and its first adopters had visions of leaving behind the tightly controlled world of traditional finance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut as crypto began moving into the mainstream, investors demanded regulation. And after the fall of FTX, those calls have only increased.\n\nThe analysts said even if regulation brings about adjustments in the crypto market, policies bring in a more sustainable ecosystem and attract more institutional investors. In their view, regulated onshore exchange companies will survive the current cycle.\n\nFor Agarwal and Chhugani, crypto still has strong potential to grow, particularly as people stop seeing it as a quick money-making speculative asset and instead focus on its ability to be a part of the infrastructure of the next decade of internet development."

        "title": "What is Wrapped Ethereum (WETH)? - OKX",
        "content": "Wrapped Ether (WETH) is essentially a version of Ether (ETH) but differs in numerous ways. WETH can be used on various platforms and decentralized applications (DApps) that support the ERC-20 token standard. WETH is pegged to ETH at a 1:1 ratio and can easily get converted. This leads to better interoperability on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nETH can be wrapped manually by interacting with the WETH smart contract. WETH can also be created using decentralized exchanges (DEXs) such as Uniswap.\n\nThis guide will cover everything you need to know about Wrapped Ethereum (WETH).\n\nWhat are wrapped tokens?\n\nA cryptocurrency that's built on top of one blockchain network to be used on a different blockchain needs to be wrapped. Each token, or coin, is also built on specific standards.\n\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi) use cases and DApps support specific standards. If the coin or token in question isn't supported by the blockchain, it needs to be wrapped.\n\nWrapped tokens make it a possibility to get a much higher level of utility for specific coins or tokens. Wrapped tokens solve incompatibility issues, and are supported by crypto wallets.\n\nThe procedure of wrapping a token is to swap one token for another token in an equal amount. This typically occurs through the usage of a smart contract or code on the blockchain, which can store or send funds.\n\nBoth tokens represent the same value. However, the Wrapped WETH version gets a higher level of compatibility. Wrapped tokens can be bought directly, or a merchant can convert their existing cryptocurrency and wrap it. The merchant, in this case, would send the person's crypto to a custodian.\n\nThe custodian would lock up the coin or token in a vault. Once the coin is locked, the custodian can create a wrapped token.\n\nThe wrapped token will represent the original coin, and this is a process known as minting.\n\nWhat Is Wrapped Ethereum (WETH)?\n\nWrapped Ethereum (WETH) is essentially an ERC-20 token standard-compliant cryptocurrency that's pegged to the value of Ether (ETH). Ethereum\u2019s native token, ETH, is used for paying gas fees on the network.\n\nWrapped Ethereum WETH can't be used for the payment of gas fees on the Ethereum network. WETH however, has a wider range of use cases when compared to ETH, specifically within the field of Decentralized Finance (DeFi).\n\nAny cryptocurrency wallet that supports the ERC-20 token standard supports WETH.\n\nNot every token built on Ethereum is alike. The network lets developers create new rules and standards for cryptocurrencies. There's the ERC-721 format, for example, that enables non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to operate on top of Ethereum. These are different when compared to ERC-20 tokens.\n\nThe majority of crypto wallets support ERC-20.\n\nMost Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications accept ERC-20 tokens for investment, staking, adding liquidity, borrowing, or lending, alongside other functionalities.\n\nIf we want to, for example, add Ether (ETH) to a liquidity pool and use it as collateral, it's better to have an ERC-20 version of the coin. In other terms, on Ethereum, almost all fungible tokens follow ERC-20. The standard was created to have a standardized set of rules for tokens. The aim is to simplify the new token launches and make them comparable to each other.\n\nThere are mandatory rules that all ERC-20 tokens follow, such as totalSupply, balanceOf, transfer, transferFrom, approve, and allowance.\n\nEther by itself doesn't comply with this token standard.\n\nWETH is built to increase interoperability between blockchains and make Ether usable in dApps.\n\nAdvantages of Wrapped Ethereum (WETH)\n\nCurious about what Wrapped Ether is, and what are some of its advantages? Let\u2019s go over that now.\n\nEthereum (WETH) has numerous advantages, including:\n\nWETH is an ERC-20-compliant token and follows all of the pre-specified rules.\n\nWrapping Ether enables the direct and seamless exchange between Ether and ERC-20 tokens.\n\nWETH solves the issue surrounding interoperability and enables the easy exchange of tokens.\n\nWETH can be used in any supporting DeFi service or DApp that supports the token standard on Ethereum.\n\nWETH is pegged 1:1 to the value of ETH.\n\nDisadvantages of Wrapped Ethereum (WETH)\n\nEthereum (WETH) has numerous disadvantages as well, including:\n\nCustodians are required for the procedure of wrapping or unwrapping WETH.\n\nIf any issues occur with the operations of the custodian, they can affect the minting or burning procedure.\n\nThe reliance on custodians can lead to a higher level of centralization.\n\nETH vs WETH\n\nSome traders find themselves confused about ETH and WETH. But let's \"unwrap\" the distinctions between these two tokens and explore the decentralized possibilities.\n\nETH (Ethereum)\n\nEthereum, the blockchain platform, has its native token known as ETH. This digital currency serves as the lifeblood of the Ethereum network, enabling users to conduct transactions and pay gas fees. However, while ETH is a fundamental component of Ethereum, it has certain limitations regarding DeFi applications.\n\nETH is the native token used for transactions and gas fees on the Ethereum blockchain\n\nTraders must exchange ETH to complete transactions on the Ethereum network\n\nETH isn't ERC-20 compliant, which can restrict its seamless integration with some DeFi applications\n\nWETH (Wrapped ETH)\n\nEnter Wrapped Ether, or WETH, the enchanting counterpart to ETH in the DeFi realm. WETH acts as a container, embracing the original ETH tokens and wrapping them in an ERC-20 compliant standard. This transformative process breathes new life into ETH, making it compatible with many DeFi apps.\n\nWETH serves as a container, wrapping and embracing the original ETH tokens\n\nWrapped in an ERC-20 compliant standard, WETH becomes seamlessly usable in various DeFi applications\n\nWETH was created to enable ETH's use in decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and various DeFi applications\n\nERC-20 Standard\n\nThe ERC-20 standard plays a pivotal role in differentiating ETH from WETH. While ETH doesn't follow this standard, WETH wholeheartedly embraces it. This compliance empowers WETH to integrate with other ERC-20 tokens, fostering interoperability in the DeFi space.\n\nETH isn't ERC-20 compliant, whereas WETH adheres to this standardized token format\n\nThe ERC-20 standardization enables seamless integration of WETH with other ERC-20 tokens, promoting interoperability\n\nValue equivalence\n\nOne might wonder if wrapping ETH into WETH alters its inherent value. Fear not \u2014 the enchantment of WETH doesn't tamper with the worth of its underlying ETH. For every one ETH wrapped, one WETH emerges with an identical value, maintaining a 1:1 equivalence.\n\nWrapping ETH into WETH doesn't affect its original value. 1 ETH remains equivalent to 1 WETH\n\nNo loss or gain of value occurs during the wrapping process\n\nOperational flexibility\n\nWETH provides flexibility for its users, allowing them to quickly unwrap it and convert it back to ETH with a few clicks. This conversion is effortlessly facilitated through DEXs or DEX aggregators, making the process seamless and swift.\n\nUsers can quickly unwrap WETH and convert it back to ETH through DEXs or DEX aggregators\n\nFacilitating DEXs\n\nThanks to WETH's ERC-20 compliance, DEXs can operate smoothly, enabling traders to swap different tokens seamlessly. These tokens often must be wrapped first, paving the way for frictionless exchanges on DEX platforms.\n\nWETH's ERC-20 compliance supports the smooth functioning of DEXs\n\nWrapping tokens makes DEXs more efficient, allowing seamless exchanges between tokens\n\nToken creation in DApps\n\nThe ERC-20 format of WETH empowers users to create their own tokens for their DApps, fostering a realm of innovation within the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nWETH's ERC-20 format enables users to create custom tokens for their DeFi apps, fostering innovation\n\nHow to Wrap Ether (ETH)?\n\nOne of the most popular ways through which Ether is wrapped is through Uniswap. As such, in this guide, we'll be creating WETH using Uniswap.\n\nTo do so, all users need to do is visit Uniswap and then connect their wallet. Each user will also need to ensure that Ethereum is selected as the network.\n\nNext, ETH needs to be selected in the top field, and then WETH needs to be selected in the bottom field.\n\nOnce a user clicks on the \u201cSelect a Token\u201d section, they'll be able to type in \u201cWETH\u201d in the field.\n\nNow, all that's left for a user to do is input the amount of ETH they want to convert. Next, click on the \u201cWrap\u201d button.\n\nAll that's left for each user to do is confirm the transaction in their crypto wallet and also pay the gas fees.\n\nAfter the user reviews the details of the transaction, they can click on \u201cConfirm.\u201d\n\nHow to Unwrap Ether (WETH)?\n\nNow that we understand the basics of wrapping ETH, we can now go over how to unwrap WETH.\n\nNavigate again to the Uniswap website, and connect with your wallet. Make sure the Ethereum network is selected.\n\nSelect the wallet icon on Uniswap, and connect your wallet.\n\nUsers will need to go to the \u201cSwap\u201d section and select WETH at the top and ETH at the bottom.\n\nNow, users can type in the amount they need to unwrap and confirm it. Each user will need to confirm the operation on their wallet.\n\nWETH will now turn into ETH and will be stored in the wallet directly.\n\nThe impact Wrapped Ethereum (WETH) has on the blockchain space\n\nWrapped Ethereum (WETH) is essentially the wrapped or packaged version of Ether (ETH) that lets each investor use it to interact with the Ethereum ecosystem of dApps. Its additional level of utility to holders is the main reason behind its existence.\n\nWETH can be staked, used for yield farming, lent, and used for providing liquidity to a variety of liquidity pools. Unlike ETH, which doesn't conform to its own ERC-20 standard, WETH has a much higher level of interoperability.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat is a WETH Coin?\n\nWETH isn't a coin but a token. ETH is the coin, and the wrapped version of the coin becomes the WETH token. It's a token that follows the ERC-20 token standard. Due to this, it can be used for yield farming, lending, and used for providing liquidity to a variety of liquidity pools.\n\nAre WETH and ETH the same?\n\nWETH and ETH aren't the same. The former conforms to the ERC-20 token standard, while ETH doesn't conform to the ERC-20 token standard. WETH is pegged at a value of 1:1 to ETH. However, WETH can be used by DApps and in the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nWhich is better ETH or WETH?\n\nEach cryptocurrency has its own pros as well as cons. WETH is better for usage in DeFi and DApps. However, ETH is a far more established cryptocurrency and is held by a lot more investors.\n\nIs WETH Worth Anything?\n\nWETH does indeed have a value associated with it. The token is pegged 1:1 to the value of ETH. This means that ETH and WETH have the same value, as they are connected in this regard.\n\nWhat is Wrapped Ether used for?\n\nETH is wrapped into WETH for usage on different DApps or networks aside from Ethereum. WETH leads to an increase in liquidity, capital efficiency, and interoperability. It can be used for yield farming, lending, and providing liquidity to a variety of liquidity pools.\n\nCan you convert Wrapped ETH to ETH?\n\nYou can convert Ether (ETH) to Wrapped Ethereum (WETH) or the other way around. This is typically done through a custodian or through decentralized exchanges (DEXs).\n\nIs Wrapped ETH better?\n\nThere are indeed ways through which Wrapped Ethereum (WETH) is better than Ether (ETH). If you want to use ETH coins in a DApp or DeFi ecosystem, it needs to be wrapped. WETH is better in the sense that it enables enhanced functionality, compatibility, and interoperability."

        "content": "The Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) is trading at a record-low discount rate of 59%, according to the data shared by the crypto influencer DB.\n\nThe Grayscale trust gathers money from institutions that wish to invest in various cryptocurrencies but want to avoid the challenges of buying, storing, or safekeeping their crypto. The funds collected under ETHE are used to purchase Ethereum (ETH) to expose institutional investors to ETH passively.\n\nThere is currently $3.6 billion worth of assets under the ETHE pool collected from 31 million shares. The ETH per share is around 0.0097 ETH, and the market price per share is $4.77.\n\nCommunity concerns about Grayscale\n\nAccording to the data, ETHE is not the only Grayscale fund that is struggling. On Dec. 8, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) reached a record-low discount of 49,20%. The GBTC has healed only slightly since then, with a discount rate of 45.\n\nRecently, Grayscale has been facing speculations regarding its financial stability. On Nov. 16, Grayscale\u2019s sister company Genesis halted withdrawals, raising questions regarding insolvency. Soon after, reports revealed that both companies\u2019 parent institutions had a debt of around $2 billion to Genesis.\n\nEven though Grayscale\u2019s partner Coinbase assured the community that Grayscale held enough Bitcoin (BTC) to remain liquid, Grayscale refused to provide proof of its BTC reserves, which didn\u2019t help soothe the community concerns.\n\nMentioned in this article"

I actually like it a lot at $4.20\u2026 But I honestly think there\u2019s a chance we don\u2019t get there. And this is a structure that I like to buy as in the current weekly look is one where the market completely disappears, and you get a little bit of buying and another secondary capitulation event. I usually like to buy these.\n\nI could see a move from $10 to $16 happen anytime soon, which is a massive trade.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Solana is changing hands for $11.12, up over 12% in the last 24 hours. A move to DonAlt\u2019s target suggests an upside potential of over 43% for the smart contract protocol.\n\nLooking at Ethereum itself, the crypto analyst says ETH is flashing relative strength but wants to see the leading altcoin take out a key resistance level to turn bullish.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say ETH goes up from here, and $1,300 is the nearest resistance, and it starts looking like it\u2019s breaking the trend.\u201d\n\nDonAlt also says that Ethereum had a lot of bullish development in 2022.\n\n\u201cYou still have one the biggest narratives that we\u2019ve had in crypto, basically ETH going deflationary. We still haven\u2019t had that play out at all. I think it\u2019s in the backburner because the entire market is doing poorly. But I wouldn\u2019t want to fade all of that. If it crashes to $800, then it crashes to $800, and I\u2019ll buy it. If it crosses $700, I\u2019ll buy it.

According to Arcane: \u201cA Reg M would cause a massive arbitrage strategy of selling crypto spot versus buying GrayscaleTrust shares. If this scenario plays out, crypto markets could face further downside.\u201d\n\nWinklevoss has been vocal on the alleged DCG liquidity issues, previously tweeting an update in December that global investment bank Houlihan Lokey had presented a plan on behalf of the Creditor Committee to provide a pathway for the recovery of assets."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price has been oscillating in a very tight range over the past couple of weeks as the markets were heading into the new year\u2019s holidays. However, a decisive move may be on the horizon, as the cryptocurrency now resides in a critical area.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy: Edris\n\nThe Daily Chart:\n\nOn the daily chart, the price has been testing a significant resistance level recently, where the $1250 zone and the 50-day moving average have a confluence.\n\nWhile the market is yet to break this fundamental level to the upside, a potential bullish breakout would pave the way for a rise toward the 200-day moving average, around a psychologically significant price the $1400. A valid breakout from the mentioned 200-day MA would likely lead to a short-term rally which can drive ETH\u2019s price toward $1800.\n\nOn the other hand, if the price gets rejected to the downside from the $1250 level and the 50-day moving average, a rapid decline toward the bulls\u2019 last resort, which is the $1000 support level, would be more likely.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart:\n\nLooking at the 4-hour timeframe, the recent consolidation pattern has become more evident, as the price has bounced inside a symmetrical triangle forming below the $1250 mark. A valid breakout from either side of the pattern could lead to a further continuation in the direction of the initial breakout.\n\nThe $1350 resistance zone would be the likely target for a bullish breakout, while a break below the pattern could potentially lead to a drop toward the $1100 support level.\n\nThe RSI indicator can also provide helpful insight, as the momentum is approaching the overbought area, and a potential bearish divergence could form soon, signaling a high probability for a bearish reversal. All in all, the market\u2019s short-term future is still hanging in the balance, yet a breakout or rejection from the $1250 level could shape the short-term to mid-term price trend, as liquidity will soon return to the markets after the holidays.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nBy: Edris\n\nEthereum Taker Buy Sell Ratio\n\nEthereum\u2019s price is still reluctant to decline further and create a new lower low, and the futures market sentiment is highlighting one of the reasons for this relative strength.\n\nThis chart displays the 100-day moving average of the Taker Buy Sell Ratio, a metric predominantly used for assessing the futures market sentiment, as it indicates whether the bulls or bears are engaging more aggressively with their orders. Values above 1 show bullish sentiment, and conversely, values below 1 indicate the bears\u2019 dominance. Moves above or below this threshold are also significant, as the metrics\u2019 decline below 1 usually signals a crash in the short term.\n\nThis metric has been holding above 1 over the last few months, pointing to the bulls\u2019 resilience in the futures market, as their orders create sufficient demand to prevent the price from dropping below the $1000 mark. If this behavior continues, even higher prices could be expected in the short term, as the price is seemingly forming a base however, if the metric drops below 1, a further continuation of the bear market would be highly probable."

        "title": "Understanding Different ETH Contract Types (721 vs. 1155 vs. 20) - NFT Culture",
        "content": "ERC 721 vs. ERC 1155\n\nAs an artist, you may be considering using blockchain technology to sell your digital art or other creative works. One aspect to consider is the type of smart contract you will use to facilitate the sale of your art. The Ethereum blockchain offers several types of smart contracts, each with their own unique features and use cases. In this article, we will explore the differences between four of the most commonly used smart contracts for selling digital art: ERC-721, ERC-721A, ERC-1155, and ERC-20.\n\nERC-721\n\nERC-721 is a smart contract standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Non-fungible tokens are unique digital assets that cannot be replaced or exchanged for other assets on a one-to-one basis. Each ERC-721 token represents a unique digital item, such as a piece of art or a collectible.\n\nOne of the key features of ERC-721 is that it allows for the ownership and transfer of unique digital assets. This makes it well-suited for selling digital art, as each piece can be represented by a unique ERC-721 token. Additionally, ERC-721 allows for the creation of marketplaces and exchanges for buying and selling unique digital assets.\n\nERC-721A\n\nERC-721A is an enhanced version of the ERC-721 smart contract standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs). It was developed by the Azuki team and used for their own NFT collection. One advantage of ERC-721A is that it is more gas-efficient, meaning it requires less processing power to execute certain actions. This can be especially beneficial when minting multiple NFTs at once, as it allows developers to do so at a lower cost in terms of gas fees. Gas fees refer to the fees paid to process transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, which have been subject to fluctuation and can sometimes become quite expensive. Overall, ERC-721A offers improved efficiency and cost-saving potential compared to the original ERC-721 standard.\n\nERC-1155\n\nERC-1155 is a smart contract standard that allows for the creation of both fungible (interchangeable) and non-fungible (unique) tokens in a single contract. This means that ERC-1155 can be used to represent both types of digital assets, making it a more flexible option than ERC-721.\n\nOne potential use case for ERC-1155 is the creation of games or other interactive digital experiences that involve both unique and interchangeable assets. For example, a game might use ERC-1155 to represent both unique collectibles and in-game currency that can be traded or exchanged.\n\nERC-20\n\nERC-20 is a smart contract standard for fungible tokens, which are interchangeable digital assets that can be exchanged on a one-to-one basis. ERC-20 tokens are commonly used as a form of digital currency or as a way to represent a stake in a particular project or asset.\n\nUnlike ERC-721, ERC-721A, and ERC-1155, ERC-20 is not specifically designed for the ownership and transfer of unique digital assets. However, it can still be used to facilitate the sale of digital art, as long as the art is represented by a fungible token rather than a unique NFT."

        "content": "The collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s crypto empire impacted several divisions of the crypto ecosystem. The retrospective liquidity crunch faced by firms made them halt operations. Crypto lender Genesis was one such victim that paused withdrawals due to the \u201cunprecedented\u201d market turmoil.\n\nPost the announcement, Digital Currency Group\u2014the lender\u2019s parent company\u2014clarified that it had no impact on its own operations. However, it is worth noting that Genesis Global served as the liquidity provider for the $6 billion market-capped Grayscale Bitcoin Investment Trust.\n\nOn its part, the state of the trust\u2019s share price has considerably deteriorated over the past year. Post shrinking by almost 76% in value, GBTC shares closed at $8.29 on 30 December 2022.\n\nFor context, DCG was established in 2015 by billionaire Barry Silbert. Like Grayscale, even Genesis is one of its subsidiaries. In an open letter on Twitter to Silbert, Gemini\u2019s Cameron Winklevoss recently alleged that Genesis owed the exchange\u2019s clients $900 million.\n\nAdditionally, Gemini users have filed a request for a class action against Genesis and DCG. This was done in response to the exchange suspending its Earn redemption program because of Genesis freezing its withdrawals.\n\nUntangling The Genesis-Grayscale Strand\n\nSo at the moment, users expect Gemini to force Genesis into bankruptcy.\n\nVia its various investment vehicles, Grayscale\u2019s balance sheet comprises a host of assets like Bitcoin [$10.5 billion], Ethereum [$3.69 billion], Ethereum Classic [$190.81 million], Litecoin [$114.13 million], Bitcoin Cash [$30.6 million], etc.\n\nThere have been a few claims doing the rounds that if Grayscale is forced to sell its assets to cover Genesis\u2019 creditors, these tokens and their investors would be the most impacted. Even though it seems tangled at the moment, the odds of such a scenario unfolding are quite low.\n\nIn mid-November, Grayscale explicitly assured investors that the safety and security of the holdings underlying Grayscale digital asset products remained unaffected.\n\nFurthermore, several from the space have given word that the trust assets are not in danger. Messari founder Ryan Selkis recently assured the same by tweeting,\n\n\u201cTrust assets will not be at risk.\u201c"

        "content": "Image: Shutterstock\n\nAccording to data from Nasdaq and Ycharts, the Ethereum network had a higher total transaction volume compared to Bitcoin in 2022. Specifically, there were 338 percent more transactions on the Ethereum network (408.5 million) than on the Bitcoin network (93.1 million). The average daily number of transactions on Ethereum was around 1.1 million, while the average daily number of transactions on Bitcoin was 255,000. Despite this, Bitcoin has remained more popular in terms of online search interest.Transaction volumes on the Bitcoin network were more consistent and regular compared to those on the Ethereum network, which saw more fluctuations. This was attributed to times of increased demand, such as during the launch of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and other activities that required a lot of gas (a measure of the amount of computing power needed to perform a certain action on the Ethereum network), such as the minting of XEN.Ethereum has continued to have higher transaction volumes in 2023, with the number of transactions on the Ethereum network on January 2 reaching 924,614, which is a 300 percent increase compared to the Bitcoin network on the same day (229,191).The person who shared the data on Reddit expressed scepticism about the idea that the Ethereum network could surpass the Bitcoin network in terms of transaction volume and activity, a phenomenon known as a \"flippening.\" However, they noted that those who advocate for a flippening now have more reason to do so, given the current transaction volumes. A flippening occurs when one blockchain surpasses another in a particular metric, such as transaction volume or activity.Although Ethereum may currently have higher transaction and activity levels, Bitcoin remains the most searched crypto online. On January 1, data from \"In Bitcoin We Trust\" showed that Bitcoin had the highest number of monthly Google searches globally in 2022, with 28.4 million searches. Ethereum did not even come in second or third place in terms of search popularity. These spots were occupied by memecoins Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, respectively. According to the data, Ethereum was in fourth place with 3.8 million global monthly searches."

        "content": "Snowfall Protocol (SNW) Gains While Solana\u2019s (SOL) Defi Exchange Is Hacked, And Coinbase Delists Ethereum Classic (ETC)\n\nDisclaimer: The text below is a press release that is not part of Cryptonews.com editorial content.\n\nA lot has happened in the Crypto market recently. Some cryptocurrencies showed amazing price rises, while others became prey to hacking. Solana (SOL) DeFi exchange lost millions due to hackers\u2019 unethical penetration into the network. On the other hand, Ethereum Classic (ETC) has been delisted from the biggest crypto trading platform, Coinbase. Among all these, a new Crypto, Snowfall Protocol (SNW) , has been performing beyond creators\u2019 expectations.\n\nKeep reading ahead to learn about Solana (SOL), Ethereum Classic (ETC), and Snowfall Protocol (SNW) in detail.\n\nSolana (SOL) Lost Millions To A Hacker\n\nThe sudden downfall of FTX (FTT) made a huge impact on cryptocurrencies, especially Solana (SOL). FTX (FTT) was one of the significant backers of Solana (SOL). While Solana (SOL) was still struggling to recover from the damages, its DeFi protocol, Raydium, was hacked. There was a loss of $2.2 million worth of assets, including a $1.6 million loss of Solana (SOL).\n\nIt was terrible news for Solana (SOL) investors as Raydium is the largest DeFi protocol of Solana (SOL). The incident led many Raydium community members to withdraw entirely from the protocol.\n\nThe TVL (Total Value Locked) of Solana (SOL) on the protocol declined more than 27%, and Raydium\u2019s native token, RAY, dropped by 8%.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) Will No Longer Trade On Coinbase\n\nEthereum developers forked the Ethereum blockchain after millions were hacked from the DAO in 2016. Ethereum Classic (ETC) was created as a result of the forked network. The decision to fork the blockchain was made after the majority of developers voted in its favor. The aim was to restore the lost funds to the hacked accounts.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) represents the old Ethereum blockchain token, while Ether represents a new token. Over the years, Ether became more popular among holders, and Ethereum Classic (ETC) usage declined.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) lost its investor count and showed a bearish pattern for most of the period. Last month\u2019s data shows Ethereum Classic (ETC) and USD pair dropped by 14.16% and its 1-year performance is 53.62% down. Additionally, the Ethereum Classic (ETC) price prediction estimated a 7.30% drop in the next 5 days.\n\nThe constant low performance of Ethereum Classic (ETC) came to the notice of Coinbase. The crypto company announced removal of Ethereum Classic (ETC) and a few other tokens from its list. The changes will be applied from January 2023. Coinbase cited that the delisting of Ethereum Classic (ETC) is happening due to its low usage.\n\nSnowfall Protocol (SNW) Shows Consistent Raise\n\nSnowfall Protocol (SNW) aims to build an efficient interoperable cryptocurrency market. Its cross-chain asset transfer approach allows users to swap assets among different blockchain networks without any hindrance. Snowfall Protocol (SNW) covers all categories of the crypto market, including infrastructural cryptocurrencies, DeFi, NFTs, and stablecoins.\n\nSnowfall Protocol (SNW) runs stress tests, security checks, and analysis for weeks before a project launch to ensure a secure, interoperable platform.\n\nSnowfall Protocol (SNW) is yet to launch, but its presale price has already spiked. Snowfall Protocol (SNW) was selling at $0.005 at the beginning of the 1st presale stage, which quickly raised to $0.025. Its 2nd presale stage was sold out a day earlier, which was a huge success for Snowfall Protocol (SNW) . The 3rd Snowfall Protocol (SNW) presale stage is live, and the token price has surged to $0.14.\n\nSnowfall Protocol (SNW) has shown 400% gains, and experts expect it to provide 5000% gains after the final launch. Thus, the future seems bright for the Snowfall Protocol (SNW) . Thus, if you are looking to park your capital in crypto, be an early buyer of Snowfall Protocol (SNW) and gain maximum returns.\n\nGet in while you can and invest in Snowfall Protocol (SNW) today!!!"

        "content": "Ethereum Name Service (ENS) saw a lifetime record number of domain registrations in 2022 amid a broader market frenzy in which some traders treated the domains as investments.\n\nENS is a decentralized domain name protocol that runs atop the Ethereum network. It provides users with an easily readable name such as \u201cabc.eth\u201d instead of a complex, long-form alphanumeric address for their crypto wallets, similar to the way the Domain Name System substitutes memorable names such as \"coindesk.com\" for websites' numeric internet-protocol addresses.\n\nData from Dune Analytics shows that more than 630,000 unique wallets created 2.82 million domain names, with 459,000 of those classified as \u201cprimary names.\u201d Primary names are ENS addresses that resolve to a user\u2019s crypto wallet and can be used as a proxy to search for information on blockchain explorers, such as Etherscan. The 2.82 million figure represents over 80% of all registrations since the service started in 2017.\n\nSeptember saw the most ENS registrations at more than 430,000 unique domains, and December recorded the lowest at just 52,000 domains, the data shows. The month of May, however, saw the most new users at more than 64,000.\n\nSome ENS buyers treat the names as investments, purchasing popular and common names and selling them for a profit, research firm Delphi Digital said in a July note. At the time, \u201c000.eth\u201d was sold for a record 300 ether (ETH), fueling interest in three-digit ENS names as \u201ctraders tried to capitalize on the hype,\u201d according to Delphi analysts."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIf 2022 made one thing clear about crypto, it\u2019s that there\u2019s absolutely no point in predicting anything.\n\nOvernight collapses of multi-billion dollar companies, historic technological achievements, industry-wide crashes, blockbuster confrontations with world governments, shocking revelations of corporate malfeasance, billionaires on the run, surprise arrests: 2022 had it all\u2014if not too much.\n\nWhere does crypto go from here? While the future may not be certain, it's too tempting not to make some educated guesses. A number of 2022\u2019s seismic events will certainly reverberate well into the new year; some new trends, too, are poised to play a major role in shaping what already looks to be another critical year for crypto.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHere are some potential answers to a few questions likely to have major implications for the industry in 2023.\n\nWhen will winter end?\n\nBy late fall, the crypto market looked poised for a recovery after months of relentless battering: the stock market was coming up for air, inflation was slowing, and prognostications for 2023 were cautiously optimistic.\n\nThen, one of crypto\u2019s most prominent institutions exploded in real time.\n\nThe stunning collapse last month of crypto exchange FTX cratered crypto prices, sending Bitcoin to its worst low in two years. Ethereum plunged to almost $1,100 in late November, due to a combination of market-wide panic and the dumping of millions of dollars worth of ETH by an attacker who purportedly drained FTX wallets in the midst of the company\u2019s unraveling.\n\nCrypto prices have since marginally recovered, but the contagion sparked by FTX\u2019s collapse only continues to spread. Digital asset lender BlockFi, which took a $250 million line of credit from FTX over the summer, declared bankruptcy late last month, weeks after freezing all withdrawals.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe company joined the ranks of a litany of crypto firms impacted by FTX\u2019s demise. Cryptocurrency exchange Liquid Global, acquired by FTX earlier in the year, froze all fiat and cryptocurrency withdrawals just days after its parent company collapsed; Sino Global, a blockchain-focused venture firm, confirmed \u201cmid-seven figure\u201d exposure to FTX; crypto investment and trading group CoinShares confirmed a $30.3 million exposure; crypto prime broker Genesis suffered a whopping $175 million exposure to FTX, and suspended client withdrawals for its lending arm as a result; crypto lender SALT also paused withdrawals.\n\nAs 2023 unfolds, it's all-but-certain that even more firms will be forced to disclose potentially devastating relationships with once-dominant FTX, which seemed to have spread its tendrils across every corner of the crypto industry.\n\nUntil the full impact of FTX\u2019s $32 billion collapse is accounted for, and its myriad connections are divulged and processed, it\u2019s unlikely a crypto spring will be able to take hold. With crypto contagion looking unlikely to let up any time soon, color us surprised if the proverbial line goes up before actual spring.\n\nCrypto laws, finally?\n\nDespite the crypto-related cacophony and controversy that emanated from Washington this year, there remains a jarring lack of clarity from the American government about the regulatory fate of crypto assets, protocols, and exchanges. Will 2023 finally bring some solid guidelines and guardrails?\n\n\u201cI am less bullish on regulatory clarity,\u201d Miller Whitehouse-Levine, policy director of crypto lobbying group DeFi Education Fund, told Decrypt about 2023\u2019s prospects.\n\nWith control of Congress set to be narrowly split between Democrats and Republicans in 2023, Whitehouse-Levine is skeptical that warring political factions will be able to put aside their differences to pass sweeping crypto regulatory legislation.\n\n\u201cI think it's going to be difficult for those two constituencies\u2014each with completely different views on crypto policy\u2014to come to a consensus that can pass Congress,\u201d he said.\n\nOne bipartisan crypto bill that looked poised to go the distance now appears all-but doomed. The Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act (DCCPA), also known as the Stabenow-Boozman bill, would have granted crypto regulatory powers to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and was by late 2022 gaining traction on the Hill.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne of the bill\u2019s most prominent supporters, though, was now-disgraced FTX founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, who favored the bill\u2019s mainstreaming of centralized crypto exchanges like FTX. Weeks after FTX\u2019s historic collapse, the bill was put on hold. It appears seismic changes in political calculus may have permanently sealed its fate.\n\nThere is, however, one area of crypto legislation with potential for movement in 2023: stablecoin regulation.\n\n\u201cIf anything moves, stablecoin regulation seems to be the area where action is most likely to occur legislatively,\u201d Whitehouse-Levine said. \u201cSeemingly everyone agrees that something needs to be done, and everyone wants a deal.\u201d\n\nOutgoing House Financial Services Committee Chair Maxine Waters (D-CA) and incoming Chair Patrick McHenry (R-NC) have been working towards a stablecoin bill for years, ever since Facebook stirred panic with its since-thwarted attempt to create its own stablecoin, Libra.\n\nIn the absence of any comprehensive legislation, stablecoins have continued to make headlines: in May, so-called algorithmic stablecoin UST depegged from the US dollar, collapsing its maker, Terra, wiping out some $40 billion in value, and kickstarting crypto\u2019s current winter.\n\nSEC vs crypto\n\nAnother key character in crypto\u2019s ongoing, unfolding battle with Washington is the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) and headline-grabbing head honcho Gary Gensler.\n\nGensler made waves in 2022 for escalating enforcement actions against crypto companies without providing baseline rules or guidelines for the emergent industry. Gensler\u2019s own colleague, SEC commissioner Hester Peirce, previously labeled such policies of education by enforcement \u201cjust not a good way of regulating,\u201d in an interview with Decrypt.\n\nWill 2023 bring any clarity, good or bad for crypto, from the SEC?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne major crypto development on deck at the SEC is a suite of pending updates to the agency\u2019s rules on security exchanges. The SEC has released a proposed draft of its revised rules, which defines security exchanges in extremely broad terms that appear poised to ensnare decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.\n\nThe rule is currently in the comments stage, and has not yet been adopted. If adopted next year in its current form, the rule could have devastating consequences for DeFi, essentially requiring the sector to be regulated as a securities marketplace.\n\n\u201cIf a DeFi protocol is required to be regulated like the New York Stock Exchange, obviously that is totally impossible,\u201d DeFi Education Fund\u2019s Whitehouse-Levine said. \u201cIt would effectively make smart contracts illegal in the US.\u201d\n\nWhitehouse-Levine is confident, however, that if such a rule were adopted, it would be challenged and potentially overturned in federal court.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the SEC may soon be embroiled in political problems of its own.\n\nRepublican lawmakers\u2014and some Democrats\u2014have recently ramped up criticism of Gensler and the SEC\u2019s inability or unwillingness to produce concrete rules on crypto assets. In the wake of FTX\u2019s collapse in November, Representative Tom Emmer (R-MN) demanded that Gensler testify before Congress, linking 2022\u2019s slew of crypto company collapses to the SEC\u2019s enduring failure to create a crypto regulatory framework.\n\nWhitehouse-Levine believes that, with Republicans soon to take charge of the House, stern words could soon evolve into real consequences for the federal regulator.\n\n\u201cEvery regulatory agency reports back to Congress, so there's a lot they [Republicans] can do,\u201d Whitehouse-Levine said. \u201cFor example, they could say, until the SEC issues rulemaking on digital assets, they can't spend any of this money on enforcement. It could be quite impactful.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWill Ripple\u2019s battle offer answers in crypto\u2019s war?\n\nOne of 2022\u2019s highest-profile\u2014and still ongoing\u2014crypto lawsuits saw blockchain payments company Ripple battle the SEC in federal court. The government asserts that the company\u2019s XRP token was illegally sold as an unregistered security.\n\nThe lawsuit has pitted a dominant crypto company with deep pockets against a federal agency with much to prove\u2014see above\u2014in one of finance\u2019s key arenas: the United States District Court, Southern District of New York. That court, colloquially referred to as the \u201cMother Court\u201d by legal professionals, oversees all Wall Street activity and holds a particularly influential sway over federal finance law.\n\nWill the case, ongoing for almost two years, finally see resolution in 2023? And if it does, what will that verdict mean for crypto as a whole?\n\nSome experts believe that the SEC is angling to use its case against Ripple not just to prevent the unregistered sale of tokens like XRP, but to set the stage for the agency to finally go after centralized crypto exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance.US\u2014the beating hearts of America\u2019s crypto trade.\n\nThe SEC, in its recent victory against blockchain-based publishing platform LBRY, successfully got a federal court to take the unprecedented step of labeling certain crypto tokens as securities in themselves, not just their sale as an illegal securities offering.\n\nIf the SEC can get its Manhattan-based judge to make a similar ruling on Ripple, the repercussions for crypto could be profound.\n\n\u201cThey want to go all the way and say the XRP tokens are the security,\u201d Lewis Cohen, an attorney specializing in crypto and securities regulation, previously told Decrypt. \u201cIf they got their way, most US token marketplaces could not allow users to buy and sell \u2018crypto securities\u2019 without registering as an exchange or getting an exemption.\u201d\n\nSuch an outcome would unquestionably upend the place of crypto exchanges in American finance, bringing stock exchange-caliber regulation to any entity trying to sell crypto assets.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n2023 will likely see either the realization of such a verdict, or an equally-consequential victory for Ripple, which would signify the dodging of a major bullet for the beleaguered industry.\n\nWhat next for Ethereum?\n\nFinally, some good news.\n\nSeptember\u2019s historic Ethereum merge transitioned crypto\u2019s dominant network to a proof of stake consensus mechanism that instantly cut its energy consumption by a whopping 99.99%, according to reports.\n\nAfter that technical triumph, what\u2019s in store for Ethereum as it moves into 2023?\n\nFirst up will be the network\u2019s Shanghai upgrade, expected to launch in March.\n\nShanghai will, first and foremost, enable withdrawals of staked ETH. Since the merge went live in September, users have been able to deposit existing ETH with the Ethereum network to help validate Ethereum transactions and create new ETH for themselves in the process. All staked ETH and newly generated ETH, however, have not yet been made available for withdrawal.\n\nCome March that will change, and some $20 billion worth of staked ETH will finally be made available to Ethereum users following the network\u2019s Shanghai upgrade.\n\nEthereum\u2019s core developers are so committed to rolling out staked ETH withdrawals that they\u2019re trying to keep Shanghai as light as possible, eliminating other much-anticipated network upgrades from the update in the name of expeditiousness.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne such improvement that many hoped would be included in Shanghai is proto-danksharding, a preliminary version of a process by which huge amounts of data on Ethereum rollups\u2014a tool used to combine many Ethereum transactions and treat them as one speedy, cheap transaction\u2014will one day be verified by only sampling small pieces of data.\n\nDanksharding will take a process that already makes Ethereum transactions cheaper and faster, and make them far cheaper and faster. The update will dramatically increase the speed and ease with which huge amounts of data could be verified on Ethereum layer-2 networks like Optimism and Arbitrum.\n\nMany see danksharding as the key to Ethereum\u2019s future proliferation and dominance as a reliable, secure network that\u2019s also incredibly fast and inexpensive to use.\n\nWhile proto-danksharding may not come as soon as March, Ethereum\u2019s developers hope it will still arrive by the end of next year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very confident that it will be shipped in 2023,\u201d Ethereum core developer Marius Van Der Wijden told Decrypt. He expects the proto-danksharding tool to be included in Ethereum\u2019s next upgrade after Shanghai, which has been tentatively labeled Cancun."

        "content": "Tron is currently the second largest blockchain in terms of total value locked, behind only ethereum, according to DefiLlama data, and is thriving in its DeFi ecosystem.\n\nTRON TVL exceeds BSC\n\nTron now has more TVL than BSC, Polygon, Solana, and Avalanche TRON recently incorporated BUSD, Binance\u2019s stablecoin into its network.\n\nTron now has a TVL of $4.15 billion (10.7%) slightly ahead of BNB\u2019s $4.08 billion (10.52%). Although negligible, the margin is noticeable. Tron has kept its TVL level while BNB Chain\u2019s slight decline has helped it advance. For virtually all of 2022, BNB Chain remained stable behind ethereum.\n\nEthereum is still the largest blockchain by TVL, at $23.07B or 59.53% of the entire market. In fourth place, is Arbitrum at $1.02 B (2.64%) followed by Polygon network at about $995M (2.57%).\n\nStronger demand for the network may have led to Tron\u2019s higher TVL ranking. Additionally, it might result in a long-term increase in TRX demand and a favourable attitude towards the network.\n\nDeFi TVL has been decreasing\n\nThe total value locked (TVL) in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols has decreased along with the harsh crypto winter, according to data supplied by DeFi Llama. Since December 2021, the total DeFi TVL has decreased by 78.1%, from an all-time high (ATH) of $181.2 billion to about $39.4 billion at the time of writing.\n\nReflectively, Binance Smart Chain\u2019s (BSC) TVL has sharply declined and hit 19-month lows.\n\nAccording to the tracker\u2019s data, BSC\u2019s total market value has decreased by 0.15% over the previous 24 hours and 19% in a month as of the time of writing. PancakeSwap is the major shareholder in BSC\u2019s TVL with ownership of almost 53% of shares and a value of $2.16 billion, down 14.3% in the last 30 days.\n\nWhat\u2019s TVL?\n\nToday, like in 2022 the total value locked (TVL) of the DeFi sector is still dominated by Tron, BSC, and ethereum. The TVL of a protocol helps us comprehend the value of each DeFi protocol. The DeFi industry\u2019s TVL statistic comes the closest to the total market size. The transaction volume of NFT for different segments reflects the erratic character of advances in this nascent market.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

The world's second-largest cryptocurrency recorded 338 per cent more transactions in 2022 as compared to Bitcoin, as per the data from Nasdaq and Ycharts.\n\nOn the Ethereum network, there were 408.5 million transactions, more than the 93.1 million on the Bitcoin network. This translates to the average daily number of transactions on Ethereum at 1.1 million while they were 2,55,000 on the Bitcoin network.\n\nEven though Ethereum emerged as the winner in transaction volumes, the Bitcoin network saw more consistent and regular transaction volumes as compared to the former. This was attributed to times of increased demand, such as during the launch of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and other activities.\n\nThe success rate in Ethereum's transaction volumes continued in 2023 too as the number of transactions on its network on January 2 touched 924,614, a 300 per cent jump compared to the Bitcoin network on the same day (229,191), according to Cointelegraph.\n\nVitalik Buterin on what he\u2019s bullish on\n\nCo-founder of the crypto token recently shared some bullishness for the year ahead while confirming the launch of the Ethereum Improvement Protocol (EIP) 4884 sometime in 2023.\n\nOn New Year's Eve, December 31, Buterin replied to a post by former chief technology officer of Coinbase, Balaji Srinivasan, in which he asked users what they were bullish on for 2023? In the comment section, the Ethereum co-founder shared that he was looking forward to reaching the \u201cbasic rollup scaling\u201d milestone as outlined in the Ethereum roadmap.\n\nThis means the rollout of The Surge-related Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)-4884 and rollups partially taking off training wheels at least to stage 1 referring to a November 22 post on the \u201cEthereum Magicians forum\u201d, which details three stages of the \u201ctrust model\u201d based on how mature a project\u2019s tech was.\n\nMeanwhile, the 28-year-old had on December 30 tweeted on what he believes a \u201cGood Crypto Future\u201d might look like. In his post, the Ethereum boss highlighted several areas of crypto that would need to be fixed, including scaling, privacy, user experience and making user accounts more secure for average users than centralized services.\n\nFurther, Buterin is of the view that payments and decentralized finance (DeFi) will be a part of this future."

        "content": "If 2022 was anything to go by, the cryptocurrencies industry remains a highly innovative one with new developments always in the offing.\n\nHowever, not all developments were positive, indeed many contributed negatively to the industry and its reputation. As another year gets to speed, with help from several Dune dashboard, these are some of the trends we will be watching out for in 2023.\n\n1.) ETH Staking\n\n2022 was always going to be a significant year for Ethereum due to its transition to a full Proof-of-Stake blockchain, christened \u2018the Merge.\u2019\n\nStaking on the beacon chain was already an established trend through 2021, but in 2022 it grew to new heights.\n\nAccording to this dashboard by Dune Analytics, almost 7 million $ETH was deposited to the Beacon Chain throughout 2022, and the number of validators grew by more than 215,000.\n\n15.84 million ETH is now staked, 13.14% of the entire supply.\n\nContinuing an established trend from 2021, liquid staking remained the largest staking category and continued growing in 2022:\n\nWithin the liquid staking space itself, Lido remained the market leader, increasing its marketshare from 18% to ~30% throughout the year.\n\nThis all helped to propel the network to a successful Merge and relatively seamless switch to Proof-of-Stake.\n\n2.) The Rise of L2 Rollups\n\nBefore the much awaited Merge, a key trend on Ethereum was the emergence of L2 scaling solutions. In 2022, these platforms grew significantly, in particular Optimism & Arbitrum.\n\nThis is well captured by this ashboard showing the growth in active addresses during 2022:\n\nDaily transactions have also been rising as those on Ethereum itself steadily fall.\n\nFor the first half of 2022, Optimism & Arbitrum combined were doing less than 200k daily transactions. By Q4 2022, this figure was regularly hitting 1 million:\n\n3.) The Flight to Self Custody\n\nThe collapse of once important platforms like LUNA/UST, Celsius, Voyager, BlockFi, and most recently, FTX/Alameda, elicited a rise in self custody.\n\nThis dashboard illustrates a flight in assets from centralized platforms (CEX) throughout the year. We can even see upticks around the time of major blow-ups in May, June and November 2022:\n\nThis is definitely one development to keep an eye on as we get into 2023 proper.\n\n4.) Wash Trading\n\nIn early 2022, NFT trading seemed to explode hitting several billion dollar\u2019s worth of weekly volume for the first time.\n\nHowever, as analyzed in this recent article, more than 80% of NFT trade volume was wash trading \u2013 a form of market manipulation where users trade NFTs between different wallets that they own, typically with the goal of accruing trading rewards or boosting metrics of a specific piece or collection.\n\nWash trading is thought to account for 58% of NFT trading volume in 2022. As overall NFT volume dropped significantly from May 2022 onwards, wash trading remained at over 50%:\n\n5.) Investors Flee DeFi\n\nIn 2021, DeFi was one of the main stories in crypto, but the 2022 winter caused a noticeable flight to safety from market participants.\n\nInvestors withdrew their stablecoins from smart contracts, with the share of DAI, USDC & USDT held by smart contracts plummeting throughout the year with noticeable spikes.\n\nIt will be worth keeping an eye on these contracts in 2023, if just to get a bearing of the market condition.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nFollow us on Twitter for the latest posts and updates\n\nJoin and interact with our Telegram community\n\n_____________________________________\n\n_____________________________________"
