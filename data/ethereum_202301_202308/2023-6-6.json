        "content": "The prices of Bitcoin, Ether, and other top cryptocurrencies dropped marginally just after the Securities and Exchange Commission sued U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase\u2014just one day after the agency filed another blockbuster lawsuit against Binance, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nBitcoin was immediately down about 1%, Ether 0.7%, and BNB, Binance\u2019s digital currency, dipped to a low of 1%. Bitcoin began the day at $25,700 and dropped to a low of $25,400. The total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies sagged about 0.7%.\n\nIn the lawsuit against Coinbase, the SEC specifically detailed \u201ca non-exhaustive list\u201d of 13 cryptocurrencies that it argued were securities, including pages of details outlining these tokens\u2019 releases. The most prominent include Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and Polygon (MATIC).

        "title": "How to create a smart contract using Ethereum - TechTarget",
        "content": "Smart contracts, which are programs that run on a blockchain, have transformed blockchain from a data storage technology to an application platform that allows developers to support a variety of business processes, from supply chain management to real estate administration to decentralized finance.\n\nAt the center of it all is the Solidity programming language.\n\nAlthough smart contracts can be written in a number of programming languages, Solidity has become the first choice for many developers doing smart contract programming. That's why it's worth knowing about.\n\nSolidity is a powerful and complex programming language that takes time to master. However, starting out with Solidity isn't daunting, particularly for developers who have a background in object-oriented programming (OOP). This article shows you how to get started.\n\nBut before we get to the nuts and bolts of the matter, let's look at why Solidity has become so popular.\n\nSmart contracts for the Ethereum network: How they work and why they're popular One of the biggest reasons for Solidity's popularity is that it's the language used for programs that run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). To understand why this is significant, it's useful to understand a bit of the history of blockchain. This article is part of Blockchain for businesses: The ultimate enterprise guide Which also includes:\n\nTop 10 benefits of blockchain for business\n\nTop 10 benefits of blockchain for business What are the 4 different types of blockchain technology?\n\nWhat are the 4 different types of blockchain technology? 7 must-have blockchain developer skills Download 1 Download this entire guide for FREE now! Blockchain technology became commonplace with the introduction of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin in 2009. When it was first introduced, the Bitcoin blockchain supported transferring Bitcoin (the cryptocurrency) between parties. But, other than that, the Bitcoin blockchain was dumb. It didn't support executing rules or enforcing conditional logic. You couldn't program a transaction such as \"have Bob transfer two Bitcoin to Alice on the first of the month as payment for rent on Bob's apartment.\" However, another blockchain network came along that did have this sort of capability. That network was Ethereum. Solidity is the way Ethereum supports executing rules or enforcing conditional logic by way of smart contracts, and it is the language Ethereum created for writing smart contracts. Ethereum also specified the EVM as the mechanism for running smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The EVM acts as an intermediary between the smart contract's compiled bytecode and the Ethereum blockchain, very much in the same way that a Java virtual machine acts as the intermediary between compiled Java bytecode and the computer hosting the Java program. The way smart contract development works under Ethereum is that developers write smart contract code in Solidity as a text file. Then, they use a tool called the Solidity compiler (solc) to transform the Solidity text into bytecode that the EVM can understand. Finally, the bytecode is deployed to and stored on the Ethereum blockchain at a particular address (see Figure 1.) Figure 1. The Solidity software development lifecycle. Depending on how it's programmed, the smart contract can run on its own continually, or other smart contracts can call functions in the smart contract by using special tools. Solidity and the EVM caught on. Eventually, other blockchains such as Avalanche and Hedera incorporated the EVM specification. As support for the EVM grew among different blockchains, so too did the popularity of the Solidity programming language. Today GitHub reports over 56,000 source code repositories related to Solidity.\n\nCreating and deploying a smart contract to the Ethereum network Now, let's create a smart contract and show how to deploy it on Ethereum. The Solidity programming language supports inheritance, encapsulation and polymorphism as is typically found in OOP languages such as Java, C# and TypeScript. Whereas in OOP the basic unit of encapsulation is the class, in Solidity it's called a contract. A contract can contain public or private data members and functions. One added feature that is special to Solidity is the notion of the predefined msg, tx and block variables, which are global to any contract. The msg variable describes the external call made to the contract. The tx variable describes the fee associated with the cost of contract execution as well as the party that is going to pay that fee. A feature common to all blockchains is that there is a fee, measured in a unit of denomination called gas, incurred every time a transaction is executed, regardless of whether the transaction is a simple transfer of funds or a function being executed in decentralized applications such as Solidity contracts. The block variable describes the state of a block on the underlying blockchain on which the contract is hosted. For example, the property block.gaslimit reports the maximum amount of gas the underlying blockchain will allow to be consumed by a given transaction. As with object-oriented programming, Solidity supports interfaces, thus allowing developers to define the methods and data members that an implementing contract will provide. Also, a smart contract is considered a composite data type just as class is in OOP. The following code examples demonstrate the steps in creating a smart contract that declares an interface and then implements that interface in another Solidity smart contract. The final step shows yet another smart contract that returns the interface of the implementation contract. Listing 1 declares an interface named ILocation. (All the code for this article is available in one of my GitHub repositories here.) // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT pragma solidity ^0.8.17; interface ILocation { function getLongitude( ) external view returns(uint16 ); function getLatitude( ) external view returns(uint16 ); } Listing 2 shows how to implement the ILocation interface in a contract named Location. Notice that the syntax to declare a contract as an implementation of an interface is expressed at line 5 using the is keyword. // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT pragma solidity ^0.8.17; import \"./ILocation.sol\"; contract Location is ILocation { uint16 latitude; uint16 longitude; constructor (uint16 _longitude, uint16 _latitude){ latitude = _latitude; longitude = _longitude; } function getLongitude() external view returns(uint16 ){ return longitude; } function getLatitude () external view returns(uint16 ){ return latitude; } } Listing 3 shows another Solidity smart contract that imports the Location contract defined in Listing 2. Notice the import statement at line 3. Importing the Location contract implicitly imports the ILocation interface too. The function getLocation() returns an ILocation interface which is backed behind the scenes by a Location contract defined in Listing 2. // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT pragma solidity ^0.8.17; import \"./Location.sol\"; contract LocationFactory { function getLocation(uint16 _longitude, uint16 _latitude) public returns (ILocation) { return new Location(_longitude, _latitude); } } The three listings not only demonstrate how to create and use contracts in Solidity programming, the code also demonstrates how to use the program to the interface technique, which is common practice among object-oriented programmers. When it comes time to deploy the code to an EVM-compatible blockchain, first the developer will compile the code into bytecode and then deploy the bytecode to the blockchain either using a tool at the command line or from within an IDE such as VS Code or Remix. Let's look at the details.\n\nTools for writing a smart contract in Solidity The evolution of tools available to create distributed applications based on smart contracts is impressive, given that Solidity was first proposed in 2014. Today, IDEs do most of the heavy lifting, allowing developers to focus on the logic of their smart contracts instead of the minutiae that goes with getting it all to work. Most developers use one for writing smart contracts, and the days of only using a simple text editor are long gone. There are two types of IDEs. One type is hosted on a local machine, the other is online and accessed from a web browser. IDEs for local machines include VS Code and JetBrains WebStorm (see Figures 2 and 3). Figure 2. The Visual Studio IDE configured for Solidity programming using the Hardhat framework. Figure 3. The JetBrains IDE configured for Solidity programming using the Hardhat framework. Development in a local IDE will also involve using frameworks such as HardHat and Truffle to help execute compilation and deployment. As for online tools, Ethereum's Remix is the most popular (see Figure 4). Remix reduces the labor of creating Ethereum smart contracts by doing common development chores such as library management, code autocompletion, syntax checking and even deployment. Remix allows you to deploy smart contracts to development EVMs that are special to Remix. Also, you can bind the IDE to a MetaMask wallet browser plugin and then use test Ether cryptocurrency from a variety of Ethereum accounts to fund the transaction fees that go with deploying and running the smart contract to the blockchain. Figure 4. Ethereum's Remix is an online IDE that integrates with Metamask wallet to enable paying transaction fees."

Source: Nansen\n\nBinance\u2019s reserve assets had a net outflow of approximately $1.4 billion in the first hour after news broke of the SEC\u2019s charges, amounting to 2.6% of its total reserve assets of $52.9 billion.\n\nThe outflow of funds from Binance across all protocols has reached $999 million in the past 24 hours. Deteriorating confidence in Binance, on the other hand, has helped OKX become a preferred destination for traders, with the exchange registering a significant inflow of over $190 million.\n\nBinance outflows accelerate. Source: DefiLlama\n\nCompared with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission\u2019s lawsuit against Binance in March, the recent net outflow is substantial but smaller. The same goes for December 2022, when Binance experienced large outflows in the wake of the FTX collapse. Additionally, the net outflows are still lower than the exchange\u2019s reserve. The crypto exchange holds a healthy stablecoin balance of over $8 billion.\n\nAside from outflows on Ethereum, Binance also saw the largest outflow of Bitcoin (BTC) from the platform since the FTX collapse. Over 20,000 BTC were withdrawn from the exchange in the last 24 hours.\n\nBitcoin netflow on Binance. Source: Glassnode\n\nAnother on-chain analysis shared by CryptoQuant revealed that the total amount of user transactions to withdraw funds spiked after the SEC lawsuit announcement.

At first glance, it seemed that network usage had increased, while the rest of the metrics suggested otherwise. Not only that, but ETH underwent a price correction as well.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nLooking at the bigger picture\n\nGlassnode Alert\u2019s 5 June tweet revealed that Ethereum\u2019s mean gas price had reached a one-month low at press time. A lower gas price can lure new users onto the network and, in turn, increase the number of transactions.\n\nHowever, that has not been the case, as other datasets revealed that Ethereum\u2019s key network stats have declined. For instance, Artemis\u2019 data revealed that ETH\u2019s number of daily transactions had declined since the end of May.\n\nAdditionally, after spiking on 2 June, ETH\u2019s daily active addresses also waned. The blockchain\u2019s TVL and DEX volumes also followed the same trend, which did not look good for the blockchain\u2019s overall health.\n\nEthereum has more challenges to tackle\n\nEthereum witnessed yet another price correction on 6 June. The correction caused ETH\u2019s price to decline by nearly 3% in the last 24 hours. At press time, it was trading at $1,816.79, with a market capitalization of over $218 billion.\n\nThis happened after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Binance, one of the most prominent crypto exchanges.\n\nLookonchain\u2019s data revealed an interesting whale transaction. As per the tweet, an ETH holder quickly dumped 10,265 ETH worth $19.1 million before the market crashed after the SEC sued Binance, with an average selling price of $1,861.\n\nWill the declining trend continue?\n\nCryptoQuant\u2019s data gave hope for a trend reversal as a few on-chain metrics were positive. ETH\u2019s exchange reserve was decreasing. A decline in the metric suggests that the token was not under selling pressure.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nMoreover, ETH\u2019s taker buy/sell ratio was green, indicating that buying sentiment was dominant in the derivatives market. However, the recent price dip was accompanied by a surge in its trading volume, which could cause trouble over the coming days.\n\nMarket sentiment around Ethereum remained unaffected\n\nHowever, Santiment\u2019s data revealed that ETH\u2019s price action made news in the community, as evident from the rise in its social volume.

        "content": "Ethereum has just had its first major upgrade, or \u201chard fork,\u201d since transitioning to a proof-of-stake system. The Shanghai upgrade allows validators to withdraw the staked ether (ETH) that has been locked in the network.\n\nWhile the primary objective of the upgrade is to implement Ethereum Improvement Proposal-4895, which unlocks validator withdrawals, the changes include other significant upgrades that will impact Ethereum app developers and many of the chain\u2019s users.\n\nThe evolution of the ethereum blockchain\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain network has undergone a number of upgrades and changes since its initial launch in July 2015. Some of the most significant:\n\nFrontier (2015): This was the initial release of the Ethereum network, allowing users to create and deploy their own smart contracts and decentralized applications.\n\nThis was the initial release of the Ethereum network, allowing users to create and deploy their own smart contracts and decentralized applications.

This upgrade included a fee burn mechanism, which helps to reduce the overall supply of ETH and introduces a more predictable fee model for users. Paris (The Merge \u2014 2022): The Paris upgrade was initiated when the proof-of-work blockchain achieved a terminal total difficulty of 58750000000000000000000, which occurred at block 15,537,393 on September 15, 2022. The upgrade was triggered on the next block and marked a major milestone for Ethereum as it transitioned from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. Along with this shift, the upgrade included improvements to the execution clients, similar to Bellatrix on the consensus layer, enabling the execution clients to receive instructions from their connected consensus clients through the activation of a new set of internal API methods known as the Engine API.\n\nThese upgrades have brought numerous improvements to the Ethereum network across security, efficiency and scalability and have enhanced the functionality of the network.\n\nWhy is the upgrade important?\n\nThe upgrade is set to change the way the blockchain functions. One of the key changes is a reduction in gas fees for layer-2 solutions like Polygon and Optimism. This update aims to enhance the overall functionality of the blockchain while reducing transaction costs.\n\nAnother significant change is the ability for users to access and unstake their Ethereum tokens, which were previously locked in a smart contract when they became validators on the proof-of-stake-based Ethereum blockchain known as the Beacon Chain. This update provides users with more flexibility when managing their staked ETH tokens.\n\nThe Shanghai update brings technical improvements to the smart contract feature, which will help to position Ethereum as a major player, reflecting Ethereum\u2019s ongoing efforts to improve its technology and enhance value to users.\n\nInstitutions preparing for upgrades\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade is expected to have a positive effect on the institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies as it addresses concerns about security and reliability. It is likely that this increased level of trust will lead to further investment in this space.\n\nAs Ethereum continues to evolve, institutions need to be aware of potential impacts on investments and understand how to prepare for upgrades.\n\nUpgrades can impact assets in a variety of ways:\n\nUpgrades are not always successful. The network may experience downtime or technical issues, temporarily impacting investment value.\n\nUpgrades may change the way the network operates, directly impacting assets (e.g., reducing the cost of transactions or increasing the efficiency of dApps).\n\nUpgrades may include new features and functionality, attracting new users and developers to the network\u2014potentially increasing asset value.\n\nInstitutions preparing for an upgrade should review available documentation, including timelines for rollouts of updates, code commits and network changes. They should also ensure wallet and service compatibility.\n\nHow could the upgrade impact investors and ETH prices?\n\nThe option for full withdrawal may lead to a reduction in the number of validators on the network, but the extent of its impact will depend entirely on the number of validators who actually choose to withdraw. It is possible that the Total Value Locked on the Beacon Chain could decrease as stakers claim their rewards and unstake their assets, which could lead to a drop in ETH prices.\n\nOn the other hand, allowing the unstaking of ETH will attract more investors to staking, resulting in an increase in the amount of ETH staked. This is due to the rising popularity of liquid staking derivatives that provide stakers with liquidity flexibility while earning rewards on their staked ETH, without worrying about when they can withdraw assets.\n\nThis may increase the price of ETH, or at least help it recover further from the loss in value that occurred with the recent bank failures. The impact of these changes ultimately depends on the actions of the majority of validators regarding their rewards and unstaked assets.\n\nHowever, the daily withdrawal limit prevents a run on ETH withdrawals and will hopefully mitigate the effect of the upgrade on the market price of Ethereum. The market is notoriously hard to predict, and popular assumptions may prove to be inaccurate.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade brings significant changes to Ethereum, marking an important moment for the crypto industry, reshaping the way Ethereum functions and granting stakers newfound accessibility to their ETH holdings.\n\nThe information provided here is not investment, tax or financial advice.

        "title": "9 programming languages for smart contract development - TechTarget",
        "content": "Smart contract programming languages allow developers to craft special programs for transferring digital assets in response to specific conditions. These smart contracts typically run on top of a blockchain to automate asset exchanges without the need for intermediaries.\n\nOne of the first smart contract languages was the Bitcoin Scripting Language. It is useful for ensuring parties get paid and for exchanging digital currency during a Bitcoin sale. However, it is not practical for more complex transactions.\n\nOver the years, new smart contract programming languages such as Solidity, Vyper and Yul emerged specifically for writing more sophisticated applications. In addition, developers have created frameworks for executing smart contract programs written in legacy programming languages such as Java, JavaScript and C++. Developers should consider their programming experience and target platform when choosing the most appropriate language for a project.\n\nWhat to look for in a smart contract language Sanjiv Maewall, CTO of blockchain and digital assets at Deloitte Consulting, suggests developers assess characteristics such as security features, execution performance, developer community support, available tools and the relative ease of learning a language. Doing so can ensure that the language they choose provides a comprehensive, secure and efficient smart contract development environment. This article is part of Blockchain for businesses: The ultimate enterprise guide Which also includes:\n\nTop 10 benefits of blockchain for business\n\nTop 10 benefits of blockchain for business What are the 4 different types of blockchain technology?\n\nWhat are the 4 different types of blockchain technology? 7 must-have blockchain developer skills Download 1 Download this entire guide for FREE now! \"Familiarity with other languages additionally aids in picking up new smart contract languages rather quickly and allows for existing best practices to also be retained in the smart contract domain,\" Maewall said. Previous programming experience can also make it easier to understand important concepts in smart contract development. Knowledge of object-oriented programming, error handling and testing leads to more secure, reliable and efficient smart contracts. Nicko Guyer, Hyperledger FireFly community lead and senior full stack engineer at Kaleido, a vendor of blockchain tools and platforms, recommends developers determine the type of blockchain they plan to use before picking a language. The blockchain should be selected based on the requirements of the particular project. Even if the best language ends up being an unfamiliar one, you can probably get up and running quickly, particularly if you have prior programming experience. \"If the best answer for your project is a language you don't know, don't be afraid to learn something new,\" Guyer said. \"It's probably not as hard as you might think.\" It is also important to consider how the industry is evolving. Mrinal Manohar, co-founder and CEO at Casper Labs, a blockchain platform and service provider, observed that smart contracts were traditionally written in Solidity. But new standards like WebAssembly (Wasm), a virtual machine that can improve the performance of web applications, allow developers to write smart contracts in more mainstream languages like JavaScript, TypeScript and Python. It may also be helpful to look for a software development kit that supports features that run on top of your favorite programming language. Here are nine smart contract languages that merit serious consideration.\n\n1. C++ C++ is one of the oldest development languages on the list. It was introduced by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1983 to add object-oriented features to the C programming language. It is also a compiled language, which makes it perform well, but the compilation process adds an extra step to the development process. C++ is supported by popular blockchain projects, including EOS, Stellar and Ripple. It can also be compiled into Wasm code. One concern is that C++ is not a memory-safe language, which can result in security issues arising from how a program uses memory. It also can result in longer programs than some of the newer smart contract-specific languages.\n\n2. Clarity Clarity is a newer smart contract programming language introduced for the Stacks blockchain. It employs a framework for writing decentralized applications (dApps) that combine digital assets, data and identity in new ways. One novel feature is that Clarity is a non-Turing-complete programming language, which means it can't simulate every function of a Turing machine (a mathematical model of computation). Although Turing-complete languages allow greater flexibility, they can also be compromised by various smart contract hacks. Clarity's non-Turing-complete approach also makes it easier to perform a more thorough static analysis to identify security issues before deploying new smart contract apps. Clarity apps are also interpreted rather than compiled, which can make it easier to find and fix bugs after deploying an app.\n\n3. Java James Gosling developed the Java programming language in the early 1990s as a replacement for C++. One of its most essential features was the ability to write once and run anywhere. A key innovation was a just-in-time compiler that allows Java applications to run on different processes and operating systems. Java can be used to write smart contracts on Corda, Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, IBM Blockchain and Neo. It has a large development community and a significant ecosystem of open source components.\n\n4. JavaScript JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages for developing web application front ends. It is considered easy to learn and has an extensive open source community, which helps developers get started quickly. Despite the word \"Java\" in its name, JavaScript is an entirely different language introduced by Netscape in the mid-1990s. Many of the most popular blockchain platforms support it, including Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, Neo, Polkadot and Solana. It's a good choice for developing front ends for decentralized apps. For example, the web3.js Ethereum JavaScript API includes libraries for connecting front ends to Ethereum blockchain nodes using HTTP, IPC or WebSocket calls. The ethers.js library provides a basic wallet implementation in JavaScript.\n\n5. Python Guido van Rossum created the Python programming language in the early 1990s. It supports a variety of application development concepts, such as object-oriented programming and structured programming. Users can employ modules to add functionality to existing apps. Python is one of the most popular languages for developing AI apps. One of its top benefits for smart contract developers is ease of use. However, it is an interpreted language, which can slow performance compared to other languages. Blockchain platforms that support Python include Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, Steem and Neo.\n\n6. Rust Graydon Hoare introduced Rust in 2006 to fix some of the memory bugs plaguing C and C++. Like the other languages on this list, it is designed for writing compact and fast apps that can run on everything from embedded systems to high-performance computers. Rust has grown into one of the most popular development languages for writing back-end applications. It's also a good choice for writing highly scalable and fast-performing smart contract applications. However, it can be more complicated to develop on top of Rust compared to languages like JavaScript, Python or smart contract-specific languages. Some of the blockchain platforms that support Rust apps include Aleo, Cosmos, OpenEthereum, Polkadot, Solana and Stacks 2.0.\n\n7. Solidity Solidity is hands down the most popular smart contract programming language. It was introduced by Ethereum founder Gavin Wood in 2014 and later enhanced by a team at the Ethereum project. It runs on some of the most popular blockchain platforms, including Avalanche, Binance, Counterparty, Ethereum, Tron, Hedera Hashgraph and Polygon. It is based on JavaScript syntax, which can make it easier to learn (see Figure). Another key advantage is its large community of smart contract developers that can help developers master the basics of writing dApps. That said, it comes with several limitations and challenges that some of the newer smart contract languages are designed to mitigate. For example, in 2016, Solidity was blamed for a security vulnerability that enabled an attack on one of the first decentralized autonomous organizations, a popular blockchain-based management structure. Figure. Solidity software development lifecycle on the Ethereum blockchain network.\n\n8. Vyper Vyper is a newer smart contract programming language that is similar to Python. It enables developers to create smart contract apps that run on top of Ethereum, which provides broad support for dApps. One key innovation is a focus on readability and auditability in smart contract development, which can make it easier to find bugs and help developers identify other problems sooner in the development process. A downside compared to Solidity is that Vyper supports fewer features, which improves security but can also limit functionality. Vyper also does not support object-oriented concepts like inheritance, which can slow development but also improve security."

Pierre Rochard, vice president of research at Riot Platforms, suggested that Coinbase refocus its attention on Bitcoin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEchoing Rochard's sentiment, Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, known for his advocacy of Bitcoin, also expressed support for prioritizing the main cryptocurrency amid regulatory challenges. The founder of Twitter further emphasized the scarcity of censorship-resistant technologies at scale, including Tor, Bitcoin and Nostr.\n\nElon Musk, the world's richest man and current owner of Twitter, promptly responded to Dorsey's pro-Bitcoin stance with a concise yet attention-grabbing tweet, injecting his characteristic wit into the conversation. Musk, who has previously expressed interest in Dogecoin, a meme-inspired cryptocurrency, tweeted: \"DOGE ftw,\" an abbreviation for \"for the win.\" With this simple reply, Musk emphasized his ongoing enthusiasm for Dogecoin, adding an interesting twist to the ongoing discussion surrounding Bitcoin's prominence.\n\nWhile Dorsey has yet to respond directly to Musk's tweet, he made a notable comment regarding Ethereum. In response to a question about ETH's classification, Dorsey affirmed its status, implying that he believes Ethereum should be considered a security. This statement adds a new layer of complexity to the ongoing debates surrounding the regulatory treatment of cryptocurrencies and may spark further discussions within the industry."

        "title": "Security or not, Ether looks poised to hold the $1.8K level based on 3 key metrics - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ether\u2019s price retested $1,780 after the news of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) suing cryptocurrency exchanges Binance and Coinbase, but it\u2019s not preposterous to suggest that Ether bulls should be more than happy that its price did not break below the 67-day support.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s actions are actually a double-edged sword for Ether (ETH), and on Crypto Twitter, some analysts attributed the bounce in Ether to its not being listed as a security in either of the cases brought against Binance and Coinbase. For instance, the SEC explicitly mentioned BNB (BNB), Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA), which are direct competitors to Ethereum\u2019s smart contract-processing capabilities.\n\nHowever, as noted by analyst Jevgenijs Kazanins, Ether\u2019s omission does not mean that it has the green light from the SEC.\n\nSEC did not mention #ETH in the list of tokens that it considers to be securities when suing Coinbase and Binance. Could it be that the SEC is working on a separate lawsuit targeting Ethereum Foundation? \u2014 Jevgenijs Kazanins (@jevgenijs) June 6, 2023\n\nKazanins raises the question of whether the SEC could be targeting the Ethereum Foundation in a separate lawsuit. For now, the idea is a mere unfounded speculation, but it certainly has merit given that SEC Chairman Gary Gensler refused to answer questions about Ether\u2019s status before the U.S. House Financial Services Committee in April 2023.\n\nIn the meantime, what traders can focus on is Ether\u2019s price action, network data and other data that impacts investor sentiment and price in the short term.\n\nEthereum DApps get a slight boost\n\nTotal value locked (TVL) measures the deposits locked in Ethereum\u2019s decentralized applications (DApps), which have been in a downtrend since mid-March. The indicator reached a 14.35 million ETH bottom on June 3 but bounced back to 14.6 million ETH by June 6, according to DefiLlama.\n\nThe number of active addresses interacting with DApps is also in a slump. Over the last 30 days, the top 12 DApps running on the Ethereum network saw a 4% increase in active addresses, even though the average transaction gas fee remained above $6.50.\n\nEthereum's 30-day DApp activity. Source: DappRadar\n\nIf investors fear that Ether has higher odds of breaking below the $1,800 support, it should be reflected in the ETH futures contract premium and increased costs for protective put options.\n\nEther derivatives metrics neutral as regulations ramped up\n\nEther quarterly futures are popular among whales and arbitrage desks. However, these fixed-month contracts typically trade at a slight premium to spot markets, indicating that sellers are asking for more money to delay settlement.\n\nAs a result, ETH futures contracts in healthy markets should trade at a 4 to 8% annualized premium \u2014 a situation known as contango, which is not unique to crypto markets.\n\nEther 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nAccording to the futures premium, known as the basis indicator, professional traders have been avoiding leveraged longs (bullish bets). Still, not even the retest of the $1,780 level on June 6 was enough to flip those whales and market makers into bearish sentiment.\n\nTo exclude externalities that might have solely impacted the Ether futures, one should analyze the ETH options markets. The 25% delta skew indicator compares similar call (buy) and put (sell) options and will turn positive when fear is prevalent because the protective put option premium is higher than the call options.\n\nEther 30-day 25% skew. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe skew indicator will move above 8% if traders fear an Ether price crash. On the other hand, generalized excitement reflects a negative 8% skew. As displayed above, the 25% delta skew moved above the positive 8% threshold on June 5, indicating bearishness. However, the subsequent bounce to $1,880 on June 6 has moved the metric back to a neutral state.\n\nRelated: Coinbase reminds world it tried to \u2018embrace regulation\u2019 as SEC sues for violations\n\nEther\u2019s price looks poised to hold above $1,800\n\nIn short, these three indicators signal resilience \u2014 namely, the TVL bounce to 14.6 million ETH, the 4% increase in DApps\u2019 active addresses and a meager impact on Ether derivatives markets, despite the retest of the $1,800 level.\n\nEthereum network usage data remains healthy, and the recent retest of the 67-day support was not enough to scare professional traders, according to derivatives metrics.\n\nConsequently, bulls seem to have dodged a bullet, greatly reducing the risk of an imminent price crash.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "Long-time Bitcoin (BTC) advocate Jack Dorsey has found himself in a Twitter war with several crypto industry pundits after he responded with \u201cyes\u201d to a question asking if Ether (ETH) was a security.\n\nThe comment caught the attention of Udi Wertheimer, a Bitcoin Ordinals developer at Taproot Wizards, who inferred Dorsey was a \u201cclown\u201d in a tweet on June 6.\n\nIn response, Dorsey tweeted, \u201cETH is not a security?

        "content": "The Ethereum network has made the switch from proof-of-work mining to proof-of-stake mining. The transition was completed successfully on September 15, 2022. Additionally, the blockchain went through some major changes as validators replaced the miners.\n\nRecently, the much-awaited Shapella upgrade went live, allowing these speakers to withdraw their staked Ethereum 2.0. Additionally, with numerous developments on the Ethereum blockchain, let us learn about ETH a bit more.\n\nAlso read: How To Change Slippage Tolerance on PancakeSwap?\n\nEthereum in a nutshell\n\nVitalik Buterin built the decentralized blockchain platform Ethereum in 2015, along with the Ethereum Foundation, to support the development and execution of smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Additionally, it has developed to become one of the biggest and most popular cryptocurrencies in the world. Ethereum is distinguished from Bitcoin by its programmability.\n\nThe blockchain has grown to accommodate a wide range of applications. Developers on the ETH network can design decentralized applications by using smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with predefined rules. Additionally, over time, ETH has grown to be the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world.\n\nAlso read: Is MetaMask Safe (2023)?\n\nSource: CNN\n\nETH Price Performance\n\nSome of the early investors in ETH enjoyed a mind-boggling ROI.

Experts also predict Ethereum\u2019s average cost to sit around $2,009.\n\nWhether Ethereum can go up in 2023 can vary greatly depending on market sentiment. The SEC\u2019s crackdown on cryptocurrency exchanges, including Binance and Coinbase, has sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency market. This has also affected the price of major crypto assets. However, if the market proves to be bullish moving forward, ETH\u2019s price can shoot up."

        "title": "SEC Tells Coinbase: 'You Simply Can't Ignore the Rules Because You Don't Like Them.' But Coinbase Still Isn't Binance - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The SEC has brought charges against two popular crypto exchanges in as many days. Yesterday, it accused Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, and several connected entities, of a laundry list of securities law violations. Today, it charged Coinbase with operating as an unregistered national securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency. It also said it failed to register its crypto staking program.\n\n\"You simply can't ignore the rules because you don't like them or because you'd prefer different ones; the consequences for the investing public are far too great,\u201d said Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. In response, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong tweeted, \"Instead of publishing a clear rule book, the SEC has taken a regulation by enforcement approach that is harming America.\"\n\nThe SEC's charges against Coinbase center around securities\n\nIt's several years since Gary Gensler took the helm of the SEC. But from the outset, he's said he believes many cryptocurrencies are unregistered securities. He thinks they are operating without the required oversight. Recent moves from the SEC reflect this belief.\n\nIf a product is a security, it comes under the umbrella of the SEC and there are strict rules about how it can be traded and share information. Platforms that trade securities need to register and follow SEC regulations. But, up until now, most cryptocurrencies have been considered commodities. These are regulated by the CFTC and the rulebook is different.\n\nSo, what constitutes a security? The SEC's argument is that a product is an investment contract if a person \"invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party.\" The SEC thinks this applies to cryptocurrencies that are run by foundations or other entities if they make statements that lead investors to think they could make a profit.\n\nAs a result, the SEC accuses Coinbase of operating an unregistered marketplace where people can trade securities. It says that Coinbase's failure to register means crypto investors have been deprived of investor protections. It also argues that Coinbase's staking-as-a-service program was not correctly registered.\n\nOur top crypto play isn't a token - Here\u2019s why We\u2019ve found one company that\u2019s positioned itself perfectly as a long-term picks-and-shovels solution for the broader crypto market \u2014 Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and all the others. In fact, you've probably used this company's technology in the past few days, even if you've never had an account or even heard of the company before. That's how prevalent it's become. Sign up today for Stock Advisor and get access to our exclusive report where you can get the full scoop on this company and its upside as a long-term investment. Learn more and get started today with a special new member discount. Get started\n\nCoinbase has hit back at the charges. Armstrong says the popular exchange has tried to register with the SEC. He also points out that the SEC reviewed its business and allowed it to become a public company in 2021. According to Armstrong, \"The SEC and CFTC have made conflicting statements, and don't even agree on what is a security and what is a commodity.\"\n\nIn contrast, the SEC says Binance deliberately mishandled customer funds\u2026 as well as selling unregistered securities\u2026 and several other things\n\nTiming aside, there are some similarities between the SEC's cases against Binance and Coinbase. Both are accused of operating unregistered exchanges and the unregistered offer and sale of securities. But that's where it ends.\n\nThe accusations against Binance go a lot further and are more concerning -- particularly if you're a customer of Binance or Binance.US. According to the SEC, \"Zhao and Binance misled investors about their risk controls and corrupted trading volumes while actively concealing who was operating the platform.\"\n\nThe SEC says the companies involved lied about the controls in place to prevent market manipulation. Moreover, it accuses Sigma Chain, another company owned by Zhao, of carrying out wash trading on the platforms. Wash trading essentially involves buying and selling an asset to push up trading volumes and create an unfounded impression of demand.\n\nThe complaint also raises questions about the custody of crypto assets on Binance.US. It says customers don't know where their assets are stored. The SEC document warns this gives, \"Zhao and Binance free reign to handle billions of dollars of crypto assets that customers have deposited, held, traded, and/or accrued on the Binance.US Platform with no oversight or controls.\"\n\nWhat it all means for crypto investors\n\nThere are a lot of moving parts to crypto regulation. The SEC's charges come as key players, including Coinbase, testify in front of the House Committee on Agriculture on draft crypto legislation. We don't know what shape additional crypto regulation in the U.S. will take, nor do we know how the SEC's legal cases will pan out.\n\nWhat's for sure is that the question of how to categorize and regulate crypto isn't going away. If you hold assets with Binance or Binance.US, it's worth reading the SEC's accusations in full. Binance has said it will defend itself vigorously and that client funds are safe. But given that we're talking about your money, it's important to understand the details so you can make up your own mind.\n\nIn the meantime, brace yourself for further volatility, whatever exchange you use. Cryptocurrencies are extremely risky investments. One way to protect yourself is to only invest money you can afford to lose. You can also minimize risk by ensuring your crypto is part of a diversified portfolio. If you currently only own cryptocurrency, the risk is that you'll lose everything if the industry fails. Consider also opening a brokerage account and exploring other assets such as stocks, bonds, or real estate. That way you won't have all your financial eggs in one basket."

        "content": "Crypto trading pairs often provide valuable insights into market sentiment and dynamics. One such pair that has been gaining attention is Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC). The ETH/BTC pair has been showcasing quite a unique behavior, becoming a significant risk indicator on the crypto market. If you are a crypto trader or investor, this is a pair you should not ignore. Here's why.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOver the past 60 days, the ETH/BTC pair has seen a 12% increase, an impressive performance given the current market volatility. Moreover, its Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a popular technical indicator used by traders to gauge market trends, is about to perform a golden cross. This occurs when a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average, often seen as a bullish signal in technical analysis.\n\nBut it is not just the technical indicators that make this pair intriguing. The ETH/BTC pair's performance has been hinting at a broader shift in the crypto market. Ethereum is gradually cementing its place as a potential safe haven asset in the crypto landscape. Traditionally, Bitcoin has held the safe haven mantle, but recent trends suggest Ethereum may be ready to share the podium or even take the lead.\n\nInterestingly, Ethereum has begun to outperform Bitcoin during certain risk-off events, a phenomenon rarely observed on the crypto market. This shift could suggest growing investor confidence in Ethereum's long-term prospects, bolstered by the successful upgrades and the ecosystem's ongoing development.\n\nNonetheless, the ETH/BTC pair's performance offers an essential viewpoint for assessing the health and direction of the crypto market. By tracking its trend, traders can gain valuable insights into the relative strength of these two dominant cryptocurrencies and better inform their investment decisions."

The $25,290 barrier will likely provide some respite from bears.\n\nA recovery inside the falling wedge could see Bitcoin price try and retest the upper limit of the wedge at roughly $27,395. A flip of this hurdle into a support floor could trigger a swift move to $30,048. This uptick is likely going to target the buy-side liquidity resting above this level.\n\nBTC/USD 1-day chart\n\nA bearish case scenario for Bitcoin (BTC) price will include BTC sliding lower to retest the 62% and 70.5% retracement levels of the 59% rally at $23,905 and $22,925, respectively. While in the short-term, this move might seem bearish, a revisit to these levels will be an opportunity for long-term holders to accumulate BTC.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin Weekly Forecast: BTC delays inevitable crash to $25,000\n\nEthereum price could dip lower before a bounce\n\nEthereum (ETH) price currently sits below a critical support level at $1,817, leaving investors guessing where it will head next. A recovery of ETH above the aforementioned level, combined with Bitcoin\u2019s bounce, sounds plausible and could trigger a rebound rally for Ether.\n\nIf successful, Ethereum price could continue its ascent and target the $2,028 hurdle.\n\nETH/USD 12-hour chart\n\nIf the after-effects of the recent sell-off continue to impact the crypto markets, Ethereum (ETH) price could slide lower. In such a case, a retest of the $1,703 support level seems likely. The aforementioned level and the zone, extending from $1,563 to $1,478, are places where long-term holders are likely to accumulate ETH.\n\nRead more: Ethereum exchange supply hits multi-year lows, VanEck analysts predict a rally to $11,800\n\nRipple price to move sideways before revealing its move\n\nRipple (XRP) price has successfully hit targets of the inverse head-and-shoulders, as forecasted in previous publications. The recent sell-off pushed the XRP price into an inefficiency above the $0.483 support level.\n\nGoing forward, Ripple price is likely to consolidate between the $0.483 and $0.515 support levels before making a move to the upside. A successful flip of the $0.515 hurdle is likely to trigger a sweep of the $0.548 hurdle to collect the buy-side liquidity.\n\nXRP/USD 12-hour chart\n\nA failure to move higher after consolidation will signal a waning bullish momentum for Ripple (XRP) price. In such a case, a breakdown of the $0.483 support floor will be the obvious outcome. A further spike in selling pressure could send XRP down to retest the $0.466 barrier.\n\nAlso read: Pro-XRP attorney says Ripple has 25% chance of winning against SEC, Judge could announce verdict by September"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nCrypto gaming startup Argus Labs has raised $10 million in seed funding in a round led by Haun Ventures, the firm announced today, with Robot Ventures, Anagram, Dispersion Capital, and Alchemy also participating in the round.\n\nThe raise also included angel investors like Gitcoin co-founder Scott Moore, Sandbox VR co-founder Siqi Chen, and Osmosis co-founder Sunny Aggarwal in the mix, to name a few.\n\nArgus Labs' flagship product is its World Engine, a software development kit (or SDK) that will enable game developers to create their own dedicated layer-2 blockchain networks using zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) on Ethereum. Developers can customize their chains and decide exactly to what extent they want their game to live \u201con-chain.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nZero-knowledge proofs verify zk-Rollup transactions, which is a technical innovation in crypto that allows more transactions to be processed simultaneously to help scale networks and add more transaction privacy.\n\nArgus founder Scott Sunarto co-created Dark Forest, a crypto game launched back in 2020 that uses ZKPs. He believes that many more game elements can be on-chain than the average person might think.\n\nIn an interview with Decrypt, Sunarto said that World Engine will be able to support user-generated content through the blockchain and allow even more complex games like massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) to exist fully on-chain.\n\nAnd in a time following the sudden rise and fall of play-to-earn smash Axie Infinity\u2014when many Web3 game developers are shying away from going fully crypto and instead offering optional NFTs\u2014Sunarto is doubling down on the new ways that crypto elements can be used in video games.\n\n\u201cRight now, the only ingredients that you\u2019re really putting on-chain as a game developer are the NFT assets,\u201d Sunarto told Decrypt. \u201cBut now, if you have more parts of the games on-chain, you\u2019re essentially giving more ingredients for players, for other developers to really extend and build on top of the game.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSunarto envisions blockchain games in which players creating user-generated content (UGC) are more crypto-literate, and can code their own smart contracts (which power decentralized apps) to add new game elements and features.\n\nAnd crypto scaling features like sharding will be able to help adapt games for growing audiences and effectively add new servers, Sunarto said. The goal is to offer game developers customization while empowering players to develop their own communities and initiatives around Web3 games.\n\n\u201cThey built their own guild system,\u201d Sunarto said of Dark Forest\u2019s players, who also formed their own DAOs or decentralized communities around the title. He added that players took the initiative to create their own smart contract and \u201cpool their resources together\u201d in the game.\n\nWhen it comes to other blockchains protocols like Solana, Avalanche, and even Ethereum scaling network Polygon, Haun Ventures suggested that none are optimized for gaming. Argus is attempting to fill that claimed void.\n\n\"Current blockchains are not designed to run games,\u201d lead investor Haun Ventures said in a statement. \u201cScott and team, with our support, envision the World Engine as an open source, connected layer-2 of sharded blockchains that will serve as the backbone for the 'Internet of Games.'\""

        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) cleared its intention to go after the crypto market. Meanwhile, the crypto industry remains united and disagrees with the SEC for actions against Binance and Coinbase, as Bitcoin and Ethereum, and Coinbase (COIN) prices rebounded. Moreover, there are several differences between Coinbase and Binance lawsuits in relation to charges filed by the US SEC.\n\nKey Differences Between US SEC Charges Against Coinbase and Binance\n\nThe US SEC filed 13 charges against Binance and CEO Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao, primarily alleging commingling of funds. Charges include operating unregistered exchanges, broker-dealers, and clearing agencies; misrepresenting trading controls and oversight on the Binance.US platform; and the unregistered offer and sale of securities.\n\nadvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, charges against Coinbase include operating an unregistered exchange, broker, and clearing agency, and offering and selling securities in connection with its staking-as-a-service program.\n\nNo fraud charges were brought against Coinbase and CEO Brian Armstrong was not named in the lawsuit. Whereas Binance CEO \u201cCZ\u201d was named in the Binance lawsuit for commingling of funds and manipulative trading.\n\nDespite Coinbase being a publicly listed company, the SEC alleges Coinbase failed to register and deprived investors of significant protections, including inspection, recordkeeping requirements, and safeguards against conflicts of interest. SEC also holds Coinbase\u2019s holding company Coinbase Global Inc. (CGI) accountable for certain violations.\n\nMoreover, there was no proposal in Coinbase\u2019s lawsuit to prohibit the firm from engaging in financial-related businesses. Coinbase also received show cause notice from ten states California, Alabama, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, New Jersey, South Carolina, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin for\n\nUS SEC mentioned BNB, BUSD, SOL, ADA, MATIC, FIL, ATOM, SAND, MANA, ALGO, AXS, and COTI as securities in the Binance lawsuit. The agency listed SOL, ADA, MATIC, FIL, SAND, AXS, CHZ, FLOW, ICP, NEAR, VGX, DASH, and NEXO as securities in the Coinbase lawsuit.\n\nAlso Read: Terra Classic Passes Crucial Proposal To Revive LUNC, USTC Price To $1 After Parity Upgrade\n\nCrypto Market and Coinbase Shares Rise Higher\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum prices fell below $25.5k and $1800, respectively after the SEC filed the lawsuit against Binance. However, the crypto market defies SEC action against Coinbase and stands together to fight for clarity on crypto rules and guidelines.\n\nBTC price rallied above the $27k level after the Coinbase lawsuit, rebounding from the support at $25.5k. ETH price also jumped higher, with the price currently trading at $1,842.\n\nCoinbase shares rebounded after Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark Invest purchased $21 Million worth Coinbase (COIN) shares.

        "content": "Former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey says Ethereum (ETH) is a security while supporting a Bitcoin-focused approach for Coinbase amid the SEC lawsuit.\n\nIn a noteworthy development, Jack Dorsey, the founder and former CEO of Twitter, has publicly stated his belief that Ethereum (ETH) should be classified as a security amid the latest lawsuit against the US-based crypto exchange, Coinbase, alleging the exchange\u2019s unregistered operations.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIn addition, given Coinbase\u2019s entanglement with the US securities regulator, Dorsey, who is widely known as a Bitcoin (BTC) maximalist, agreed with a statement that the American exchange should pivot to a Bitcoin-only business model.\n\nSpecifically, Pierre Rochard, the VP of Research at Riot Platforms, a prominent Bitcoin mining firm, shared a 2015 tweet from Coinbase CEO in which he remarked:\n\n\u201cRipple, Stellar, and Altcoins are all distractions. Bitcoin is way too far ahead. We should be focused on Bitcoin and sidechains.\u201d\n\nQuoting Armstrong\u2019s statement, Rochard suggested that Coinbase should pivot back to being focused on Bitcoin, to which the former Twitter CEO expressed a 100% agreement.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nCoinbase\u2019s Case with the SEC\n\nInterestingly, the discussion surrounding Coinbase\u2019s focus on BTC occurred shortly after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against the exchange.\n\nThe lawsuit accuses Coinbase of operating as an unregistered national securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency, as well as failing to register its crypto asset staking-as-a-service program.\n\nThis development particularly stirred the crypto community, given that the SEC had filed a civil action against Binance, a top rival of Coinbase, barely 24 hours before launching the movement against Coinbase, as reported by The Crypto Basic.\n\nIndustry leaders such as Charles Hoskinson, the founder of the Cardano network, have described the SEC\u2019s recent action as a threat to financial freedom. Hoskinson particularly believes the SEC aims to replace mainstream crypto assets with a government-controlled CBDC."

        "title": "How ethereum survived its biggest test - The Australian Financial Review",
        "content": "\u201cIt was a major change, but there\u2019s a lot of talent and trust in the ethereum team,\u201d said Richard Galvin, the co-founder and chief executive officer of DACM. \u201cWe\u2019d been staking for several months and things were going pretty well.\u201d\n\nEach pledge helped secure the ethereum network, which was handling tens of millions of transactions per day, and in return, those \u201cpledgers\u201d, would generate a kind of interest rate.\n\nBut those behind the ethereum protocol \u2013 a group of developers called the Ethereum Foundation \u2013 had restricted those rewards until the underlying technical upgrades were secure enough to open the floodgates.\n\nOn April 12, the developers glued to their screens were awaiting the opening of those floodgates.\n\n\u201cIt was a long time coming, the upgrade had been pushed back many times as they tested everything,\u201d said Sally Yu, investment associate at King River Capital, a web3 venture capital fund based in Sydney.\n\n\u201cBut finally users were going to be able to withdraw ether from the network. It\u2019s quite a milestone in the development of this technology.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin vs ethereum\n\nEthereum, which operates like a global computer, allows developers to publish and execute applications powered by smart contracts. These are programmable scripts that facilitate the flow of digital assets.\n\nSince its inception in 2015, ethereum had operated like its older crypto-cousin bitcoin.\n\nThousands of computers had been crunching through mathematical puzzles to secure and verify an enormous, decentralised ledger that tracked the movement of these immutable but programmable digital assets.\n\nRather than a bank monitoring and recording money transactions, a decentralised network of computers did. And rather than individual dollars, they were tiny computer programs.\n\nBut in 2020, the Ethereum Foundation decided to change this model. Rather than rely on thousands of \u201cminers\u201d in the Proof-of-Work system, they wanted to reduce the power consumption and move to what\u2019s known as a Proof-of-Stake system.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead of crunching through mathematical problems, chewing up power, ethereum would invite users of the network to \u201cpledge\u201d their money \u2013 in the form of ether \u2013 to verify and confirm blocks of transactions as they passed across the ledger.\n\nThese pledges were made through a kind of server called a \u201cnode\u201d. Theoretically, anybody could set up a node, and across Australia several companies were quick to try it out.\n\nValidating transactions\n\nDavid Lavecky, chief executive of Canvas Digital, a payments provider helping the Reserve Bank of Australia with its crypto experiments, had previously been a large ethereum miner.\n\n\u201cBut when the mining stopped all that equipment became obsolete,\u201d Lavecky said. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t bother us too much because this new mechanism is much more efficient.\u201d\n\nCanvas was quick to begin running nodes out of Sydney, as were DACM and a distributed ledger technology provider called Trovio.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd The Australian Financial Review spoke with two individual software engineers in Brisbane who confirmed they were running one node apiece from their respective offices.\n\nAs it stands, there are roughly 156 validator nodes running across Australia, which account for about 2.2 per cent of all Ethereum activity. In total, there are around 7211 nodes, with the bulk of validators coming from the United States and Germany.\n\nIn return for correctly verifying the millions of ethereum transactions that take place every day, node validators receive a financial reward, paid in ether.\n\nBut if you, or your node, incorrectly verified a transaction block, your \u201cpledged\u201d stash of cryptocurrency would be burnt and lost. The idea was to hold the money to ransom and incentivise participants to keep the system honest.\n\nIt\u2019s also touted as a deflationary system.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an inbuilt mechanism that means a certain amount of ether is burned as part of the transaction. This helps stabilise the total circulation,\u201d Canvas\u2019 Lavecky said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo participate, each participant is required to stake at least 32 ether, which was worth about $60,000 at the time, or pool funds through some third parties.\n\nIn September last year, the switch to the proof-of-stake system took place. The Ethereum mainnet merged with the Beacon Chain, the original \u201cproof-of-stake\u201d blockchain, and the miners were switched off.\n\nThe rush of those wanting to sign up to validate the new network was immediate. Within two months, 15 million ether \u2013 worth about $US18 billion at the time \u2013 was staked.\n\nAt the time, the network calculated it would begin paying yields returning about 5 per cent on average per validator.\n\nBut the Ethereum Foundation, run by the blockchain\u2019s Russian-Canadian creator Vitalik Buterin, held back on allowing the participating nodes to withdraw their rewards.\n\nAt the time, Buterin and his team outlined the risk of placing too much stress on the network all at once.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut after many months of work, and a steady stream of new \u201cstakers\u201d signing up to secure and benefit from Ethereum\u2019s new \u2018proof of stake\u2019 system, the Shanghai upgrade was ready to launch.\n\nYouTube party\n\nThat\u2019s what brings us to April 12. And the thousands of node participants were able to begin withdrawing their staking rewards. At the time, there was about $US36.7 billion of ether locked up for staking.\n\nAs the minutes ticked by, the Ethereum Foundation was reminding participants that they needed to have upgraded their software to be compatible with the changes.\n\nA watch party on YouTube sprang up, with more than 25,000 onlookers from around the world. Buterin and the developer team took questions. And while it was mostly a celebratory mood, there was an underlying tension.\n\nThe price of ethereum, which had been under pressure for months thanks to the collapse of high-profile crypto exchanges like FTX and Celsius, could take a hit if things didn\u2019t go to plan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne analyst said: \u201cThis could still be volatile. There is a queue forming for [ether] withdrawals, and the looming sell pressure from Kraken, Celsius and others \u2013 that have to un-stake.\u201d\n\nBut as 8.30am ticked over, the software upgrade loaded, and it was done. The YouTube watching party broke out into applause and cheers.\n\nA musician called Jonathan Mann launched into a song, singing the YouTube comments out in a real-time performance.\n\n\u201cFor something that was securing billions of dollars, with huge teams working on it all around the world, it all went as expected,\u201d Lavecky said.\n\n\u201cI suppose you can say it was a bit of anticlimax, though a very welcome one.\u201d\n\nThe price of ethereum began rallying immediately. Hours after the upgrade, it rallied above $US2,000 for the first time in almost a year. In the following days, it jumped higher and higher.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat laid to rest concerns that potential heavy selling pressure would hit the market after the Shanghai upgrade because locked ether would suddenly flood into the market.\n\nBut the withdrawal process doesn\u2019t happen instantly or overnight, and much of the staked ether was sitting at a loss.\n\n\u201cThe amount of ETH entering the market from Shanghai withdrawals is much lower than what was previously expected,\u201d said Matt Maximo, research analyst at Grayscale."

        "title": "The Future of Tokenization: Exploring HedgeUp (HDUP), Ripple (XRP), and Ethereum (ETH) - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Tokenization, using real-world assets (RWA) to create blockchain tokens, will play a significant role in the future of cryptocurrencies. We are already seeing this trend develop with projects like HedgeUp (HDUP), which are creating competition for legacy crypto assets like Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP).\n\nHere is a closer look at each and how HedgeUp (HDUP) changes the game.\n\nRipple (XRP): international remittances\n\nRipple (XRP) was launched in 2012 by a company called Ripple Labs. The project, which was initially called OpenCoin, includes the Ripple payment protocol and the XRP cryptocurrency.\n\nRipple (XRP) was designed to facilitate fast and efficient cross-border transactions. But unlike traditional banking systems, the solution runs on a decentralized payment protocol called RippleNet.\n\nSince its launch, Ripple (XRP) has partnered with many banks, payment providers, and other financial institutions. However, it has also faced a good amount of legal issues that are still being resolved to date.\n\nThese haven\u2019t stopped XRP, Ripple\u2019s native cryptocurrency, from becoming one of the biggest crypto assets. The cryptocurrency currently trades at $0.530942 and has a market cap of more than $25 billion.\n\nEthereum (ETH): smart contracts and dApps\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) project is one of the most revolutionary crypto projects ever made. The development of the protocol began in late 2013. And since its launch on June 2015, it has gone on to become the most influential project in the crypto space.\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) protocol introduced the world to smart contracts. This is a revolutionary concept that allows developers to create decentralized applications (dApps). As a result, it has gone on to become the center of decentralized finance (DeFi), which greatly relies on smart contracts to function.\n\nETH is Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency. Thanks to the blockchain\u2019s successes, ETH is now the second-largest crypto asset. It is currently trading at around $1880 and has a market cap of well over $200 billion.\n\nHedgeUp (HDUP): tokenization of RWAs\n\nHedgeUp (HDUP) is a much newer project than Ripple (XRP) and Ethereum (ETH). In fact, it is yet to launch officially, and its presale went live less than two months ago. Despite that, the project has got the market talking. This is because of the game-changing platform it has been developing over the past few months.\n\nHedgeUp (HDUP) is building an investment platform. But unlike other protocols in the crypto ecosystem, this platform doesn\u2019t let you invest in cryptocurrencies. Instead, it gives you exposure to alternative assets like precious metals, rare artwork, valuable jewelry, and more.\n\nHedgeUp (HDUP) accomplishes this by tokenizing RWA into NFTs and making these asset-backed NFTs available to investors to trade. By interacting with these NFTs, users will be exposed to the underlying physical assets. Investors can also make fractional purchases. This involves buying a slice of an asset instead of the whole thing.\n\nAccording to crypto experts, HedgeUp\u2019s unique approach to tokenization has made it one of the best upcoming DeFi projects.\n\nThe HedgeUp (HDUP) presale has been live for many weeks now. It is currently in stage four, with the HDUP token available for $0.036. On top of buying into a promising project, investors who buy the presale get 30% extra tokens.\n\nClick the links below for more information about HedgeUp (HDUP) presale:\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Whales are suddenly moving hundreds of thousands of Ethereum (ETH) as the crypto markets witness a serious sell-off event.\n\nThe blockchain-surveying service Whale Alert spotted a string of Ethereum transactions adding up to 353,579 ETH and worth almost $400 million.\n\nOne of the largest transactions in the past day involved a deep-pocketed investor abruptly relocating 149,999 ETH worth $276.16 million from a wallet of unknown origin to US-based crypto exchange Coinbase.\n\nWhale Alert shows that the crypto whale paid about $3 in transaction fees to move the massive Ethereum stack.\n\nA different entity also moved 149,999 ETH worth $276.16 million from an unknown wallet to Coinbase. The crypto whale shelled out a little over $3 for the transfer.\n\nWhale Alert also reports three other large Ethereum transactions that saw the movement of tens of thousands of ETH from unknown wallets to Coinbase.\n\nSince all of the ETH mentioned were moved to a crypto exchange, they could potentially be sold on the open market.\n\nAt time of writing, Ethereum is trading for $1,809, down nearly 4% in the last 24 hours.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

However, amid the turbulence, there are indications that institutional investors, whales and so-called smart money are capitalizing on the market dip. Notably, Cumberland, a subsidiary of DRW, a reputable and diversified trading firm, has emerged as one of these astute investors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Lookonchain, a prominent crypto analytics platform, Cumberland made strategic moves following the news of the SEC lawsuit against Binance. On June 6, Lookonchain reported that the firm swiftly withdrew a staggering sum of 67.9 million USDC from Circle, redirecting 67.1 million USDC to Coinbase.\n\nSHIB and ETH to USD by CoinMarketCap\n\nAdding to the previous report, Lookonchain provided further insights today, suggesting that Cumberland seized the opportunity presented by the SEC's actions against Binance and Coinbase. Notably, Cumberland withdrew 20,000 ETH, equivalent to a substantial $37 million, from Coinbase. They also pulled out 4,850 ETH, valued at approximately $9 million, from Binance. Cumberland also withdrew various other tokens, including AXS, SHIB, COMP, LINK, CRV, AAVE and RNDR, further strengthening their position on the market.\n\nThese moves by a major trading firm indicate a strategic response to the prevailing circumstances. Such actions may serve as a confidence booster for other market participants, as institutional investors appear to see value in purchasing digital assets at a discounted price."

        "content": "Jeffrey Wilcke sent 22,000 ETH to a Kraken address.\n\nThe 22,000 ETH was worth around $41 million at the transfer time.\n\nWilcke\u2019s transfer occurred just hours before the SEC sued Binance.\n\nThe current crypto bear market has been one of the most brutal ones. Multiple companies have gone bust, and digital asset prices have plummeted.\n\nThe price has somewhat rebounded for Ethereum (ETH) since the local bottom of around $850.\n\nHowever, on Monday, one of Ethereum\u2019s co-founders transferred millions of dollars worth of ETH to a Kraken address, causing speculation that the ETH had been dumped.\n\nEthereum Co-Founder Transfers 22,000 ETH\n\nETH has been enjoying quite steady growth since the start of the year, being up by around 51%.\n\nHowever, the recent move by one of the co-founders of Ethereum has made ETH investors uneasy. Jeffrey Wilcke transferred 22,000 ETH on Monday to another address, then moved it to Kraken.\n\nAt the time of the transfer, 22,000 ETH was worth around $41 million.\n\nJeffrey Wilcke ( the co-founder of Ethereum ) deposited 22K $ETH($41M) to #Kraken 2 hrs ago.\n\n\n\nAnd the price of $ETH dropped by 0.4%.\n\n\n\nAccording to the -2% Depth data on #Kraken, he should not have sold all of the $ETH.https://t.co/ps5Th79BWu pic.twitter.com/HVbEV5IMrf \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 5, 2023\n\nMore interestingly, Wilcke transferred the ETH just hours before the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced its lawsuit against Binance. The price of ether then dropped by around 5%.\n\nETH is currently trading at $1,816, according to data from CoinGecko.\n\nThis was Wilcke\u2019s first transaction on that address in more than two years. In January 2023, Wilcke transferred 9,999 ETH to a different address, from which he then moved to a Kraken-labeled address.\n\nWilcke\u2019s transfer of 22,000 ETH comes just a month after the Ethereum Foundation sold 15,000 ETH.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nWilcke still holds over 150,000 ETH, worth around $272 million.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nSeeing what ETH insiders do helps better position oneself as a trader and investor. However, nowadays, a $41 million sale doesn\u2019t significantly impact the price of ETH.\n\nRead more about Rocket Pool\u2019s deployment on zkSync Era:\n\nRocket Pool to Allow Users to Stake ETH on Ethereum Layer-2 zkSync Era\n\nRead more about Circle deploying USDC on Arbitrum:\n\nCircle to Deploy USDC on Arbitrum: Here\u2019s What This Means"

        "title": "Etherscan Improves Ethereum Blockchain Study with Launch of Advanced Filters - CoinTrust",
        "content": "Etherscan has recently implemented an advanced filter as a means to streamline and expedite the process of blockchain analysis. The advanced filter facilitates quick access to desired data by enabling users to refine their searches. Etherscan serves as a platform for exploring blocks and analyzing data on the Ethereum blockchain. The platform encompasses a range of features such as transaction history, smart contract data, a block explorer, token information, analytics, and an API.\n\nIndividuals who are keen on expanding their knowledge about the Ethereum blockchain or undertaking research on Ethereum-driven initiatives will discover that the analytical tool is an indispensable asset. It is a common practice among traders and investors to frequently utilize it for monitoring the price of Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nEtherscan is an open-source project that is free of cost and is maintained by a team of software engineers. With a global user base of millions, this Ethereum blockchain explorer is among the most extensively utilized. According to Etherscan, the advanced filter enables users to search for transactions based on various criteria such as transaction type, function name, duration, amount, assets, and address sensitivity (sending and receiving addresses). In addition, users have the ability to save their filter queries for future use.\n\nThe significance of the Web3 analytics sector has grown progressively over the years. They are advantageous in terms of understanding the decentralized web ecosystem and making well-informed decisions. Their services encompass network monitoring, data analysis, smart contract auditing, portfolio tracking, and real-time monitoring of blockchain networks. These tools offer insights into user engagement, network usage patterns, and market trends. Additional examples comprise CryptoQuant, Covalent, the Graph, Dune Analytics, Nansen, and Alethio, alongside Etherscan.\n\nIn April 2023, Etherscan implemented a feature to hide token transfers with zero value as a means of enhancing its user experience. Recently, the platform has also broadened its scope by collaborating with the WEMIX3.0 ecosystem.\n\nTo utilize Etherscan\u2019s latest functionality for filtering transaction types, adhere to the following steps:\n\nBegin by selecting \u201cAll\u201d to include all transaction types.\n\nNext, focus on transactions where an Externally Owned Address (EOA) or wallet address sends ETH directly to other addresses.\n\nThen, consider \u201cInternal Txs,\u201d resulting from smart contract logic triggered by regular transactions.\n\nDirect your attention to \u201cERC-20\u201d transactions involving transactions related to ERC-20 tokens.\n\nFinally, explore \u201cERC-721\u201d transactions, which involve transactions related to non-fungible ERC-721 tokens (NFTs).\n\nFurthermore, the latest filter feature includes the following transaction types:\n\n\u201cERC-1155\u201d encompasses transactions involving semi-fungible ERC-1155 tokens (SFTs).\n\n\u201cDeposit\u201d narrows down transactions involving the deposit of ETH into the Beacon Chain Contract for Ethereum validation purposes.\n\n\u201cWithdrawal\u201d covers transactions related to the withdrawal of ETH from the Beacon Chain. This can include automatic reward withdrawals or exiting as a validator.\n\nThe analysis of DeFi exploits can be a complex task, often involving multiple addresses and requiring a comprehensive understanding of the incident. Previously, executing this process necessitated the simultaneous opening of numerous Etherscan windows.\n\n\ud83c\udd95 Advanced Filter (Beta) Refine your Ethereum transaction search with rich filters \ud83d\udd0d pic.twitter.com/DIb5ESYmNP \u2014 Etherscan (@etherscan) June 2, 2023\n\n\n\nThe Advanced Filter tool offered by Etherscan is a valuable resource for community members as it allows them to streamline their analysis by combining results from various filter fields. This results in a more comprehensive understanding of the exploit at hand. Please take into account the Euler attack that transpired in March of 2023. Prioritizing key transactions was crucial given the involvement of a flash loan and multiple tokens in this breach. Achieving this is feasible by utilizing the Advanced Filter feature, which encompasses regular transactions (txs), ERC-20 tokens, and internal transactions."

        "content": "Arbitrum stopped processing transactions for an hour today after its central piece of software that bundles transactions \u2014 the Sequencer \u2014 ran out of funds for gas.\n\nArbitrum has only one Sequencer and it needed to be manually replenished with Ether yesterday.\n\nAlthough Arbitrum is operational again, the incident highlights the blockchain\u2019s single point of failure.\n\nArbitrum, a layer 2 blockchain, stopped processing transactions for about an hour today, bringing the network with over $2.24 billion in deposits to a standstill. The reason was a bug that led to the blockchain\u2019s centrally-controlled sequencer to run out of funds to pay for gas.\n\n\u201cThere was a bug that occurred on the Sequencer that led to its batches reverting on-chain. When the batches revert, the Sequencer is not refunded the gas cost for sending the batch,\u201d Patrick McCorry, a developer at the Arbitrum Foundation, told DL News.\n\nWhen that happens, he said, the Sequencer runs out of ETH, \u201cand when the bug was fixed, it was manually topped up again.\u201d\n\nAt around 11:40 am London time developers in the Arbitrum Discord server started reporting that they could not connect to the network\u2019s Sequencer \u2014 a piece of software which bundles up transactions and sends them to the Ethereum network for confirmation.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nLayer 2 blockchains like Arbitrum need to send transactions back to Ethereum to achieve finality, meaning the transactions are inscribed on the Ethereum blockchain forever and cannot be changed.\n\nOn-chain records show that the Sequencer used up its stock of Ether, the Ethereum-native cryptocurrency used to pay transaction fees on the network. With no Ether to pay for fees, the Sequencer could not send transactions to Ethereum, bringing Arbitrum to a standstill.\n\nArbitrum Sequencer Transactions today (parsec)\n\nArbitrum currently has only one Sequencer that processes transactions. It\u2019s run by Offchain Labs, the company which created and stewards the network.\n\nAfter failing to process transactions for approximately an hour, Arbitrum now appears to be working again. A wallet which had previously sent funds to the Arbitrum multi-signature wallet sent a total of 1.4 Ether to the Sequencer at around 12:27 pm, allowing it to start sending transactions to Ethereum again.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nThe Sequencer has only been manually topped up with Ether four times since Arbitrum launched in May 2021.\n\nNOW READ: Retail feared that insiders would dump Optimism\u2019s $500m token unlock \u2014 so they mass dumped it first\n\nOffchain Labs did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe incident puts a spotlight on how networks like Arbitrum, which inherit Ethereum\u2019s security and decentralisation of the Ethereum network, also rely on centralised points of control. Offchain Labs has previously said it intends to decentralise Arbitrum\u2019s Sequencer in the future.\n\nArbitrum's total value locked, a metric for investor deposits in DeFi\n\nThe price of Arbitrum\u2019s governance token, also called Arbitrum, remained largely unchanged throughout the downtime. It trades around $1.14 as of this writing.\n\nUpdate, June 8: The second bulletpoint was changed from \u201cneeds to be manually replenished with Ether\u201d to \u201cneeded to be manually replenished with Ether yesterday.\u201d The second sentence of the first paragraph was modified to mention that there was a bug. The quotations in the second and third paragraphs were added."

        "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cryptocurrency markets were trading in the red on Tuesday after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed suit against Binance, accusing the exchange giant of violating securities laws.Bitcoin (BTC) declined 4% to $25,764, whereas Ethereum (ETH) was below the $1,850 level. BTC volume stood at approximately $20.32 billion, rising 76% in the last 24 hours.\"The latest development between Binance and SEC has spooked the global crypto market resulting in a bloodbath across digital assets. The market will respond sharply as the Binance-SEC saga unfolds; we should brace ourselves for a choppy market in the coming weeks. Regulatory clarity is the need of the hour for the global crypto ecosystem,\" Shivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, said.The world's biggest cryptocurrency exchange Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao have been sued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which alleged in a June 5 court filing that the firm operated a \"web of deception\" that included artificially inflating its trading volumes and commingling customer funds.The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) also sued Binance over regulatory violations in March.Other top crypto tokens were also trading lower. BNB and Solana declined by over 7%. Meanwhile, Dogecoin XRP , Cardano, Polygon and Polkadot also traded with cuts. The global cryptocurrency market cap was trading lower around $1.09 trillion, falling 4% in the last 24 hours.The total volume in DeFi is currently at $3.46 billion, which is 7.5% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume. The volume of all stablecoins is now $43.78 billion, which is 94% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume.The market cap of Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, was around $499 billion. Bitcoin\u2019s dominance is currently 45.78%, a decrease of 0.08% over the day, according to CoinMarketCap.\"The sell-off in crypto markets as a reaction to US SEC suing Binance has brought Bitcoin to its 3-month low. There is a strong confluence of support for BTC at the $25,200 range that will likely hold to form a 'higher low' for the asset and provide a bounce for the next leg up. Markets will likely remain volatile in the upcoming week,\" Vikram Subburaj, CEO of Giottus Crypto Platform, said.Rajagopal Menon, Vice President at WazirX said, \"Major market oscillators point to a neutral sentiment. The Relative Strength Index (14) sits at 37, with a neutral outlook. The Stochastic %K (14, 3, 3) at 24 and the Average Directional Index (14) at 21 indicate a Neutral outlook as well.\"The MACD Level (12, 26), at \u2212317, indicates Sell.

        "title": "InQubeta (QUBE) Presale is Rapidly Gaining Popularity in the Crypto Market Among Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH ... - BSC NEWS",
        "content": "AI-linked cryptocurrencies like InQubeta are gaining attention from both traditional and crypto investors, driven by the limitless growth potential of the AI sector.\n\nThe InQubeta (QUBE) presale is getting lots of attention from Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) holders. Bitcoin and Ethereum have enjoyed substantial growth in 2023, with prices rising by as much as 40% at some point. However, their prices seem to be stalling out as an increasing number of BTC and ETH holders swap some of their crypto for InQubeta.\n\nIt\u2019s the rational thing to do since InQubeta investors are set to 4x their portfolio during the presale\u2019s ten stages. Prices start at $0.0007 during the presale\u2019s beta stage and rise to $0.028 by its end. Prices are expected to shoot up exponentially once QUBE is officially launched.\n\nThe success of the InQubeta presale mirrors the growing number of investments poured into the artificial intelligence (AI) industry in the past several decades, going from $12.75 billion in 2015 to $119 billion in 2022. Investments in the sector are expected to rise exponentially by 2030 to $1.5 trillion. With so much money being funneled into the AI industry, it only makes sense that a portion is being poured into AI-driven cryptocurrencies like InQubeta that help to push the technology\u2019s development.\n\nInQubeta presale outperforming projections\n\nArtificial intelligence has gone from an interesting sci-fi concept to reality in the past decades. Ideas that once seemed scientifically impossible like self-driving cars are now being mass-produced. Many tech experts are already predicting AI will be the next major technological breakthrough that will significantly impact how the world operates.\n\nThe internet was the last major technological breakthrough that drastically changed many industries. For example, Amazon went on to dominate the retail industry despite not owning any storefronts, reducing its overhead and allowing further expansion. Today Amazon is worth over a trillion dollars. Investors who purchased equity in Amazon during its initial public offering have enjoyed exponential profits. A $10,000 investment in 1997 would be worth about $2.2 million today.\n\nJust like early investors in internet-based businesses went on to enjoy substantial profits, so will those who purchase equity in promising artificial intelligence startups that go on to change the world.\n\nInQubeta (QUBE) is helping to push the AI revolution by developing a platform that allows investors to bypass the unreasonable barriers often associated with traditional investment channels like unreasonable minimum deposits.\n\nCompanies create fractionalized ERC-20 tokens that represent equity and other bonuses on InQubeta\u2019s blockchain. These non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are listed on the marketplace where investors can purchase tokens of companies they think have bright futures. These purchases are made with $QUBE tokens, the platform\u2019s deflationary native currency. A 2% tax is added to all marketplace transactions and sent to burn wallets to lower the supply of tokens. Investors can also earn rewards on the platform by staking their cryptos.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\nBitcoin\u2019s (BTC) growth stalls\n\nBitcoin had a great run in early 2023, but prices have recently stalled. Bitcoin remains the most popular cryptocurrency on the planet, despite the problems older blockchains have like slower transactions and higher speeds. Still early Bitcoin investors have been turned into millionaires and billionaires, Many crypto experts still expect Bitcoin to grow significantly in the future.\n\nEthereum (ETH) mirroring Bitcoin\n\nEthereum\u2019s growth has been virtually identical to the growth Bitcoin has enjoyed this year. Ethereum was the first cryptocurrency to allow for the creation of smart contracts and decentralized apps. It uses a proof-of-work (PoW) protocol and hosts many other cryptocurrencies, including InQubeta\u2019s platform. ETH remains one of the top altcoins, but investors are dumping it in favor of InQubeta which has more room for growth.\n\nSummary\n\nThe verdict is in; a growing number of traditional and cryptocurrency investors are giving AI-linked cryptocurrencies like InQubeta lots of attention. The sector\u2019s limitless growth potential is one of the main factors driving this, with total investments in the artificial intelligence space expected to grow to $1.5 trillion by 2030.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale"

        "title": "Ethereum vs Solana: Which is Better for Investment? - ClearTax",
        "content": "Ethereum has been one of the most popular blockchains dominating the scene of dApps development. It also facilitates faster and safer payments across the globe. But now, another blockchain has been raging the market \u2013 Solana.\n\nReleased on 16 March 2020, Solana has addressed many issues that Ethereum users have been facing and has risen to a position to act as a viable alternative. Indeed, 2021 has been the year of Solana.\n\nHere\u2019s a competitive analysis between Ethereum and Solana.\n\nEthereum vs Solana: Mechanism\n\nThe performance of both these blockchains depends a lot on the mechanism they use. Ethereum uses the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism that Bitcoin uses. The network miners take part in this process. This ensures that the network stays decentralised, but there is a catch. The participating barrier within the network is high. This leads to fewer transactions on the network per second and reduces the network\u2019s performance as a whole.\n\nOn the other hand, Solana uses the Proof-of-History (PoH) mechanism. This protocol cryptographically determines the time passage between two events. The mechanism further adds timestamps to track the order of each transaction.\n\nThis difference in mechanism solves the problem of Ethereum and Bitcoin, where transactions on the blockchain are not logged promptly.\n\n\n\nEthereum vs Solana: Architecture\n\nEthereum uses a \u2018stateful\u2019 architecture in which all the miners on the network must update their copy of the network each time a new transaction occurs.\n\nThis may seem like a decentralised way to maintain records; however, it slows down the entire process.\n\nSolana solves this problem by using a \u2018stateless architecture\u2019. As all the transactions are time-stamped, the entire network does not need to update itself for each transaction. The updates are processed sequentially, leading to an overall speeding up of the entire process.\n\n\n\nEthereum vs Solana transaction: Speed\n\nThe current version of Ethereum can process approximately 13-15 transactions per second. However, platforms like Polygon serve as a multi-chain Ethereum scaling platform. It helps increase the number of nodes in the network, thereby enhancing the transaction load.\n\nSolana, on the other hand, does not need Layer-2 solutions to speed up its transactions. It uses a Turbine block propagation protocol that breaks data into smaller fragments. This process, in turn, makes data transfer across the network an easy task. The entire mechanism helps the blockchain perform at a whopping 50,000 transactions per second.\n\n\n\nEthereum vs Solana: Smart contracts\n\nEthereum is considered to be Turing complete. This unique feature helps it support a variation in programmability, which helps it to create different smart contracts. Ethereum also uses Solidity as a base programming language for coding its smart contracts.\n\nOn the other hand, Solana uses Sealevel to manage its smart contracts. Compared to the traditional EVM-based contracts, Sealevel uses a stateless mode and contains only program logic.\n\n\n\nEthereum vs Solana: NFTs\n\n\n\nIf you are interested in NFTs, you probably have heard of Ethereum-based NFT marketplaces. OpenSea is a famous example in this respect. It runs on the ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards and aims to build a vibrant open digital economy. This platform supports cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH/WETH), SOL, USDC, and DAI. The wallets that support OpenSea are:\n\nMetaMask\n\nCoinbase Wallet\n\nWalletConnect\n\nPhantom\n\nGlow\n\nFortmatic\n\nKaikas\n\nBitski and many more\n\nFor minting NFTs on OpenSea, there is no fee. On the final sale, you must pay 2.5% as a service fee. There is also a Creator\u2019s fee of 10%.\n\nSolSea is Solana\u2019s NFT marketplace with integrated minting. It uses ALL.ART Protocol has embedded licenses called NFT-PROs for its non-fungible tokens. You can buy NFTs on this marketplace with fiat currencies using Moonpay or FTX Pay. The compatible wallets are:\n\nPhantom\n\nCoin98\n\nLedger\n\nSolflare\n\nTorus\n\nSollet\n\nSlope\n\nSolSea does not have bidding options like OpenSea, but they plan to implement them soon.\n\nThere is a 3% marketplace fee for every successful NFT sale. You can also choose your own creator\u2019s fee.\n\nEthereum and Solana have transaction fees for minting, listing and delisting, which are not refundable. The method to open an account and mint NFTs is similar on both platforms.\n\n\n\nEthereum vs Solana: DeFi ecosystem\n\nEthereum has many decentralised finance applications that cater to billions of users. Top Ethereum DeFi apps are:\n\nMetaMask Swap\n\nSushi\n\nPolygon POS Bridge\n\nBungee\n\nLibera.Financial\n\nCowSwap\n\nHEX\n\nAave V2\n\nShibaSwap and many more\n\nComparatively, Raydium, Saber, Serum, etc., are a few DeFi apps available on Solana. Being new to the blockchain world, this platform\u2019s DeFi ecosystem is yet to grow to a larger scale.\n\n\n\nEthereum vs Solana: Investment\n\n\n\nEthereum and Solana both have their pros and cons. The former has been an older player in this field and thus has a larger market cap than the latter. However, with its new technologies, Solana has addressed many issues that Ethereum users face.\n\nFirstly it\u2019s the network congestion. On busy days, Ethereum transactions can be a real pain to process. Additionally, the higher gas fees are also an issue that needs addressing. However, with its vast DeFi marketplace, Ethereum gives its users many opportunities to diversify their assets.\n\nThe growth of Solana has been worth noticing, especially throughout 2021. It is too early to judge as the ecosystem is relatively new. However, it does have the potential to make its mark in the future.\n\nBoth the native tokens of Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (Ether) are available for purchase from the following exchanges:\n\nKuCoin\n\nBinance\n\nUphold and many more\n\nAs an investor, you should look at the opportunities present in both ecosystems. Conducting thorough research on these blockchains and planning your investment accordingly is the best way to proceed.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "title": "How Ethereum Gas Prices Soared Due to Memecoin Craze? - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Ethereum gas prices surged to another level after the memecoin craze became more prominent and the talk of the town\n\nMemecoin Craze reaching its glory caused Ethereum gas prices to surge to another level. Last year\u2019s merge to ETH 2.0 was supposed to fix high gas-fee issues, and while it went a long way in addressing them\u2014recent buyer demand has shown that they can still become expensive. While ETH might not be the best investment right now when it comes to price action, it\u2019s still the backbone of the defi token world and home to countless innovative projects on its blockchain. That\u2019s why there will always be a place for ETH in the crypto world, and there should arguably always be a place for it as part of a diversified portfolio.\n\nNotably, prominent blue-chip NFTs like MAYC and Azuki drove the surge in NFT volume. DappRadar\u2019s data indicated that over the past week, the volume of these NFTs increased by 29.9% and 129% respectively.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, ETH, was trading at US$1,873 at press time. The coin\u2019s MVRV (Market-Value-to-Realized-Value) ratio increased over the last month, suggesting that the profitability of addresses holding ETH is relatively high.\n\nThis could incentivize these address holders to sell and secure profits, potentially impacting the price of ETH shortly.\n\nLayer 2 Ethereum (ETH) solutions are gaining interest as they solve the scalability difficulties within Ethereum (ETH), which have resulted in high Ethereum (ETH) gas prices since 2020.\n\nEthereum (ETH) smart contract implementation on Layer 2 has increased by 160% yearly, indicating increased Ethereum (ETH) development activity. Some experts say sharding the Ethereum (ETH) network may also assist in cutting gas prices.\n\nFollowing the execution of the Shanghai update last week, approximately 1 million staked ETH worth more than US$2 billion were removed. The long-awaited update went live on April 12th, allowing the withdrawal of staked ETH. At the time of writing, the price of Ethereum (ETH) is rest at the US$1.8k barrier.\n\n5 ways to reduce the Ethereum gas prices\n\nUse Simulation Through DeFi Saver\n\nYou don\u2019t know the actual gas fee until you carry out the transaction and pay for the gas. However, you could use the DeFi Saver app to simulate your transactions. First, you\u2019ll create a recipe for Ethereum activities and then run it virtually.\n\nUse a Layer-2 Blockchain\n\nThe Ethereum Mainnet, also known as Layer One, is frequently congested, making transactions costly. Layer-two blockchains offer users the ability to scale up their transactions, and they do so by utilizing technologies such as Rollups and side chains.\n\nPick your transaction times carefully\n\nWhen it comes to Ethereum transaction fees, timing matters. According to gasprice.io, a handy resource for checking real-time gas fees, gas prices usually peak sometime between 8 a.m. and 1 p.m. Eastern Time. Saturdays and Sundays are usually the cheapest days to transact in ETH. A good rule of thumb is that the cheapest time to make ETH transactions is typically outside of working hours in the U.S. and Europe.\n\nUse DApps That Offer Rebates and Discounts\n\nOne of the easiest ways to avoid Ethereum gas fees is to use Ethereum projects and dApps that offer fee subsidies or nominal fees. If you are looking for such a platform, Balancer is a great one. The platform refunds the gas fees up to 90 percent in the form of BAL tokens. Balancer minimizes the gas fees for high-frequency traders by carrying out traders that don\u2019t leave the vault.\n\nSort Transaction Types\n\nDepending on the sort of transaction, the gas fee varies on the Ethereum blockchain. To save money on gas fees, users may wish to organize and implement similar transactions simultaneously. Consider that they have two Ethereum addresses, each containing 1,000 tokens. Now, if users intend to store all tokens in a new DApp\u2019s crypt to earn higher returns.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Polygon vs Optimism: How Do They Provide Enhancements to Ethereum? - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "In the ever-evolving landscape of blockchain technology, scalability solutions have come to the fore as the key to widespread adoption. Ethereum, one of the leading smart contract platforms, has given birth to an array of Layer 2 solutions, two of which are Polygon and Optimism. Both of these platforms provide enhancements to Ethereum\u2019s scalability, transaction speed, and cost-efficiency, albeit through distinct approaches.\n\nThis article will delve deep into both technologies, exploring their architecture, scalability solutions, transactional efficiencies, security measures, and more. We will also compare these platforms head-to-head, allowing you to understand which might better serve your needs in the diverse world of decentralized applications.\n\nPolygon vs Optimism: Major Differences\n\nPolygon, formerly known as Matic Network, is an Ethereum-compatible blockchain network designed to provide a platform for Ethereum scaling and infrastructure development. It transforms Ethereum into a fully-fledged multi-chain system by leveraging layer 2 technologies.\n\nOptimism, also known as Optimistic Ethereum, is another layer 2 scaling solution that increases the scalability of the Ethereum network, significantly reducing transaction costs and enhancing speeds. It uses a technology called Optimistic Rollups to accomplish these benefits.\n\nPolygon offers the Proof of Stake blockchain network as its primary product. This network serves as a layer 2 and a layer 1 blockchain aimed at reducing transaction fees and improving confirmation speeds for Ethereum. Since Polygon has its own consensus mechanism and deals with transaction security issues like double spends and 51% attacks, it can be considered as a layer 1 blockchain.\n\nHowever, Polygon is also classified as a layer 2 blockchain because it addresses Ethereum\u2019s congestion problem and enables asset bridging through plasma checkpoint-enabled bridges. To achieve this, Polygon uses smart contracts in its Ethereum layer to connect to the Ethereum network.\n\nPolygon\u2019s architecture includes two layers: Heimdall and Bor. Heimdall is the proof of stake layer where block finalization and transaction validation happen. The Merkle root hash is published on the Ethereum Blockchain as well. The Bor layer\u2019s responsibility is to produce blocks by collecting all the transactions. The Heimdall layer validates these blocks.\n\nOn the other hand, Optimism is a layer 2 blockchain protocol that operates independently from Ethereum. Its purpose is to alleviate congestion on Ethereum and assist with its scaling. Optimism achieves this by processing transactions and grouping them into batches, which are then verified on the Ethereum network. However, it is important to note that Ethereum still incurs costs for validating these transactions. Despite this, Optimism\u2019s transaction fees are significantly lower than Ethereum\u2019s.\n\nThe Optimism network is a layer 2 network that operates under the assumption that transactions are valid and not fraudulent, hence the term \u201coptimistic.\u201d However, if a transaction is found to be invalid, there is a 7-day window to challenge it before it becomes permanent and considered valid.\n\nUnderstanding the Technology Behind Polygon and Optimism\n\nPolygon and Optimism are both Ethereum Layer 2 solutions. Layer 2 refers to a secondary framework or protocol built on top of an existing blockchain. The main goal of these technologies is to solve the transaction speed and scalability issues that currently exist in the Ethereum network.\n\nPolygon uses a technology known as \u2018secured chains\u2019 and \u2018standalone chains\u2019 based on the Ethereum protocol. It implements a four-layer system comprising the Ethereum layer, security layer, Polygon Networks layer, and Execution layer.\n\nOptimism uses Optimistic Rollup technology. It\u2019s a Layer 2 solution that operates on top of the Ethereum blockchain, where computation is handled off-chain and data is stored on-chain. Optimism inherits the same security guarantees as Ethereum.\n\nHow do they achieve scalability?\n\nPolygon achieves scalability by utilizing side chains for off-chain computations while ensuring asset security using the Plasma framework and a decentralized network of Proof-of-Stake (PoS) validators.\n\nOptimism improves scalability by running smart contracts off-chain and only posting a small amount of data per transaction to the Ethereum mainnet. This approach significantly increases transaction throughput.\n\nTransaction Speed and Cost\n\nPolygon provides a higher transaction speed due to its unique layered architecture. Optimism, while faster than Ethereum, still trails behind Polygon in raw throughput.\n\nBoth platforms offer significantly reduced transaction costs compared to Ethereum. However, due to the batch processing of transactions, Polygon tends to be cheaper than Optimism.\n\nSecurity Measures\n\nPolygon combines the Plasma framework and PoS consensus mechanism to ensure security. It also includes optional \u2018checkpoints\u2019 to the Ethereum main chain for added security.\n\nOptimism leverages the security of the Ethereum mainnet by posting transaction data (not computation) to the chain, allowing disputes to be resolved as per Ethereum\u2019s consensus rules.\n\nTherefore, Optimism is more secure than Polygon because Optimism is built on Ethereum which has a larger number of validator nodes compared to Polygon. This means that all transactions on Optimism are validated and finalized on Ethereum, which is one of the most secure cryptocurrencies in the world after Bitcoin.\n\nOptimism, being a layer 2 built on the security of Ethereum, also has strong security. However, this does not imply that Polygon has poor security, as it is a network protocol with good security measures in place.\n\nNetwork Consensus Models\n\nPolygon employs a PoS consensus mechanism with validators who stake tokens for network security. It also utilizes Heimdall and Bor for block production and validation.\n\nOptimism does not have its own consensus mechanism. Instead, it relies on the underlying Ethereum network\u2019s consensus protocol.\n\nDeveloper Experience\n\nPolygon provides a variety of developer-friendly tools like the Polygon SDK, and fosters a vibrant community. It is compatible with Ethereum tools, reducing the learning curve for developers.\n\nOptimism also supports Ethereum tooling and community infrastructure, providing a seamless experience for developers already familiar with the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nExploring Decentralization: Optimism vs Polygon\n\nPolygon is more decentralized than Optimism, particularly because Optimism has one node called the sequencer. The sequencer is the block producer of Optimism; it submits all transactions from the Optimistic network to Ethereum.\n\nOptimism also remains decentralized as users can submit transactions to Ethereum through the CanonicalTransactionChain smart contract. However, linking Optimism to Ethereum through the smart contract eliminates the advantage of using Optimism instead of Ethereum, as individuals would have to pay the complete Ethereum transaction fee.\n\nOptimism is a network that maintains a degree of decentralization because it\u2019s built on Ethereum\u2019s decentralized platform. On the other hand, Polygon is made up of two layers, Heimdall and Bor, which makes it more decentralized compared to Optimism.\n\nAs Polygon operates on a proof of stake model, validation of transactions is carried out by validator nodes that are under the control of different parties. On the other hand, validation of blocks is the responsibility of Heimdall nodes, which are individual nodes chosen to validate the blocks produced by the Bor layer.\n\nAdoption and Use-cases\n\nPolygon hosts several high-profile projects, including Aavegotchi, Polymarket, and QuickSwap, showcasing its versatility in DeFi, NFT, and DAO applications. Notable projects on Optimism include Uniswap and Synthetix, reflecting its capability to handle complex financial applications.\n\nFuture Roadmap\n\nPolygon aims to continue its efforts to expand and diversify its multi-chain ecosystem. It plans to invest in ZK-based solutions, privacy-preserving technologies, and data availability solutions. Optimism plans to further enhance its infrastructure, interoperability, and developer tooling. It also aims to remove the current whitelisting of contracts, opening the platform for broader use.\n\nAdvantages and Limitations\n\nPolygon\u2019s advantages include high scalability, low transaction costs, and Ethereum compatibility. However, it faces criticism over centralization concerns due to its PoS consensus and validator system.\n\nOptimism also offers reduced gas fees and increased transaction speed while maintaining Ethereum-level security. The main disadvantage is the current seven-day withdrawal period due to fraud proofs, which may be a hindrance for some applications.\n\nDeeper Dive into the Technology\n\nPolygon\u2019s architecture includes four main layers. The Ethereum layer enables communication with Ethereum, while the security layer provides validators for PoS consensus. The Polygon Networks layer consists of PoS blockchains and other chains secured by the security layer. The execution layer executes smart contracts and processes transactions.\n\nOptimism uses an architecture known as Optimistic Rollups, which allows it to run computations off-chain and store the results on-chain. This offloading reduces the load on the Ethereum network, improving scalability and speed.\n\nThe Role of Native Tokens\n\nMATIC, the native token of Polygon, is used for transaction fees and participation in the network\u2019s PoS consensus mechanism. It also empowers users to participate in network governance. In Optimism, ETH is used to pay for transaction fees, just like on Ethereum. The gas fee model is identical to Ethereum\u2019s EIP-1559 model, ensuring fee predictability and improved user experience. Optimism has a native token with the ticker OP. It is used for rewards and governance.\n\nInteroperability\n\nPolygon is designed to provide full Ethereum interoperability. It supports Ethereum standards and protocols, which allows for seamless interaction between assets and applications across both ecosystems.\n\nOptimism also offers full Ethereum interoperability. All Ethereum smart contracts can be directly ported to Optimism, preserving the connections and functionalities of Ethereum\u2019s rich ecosystem.\n\nGovernance\n\nPolygon uses a DAO model for governance, allowing MATIC token holders to propose and vote on network upgrades, modifications, and other important decisions. Optimism is also governed through a DAO model. OP is the project\u2019s primary token. It\u2019s used for governance, with OP holders voting on key decisions. It\u2019s also distributed as rewards to supporters of the Optimism ecosystem and to finance future Optimism-based projects.\n\nCommunity and Partnerships\n\nPolygon has a large and active community, and it has forged partnerships with prominent blockchain projects like Chainlink, Decentraland, and Aave, among others. Optimism\u2019s community is vibrant and growing, thanks to its ties to the Ethereum community. It also has partnerships with major projects like Uniswap and MakerDAO.\n\nConclusion\n\nPolygon and Optimism both represent crucial advancements in Ethereum\u2019s Layer 2 solutions, bringing significant improvements to the blockchain\u2019s scalability and transaction efficiency. These platforms aim to preserve Ethereum\u2019s decentralization and security while paving the way for mass adoption through higher transaction throughput and lower costs.\n\nWhether it\u2019s Polygon\u2019s flexible Layer 2 chains or Optimism\u2019s Optimistic Rollups, both solutions have their own unique merits and limitations. The choice between them largely depends on the specific requirements of the users or developers. As the blockchain landscape continues to evolve, Polygon and Optimism will undoubtedly play pivotal roles in shaping Ethereum\u2019s future.\n\nChoosing between Polygon and Optimism depends largely on your specific needs. Both offer scalable solutions with reduced transaction costs. If high throughput is your priority, Polygon may be the better choice. If maintaining security levels comparable to Ethereum is paramount, Optimism may be more suitable."

        "title": "30 Questions and Answers about ZkSync, Layer-2 Solution for Ethereum - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "Layer-2 solutions such as ZkSync are emerging as critical components for scalability and efficiency. Built on the principles of zero-knowledge proofs, ZkSync aims to improve transaction speed and decrease costs without sacrificing the security of the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nThis Cryptopolitan guide gives you in-depth information about ZkSync, addressing a range of questions about its capabilities, features, challenges, and potential use cases.\n\nWhat is ZkSync?\n\nZkSync is a Layer-2 scaling solution designed for Ethereum, the world\u2019s second-largest blockchain platform by market capitalization. It is designed to bring a Visa-scale level of throughput to Ethereum while preserving the strong security properties of Layer-1. ZkSync utilizes zkRollups technology, a zero-knowledge proof methodology that allows for increased data privacy and transaction scalability.\n\nHow does ZkSync operate as a Layer-2 solution for Ethereum?\n\nAs a Layer-2 solution, ZkSync processes transactions off the main Ethereum chain, hence, significantly improving transaction speed and reducing costs. It bundles multiple operations into a single proof, which is then posted to the Ethereum mainnet. This method greatly enhances Ethereum\u2019s transaction capacity without overloading the network.\n\nWhat technology underpins ZkSync?\n\nZkSync is built on a technology known as zkRollup. ZkRollup is a Layer-2 scaling solution that uses zero-knowledge proofs to validate all transactions off-chain, while storing only the minimal data on-chain. It\u2019s a way to perform many computations off-chain while ensuring the security of the main Ethereum network.\n\nHow does ZkSync enhance transaction speed on the Ethereum network?\n\nZkSync enhances transaction speed by processing transactions off-chain. Instead of each transaction needing to be processed by every node on the Ethereum network, ZkSync aggregates multiple transactions into a single proof that is posted on-chain. This means transactions can be confirmed much faster.\n\nCan ZkSync address Ethereum\u2019s high gas fees issue?\n\nYes, ZkSync can address Ethereum\u2019s high gas fees. By moving transactions off-chain, ZkSync drastically reduces the amount of computational work that needs to be done on the Ethereum mainnet, leading to lower gas fees. Transactions are processed in batches, meaning users only have to pay a fraction compared to executing transactions directly on Ethereum.\n\nWhat is the role of zkRollups in ZkSync\u2019s operation?\n\nZkRollups play a vital role in ZkSync\u2019s operation. They allow for the aggregation of multiple transactions into a single proof that can be verified on-chain. ZkRollups maintain the security of the Layer-1 blockchain while increasing transaction throughput. All the transaction data is available on-chain but the computation and storage are performed off-chain, providing a balance of efficiency and security.\n\nHow does ZkSync contribute to the scalability of Ethereum?\n\nZkSync significantly enhances Ethereum\u2019s scalability. It achieves this by taking most of the computational and storage load off of Ethereum\u2019s Layer-1, processing transactions off-chain, and then posting a single proof to the Ethereum network. This allows more transactions to be processed per second, thereby contributing to the scalability of Ethereum.\n\nCan ZkSync support smart contracts?\n\nMatter Labs, the team behind ZkSync, announced plans for ZkSync 2.0, which is expected to support EVM-compatible smart contracts. This feature would allow developers to write and deploy smart contracts just as they would on Ethereum\u2019s mainnet, but with the scalability benefits of ZkSync.\n\nWhat are the potential use cases for ZkSync?\n\nZkSync can be used for a variety of applications that require high transaction throughput and lower fees. These can include decentralized exchanges, gaming platforms, and other decentralized applications (dApps) that need to manage a high volume of transactions. It\u2019s also useful for microtransaction scenarios, such as pay-per-use services, where the high fees on the Ethereum mainnet would otherwise make such transactions prohibitively expensive.\n\nHow is security maintained in ZkSync?\n\nSecurity in ZkSync is maintained through the use of zero-knowledge proofs and the inherent security of the Ethereum mainnet. With zkRollups, all the data necessary to prove the validity of each transaction is stored on-chain, while the computation is performed off-chain. This ensures that even if the Layer-2 system were to fail, users could still recover their assets directly from the data stored on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nIs ZkSync interoperable with other blockchains?\n\nWhile ZkSync is specifically designed as a Layer-2 solution for Ethereum, the principles behind its design could potentially be applied to other blockchains that support smart contracts and have similar architecture to Ethereum. However, each implementation would require careful consideration of the unique characteristics and security models of the underlying blockchain.\n\nWhat makes ZkSync unique compared to other Layer-2 solutions?\n\nZkSync stands out due to its implementation of zkRollups, providing a unique balance between security, scalability, and decentralization. It provides high throughput without sacrificing the strong security of Ethereum\u2019s Layer-1. Another distinctive feature is its anticipated support for EVM-compatible smart contracts, enabling existing Ethereum developers to deploy their applications on ZkSync with minimal changes.\n\nWhat role does zero-knowledge proof technology play in ZkSync?\n\nZero-knowledge proof technology plays a fundamental role in ZkSync. It\u2019s the mechanism that allows ZkSync to validate transactions off-chain, reducing the computational load on the Ethereum network. In ZkSync, this principle is used to prove the validity of transactions without having to process each transaction on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nHow does ZkSync handle consensus and validation of transactions?\n\nIn ZkSync, transactions are initially processed off-chain by validators who maintain the state of the ZkSync network. These validators batch multiple operations together into a single zkRollup proof, which is then posted to the Ethereum mainnet. The Ethereum network then validates this proof, reaching consensus on the updated state of the ZkSync network. This process ensures both efficiency and security for the ZkSync Layer-2 system.\n\nWhat are the limitations or challenges of using ZkSync?\n\nOne potential limitation of ZkSync, and Layer-2 solutions in general, is the additional complexity they introduce. Users and developers must understand how to interact with a Layer-2 system on top of the underlying Layer-1 blockchain. Another challenge lies in achieving widespread adoption: for Layer-2 solutions to be effective, they must be widely used, which requires integration with wallets, exchanges, and other parts of the blockchain ecosystem. Also, while Layer-2 solutions can drastically improve scalability, they still rely on the underlying Layer-1 for security and finality.\n\nIs ZkSync suitable for enterprise applications?\n\nZkSync, with its enhanced scalability and lower transaction fees, can certainly be suitable for enterprise applications. For businesses requiring a high volume of transactions, particularly those that are considering the use of Ethereum for its robust smart contract capabilities, ZkSync could provide the scalability solution needed to make such applications practical. However, each enterprise has unique needs and should consider the implications of Layer-2 solutions carefully.\n\nHow can ZkSync enhance privacy and confidentiality in blockchain transactions?\n\nZkSync uses zero-knowledge proofs, a cryptographic technology that can provide enhanced privacy. The technology allows validators to verify transactions without needing to know the content of the transactions themselves. However, it\u2019s important to note that like Ethereum, ZkSync is not designed to be a privacy-centric blockchain where transaction details are hidden. The details of transactions are transparent, but the technology provides certain privacy-enhancing characteristics.\n\nWhat are the costs associated with using ZkSync?\n\nBy processing transactions off-chain, ZkSync can greatly reduce the transaction fees of the Ethereum network. Instead of paying gas fees for every single transaction, users in ZkSync pay fees only when they deposit into or withdraw from the Layer-2 environment. Within ZkSync, transaction fees are paid in the token being transacted, which can provide a more predictable and user-friendly experience.\n\nHow does ZkSync handle token transfers and asset management?\n\nZkSync can handle token transfers and asset management much like Ethereum, but more efficiently. Any ERC-20 or ERC-721 token can be sent on ZkSync just like on the Ethereum mainnet, but with higher speed and lower costs. This makes it a compelling solution for applications involving frequent token transfers or complex asset management, like decentralized exchanges or gaming platforms.\n\nHow does ZkSync address the issue of transaction finality?\n\nZkSync relies on the security and finality of the underlying Ethereum Layer-1. Once a zkRollup proof is posted and accepted on Ethereum, the transactions included in that proof are considered finalized. By tying the finality of transactions to Ethereum, ZkSync leverages the robust security and decentralized nature of the Ethereum network.\n\nWhat are the potential risks associated with ZkSync?\n\nAs with any Layer-2 solution, there are potential risks associated with ZkSync. One risk involves user error: if users are not familiar with the workings of Layer-2, they could make mistakes when interacting with it. Also, there could be smart contract bugs or vulnerabilities in the Layer-2 solution itself, though such risks are mitigated through rigorous auditing and formal verification. Finally, there\u2019s always the risk of insufficient adoption, which could limit the utility of ZkSync.\n\nHow does ZkSync impact decentralization in Ethereum\u2019s network?\n\nZkSync is designed to preserve the decentralization of the Ethereum network. By offloading computational work from Ethereum, ZkSync can help ensure that running an Ethereum node remains feasible for as many participants as possible, thereby supporting the decentralization of the network. Meanwhile, ZkSync\u2019s reliance on Ethereum for security and finality means that it does not introduce additional points of centralization.\n\nHow is ZkSync different from other zkRollup solutions?\n\nZkSync sets itself apart from other zkRollup solutions through a focus on user and developer experience, including planned support for EVM-compatible smart contracts. ZkSync also emphasizes security, using a process of rigorous testing, formal verification, and third-party audits to minimize the risk of smart contract bugs or other vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the team behind ZkSync has a strong commitment to open-source development and community engagement, which helps foster a healthy ecosystem around the project.\n\nAre there any regulatory considerations specific to ZkSync implementations?\n\nRegulatory considerations for ZkSync implementations will largely be similar to those for other blockchain and Layer-2 technologies. These could include considerations around the transmission of digital assets, privacy regulations, and potential securities law implications for certain types of transactions. As with any blockchain technology, it\u2019s important to consider the regulatory landscape of the specific jurisdictions in which the technology will be used.\n\nCan ZkSync achieve the same level of security as Ethereum\u2019s Layer-1?\n\nZkSync is designed to inherit the security of Ethereum\u2019s Layer-1. By leveraging zkRollup technology, it ensures that all transaction data is stored on-chain, even though computation and storage are performed off-chain. This means that even in the event of a failure of the Layer-2 system, users would still be able to recover their assets based on the data stored on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nHow does ZkSync impact user experience in blockchain applications?\n\nZkSync can significantly improve the user experience in blockchain applications by providing faster transaction confirmation times and lower fees. It also enables users to pay transaction fees in the token they are transferring, instead of having to hold and pay fees in ETH. Furthermore, with its planned support for EVM-compatible smart contracts, ZkSync will allow developers to create more complex applications, further enhancing the potential user experience.\n\nWhat are the future developments and trends in ZkSync technology?\n\nThe most significant future development for ZkSync is the introduction of ZkSync 2.0, which is expected to support EVM-compatible smart contracts. This will allow developers to write and deploy smart contracts in a similar way to Ethereum, but with the benefits of Layer-2. Beyond that, the team behind ZkSync is continuously working on enhancing its technology, and we can expect further advancements in scalability, security, and usability as the project evolves.\n\nCan ZkSync handle network congestion and scalability issues?\n\nYes, ZkSync is specifically designed to address network congestion and scalability issues. By processing transactions off-chain and aggregating them into zkRollup proofs posted on the Ethereum mainnet, ZkSync significantly improves the scalability of the Ethereum network, reducing congestion and allowing for a higher throughput of transactions.\n\nWhat are some notable projects or companies that are using ZkSync?\n\nSeveral notable projects and companies are utilizing ZkSync for their blockchain applications. Some examples include 1Inch, a decentralized exchange aggregator that picks the cheapest crypto prices; Mini Mini Dungeon, a layer-2 play-to-earn game; and Forward Protocol, the WordPress for Web 3.0. These projects leverage ZkSync to enhance transaction speed, reduce costs, and provide a better user experience.\n\nHow can developers build on ZkSync?\n\nDevelopers can build on ZkSync by utilizing the developer documentation, tools, and SDKs provided by the ZkSync team. They can leverage the ZkSync software development kit to integrate ZkSync functionality into their applications, enabling faster and more cost-effective transactions. The ZkSync ecosystem also encourages collaboration and community engagement, offering support and resources for developers looking to leverage the capabilities of ZkSync in their projects.\n\nConclusion\n\nZkSync is a pioneering Layer-2 solution, introducing innovative ways to enhance Ethereum\u2019s scalability while preserving its inherent security. As the world of blockchain technology continues to mature and evolve, solutions like ZkSync are set to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of digital transactions, applications, and services. By understanding the nuances of ZkSync, we can better appreciate the potential of Layer-2 solutions and their capacity to address some of the most pressing issues within the blockchain ecosystem."
