        "content": "While many investors appreciated these services, the SEC did not. Its public complaint states, \u201cKraken has offered and sold its crypto asset \u2018staking services\u2019 to the general public, whereby Kraken pools certain crypto assets transferred by investors and stakes them on behalf of those investors. Staking is a process in which investors lock up \u2013 or \u2018stake\u2019 \u2013 their crypto tokens with a blockchain validator with the goal of being rewarded with new tokens when their staked crypto tokens become part of the process for validating data for the blockchain. When investors provide tokens to staking-as-a-service providers, they lose control of those tokens and take on risks associated with those platforms, with very little protection.\u201d"

        "content": "Ethereum Layer-2 project Polygon is letting go of some of its staff after merging multiple business units.\n\nIn a blog published Tuesday, Polygon\u2019s founders and president said they would lay off 20% of workers and cut 100 positions. All affected employees will receive three months of severance pay.\n\n\u201cThis was a painfully hard decision, but a necessary step in our journey,\u201d they said.\n\nLast month, Polygon announced a corporate restructuring that combined all staff under \u201cPolygon Labs.\u201d\n\nPolygon\u2019s native token MATIC is among the 10 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. MATIC sank 6.5% following the layoff announcement.\n\nThe token had been the best performer among the top 20 cryptocurrencies over the preceding month, having gained 48%.\n\nAround one year ago, Polygon raised $450 million in venture capital funding in a private token sale led by Sequoia India. Now, the team says its treasury remains \u201chealthy,\u201d with a balance of $250 million and over 1.9 billion MATIC ($2.53 billion).\n\nSeparately on Wednesday, Australian startup Immutable, creator of the NFT-focused Ethereum Layer-2 network Immutable X, disclosed it had slashed 11% of its staff.\n\nImmutable cited a dearth in cash reserves and a push to redirect resources for the cuts, the Sydney Morning Herald reported, noting that it would include shaking up business units.\n\nIt also plans to transfer responsibility of some aspects of game development to external partners so it can focus on its crypto and Web3 components.\n\nA spokesperson called the reporting, \u201ca false attribution,\u201d and told Blockworks that \u201cImmutable did not cite low cash as the reason for this strategic move in February.\u201d\n\nLast year, the firm laid off 6% of its workforce, mostly affecting developers who worked on NFT-centric game Gods Unchained.\n\nGenesis, Crypto.com, Blockchain.com and ConsenSys are among other crypto companies that recently reduced their workforces.\n\nUpdated March 8, 2023 at 5:33 am ET: Added a comment from an Immutable spokesperson.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Ethereum core developer Tim Beiko announced the Shapella upgrade is scheduled for Feb. 28. The Shapella network upgrade will activate on the Sepolia network at epoch 56832.\n\nShanghai and Capella (Shapella) are the upcoming Ethereum hard fork names. Shanghai is the fork\u2019s name on the execution layer client side, and Capella is the upgrade name on the consensus layer client side.\n\nEthereum Sepolia upgrade schedule. Source: GitHub\n\nSome key Ethereum improvement proposal (EIP) changes on the execution layer include warm coinbase (not to be confused with the crypto exchange) and Beacon Chain push withdrawals. The push withdrawals will allow validator withdrawals from the Beacon Chain to the Ethereum Virtual Machine via a new \u201csystem-level\u201d operation type. On the other hand, warm coinbase could be a game changer that reduces network fees for builders.\n\nCoinbase is the name of the software that builders use to receive new tokens on the network. Every new platform transaction must interact with the coinbase software multiple times. The first interaction costs more as the software needs to \u201cwarm\u201d up, with fees declining as the interactions increase. However, with the introduction of EIP-3651, the coinbase software will remain warm to begin with, requiring a lower gas fee to access it.\n\nRelated: Ethereum on-chain data suggests ETH sell pressure could be a non-event after the Shanghai upgrade\n\nMajor changes to the consensus layer include full and partial withdrawals for validators and independent state and block historical accumulators, replacing the original singular historical roots.\n\nPartial withdrawal means validators can withdraw Ether (ETH) rewards in excess of 32 Ether and keep validating. If they want a full withdrawal, validators can fully exit, take all 32 Ether and rewards, and stop doing the work.\n\nThe upcoming upgrade would enable validators to withdraw their staked Ether (stETH) from the Beacon Chain to the execution layer. Moreover, the upgrade would bring changes to the execution and consensus layers, adding new features, making it a key upgrade following the Merge.\n\nStakers and non-stakers who operate nodes must, however, upgrade their nodes to the most recent Ethereum client versions to take advantage of the Sepolia upgrade. After the deployment of the Sepolia upgrade, the next step would be the release of the Shanghai upgrade on the Ethereum Goerli test network, expected to commence in March."

        "title": "Coinbase Is Building Its Own Ethereum Layer-2 Network Called 'Base' - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nCoinbase has today unveiled Base, its own Ethereum layer-2 network. The company says Base will be the new home for the Coinbase\u2019s on-chain products and\u2014it hopes\u2014an open ecosystem for millions of new decentralized apps.\n\nThough only publicly announced today, a testnet for Base has actually been live since the start of the month, Coinbase Senior Director of Engineering Jesse Pollak told Decrypt.\n\n\u201cThis is a bet that we can help enable the next million dapps, which are going to bring in the next billion users. We think that's going to happen on a five- to 10-year horizon and this is our contribution to making that happen sooner rather than later,\u201d he said. \u201cOur goal is to launch mainnet in the next few months.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat makes Coinbase, which has traded on Nasdaq under the COIN ticker since April 2021, the first publicly traded company to launch a layer-2 blockchain network on top of Ethereum. On Wednesday, COIN ended the day trading at $61.18 per share, down 1% for the day, after trading as high as $67.17 in the wake of beating analyst predictions on its Q4 earnings.\n\nLayer-2 networks help make transactions faster and cheaper than an underlying blockchain, in this case Ethereum, by processing batches of transactions on a separate chain and then sending receipts back to the mainnet. Base will be \u201ca rollup agnostic superchain powered by Optimism,\u201d according to a blog post that Coinbase shared with Decrypt ahead of its Thursday announcement.\n\nBase is entering a crowded and rapidly growing cohort. As of Wednesday evening, there was more than $6 billion worth of ETH on layer 2s, a 17% increase from a month ago, according to L2Beat.\n\nThe website tracks 26 different Ethereum scaling networks, including Arbitrum One and Optimism. Those two networks alone account for 53% and 31% of L2 market share, respectively. But unlike those L2s, Base will not be launching a network token. On other networks, tokens help pay for gas fees and are used to incentivize development.\n\n\u201cWe've seen a lot of people kind of use tokens to drive activity. But our thesis is that tokens are not the only way to drive activity,\u201d Pollak said. \u201cBuilding great products is a great way of driving activity by making things actually useful.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt's worth noting, however, that both Optimism and Arbitrum initially launched their networks without a token either. Optimism has since airdropped its OP governance token to early adopters of its network and Arbitrum has long been rumored to be planning the same.\n\nBase is launching with dozens of partners who\u2019ve committed to building in and supporting the ecosystem, including oracle network Chainlink, Ethereum block explorer Etherscan, and DeFi protocol Aave.\n\nCoinbase said it intends for the governance of Base to be fully decentralized, although it won\u2019t be that way at the start.\n\n\u201cCoinbase is going to gradually transition into a role where we\u2019re a contributor to Base, we provide services and products that are built on top of Base, and we are not the decision maker for everything in the Base network\u2014that\u2019s being done through more decentralized governance,\u201d Pollak said.\n\nTo that end, Coinbase will be joining Optimism as a core developer on the open-source OP Stack. Pollak heads up the small Coinbase team dedicated to working on Base.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to keep the core team really lean and lean into this reality that we can have an outsized impact if we\u2019re building onchain,\u201d he said."

        "title": "Coinbase\u2019s layer-2 blockchain may help expand scaling on Ethereum - TechCrunch",
        "content": "Coinbase, the second-largest crypto exchange by trading volume, is diving into the blockchain world in a move that some market players are excited about.\n\nOn Thursday, the exchange launched Base, an Ethereum-focused layer-2 (L2) blockchain, in an effort to enter the decentralized ecosystem through its own chain and expand further into the developer space, Jesse Pollak, lead for Base and head of protocols at Coinbase, previously told TechCrunch.\n\nBase\u2019s L2 is a \u201csecure, low-cost, developer-friendly\u201d chain that aims to help builders create dApps on-chain, the company stated. A number of crypto businesses, platforms, marketplaces and infrastructure firms have committed to building on Base, a Coinbase spokesperson told TechCrunch.\n\nThose that plan to be involved include Blockdaemon, Chainlink, Etherscan, QuickNode, Aave, Animoca Brands, Dune, Nansen, Magic Eden, Pyth, Rainbow Wallet, Ribbon Finance, The Graph, Wormhole and Gelato, to name a handful.\n\n\u201cThe launch of Base reinforces the importance of L2s in growing the blockchain ecosystem,\u201d said Dmitry Shklovsky, co-founder of QuickNode, which is a partner and node provider for Base. \u201cMore onramps and more equitable, developer-friendly L2s are key health indicators that we are moving in the right direction.\u201d\n\nL2 blockchains build on top of layer-1 (L1) blockchains like Ethereum, Solana and Avalanche in an effort to reduce bottlenecks, constraints and other network-clogging effects. Instead of putting every transaction on an L1 chain, L2s bundle transactions so tasks can be delivered in a more efficient manner.\n\nL1s like Ethereum are secure but impractical for high-throughput volumes due to prohibitively expensive gas, or transaction, fees, spokespeople from The Graph Foundation and Edge & Node said in an email to TechCrunch. \u201cL2s make the blockchain space more accessible by a broader range of both devs and users, allowing cheaper, faster transactions that still take advantage of the security of L1s like Ethereum.\u201d\n\nL2s are essential for accessibility and scalability in the space, Shklovsky said. \u201cL1s typically prioritize security and decentralization over scalability. L2s reduce the workload on the main chain, making the network faster and more user-friendly, allowing chains to scale quickly without compromising decentralization or security.\u201d\n\nGrowing the L2 space\n\nBase is built on the MIT-licensed OP Stack in collaboration with the layer-2 blockchain Optimism, which is also focused on the Ethereum blockchain. \u201cOptimism is not a competitor [to Base], but rather a collaborator,\u201d Shklovsky said.\n\nThe Optimism stack is open source and relied upon by many in the web3 space, The Graph and Edge & Node spokespeople said. \u201cThis demonstrates the positive-sum and collaborative spirit of web3, in contrast to the competitive landscape that has become the norm in web2. When developers build in the open, everyone benefits without having to reinvent the wheel from scratch every time a new technology is created.\u201d\n\nCoinbase\u2019s new chain will not impact the crypto ecosystem more or less than any other L2, Shklovsky thinks. \u201cSince there is no plan to issue a network token, Base\u2019s only impact on the broader crypto ecosystem is creating another onramp for new users \u2014 which is good for everyone.\u201d\n\nCoinbase is home to over 110 million verified users and is a well-known entry point for new people looking to enter the web3 space. So, this launch could be a connecting point to the Wild West of crypto.\n\nThe new chain will help \u201conboard new users into the crypto ecosystem that will engage in decentralized applications \u2014 at a deeper level than surface-level engagement on exchanges,\u201d The Graph and Edge & Node spokespeople said.\n\n\u201cBy launching an L2, Coinbase creates a bridge between exchange users and the decentralized web,\u201d the spokespeople said. \u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see centralized organizations building on top of decentralized infrastructure, introducing their users to more web3-native experiences.\u201d\n\nReinforcing beliefs\n\nIn general, Offchain Labs (the team behind L2 scaling solution Arbitrum) and QuickNode also see Coinbase\u2019s involvement as exciting. \u201cIt reinforces what we\u2019ve always believed \u2014 blockchain is about so much more than just cryptocurrency,\u201d Shklovsky said, referring to the tokens often associated with particular chains.\n\nCoinbase\u2019s involvement also validates the vision for L2s, Steven Goldfeder, CEO of Offchain Labs, said. \u201cScaling Ethereum is a team sport and we welcome them to this important space.\u201d\n\nThere are dozens of L2 blockchains that exist today, with over $6.34 billion in total value locked (TVL) across the networks, up about 3% in the past seven days, according to L2BEAT data.\n\nArbitrum, which is the biggest L2 scaling system, has over $3.35 billion in TVL and surpassed Ethereum in daily transactions on Tuesday with over 1.1 million transactions, according to block explorer Arbiscan. This growth points to the demand for scaling solutions as the Ethereum ecosystem continues to grow.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been long-time believers in the importance of L2 technologies as the future of our Ethereum, and indeed we\u2019ve been seeing this vision play out with Arbitrum seeing explosive organic growth, outpacing the number of transactions on Ethereum for the first time this week,\u201d Goldfeder said.\n\nWhile Base is incubated inside of Coinbase, its plan is to decentralize it \u201cin the years ahead,\u201d Pollak said. The team has done \u201ca lot of work over the last six months\u201d to address some of the biggest concerns from others, including how a big centralized company can engage in a decentralized way.\n\nThis effort to become fully decentralized \u201cshows their commitment to the ethos of the blockchain space,\u201d Shklovsky said.\n\nMarket players have to look at the L1 and L2 spaces with an abundance mindset, Shklovsky said. \u201cWith billions of potential users worldwide, there is a place and use case for every L2 as long as they are secure, user-friendly and scalable.\u201d\n\nRegulation sitting on the sidelines\n\nAs all this plays out, regulation looms in the background for the whole industry.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has been circulating around the crypto space as it homes in on staking businesses like Kraken\u2019s \u2014 which got hit with a $30 million charge from the agency earlier this month.\n\nIn separate news, at the beginning of 2023, New York financial regulators found that Coinbase violated anti-money laundering laws by failing to conduct adequate background checks. Coinbase agreed to pay a $50 million fine to the New York State Department of Financial Services and is also required to spend $50 million on improving its compliance program.\n\nA number of U.S.-based crackdowns are transpiring across the crypto space, and the question of how major crypto firms and exchanges like Coinbase will navigate these new waters is unclear. Adding a new decentralized blockchain to a centralized entity could cause some headaches for the exchange if they go off-course in the eyes of regulators.\n\nBut whether regulation will carry a deeper weight on the space is yet to be determined."

The Ottomans also confiscated his family\u2019s heirloom rugs and other personal belongings.\n\nAs such, Ohanian has become a huge supporter of assets that centralized institutions can not seize:\n\n\u201cAny group of people who have in their consciousness, or in their collective history, some idea of persecution, especially by a state, makes the idea of a store of value that is not controlled by any single state very attractive. And so, in some ways, it was hardwired in me then and made me, in a way, receptive to the idea of a decentralized currency.\u201d\n\nOhanian understood that a blockchain protocol called Ethereum was about to be launched almost a decade ago and invested $15,000 in its native token \u2013 ETH. This means he bought the cryptocurrency for roughly $0.30 per token.\n\nHis investment is now worth approximately $82 million, a staggering 546,000% return. However, Ohanian wished he could have bought more at the time:\n\n\u201cIn hindsight, I didn\u2019t invest nearly as much as I should have.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed in 2021 that he has \u201ca lot\u201d of Ethereum without providing further details.\n\nHis Other Crypto Forays\n\nApart from co-creating Reddit, Ohanian has founded another entity \u2013 the venture capital firm Seven Seven Six. It raised $500 million at the beginning of 2022 to invest in cryptocurrency start-ups and doubled down with another $177 million fundraiser several months later.\n\nOhanian is also a proponent of non-fungible tokens. He purchased an NFT from the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) collection last summer and gifted it to his wife \u2013 the tennis superstar Serena Williams."

        "title": "Coinbase Drops Free Ethereum NFT via Zora to Mark Base Network Launch - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Coinbase announced a major new project today in the form of Base, a layer-2 scaling network for Ethereum built in collaboration with Optimism. To mark the news, the crypto exchange dropped a free open edition Ethereum NFT for anyone to mint\u2014but it's not through Coinbase\u2019s own struggling NFT marketplace.\n\n\u201cBase, Introduced\u201d is a free NFT that Coinbase made available through Zora, an NFT minting platform and startup focused on Web3 creator tools. It\u2019s an open edition NFT, which means that anyone can claim one of the identical collectibles until the minting window ends on Sunday, with a limit of one NFT per wallet.\n\nAlready, more than 24,000 of the Ethereum NFTs have been minted since this morning\u2019s announcement of Base. As a result, the NFT\u2019s smart contract\u2014which contains the code that powers the project\u2014has become the largest \u201cgas guzzler\u201d on the Ethereum network, with over $271,000 worth of gas (or network transaction fees) used over the past three hours.\n\nCoinbase Is Building Its Own Ethereum Layer-2 Network Called 'Base'\n\nZora is a well-known NFT minting platform for Web3 creators, but Coinbase already has its own NFT marketplace. However, Coinbase NFT has gained very little traction since launching last spring, with public blockchain data showing less than $8,000 worth of total NFT trading volume over the past week.\n\nCompare that to some $596 million worth of trading volume over the last week at Blur, the top NFT marketplace that recently surpassed longtime leader OpenSea on the back of whale traders flipping assets at a rapid race to maximize BLUR token trading rewards.\n\nCoinbase NFT shows the Base, Introduced NFTs on its marketplace, but they\u2019re secondary listings posted by users who minted through Zora. Coinbase President and COO Emilie Choi said on an earnings call this week that the exchange is \u201cnot throwing in the towel\u201d on its NFT ambitions, despite having \u201ca very lean team on it now.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nThe exchange's NFT marketplace has supported NFT mints in the past, including significant drops like The Bill Murray 1,000. However, the company confirmed earlier this month that it \"paused\" creator drops on Coinbase NFT to push resources towards other features on the marketplace.\n\nThe free Base NFT nods towards the recent \u201copen edition meta\u201d in the NFT world, in which creators launch low-priced NFT mints that then layer in gamification elements, in some cases providing incentives to holders to \u201cburn\u201d (or permanently destroy) a number of them in exchange for a unique, rarer version that isn\u2019t identical to the others.\n\nFrom $8 Mint to $4K Flip: Open Edition NFTs Are Reenergizing the Market\n\nCoinbase hasn\u2019t promised any future utility or benefits for the Base NFT. However, the NFTs are finding some traction on secondary markets. Most of them are selling for a relatively low price right now, about 0.01 ETH ($16) apiece, but some of the early-numbered editions or those with so-called \u201cvanity numbers\u201d are commanding higher prices.\n\nFor example, NFT #888 sold for 0.888 ETH (about $1,455) this morning, and the buyer has listed it for 8.888 ETH ($14,700) in the hopes of securing a sizable flip. Other three-digit NFT editions have sold for hundreds of dollars since the free mint launched this morning."

        "title": "Only 0.04% of Ethereum validators have been slashed since 2020, says core dev - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The Ethereum ecosystem has seen only 226 validators slashed since the launch of the Beacon Chain on Dec. 1, 2020 \u2014 amounting to just 0.04% of 524,060 validators, according to an Ethereum core developer.\n\nSlashing is a process where a validator breaches the proof-of-stake consensus rules, which often results in the removal of that validator from the network and slashing a portion of the staked Ether (ETH) that the validator provided as collateral.\n\nSuch slim odds of being slashed were highlighted by Ethereum core developer \u201cSuperphiz\u201d in a Feb. 23 Twitter post, which suggests that people shouldn\u2019t be concerned about staking ETH for that particular reason.\n\n226 out of 523,000 validators on the beacon chain have been slashed. This is nothing to lose sleep over. Many slashings have occurred during failed system migration. Here are four emerging best practice tips to avoid this:https://t.co/wleR4YQmDD \u2014 superphiz.eth (@superphiz) February 22, 2023\n\nThe developer also explained \u201cfour emerging best practices\u201d to reduce those odds even further.\n\nOne of these practices was to wipe any existing chain data on old staking machines and to reinstall and reformat the validator where necessary, said Superphiz, noting that many slashings occur due to \u201cfailed systems migrations.\u201d\n\nSuperphiz then suggested using \u201cdoppelganger detection,\u201d which checks whether the validator\u2019s keys are active before starting the validation process.\n\nWhile this can impact validator uptime, he explained that \u201cperfect uptime\u201d isn\u2019t worth getting slashed in the grand scheme of things:\n\n\u201cIt's wise to throw away $0.06 to save $1700. (A slashing costs about 1 Ether).\u201d\n\nThe developer said it is also worth watching buffers and logs on the Beacon Chain to become aware of any potential problems that may arise.\n\nLog of the slashed validators on the Beacon Chain. Source: Beaconcha.in\n\nIf something feels wrong, Superphiz suggested \u201cunplugging everything\u201d and to \u201ccome back\u201d when the problem has been identified and a proposed solution is set in place.\n\nThe developer also noted that over 150 of the 226 slashings have been caused by services rather than \u201chome stakers.\u201d\n\nStaked ETH and number of active validators on the Beacon Chain. Source: Beaconcha.in\n\nSlashing can occur due to an \u201cattestation\u201d or a \u201cproposal\u201d violation, according to the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nAn attestation violation is one where a malicious validator attempts to change the history of a block or \u201cdouble votes\u201d by attesting two candidates for the same block.\n\nA proposal violation occurs when a validator proposes and signs two different blocks for the same slot.\n\nThe majority of slashing events have come from attestation violations, according to data from beaconcha.in.\n\nOne of the largest slashing events occurred on Feb. 4, 2021, when staking infrastructure provider \u201cStaked\u201d had 75 of its validators slashed for producing competing blocks. Staked said the attestation violation came about due to a \u201ctechnical issue.\u201d\n\nRelated: What are the risks of the Ethereum Merge?\n\nSince the Beacon Chain merged with the Ethereum proof-of-work chain on Sept. 15, only 35 of the total 226 slashings have taken place, according to beaconcha.in, which suggests that the Merge has not had a profound impact on slashing rates.\n\nWith about 16.7 million ETH staked (according to beaconcha.in) out of 120.4 million ETH currently in circulation (according to CoinGecko), the percentage of ETH staked is about 13.9%.\n\nETH can be staked via a centralized exchange, by delegation to a third-party validator network, or by running on an independent node, which requires 32 ETH."

Source: Lookonchain\n\n3 Ether investment lessons to learn\n\nTraders can use such examples to learn from others' mistakes and reduce their investment risks with proven strategies. Let's take a look at some of the most basic tools that can help reduce losses.\n\nDon't rely on just one fundamental\n\nThe investor first traded stablecoins for ETH on Sept. 12, just three days before the long-awaited transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake via the Merge upgrade.\n\nThe Merge, however, turned out to be a \"sell-the-news\" event. Thus, going extremely bullish on Ether based on one strong fundamental was a poor decision.\n\nMoreover, going all in while relying on one indicator, particularly a widely-anticipated news event, is often a losing strategy, which is why traders should consider multiple factors before making a decision.\n\nEthereum fund outflows picked momentum ahead of the Merge. Source: CoinShares\n\nFor instance, one such metric was institutional flows. Ether investment funds suffered outflows worth $61.6 million a week before the Merge, according to CoinShares' weekly report, suggesting that \"smart money\" was leaning bearish.\n\nHedge with put options\n\nHedging with options in Ether trading enables investors to purchase options contracts opposite their current open positions. Therefore, investors could mitigate risk by opening a put option contract against their bullish spot.\n\nA put option gives a holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell ETH at a predetermined price on or before a particular date. So, if the spot Ether price drops, the investor could sell the asset at a pre-agreed price, thus protecting themself from losses in ETH's value.\n\nDon't go all in; check momentum\n\nDo not put all your eggs in one basket regardless of how much capital you can throw around.\n\nInstead, entering a position in increments could be a safer strategy while keeping some funds on the sidelines. Thus, traders can buy ETH during a short- or long-term bull run but can spare some capital to buy during potential dips, while relying on multiple technical indicators for cues.\n\nFor instance, momentum oscillators like the relative strength index (RSI) reveal whether Ether is oversold or overbought on specific timeframes. So a strategy of going long when the RSI reading is close to or above the 70 and forming a lower high has a high chance of failure.\n\nRelated: A beginner\u2019s guide to cryptocurrency trading strategies\n\nThe Ethereum daily chart below shows the two instances when the above-mentioned investor bought ETH alongside the RSI forming a lower high.\n\nETH/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nUltimately, traders' mistakes can serve as opportunities to learn what works for an investor and what doesn't. The main takeaway is that investors should enter a market with a definite plan based on their own analysis and risk appetite.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations. Every investment and trading move involves risk, and readers should conduct their own research when making a decision."

        "content": "Circle rolls out new Euro-based stablecoin as an ERC20 token on Ethereum.\n\nEthereum\u2019s on-chain metrics rose as a result of the announcement.\n\nThe Ethereum [ETH] network just added support for another stablecoin. The network has so far supported multiple stablecoins, but most are pegged on the U.S. dollar. This time the latest addition is Euro Coin [EUROC], which will be pegged on the Euro.\n\nRead about Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nThe new Euro-backed stablecoin issued by Circle might be the first major attempt at properly tapping into the European market. The Coinbase exchange is already making efforts to make EUROC available. It noted recently that the new stablecoin is an ERC20 token and that it will be available in regions where Coinbase is supported.\n\nCoinbase will add support for Euro Coin (EUROC) on the Ethereum network (ERC-20 token). Do not send this asset over other networks or your funds may be lost. Inbound transfers for this asset are available on @Coinbase & @CoinbaseExch in the regions where trading is supported. \u2014 Coinbase Assets (@CoinbaseAssets) February 21, 2023\n\nCoinbase also noted that the support may be restricted. In addition, the exchange noted that it will initially be available as EUROC-EUR and EUROC-USD pairs. While this new stablecoin might be a game changer for European crypto traders, Ethereum will be one of the biggest beneficiaries.\n\nAssessing the on-chain impact\n\nEurope is one of the biggest economic regions in the world. As such, it can control a substantial amount of trading volumes in the crypto market. A direct link to the market through a Euro-backed stablecoin may thus prove quite useful. Ethereum is banking on this development to tap into more trading volume and network growth.\n\nSuch a major development is bound to have an impact in both the short and long term. Ethereum\u2019s development activity metric registered a sharp rally in the last 24 hours ahead of the EUROC launch. In addition, its on-chain volume grew by over $2 billion within the same 24-hour period.\n\nOn the network activity side of things, there was a noteworthy surge in 24-hour active addresses in the last 24 hours. Ethereum\u2019s network growth tanked to a new weekly low. This is contrary to expectations that a major stablecoin launch would likely trigger renewed interest.\n\nA potential reason for the relatively low change in activity is that ETH is currently slowing down after facing resistance above $1,700.

The transition was completed successfully on September 15, 2022.\n\nThe Shanghai testnet, which was supposed to go live by the end of February, was one of the most eagerly anticipated Ethereum releases.

According to the Ethereum developers, the Shanghai upgrade is most likely to take place in March 2023 if everything goes as planned."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nCoinbase announced a major new project today in the form of Base, a layer-2 scaling network for Ethereum built in collaboration with Optimism. To mark the news, the crypto exchange dropped a free open edition Ethereum NFT for anyone to mint\u2014but it's not through Coinbase\u2019s own struggling NFT marketplace.\n\n\u201cBase, Introduced\u201d is a free NFT that Coinbase made available through Zora, an NFT minting platform and startup focused on Web3 creator tools. It\u2019s an open edition NFT, which means that anyone can claim one of the identical collectibles until the minting window ends on Sunday, with a limit of one NFT per wallet.\n\nAlready, more than 24,000 of the Ethereum NFTs have been minted since this morning\u2019s announcement of Base. As a result, the NFT\u2019s smart contract\u2014which contains the code that powers the project\u2014has become the largest \u201cgas guzzler\u201d on the Ethereum network, with over $271,000 worth of gas (or network transaction fees) used over the past three hours.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nZora is a well-known NFT minting platform for Web3 creators, but Coinbase already has its own NFT marketplace. However, Coinbase NFT has gained very little traction since launching last spring, with public blockchain data showing less than $8,000 worth of total NFT trading volume over the past week.\n\nCompare that to some $596 million worth of trading volume over the last week at Blur, the top NFT marketplace that recently surpassed longtime leader OpenSea on the back of whale traders flipping assets at a rapid race to maximize BLUR token trading rewards.\n\nCoinbase NFT shows the Base, Introduced NFTs on its marketplace, but they\u2019re secondary listings posted by users who minted through Zora. Coinbase President and COO Emilie Choi said on an earnings call this week that the exchange is \u201cnot throwing in the towel\u201d on its NFT ambitions, despite having \u201ca very lean team on it now.\u201d\n\nThe exchange's NFT marketplace has supported NFT mints in the past, including significant drops like The Bill Murray 1,000. However, the company confirmed earlier this month that it \"paused\" creator drops on Coinbase NFT to push resources towards other features on the marketplace.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe free Base NFT nods towards the recent \u201copen edition meta\u201d in the NFT world, in which creators launch low-priced NFT mints that then layer in gamification elements, in some cases providing incentives to holders to \u201cburn\u201d (or permanently destroy) a number of them in exchange for a unique, rarer version that isn\u2019t identical to the others.\n\nCoinbase hasn\u2019t promised any future utility or benefits for the Base NFT. However, the NFTs are finding some traction on secondary markets. Most of them are selling for a relatively low price right now, about 0.01 ETH ($16) apiece, but some of the early-numbered editions or those with so-called \u201cvanity numbers\u201d are commanding higher prices.\n\nFor example, NFT #888 sold for 0.888 ETH (about $1,455) this morning, and the buyer has listed it for 8.888 ETH ($14,700) in the hopes of securing a sizable flip. Other three-digit NFT editions have sold for hundreds of dollars since the free mint launched this morning."

The DUST ecosystem token tied to both projects will also be bridged to both Ethereum and Polygon.\n\nFew concrete details about the migration have been announced since then, but for the first time, Frank and Dust Labs CEO Kevin Henrikson exclusively discussed the motivations behind the move with Decrypt and explained the upcoming process.\n\nNot \u2018if,\u2019 but \u2018when\u2019\n\nWhen DeGods launched in late 2021, Solana was near its all-time high price and its NFT scene was rapidly expanding. By the time it became Solana\u2019s most valuable large-scale NFT project last summer, SOL had lost considerable value and the wider NFT market was in freefall.\n\nIn late December, soon after the move was announced, SOL had fallen about 97% from its peak price. Frank had previously tweeted about a potential migration amid Solana\u2019s late-year struggles and faced considerable backlash from the community. Even so, rumors persisted as DeLabs continued fleshing out its actual plans.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHenrikson told Decrypt that Solana was \u201ca great place\u201d to begin life, given the tooling on the network and the fact that its NFT community wasn\u2019t as established as Ethereum\u2019s. But he said that DeLabs had larger-scale ambitions that the team knew would likely someday lead the 10,000 NFT profile picture (PFP) project to the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n\u201cIt wasn't about \u2018if,\u2019 it was just a matter of \u2018when\u2019\u2014and that was even in the earliest days of DeGods,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we're gonna be the biggest, most popular NFT collection in the world, you're gonna have to be on Ethereum.\u201d\n\nDeGods, which has generated nearly $150 million worth of trading volume on Solana, will soon enter the largest market for high-value NFT collections. Frank reaffirmed his goal of making DeGods the \u201cnumber-one luxury NFT in the world.\u201d\n\nCurrently, a DeGods NFT on Solana starts at about $11,500 worth of SOL on the Magic Eden marketplace, but Yuga Labs\u2019 Bored Ape Yacht Club PFPs on Ethereum start at 10 times that amount. It\u2019ll be a new challenge to try and outshine ETH\u2019s heavyweights, but that\u2019s a big part of the appeal for DeLabs.\n\nWhy Polygon?\n\nAs follow-up project y00ts started making waves last summer, DeLabs received outreach from various blockchain networks about launching the NFT collection elsewhere.\n\nIt ultimately rolled out on Solana, but DeLabs sought an eventual destination that could help that collection reach a broader audience and collaborate with sizable brands. Henrikson cited last year\u2019s litany of brand announcements around Polygon, including NFT initiatives from Reddit, Meta, Starbucks, DraftKings, Disney, and beyond, and described it as an opportunity.\n\nHe told Decrypt that moving to Polygon is \u201cthe fastest way to get connected to these companies because they'll be on the same chain.\u201d Frank added that in addition to consumer brand deals, Polygon offers access to a growing slate of metaverse game platforms. Many y00ts visual traits were even left blank \u201cso brands can imprint their logos on there,\u201d Frank said.\n\nThe project\u2019s artwork was also designed to be broadly appealing\u2014or \u201cclean enough that I can sell pacifiers and diapers,\u201d Henrikson explained of potential partnerships or licensing deals, but also \u201cmen's cologne and things that are more degen-centric.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nUltimately, DeLabs accepted a $3 million non-equity grant from Polygon Labs as part of the agreement to move y00ts to the network. Frank said that Polygon was \u201cnowhere near the largest bidder in that regard\u201d and that DeLabs chose the network for other reasons, but admitted that \u201cit felt dumb to not take\u201d the grant when so many networks were offering funds.\n\nDeLabs will use the funds to help grow its team and take some of the public-facing emphasis off of Frank, he said. Furthermore, DeLabs and Dust Labs will develop a Polygon NFT launchpad and help incubate new projects, as Polygon Labs President Ryan Wyatt recently discussed on Decrypt\u2019s gm podcast. It\u2019s a move to grow the network\u2019s NFT scene beyond brand apps.\n\n\u201cThe most powerful thing in crypto is aligned incentives,\u201d Frank said. \u201cI personally want to see y00ts succeed, but part of seeing y00ts succeed is seeing the rest of the ecosystem succeed.\u201d\n\nHow it works\n\nDeLabs has set a March 15 launch target for both the DeGods and y00ts bridges, but Henrikson told Decrypt that late March is more realistic. Up until now, it wasn\u2019t exactly clear how the team planned to have users move NFTs between chains\u2014particularly on the point of whether the NFTs could be moved back and forth between the supported chains.\n\nThe bridging process via Wormhole will be an optional \u201cone-way migration\u201d from Solana to the new chain in both cases, Henrikson said, through a \u201cburn and mint\u201d process. Essentially, the Solana version of the PFP will be destroyed, and an identical version will be minted on the new chain and sent to the holder\u2019s designated wallet. There\u2019s no option to undo the migration.\n\nHolders can choose to keep their existing Solana NFT from either collection, but they will lose access to ongoing incentives and future benefits around the projects. For example, the staking rewards offered to both\u2014the DUST token for DeGods and points for y00ts holders\u2014will only continue to accrue for NFTs that have been bridged to Ethereum and Polygon.\n\n\u201cYou want to do the burn-and-mint,\u201d Frank said, \u201cand you want to have some type of incentive for people to get over there in the first week\u2014so that it's like a proper party.\u201d\n\nHenrikson said that Phantom wallet, which supports Solana and has added Ethereum and Polygon in beta, is ideal for this kind of transition as it can all happen in one interface. But the Wormhole process can work with other wallets, starting with any other Solana wallet and ending with the new NFT in the popular Ethereum wallet MetaMask, for example.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nFrank said that DeLabs has purposefully been quiet about future plans ahead of the shift, but that the migration will herald the start of its next phase for both projects. \u201cDeGods Season starts when we get to ETH, and y00ts Season starts when we get to Polygon,\u201d he affirmed.\n\nMoving the projects from Solana to its new respective networks will also serve as a showcase for Dust Labs\u2019 software and technology, Henrikson said, adding that the firm was founded with the ambition of being \u201call-chain or multi-chain.\u201d\n\nDust Labs, which raised $7 million last year, will offer up its software across multiple chains for other brands and companies to use. He said that doors to potential new opportunities are opening up at a \u201cmuch faster\u201d rate than ever before, thanks in part to support from Polygon Labs and interest from brands that want to help grow the NFT space on that network.\n\nWhile the announcement agitated many Solana die-hards, Frank emphasized that the migration isn\u2019t meant to be a firm goodbye to the original home of DeGods and y00ts. Any unredeemed y00t t00bs NFTs\u2014which holders burn to spawn a y00ts PFP\u2014will continue to live only on Solana, and Frank said that DeLabs would consider building future projects on the chain.\n\n\u201cWe have so much love for Solana,\u201d Frank said. \u201cAt times, it can feel very charged on the internet, but for us, it has nothing to do with that. We are honestly excited to see the mantle quote-unquote \u2018passed off\u2019 from us to another set of builders on Solana.\u201d\n\nBut DeLabs and Dust Labs see their future spanning multiple chains, and believe that the best place for DeGods and y00ts to grow is elsewhere. Frank said he\u2019s never bought into the \u201cYuga [Labs] playbook\u201d that many other NFT projects have tried to copy, and that his plan is to branch out in search of new conquests and potentially broader audiences.\n\n\u201cLet's not get complacent here. Let's keep pushing the boundaries and trying things out that are new,\u201d he said. \u201cWe're trying to take big swings, and we are trying to do it in a way that is going to make it exciting on the upside for people to participate.\u201d"

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAccording to an Ethereum Foundation blog post, after months of testing and an ephemeral devnet launch, the Shanghai/Capella or Shapella network upgrade is now scheduled for deployment on the Sepolia testnet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Shapella upgrade will activate on the Sepolia network at epoch 56832, which is estimated to be Feb. 28, 2023, at 4:04:48 a.m. UTC.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade will activate on the ETH testnet Sepolia network at epoch 56832, scheduled for 4:04:48 AM UTC on Feb. 28. This upgrade follows the Merge and enables validators to withdraw their stake from the Beacon Chain back to the execution layer. https://t.co/8NGPw8nkV8 \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) February 22, 2023\n\nThis upgrade follows the mid-September merge that ushered in the proof-of-stake transition and enables validators to withdraw. Users would be able to withdraw their stake ETH from the Beacon Chain back to the execution layer. It also introduces new functionality to both the execution and consensus layer. The Shapella upgrade combines changes to the execution layer (Shanghai), consensus layer (Capella) and engine API.\n\nThe Zhejiang testnet, which went live at the start of February, could be used to test Shapella functionality before the Sepolia upgrade. It urges stakers and nonstakers who operate nodes to upgrade their nodes to the most recent Ethereum client versions to take advantage of the Sepolia upgrade.\n\nEthereum price action\n\nAt the time of publication, Ethereum was down 1.66% at $1,647. On the upside, Ethereum could target the $1,800 mark next before continuing its journey toward the $2,000 range. Bears may mount a defense in the range between $2,000 and $2,200.\n\nOn the other hand, a strong support is envisaged near the $1,460 mark if declines continue ahead of the $1,350 mark."

        "content": "The co-founder of the social media website Reddit, Alexis Ohanian, reportedly bought 50,000 Ether (ETH) for just $15,000 during the cryptocurrency\u2019s presale in 2014, costing just 30 cents per coin.\n\nOhanian, who left the social media giant in 2020, told Forbes on Feb. 21 that he found the idea of a decentralized store of value very attractive, partly due to his Armenian heritage, prompting him to take an early gamble on Ethereum.\n\n\u201cAny group of people who have in their consciousness, or in their collective history, some idea of persecution, especially by a state, makes the idea of a store of value that is not controlled by any single state very attractive. And so, in some ways it was hardwired in me then, and made me in a way receptive to the idea of a decentralized currency.\u201d\n\nAt current prices, this investment is worth a whopping $82.5 million, according to CoinMarketCap, representing an increase of 549,589%.\n\nHe continued to explain how Turkish soldiers seized his family\u2019s inheritance of heirloom rugs during the Armenian genocide in World War I, which led to his interest in \u201cunseizable property.\u201d\n\nDue to his aversion to seizable property, Ohanian is a big proponent of self-custody. He manages the private keys to some of his most valuable crypto-related investments, keeping them off exchanges that are more vulnerable to the prying arms of governments.\n\nWhen he heard about Ethereum in a meeting with cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, Ohanian claimed he saw the potential for developers to build a wide range of potentially unseizable assets on top of it, such as nonfungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nAs a result, he made his initial investment in Ether but noted in the interview that \u201cin hindsight, I didn\u2019t invest nearly as much as I should have.\u201d\n\nRelated: Ethereum derivatives data suggests $1,700 might not remain a resistance level for long\n\nOhanian founded venture capitalist firm 776 in 2020 using the proceeds from his early investments in Ether and Coinbase. The firm has invested in 29 crypto-related startups and raised $500 million in February 2022 to finance similar investments.\n\nIn line with Ohanian\u2019s views that bear markets allow investors to buy assets at discounted prices, the firm has regarded the latest market downturn as the perfect time to make long-term bets on the crypto industry.\n\nThe firm currently boasts over $750 million in assets under management.\n\nOhanian noted that although crypto is extremely volatile, \u201cthere are plenty of people who have that generational consciousness of seeing massive inflation,\u201d which makes crypto\u2019s volatility much more palatable."

        "title": "Coinbase Enters Phase 3.5 of 'Secret Master Plan' With L2 Launch - Blockworks",
        "content": "Coinbase is launching the testnet of its Ethereum layer-2 network, Base.\n\nBase will be incubated inside Coinbase but has plans to later be completely decentralized. It will be powered through Optimism\u2019s OP stack, joining as the stack\u2019s second core contributor.\n\nIts code will be completely open-source, enabling it to preserve the critical, global, permissionless nature of cryptocurrencies, Jesse Pollak, protocol lead at Coinbase, told Blockworks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working with Optimism because we believe this must be decentralized and open to everyone,\u201d Pollak said in an interview. \u201cDoing that in collaboration with others is going to be the path to making that actually happen.\u201d\n\nConsidering there are no plans to issue a token, Base will use ether as its native asset, meaning users will be paying for gas fees in ETH. There are plans, though, to eventually bring USDC onto the network, according to Pollak.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we\u2019re excited about as well is what\u2019s called account abstraction \u2014 which is the ongoing effort to make it easier for users to have more powerful wallets,\u201d Pollak said. \u201c[This] will allow users to pay for gas in any currency they want, even if the underlying cost is in Ethereum.\u201d\n\n\n\nAccount abstraction, according to Pollak, is \u201csomething really powerful that will start to emerge in the year ahead.\u201d\n\nVision to build next super-chain\n\nCoinbase plans to run its own sequencer for Base in its initial launch, with plans to later decentralize the sequencer and make it possible to sequence multiple chains at the same time.\n\nA sequencer is similar to a validator. They are responsible for ordering and executing transactions and submitting them to the layer-1 chain, which in this case will be Ethereum.\n\nThe long-term vision though, Pollak said, is to have powerful interoperability between chains.\n\n\u201cRather than having one chain that\u2019s monolithic and requires everyone to be in the same place, we can actually have many chains that work together to scale Ethereum,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Base\u2019s initial launch, Coinbase will partner with a handful of multichain bridge providers to allow interoperability with Ethereum layer-1 and other layer-2s \u2014 as well as layer-1 ecosystems including Solana.\n\nBen Jones, the co-founder of Optimism, told Blockworks that as technology continues to evolve, capital efficiency will improve alongside it.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re using the internet right now, you\u2019re not thinking about what tier two ISP you\u2019re connected to at worst you\u2019re yelling at Spectrum, but once you\u2019re on [the internet] you\u2019re not worried about what grade your packets are being routed and all of that\u2026and so we can get to a future like that as well,\u201d Jones said.\n\nAdded Jones: \u201cThat\u2019s why we have this word super chain, which is a little cheeky, but it\u2019s trying to say that it\u2019s not about having a multi-chain, but rather building one cohesive, unified network.\u201d\n\nThe modular solution\n\nOne key goal of the initiative is to create technology that can be easily upgraded.\n\nThat goal is one of the main reasons why Coinbase chose Optimism as a partner for its latest release of Base, Pollak said, attributing it to the fact that the OP stack is built to be modular.\n\nAlthough zero-knowledge (zk) technology has been gaining momentum, Pollak said the difference in technology doesn\u2019t define the product. He described it as more of an implementation detail.\n\n\u201cWe believe that in the future, we will likely have roll-ups that have both zk components and optimistic components,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s important today is building the technology stack in a way that allows it to be easily upgraded.\u201d\n\nJones said that the \u201creality is you need to build infrastructure that makes it good to run chains, period.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you architect that the right way, you open up the door for things like the proof to be modules that we can slot in and upgrade over time,\u201d Jones said.\n\nModularity is not a limitation of the software, according to Jones \u2014 but rather a particular derivation pipeline that enables data layers to be swapped.\n\n\u201cIt will eventually allow us to do that with the right proof systems in a way that makes fewer sacrifices,\u201d he said.\n\nSimilar to other layer-2s, data availability on Base \u2014 the guarantee that all transaction data for a block is available to different network participants \u2014 will be on Ethereum.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working with Optimism for the last year on something called EIP 4844 \u2014 or proto danksharding \u2014 which is creating a new form of data availability on Ethereum,\u201d Pollak said. \u201cThat is going to make it 10 to 100 times cheaper for rollups like Optimism and Base to be running, which will make it cheaper for users.\u201d\n\nThe shipping of EIP 4844 is targeted for this summer, Pollak said.\n\nEntering phase 3.5 of Coinbase\u2019s \u201cSecret Master Plan\u201d\n\nCoinbase\u2019s end goal is to make it easier for developers to build useful decentralized applications (dapps) and distribute them broadly.\n\nCEO Brian Armstrong has said as much.\n\nIn 2016, Armstrong in \u201cThe Coinbase Secret Master Plan\u201d said that effort would be divided into four different phases: Develop the protocol; build a digital currency exchange; build a mass market interface for digital currency apps; then finally build the apps that power an open financial system.\n\n\u201cFor the last while, we\u2019ve been stuck between [phases] three and four, we\u2019ve had consumer interfaces, but we haven\u2019t had the useful dApps. Base is our bet that we can build a better platform that makes it easier for developers to build applications that are actually useful, and can bring a billion users into the crypto economy,\u201d Pollak said.\n\nPollak deems Coinbase as well-positioned to do so. It currently serves over 108 million verified users \u2014 and has access to over $100 billion worth of assets in its ecosystem, he said.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t be more excited to build what we consider phase 3.5 of the secret master plan,\u201d Pollak said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Ethereum developers are raising concerns over the creation of a marketplace for Ethereum tokens on the blockchain\u2019s sandbox called Goerli.\n\nLayerZero, a protocol that connects blockchains, has defended its new Goerli ETH marketplace as a solution for fixing a problem that has hobbled Ethereum development, but developers accuse it of choking access to a key tool and monetising a valueless token.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bad idea because you are incentivising people to spend real money on something that has no value,\u201d William Mitsuda, an Ethereum developer and founder of Ethereum block explorer Otterscan, told DL News.\n\nGoerli is one of Ethereum\u2019s most prominent \u201ctestnets,\u201d a blockchain where developers test their code before launching applications on the so-called \u201cmainnet,\u201d Ethereum\u2019s main blockchain.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\n\u201cWe made the market simply because the experience sucked for us and we asked ourselves \u2018what can we build to make life for Ethereum devs easier.\u201d\n\nGoerli ETH, the native token of the testnet, is normally a valueless token, but it is needed to deploy and test applications in the sandbox. Many Ethereum developers rely on Goerli to ensure their applications work properly before deploying them for real on mainnet.\n\nHowever, the Goerli testnet has been held back in recent months by a limited supply of tokens. While that scarcity has been created by design to better mirror the mainnet, it has meant that around 80% of the token is locked up in applications and cannot be used.\n\nFor testing most other applications, developers usually use the newer Sepolia testnet, where users can mint an infinite number of testnet tokens.\n\nLayerZero launched a new Testnet Bridge on Tuesday, which lets users directly swap valuable mainnet ETH, the usual token for Ethereum, for Goerli ETH, the normally valueless testnet version.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\n\u201cWe made the market simply because the experience sucked for us and we asked ourselves \u2018what can we build to make life for Ethereum devs easier,\u2019\u201d Bryan Pellegrino, co-founder and CEO at LayerZero Labs, told DL News. \u201cThis was near the top of our list. Every single person in our company has felt this exact need so it got proposed and we said \u2018yeah absolutely, let\u2019s build that.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut many developers are outraged that the bridge places a monetary value on something that, in their eyes, should be free.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a short-term relief that\u2019s not good in the long term,\u201d Mudit Gupta, chief information security officer at Polygon, told DL News. \u201cAccess to educational material and testnets should ideally be free and not gated.\u201d\n\nOthers suggest that putting a price on Goerli ETH may discourage developers from building on Ethereum.\n\nHudson Jameson, a former support lead at the Ethereum Foundation, told DL News that testnets have always been operated as public goods to welcome new developers and allow testing contracts for free.\n\n\u201cThere were already instances of people making small paid deals to get Goerli ETH, they just formalised this.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven if it looks like the issue is solved, [it] comes at the cost of new devs getting the impression they will be priced out of trying Ethereum development and instil a sense that testnet tokens have economic value similar to regular ETH tokens,\u201d he said.\n\nSome developers have rushed to defend LayerZero\u2019s Goerli ETH market.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen the argument that making Goerli ETH tradable creates a barrier to entry for new devs but I don\u2019t believe this is the case because it\u2019s extremely cheap, hovering between two [and] 10 cents,\u201d pseudonymous Ethereum developer Philogy told DL News.\n\nNOW READ: Harmony execs mismanaged funds and bullied workers, ex-staff claim\n\nOthers highlighted previous difficulty in getting enough Goerli ETH tokens for testing. Most faucets \u2013 bots that distribute tokens on request \u2013 require users to solve CAPTCHA puzzles to prove they\u2019re humans and post their wallet address on Twitter \u2013 a problem for those trying to develop quietly. Even after jumping through these hoops, users only received small amounts of Goerli ETH.\n\nAnother alternative was using over-the-counter providers of Goerli ETH.\n\nAndrey Shevchenko, co-founder at DeFi protocol Zircon Finance, told DL News that LayerZero\u2019s move is good because \u201cthere were already instances of people making small paid deals to get Goerli ETH, they just formalised this.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou literally had to hunt for it, random discords, Twitter, etc. Basically play find-a-whale,\u201d Pellegrino told DL News.\n\nGoerli ETH traded for $0.10 at Testnet Bridge\u2019s launch yesterday but has fluctuated downward since then.\n\n\u201cOverall I think it\u2019ll dump to zero quite quickly,\u201d Shevchenko said."

        "title": "Retro-Style Ethereum NFT Metaverse Game Worldwide Webb Raises $10M - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nMost metaverse games opt for 3D environments, with varying degrees of success, but Worldwide Webb has charted a different path: this massively multiplayer online (MMO) world opts for a retro, Super Nintendo-esque style, yet it supports more than a million Ethereum NFT avatars.\n\nAnd it\u2019s expanding, thanks in part to a new funding round.\n\nWorldwide Webb, founded by artist and game designer Thomas Webb, today revealed a $10 million Series A round funded entirely by VC firm Pantera Capital. It\u2019s the game\u2019s first external funding round since its initial debut in 2020.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDespite looking like an early 1990s throwback, Worldwide Webb is a fully online, browser-based experience that lets players plug in an Ethereum wallet and use their NFT avatars from hundreds of popular collections, including the Bored Ape Yacht Club, CryptoPunks, Doodles, Cool Cats, Deadfellaz, and plenty more.\n\nPopped onto @Worldwide_WEB3 to claim my valentines items, getting web3 @RuneScape vibes, with a lot more style.@WebbEmotional and co. have done an amazing job continuing to build in the bear! pic.twitter.com/pQoolM59yT \u2014 Pranksy \ud83d\udce6 (@pranksy) February 16, 2023\n\nEach supported avatar is converted into a 2D pixel character that players can then guide through the world, interacting with other players, exploring the environments, and even soaking in the story.\n\nWorldwide Webb also has its own NFT land plots in the form of digital apartments that users can customize, and those NFTs have yielded more than $80 million to date worth of trading volume.\n\nWebb, the founder and CEO, told Decrypt that the funding will help expand his development team, with ambitions to double headcount from its current tally of 30 people.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe've been moving fast and we've been shipping product,\u201d Webb said. \u201cBut for us, it's a case of wanting to move faster. We want to build faster, and we want to innovate faster.\u201d\n\nWhat's next for World Wide Webb?\n\nThe next big step forward is Blockbusterz, a player-vs.-player (PvP) competitive mode that lets teams of five battle it out.\n\nThanks to NFT interoperability, players will be able to bring their Apes, Cats, Punks, and plenty more into the mode, which Webb demoed for Decrypt.\n\nIt looks like a streamlined multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game, akin to mobile hit Brawl Stars, as players attack each other and attempt to control the battlefield.\n\nThe cinematic 3D trailer embedded above gives a sense of the vibe of the cross-project experience, with a brief taste of the actual 2D gameplay shown at the end.\n\n\u201cBecause we have over 200 collections integrated, I wanted to see the Deadfellaz versus the Doodles,\u201d Webb said. \u201cI wanted to see CryptoPunks versus the Bored Ape Yacht Club in competitive battles\u2014and then for us to be able to issue rewards.\u201d\n\nThe PvP mode will introduce a \u201ccompete-to-mint\u201d mechanic that lets players earn NFTs simply by playing and excelling in the competitive mode. Webb said that the game mechanics are purposefully designed to be difficult to cheat via an automated bot or script\u2014a hurdle that Bored Ape creator Yuga Labs faced with its recent Dookey Dash game competition.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLonger-term, Webb aims to take even more inspiration from time-absorbing gaming classics like RuneScape and Ultima Online, keeping players hooked with richer gameplay and narrative. He said the funding will help attract more veteran talent so that they can grow Worldwide Webb into a \u201cmassive, sprawling universe.\u201d\n\nEventually, Webb said he\u2019s keen on creating native iOS and Android apps should Apple and Google grow friendlier to Web3 business models, and similarly aims to bring the game to console platforms if giants like Nintendo and PlayStation eventually play nice with NFTs.\n\nAnd while eye-catching 3D trailers are purely cinematic teasers\u2014not indicative of a visual transformation for the game\u2014his team is exploring potential ways to bring 3D elements into the experience without shedding the retro allure.\n\nHe pointed to Square Enix\u2019s role-playing game Octopath Traveler as an example of an effective hybrid aesthetic.\n\nThe 2D look is a differentiator, and even with one less dimension on-screen, Webb doesn\u2019t see it as a limitation. He still wants to deliver a large-scale, cross-project metaverse mash-up like \u201cReady Player One,\u201d albeit with pixel graphics. Fortnite currently serves up that kind of cross-IP affair, but within a limiting, closed-garden ecosystem.\n\n\u201cWhat I was really hoping to do was to see a metaverse game that people can go into, but they can bring these things in,\u201d he said, \u201cin a permissionless manner.\u201d"

        "content": "Ethereum whales move away from ETH as MVRV ratio increased.\n\nValidators and retail investors continued to support Ethereum.\n\nAccording to a 22 February tweet by Glassnode, large addresses have started selling their Ethereum [ETH]. New data suggested that addresses holding over 1000 ETH reached a one-month low.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nSelling pressure rises\n\nLarge addresses selling their Ethereum may be a good thing, as it could make the network more decentralized. However, if this trend of large addresses exiting their positions was to continue, it could impact ETH\u2019s prices negatively.\n\nOne reason why whales were observed to be selling their ETH could be due to the high MVRV ratio of Ethereum at press time. According to Glassnode\u2019s data, the MVRV ratio for Ethereum reached a one-month-high.\n\nA high MVRV ratio suggested that most ETH holders would make a profit if they sold their holdings. This would create selling pressure on a lot of addresses. Even though the selling pressure was high, retail investors continued to HODL.\n\nAlong with that, there was high activity on the network as well. This was showcased by the increasing fees paid off on the Ethereum network.\n\nETH investors stay hopeful\n\nAnother reason why the retail investors were interested in Ethereum could be due to its negative issuance. A negative net issuance indicates that the total supply of the cryptocurrency has decreased over a time period. A negative net issuance may lead to a scarcity of coins and potentially increase the value of the cryptocurrency in the future.\n\nAlong with the retail investors, the number of validators on the Ethereum network increased as well. According to Staking Rewards, the number of validators on the Ethereum network grew by 3.89% in the last 30 days. The high number of validators on the network would be due to the revenue being generated by them.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nOver the last month, the revenue generated by Ethereum validators increased by 38.08%, which translated to $1.91 billion worth of revenue at press time.\n\nOverall, despite whales moving away from ETH, retail and staker interest continued to stay strong."

        "title": "FOMO in 4D, The Legendary Ethereum Game Gets a New Life on Arbitrum - GlobeNewswire",
        "content": "BOSTON MA, Feb. 23, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Over 18 months since it\u2019s release, Arbitrum is getting the attention many of its supporters have been looking for: the high-speed, low-fee, Layer-2 Ethereum rollup network has overtaken Binance Smart Chain (BSC) in terms of daily volume. After performing neck-and-neck for much of 2023, it would appear that Arbitrum has peeled off a decent percentage of the popular centralized-decentralized network\u2019s userbase. In other words, BSC users are feeling the fear of missing out (FOMO) on Arbitrum, which couldn\u2019t come at a better time for the developers of the token PoSH4D (P4D) and its game component, FOMO3D: Arbitrum.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite quietly launching PoSH4D (P4D) on February 21st, word of the token\u2019s release\u2014and anticipation of the upcoming game\u2014spread like a virus among the Arbitrum community, driving the marketcap of P4D to $350k within the first 24 hours. Why such a demand for a token with so little fanfare? Well, the project is a direct homage to the original Ethereum game FOMO3D, and if trends continue and the team can continue to deliver on their promises (so far they've touted their staking platform for token-holders), FOMO3D Arbitrum could become the biggest Web3 game of 2023.\n\n\"Time is a Flat Circle\"\n\nThe original FOMO3D was released in mid-2018, during a downturn in the cryptocurrency market: Bitcoin\u2019s price had plunged by a third from the beginning of the year, selloffs worsened in the face of massive exchange hacks, rampant initial coin offering (ICO) scams, and rumors of incoming government regulations. However, while many in the community were overcome with doom and gloom, developers of Team JUST couldn\u2019t help but laugh at the absurdity. FOMO3D was created as a satirical game based on the cutthroat environment that marked the 2018 \u201ccrypto winter:\u201d the game billed itself as an \u201cexit scam\u201d\u2013much like the aforementioned ICO schemes\u2013where players purchased \u201cprivate keys\u201d\u2013a reference to the hacked wallets that ruined several crypto exchanges that year. The game was a massive success, and the winner of the first round walked away with 10k ETH, (now valued at $17 million dollars). Given the tumultuous last year for the crypto market, it should come as no surprise that, half a decade later, in another uncertain market, the game\u2019s themes still resonate with developers and investors alike.\n\n\"DeFi, DeFi Never Changes\"\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so many examples: Do Kwon and Terra Luna, bridge hacks like Ronin and Wormhole, and of course SBF [Sam Bankman-Fried] and FTX,\u201d said a spokesman for FOMO3D Arbitrum, rattling off the names of some the worst offenders in crypto of 2022 like a list of MVP athletes. \u201cHopefully the crypto winter put a freeze on newcomers trying to fleece the space, but in the meantime, we just want to get people\u2019s blood pumping again, and we think Arbitrum is the perfect place for a project like this.\u201d The spokesman opined, referring to the rollup\u2019s adjacency to the gargantuan amounts of liquidity held on Ethereum, as well as the low cost and high speed of transactions.\n\n\u201cDoing a revival of FOMO3D on Ethereum is impossible nowadays: even with the Merge upgrade, gas costs still regularly hit $80 per transaction and transactions can take minutes to go through, you can\u2019t run a blockchain game like that.\u201d Though the game is no longer on Ethereum, the developers did include a nod to the upgrades to the network, \u201cthe original was called \u2018proof of weak hands,\u2019 a play off the acronym for proof-of-work; as a nod to Ethereum moving to proof-of-stake, our revival is \u2018proof of strong hands.\u2019 Besides, if you\u2019re still holding crypto after last year, you\u2019ve gotta have strong hands, just how strong our community\u2019s hands are will have to wait until the game comes out this weekend.\u201d\n\nP4D CA: 0xEFc43Cf79f406D62960e34d3a62c729a0EEbEC4b\n\nP4D Chart: https://dexscreener.com/arbitrum/0xf4037ae51505d3c1f8f03f2916cd52136f0968b3\n\nP4D Staking/FOMO3D dApp preview: https://dapp.fomo3darb.com/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/fomo3darbitrum\n\nDocs: https://docs.fomo3darb.com/\n\nMedium: https://medium.com/@arbitrum3d/fomo3d-arbitrum-has-arrived-86d4011142fd\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/fomo3darbitrum\n\n"

        "title": "Ethereum Name Service: What does it mean; Pros and Cons? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum Name Service provides users with a human-readable address, and after registering a domain, it's control over all subdomains.\n\nThe internet as it exists today is very different from how it was when it first appeared. In the early stages of the development of the internet, accessibility was one of the major issues. Websites were inaccessible because computer scientists did not match internet protocol addresses and domain names.\n\nWhat is Ethereum Name Service, for example, is a question that refers to the accessibility issues present in the early days of the web in the context of blockchain or web3. Right?\n\nUsers had to type the website\u2019s complete IP address to access it before domain names were invented. The average user might need help remembering IP addresses because they contain many numbers and dots. However, the story of internet accessibility was altered in 1983 with the launch of the Domain Name System.\n\nThe alignment of IP addresses and evocative domain names was the main focus of DNS functionality. Therefore, rather than typing in lengthy IP addresses, users could access websites by simply typing in the website\u2019s name. What connection does DNS have with the ENS Ethereum Name Service? A detailed explanation of ENS and its architecture is provided in the following blog as an answer.\n\nWhat is Ethereum Name Service?\n\nThe Ethereum Name Service, or ENS, is an open naming system that expands to meet user needs. The main objective of ENS is to translate different machine-readable identifiers in blockchain and cryptocurrency into human-readable names. The crucial identifiers machines can read content hashes, cryptocurrency addresses, and cryptographic metadata.\n\nThe reverse resolution is yet another crucial aspect of ENS. It can assist in connecting Ethereum addresses to metadata, such as interface descriptions and canonical names. In the simplest explanations of ENS, the question \u201cIs Ethereum Name Service safe?\u201d also qualify as a significant highlight. Surprisingly, the Ethereum Name Service\u2019s underlying principles guarantee security. Although significant architectural differences exist in incorporating Ethereum\u2019s capabilities and constraints, ENS and DNS share similar goals.\n\nHow does the ENS work?\n\nThe basics of how Ethereum Name Service functions are also highlighted in the introduction. ENS uses domains\u2014hierarchical names denoted by a dot\u2014separated by commas. As an illustration, the Ethereum Service Name domain \u201cjohn.eth\u201d. This domain would be completely under the owner\u2019s control and any subdomains that may be present. It\u2019s crucial to keep in mind that registrars, which are smart contracts, are the owners of the.eth and.test domains. In ENS Ethereum, the registrars play a crucial role in defining the regulations that could control the distribution of subdomains. As long as they follow the guidelines in the registrar smart contracts, any user can acquire ownership of a domain for their use.\n\nThe support for importing DNS names is yet another distinctive feature of how Ethereum Name Service functions. It implies that you can use your existing DNS names with ENS. Additionally, ENS enables domain owners at any level to configure subdomains for their purposes or those of others. For instance, the domain owner \u201cjohn.eth\u201d could set up the \u201cpay.john.eth\u201d subdomain to suit their needs.\n\nThe benefits of the Ethereum Name Service are also shown by the way ENS is implemented on the Ethereum network and other test networks. Furthermore, ENS might be able to recognize the networks on which you use end-user applications or libraries, such as the ensjs JavaScript library. It could then utilize the ENS installation on the selected network. The ENS Manager app or other ENS-powered applications make good starting points for users who want to learn more about ENS functionalities.\n\nAdvantages of Ethereum Name Service\n\nThe fact that the Ethereum Name Service provides users with a human-readable address is its main benefit. In addition to being entered into an Ethereum DApp, this address can be given to someone in place of your public address. The blockchain and ENS NFT are used to parse your public address. It also has the opposite effect.\n\nThe other benefit of ENS is that, after registering a domain, you have control over all subdomains. To put it another way, if you register \u201cCryptoVantage.eth,\u201d you can also register \u201cwallet.CryptoVantage.eth\u201d or any other address that uses the primary domain name. Additionally, ENS can be connected to domains like.com,.org, or.edu, and payments can be made to those domain addresses from Ethereum Dapps. This implies that you could send money to CryptoVantage.com as you could send it to a blockchain public address.\n\nIt was mentioned in the introduction that ENS is not required as an asset to purchase and register domain names with ENS; this lowers the entry barrier, which is advantageous.\n\nDisadvantages of Ethereum Name Service\n\nThe primary drawback of Ethereum Name Service is its yearly ETH fee, which varies according to the length of your domain name. Although you can pay for domain registration years in advance, it is ideal when ETH is expensive because subscription fees are paid in the USD price of ETH.\n\nThe limited use of the token is another disadvantage of ENS. It\u2019s only employed for voting on proposals and conducting government. Since ENS is not required to create an ENS domain, fees are paid in ETH.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Ethereum Name Service\u2019s introduction to its fundamentals provides a thorough impression of its importance for web3. One of the main challenges facing the cryptocurrency and blockchain ecosystem at the moment is accessibility. The ideas behind wallet addresses and cryptography are difficult for the typical user to grasp quickly. The advantages of Ethereum Name Service can guarantee that users can access cryptocurrencies and blockchain services without confusing identifiers. Although ENS is still in its infancy, new protocols surrounding ENS may bring about new functionalities."

Discover SCENE\n\nOptimism\u2013a scaling solution built on Ethereum\u2013has seen the price of its native token soar amid Coinbase\u2019s announcement of its own layer-2 network on Thursday.\n\nThe token, OP, is up 16% on the day according to CoinGecko, and peaked just above $3 before retracing to around $2.90 at press time. By comparison, most major cryptocurrencies have been relatively stagnant over the last 24 hours, with none rising by more than 1%.\n\nCoinbase said that its new project, called \u201cBase,\u201d will be powered by Optimism, and that the company would be partnering with the DAO for open-source development on the OP stack.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLayer-2 solutions are designed to make transactions faster and cheaper than they are on their respective layer-1 blockchain, like Ethereum, where fees have been known to balloon in times of peak network demand.\n\nFor Optimism, this is accomplished by initially processing transactions on a separate chain, before eventually settling those transfers on the mainnet in batches called \u201crollups.\u201d\n\nThough initially launched without a token, Optimism began airdropping OP tokens to early adopters in May of last year as a way of distributing governance power to the community and funding development proposals through its DAO. Arbitrum One, another popular Ethereum scaler, has long been rumored by DeFi speculators to be planning an airdrop, though it's yet to materialize.\n\nArbitrum and Optimism respectively comprise 53% and 31% of market share of the $6 billion Ethereum scaling market, according to L2Beat.\n\nHowever, Base\u2019s entry into the fray may prove more cooperative than competitive for Optimism. That's because \"the Base Chain will commit a portion of transaction fee revenue back to the Optimism Collective,\u201d tweeted Optimism on Thursday. \u201cThis furthers the Collective\u2019s vision for a sustainable future where Impact = Profit.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "Customizable rollup provider Eclipse is launching a Solana-focused scaling solution, which allows applications to be compatible with Polygon, the companies exclusively told TechCrunch.\n\nRollups, a part of the layer-2 blockchain ecosystem, are a scaling solution to help make blockchains faster and cheaper. Rollups work by compiling a number of transactions into one bundle to go onto a layer-1 blockchain like Ethereum or Solana. So basically, instead of sending thousands of individual transactions, it\u2019s one larger one that costs less.\n\nThe Polygon Solana \u2014 or Sealevel \u2014 Virtual Machine (SVM) will be powered by Eclipse and will be able to run smart contracts and tooling compatible with Solana, which will ultimately increase throughput speed and interoperability for crypto subsectors like gaming, DeFi and more, Neel Somani, founder of Eclipse, said to TechCrunch.\n\n\u201cEthereum was obviously still really slow and still very expensive, so it was very obvious rollups were the path to scaling Ethereum,\u201d Somani said. \u201cSo we were thinking, what if we made a highly parallelized rollup, but the difference is that we stick to a standard set of tooling that already exists like the Solana Virtual Machine or Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\u201d\n\nThat was the initial motivation behind Eclipse, but it\u2019s evolved into a customizable rollup provider: People can pick their base level (like Polygon or Solana), choose a virtual machine like EVM or SVM, and make customizations in the application that might include different elements at the core level, Somani said.\n\nApplications, games, projects, protocols and more are still \u201ctoo expensive\u201d in the crypto ecosystem, but rollups can help support different use cases without constraining the blockchain, Somani said.\n\nThrough the launch, decentralized applications (dApps) built for the Solana blockchain can migrate or become multichain through the Polygon SVM, which can open up the doors for both communities using and building on different blockchains.\n\nBetween the two communities, there\u2019s been high demand for a collaborative solution in mainly the gaming and physical infrastructure application spaces, Somani said. \u201cThat\u2019s the big areas we\u2019ve been seeing demand for and it\u2019s the areas where Polygon and Solana have been going after lately.\u201d\n\nIn the long term, Eclipse sees this launch as just the beginning for scaling.\n\n\u201cI think this hinges toward a future proliferation of all kinds of virtual machines across all these different base layers,\u201d Somani said. \u201cThis might be one example of an SVM rollup, but we are likely to see SVM on Ethereum mainnet or SVM on other base layers.\u201d\n\nCorrection: The headline on this story was updated to properly reflect the launch of the scaling solution."

        "content": "On Wednesday, Coinbase\u2019s main Twitter account posted a six-second video of a blue dot fading into a black background. Thursday\u2019s date\u2014Feb. 23, 2023\u2014was all that was revealed. Speculation on Crypto Twitter ran rampant.\n\nThe publicly traded cryptocurrency exchange later on Thursday announced it was releasing Base, an ecosystem built on top of the Ethereum blockchain that allows developers to build decentralized applications, or dapps.\n\n\u201cTo bring in billions of users to the cryptoeconomy, dapps need to be easier, cheaper, and safer to interact with,\u201d the company wrote in a blog post. \u201cFor this to happen, we need to make it even easier for developers to build these dapps.\u201d\n\nCoinbase\u2019s latest offering continues a push toward a long-stated goal to make cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, which can appear impenetrable to lay consumers and some developers, accessible to a wider audience. And for a cryptocurrency exchange heavily dependent on trading fees, the launch of the new developer ecosystem is yet another attempt to diversify the company\u2019s products amid the extended chill of Crypto Winter.\n\n1/ \ud83d\udd35 We\u2019re excited to announce @BuildOnBase.\n\n\n\nBase is an Ethereum L2 that offers a secure, low-cost, developer-friendly way for anyone, anywhere, to build decentralized apps.\n\n\n\nOur goal with Base is to make onchain the next online and onboard 1B+ users into the cryptoeconomy. pic.twitter.com/RmwZFJzGGs \u2014 Coinbase (@coinbase) February 23, 2023\n\nBase, which Coinbase describes as \u201csecure, low-cost, [and] developer-friendly,\u201d is built on top of Ethereum, one of the largest and most heavily used blockchains. This makes it a layer-2 network, or a system built on top of another blockchain. Fees paid to operate on Base will be paid with Ether, Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, not with a new token, the company said.\n\nTo launch Base, the cryptocurrency exchange is partnering with Optimism, another layer-2 network that makes using Ethereum less expensive for users and developers. (Every time Ethereum users post a transaction on the blockchain, they must pay \u201cgas,\u201d or a fee, with Ether. Optimism lets developers process these transactions in bundles, which reduces the gas.)\n\nTo commemorate the announcement, Coinbase released a new non-fungible token collection of, unsurprisingly, blue dots. The NFTs are free to mint, or download into a crypto wallet, and will be available through Sunday.\n\nDespite the blue dot fervor, Coinbase\u2019s business took a heavy hit in 2022, as several prominent crypto companies declared bankruptcy, including rival exchange FTX.\n\nOn Wednesday, Coinbase released fourth-quarter earnings that, while beating analysts\u2019 expectations, were markedly lower than a year earlier. The company\u2019s full-year 2022 revenue was down 57%, and it lost $557 million in the fourth quarter compared with a profit of $840 million in the same quarter in 2021."

Camelot, a new decentralised exchange, also built on Arbitrum, witnessed a 369 percent spike in activities since February 1.\n\nAnalytics platform Nansen also showed that other financial applications based on Arbitrum recorded a 100 percent increase in transactions and userbase in the last 24 hours. These include Vela Exchange and Radiant Capital.\n\nIt is however noteworthy that Ethereum is still ahead of Arbitrum in terms of generating network fees. Ethereum's per-day fees amount to around $6.7 million (roughly Rs. 55 crore). Arbitrum, on the other hand, gathers around $154,000 (roughly Rs. 1.2 crore) per day.\n\nThe growth in this layer-2 blockchain solution is being triggered by some rather positive speculations making the rounds in the market. The crypto community is reportedly expecting Arbitrum to soon announce a potential airdrop.\n\nThere have been no official announcements from Arbitrum developers about the same. Arbitrum does not have a native crypto token.\n\nGaana, JioSaavn, Google Podcasts, Apple Podcasts, The iQoo Neo 7 packs a lot of power at an affordable price.

        "title": "What is Algorand? Is it Halal? - Islamic Finance Guru",
        "content": "Algorand (ticker: ALGO) is a relatively new cryptocurrency and open-source blockchain platform that focuses on scalability and speed. Officially launched in 2019, the Algorand platform and the accompanying ALGO cryptocurrency rank 35th in the cryptocurrency world.\n\nAlgorand seeks to compete directly with Ethereum, the juggernaut in the crypto world, offering a similar use case with smart contracts and Proof-of-Stake (PoS).\n\nJust like Ethereum, most scholars hold Algorand to be halal. We also share this view.\n\nRead on for a deep dive into what Algorand is and how the ALGO cryptocurrency works.\n\nWhat is Algorand?\n\nAlgorand is both a cryptocurrency (ALGO) and an open-source blockchain platform that offers fast transaction speeds and a smart contract ecosystem in much the same way Ethereum does. In fact, Algorand is a direct competitor to Ethereum and aims to become the mainstream smart contract and payment currency in the cryptocurrency space.\n\nSilvio Micali, renown cryptographer and a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), founded Algorand in 2017. The platform was officially launched to the public in June 2019.\n\nIt is easy to understand Algorand by comparing it to Ethereum. It has a similar consensus mechanism, has smart contract capability, and is directly competing with Ethereum.\n\nAlgorand is open-source just like Ethereum, meaning anyone can see the code behind the platform. This allows it to garner a level of trust and foster a developer community that is harder to come by in closed source projects.\n\nAlgorand\u2019s unique selling point is that it boasts fast transaction speeds, and can scale these fast transactions allowing it to position itself as a crypto version of Mastercard or Visa. Meaning that Algorand aims to be the payment and currency network that handles global transactions at near instantaneous speeds.\n\nAnother way in which Algorand competes directly with Ethereum is that it can host other cryptocurrencies in its ecosystem and blockchain platform. This would allow people to start their own cryptocurrency whilst using the underlying technical prowess and open-source platform of Algorand.\n\nThe number of ALGO coins is capped to a total of 10 billion, with about 7 billion in circulation right now. This creates some level of scarcity which provides ALGO coins with value.\n\nHow does Algorand work technically?\n\nThe Algorand network is a decentralised, open-source blockchain platform that was designed to be fast, secure, and scalable to handle massive volumes of transactions at near instantaneous speeds.\n\nEthereum validates a new block of transactions within 12-14 seconds, whereas Algorand validates a new block of transactions within 5-12 seconds.\n\nBitcoin (and previously Ethereum) uses a Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism to validate these transactions. PoW is essentially using very powerful computers to solve increasingly complex mathematical puzzles to add a block to the blockchain. The one who solves the puzzle in a PoW is rewarded. This person is called the \u2018block proposer\u2019.\n\nThe problem with PoW is how energy-intensive it is. Due to the computing power required it simply costs too much for most people to participate.\n\nEthereum moved onto the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) system in 2022, where users can \u2018stake\u2019 their coins to validate new blocks and earn rewards. Staking is basically locking up coins as collateral to earn coins. You can read more about staking here and whether it is halal.\n\nAlgorand has evolved the basic PoS mechanism and uses a unique consensus algorithm called \u2018Pure Proof-of-Stake\u2019 (PPoS), which allows it to achieve high transaction speeds and low fees without sacrificing security or decentralisation.\n\nOne of the key features of the Algorand network is its use of \u2018verifiable random functions\u2019 (VRFs) to select the \u2018block proposer\u2019 for each new block.\n\nIn a traditional PoW blockchain like Bitcoin, the block proposer is selected based on their ability to solve a complex mathematical puzzle as outlined. In contrast, the Algorand network uses VRFs to randomly select the block proposer from among a pool of validators (called \u2018committee members\u2019), who are chosen based on the amount of ALGO they have staked (i.e., locked up as collateral).\n\nThis means that in order to participate in the Algorand network as a validator, you must first purchase and hold a certain amount of ALGO. The more ALGO you hold, the higher your chances of being selected as a committee member and earning rewards for proposing and validating blocks.\n\nIn addition to its PPoS consensus algorithm, the Algorand network also uses a novel \u2018atomic transaction\u2019 mechanism to ensure the integrity and consistency of its blockchain ledger.\n\nAtomic transactions allow multiple transactions to be bundled together and either all committed to the ledger or all discarded, depending on whether they are valid. This helps to prevent the \u2018double spend\u2019 problem that can occur in other blockchain platforms, where a single unit of cryptocurrency can be spent multiple times before the transactions are fully processed.\n\nThe Algorand network and ALGO cryptocurrency aim to provide a fast, secure, and scalable platform and alternative to Ethereum for building decentralised applications (dApps) and quickly processing transactions to compete with not only other cryptocurrencies but with the likes of Mastercard and Visa.\n\nIt offers a smart contract capable ecosystem to foster a developer-consumer community and become the de facto open-source cryptocurrency platform of choice.\n\nWhat are the use cases of Algorand?\n\nPayments and DeFi\n\nThe ALGO cryptocurrency presents itself as a leaner, faster version of Ethereum.\n\nALGO can be used to make payments to merchants and people around the globe in a matter of seconds and with minimal fees, making it the ideal payment network.\n\nDevelopers can also use the Algorand network to build decentralised financial applications, such as peer-to-peer trading markets or platforms for stablecoins.\n\nAlgorand presents itself as a serious contender in the cryptocurrency as an actual currency space because of speed, scalability, and cost.\n\nNon-Fungible-Tokens (NFTs)\n\nNFTs are tokens that can be attached to unique items, such as art and media. These unique tokens are not interchangeable like a standard ALGO token. An NFT is secured on the Algorand network and can only have one owner at a time. NFTs can be sold on global markets powered by the Algorand network.\n\nAre people using Algorand right now?\n\nAlgorand is a small player in the cryptocurrency space when compared to the larger cryptocurrencies, but a big player in absolute terms.\n\nIt ranks 35th out of all cryptocurrencies and has a market dominance of 0.17% and a market cap of under $2 billion.\n\nALGO currently has a daily transaction volume of under $20 million and a daily transaction count of under 5 million. This is especially the case after the market downturn in 2022 where before it used to see higher numbers and more activity.\n\nIts direct competitor Ethereum, which is more established and trusted, ranks 2nd after only Bitcoin. ETH has a market cap of $201 billion and a daily transaction volume of under $3 billion.\n\nWhile in absolute terms Algorand is being used, it is miniscule when comparing it to some of the bigger players which compete against it directly.\n\nWhat are the strengths and weaknesses of Algorand?\n\nStrengths\n\nAlgorand\u2019s \u2018Pure Proof-of-Stake\u2019 (PPoS) mechanism allows it to speed past competitors in verifying transactions without sacrificing security and stability. This gives it an advantage when scaling up because on the level of millions of transactions, that is an immense amount of time and money saved.\n\nAlgorand is an open-source, smart contract capable blockchain platform which means it allows developers to build decentralised applications and even other cryptocurrencies on the Algorand network. This makes it attractive to a developer community which is essential to the longevity of any crypto network.\n\n\n\nWeaknesses\n\nAlgorand currently has a very small market cap and market dominance. The smaller this is, the less trust and momentum it can gain overall which affects its future prospects. People, developers, and companies will be more likely to go with bigger, more established competitors.\n\nAlgorand does not offer anything radically different from its more established and trusted competitors. This calls into question whether Algorand can truly take off and gain a respectable market dominance as opposed to remaining a niche, hobbyist blockchain network.\n\nIs Algorand a good investment?\n\nCrypto has now become a staple of many investment portfolios. Even major institutional investors now hold a small percentage of crypto in their portfolios.\n\nPutting a small percentage of your portfolio means that you can benefit from some of the potentially dazzling increases in crypto whilst also not going bankrupt if crypto were to take a really deep nosedive.\n\nThe price of ALGO currently sits at $0.2 and has decreased from high points of $3 in 2019 and 2021.\n\nAlgorand is currently quite a niche and small player in the space with multiple, better alternatives. If investors believe, after due diligence, that it has some advantage in a specific industry or market, then it may be worth dedicating small portions of your crypto portfolio to ALGO.\n\nHowever, Algorand does not actually bring enough radical innovations to supplant the larger, more established players.\n\nAlternatives to Algorand\n\nAlgorand is one of many smart contract blockchains. While it has the advantage of speed over other networks, it is not the only network with unique technical innovations.\n\nIf Algorand is to truly rise and become part of the core DeFi infrastructure, it will have to maintain and innovate in its competitive advantages over the networks below.\n\nEthereum\n\nEthereum is the name in cryptocurrency when it comes to DeFi and smart contract capable networks. Given how synonymous it is with the DeFi space and its 19.31% market dominance, Ethereum is the giant that Algorand needs to wrestle with.\n\nWhile Algorand has higher transaction speeds than Ethereum, there are two reasons why this may not be enough to contend with Ethereum.\n\nEthereum has a level of trust in the community that Algorand is a long way from achieving.\n\nNow that Ethereum has moved to the Proof-of-Stake in late 2022, some of the advantages Algorand had over Ethereum have now disappeared. Mining ETH is not as expensive and energy intensive as it used to be.\n\nCardano\n\nCardano (ADA) has a market capitalisation of almost $13 billion and hence the number 8 spot in the crypto space. Cardano was founded based on peer-reviewed research and evidence-based methods, lending it technical credibility.\n\nCardano claims to be the most environmentally friendly blockchain network, using only the power of 600 homes annually, which is comparatively less compared to the colossal energy usage of other major cryptocurrencies. This makes it more sustainable in the long-term.\n\nCardano offers a similar feature set to Algorand whilst being more sustainable over the long-term.\n\nPolkadot\n\nComing in the 12th spot with a market capitalisation of $7 billion, Polkadot (DOT) is well-known in the crypto space for its \u2018interoperability\u2019 feature.\n\nThis allows several blockchains together to form one larger network, allowing data to be shared securely and efficiently. This cross-chain collaboration is so important for the future of Web 3.0 and the internet at large, that Polkadot can seriously be considered one of the core digital infrastructures of the future and slowly gain market dominance.\n\nPolkadot is a network that can co-exist with Algorand as it aims to tackle different problems. Algorand is focussed on high transaction speeds and low fees, whilst Polkadot is focussed on interoperability.\n\nIs Algorand (ALGO) halal?\n\nMost scholars hold ALGO and Algorand to be halal. We also share this view.\n\nThe essence of the debate on whether cryptocurrencies are halal comes down to whether they are \u2018M\u0101l\u2019 as we have explained previously. M\u0101l is something that can be acquired, whether it be an item or a service.\n\nThere are three stances on cryptocurrencies today:\n\nCryptocurrency is not M\u0101l, rather it is a speculative, non-Sharia-compliant investment. Cryptocurrency is a digital asset but not a currency. Cryptocurrency is a digital currency.\n\nProponents of view (1) argue that cryptocurrencies are not Sharia-compliant since they have no intrinsic value and are merely entries on a digital ledger.\n\nOur view has always been that (1) does not seem right since cryptocurrencies have value as millions of people are willing to buy, hold, and trade them. They are just as real as fiat currency today which mostly exists in the spreadsheets of banks. Our monetary system became predominantly digital a while ago.\n\nView (2) seems to be the most realistic view, as cryptocurrencies are a new and emerging technology that are yet to mature into fully fledged currencies used by economies at large. However, in practice, there is no real difference for casual users between (2) and (3) since they both consider trading cryptocurrencies to be permissible.\n\nZakat is due on ALGO like any other currency. Zakat will be relatively simple to calculate since it is simply like holding US dollars or Pound Sterling. Read our Zakat on crypto guide for a good explanation.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Pure Proof-of-Stake mechanism is a good innovation which results in higher transaction speeds, lower costs, and better scalability. The question is though, is this enough to foster a developer and consumer community that will be loyal to Algorand to the exclusion of all other, larger blockchain networks that offer similar feature sets?\n\nIf Algorand can\u2019t clearly demonstrate a unique selling point to truly distinguish itself from its bigger competitors, then it\u2019s not clear how much longevity it has in the coming years."

        "content": "BIG Donates $1.5M to the Ocean\n\nBy now, you\u2019ve probably heard of the top crypto presale coin Big Eyes Coin (BIG). If you\u2019ve been living under a rock, or you\u2019re new to crypto, BIG is another adorable meme coin known for presenting competition for some of the already established ones like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. The coin has launched and promised numerous benefits from its 200% bonus launch code, to user governance, to its new loot box. But did you know that BIG also dedicates 5% of all investments to its charity wallet? The coin has pledged to regularly donate to charities that aim to protect aquatic life from pollution and harmful fishing, among others. With $29M raised in investments so far, this accounts for almost $1.5M in donations to protect our oceans! It\u2019s also worth mentioning that in addition to 5% of funding donated to charities that help ocean sanctuaries, they have also given $1000 to ACT International. This is also known as the Luna Charity, which is an organization that supports children who have suffered the impact of different tragic events such as violence, war, and natural disasters.\n\nNew Treaty Enforced With Blockchain Technology\n\nBlockchain technologies like Solana and Ethereum can transcend beyond the realm of finance. These networks can also track illegal fishing and criminal behavior on the high seas. So far, many organizations have fought to enforce an ethical set of principles, but it has been extremely difficult to police them. This is because, on international waters, there are no laws that govern fishermen. After all, it has been nearly impossible to regulate. This means the government has no control over who does and how much they take. They also believe illegal and unregulated fishing accounts for around $23.5 billion a year! So it\u2019s a serious problem.\n\nSome countries have grouped and negotiated specific regulations for sections of high waters, like rules governing tuna fishing in the Pacific or fish stocks in the Atlantic between Greenland and Europe, but experts state that the existing patchwork makes it too hard to manage biodiversity in international waters. Liz Karan, senior manager for the high seas at the Pew Charitable Trusts, a non-profit organization, mentioned that small Pacific island nations suffer the most from this system. She noted that the EEZs of countries like Kiribati, Nauru, and the Solomon Islands leave gaps for large-scale international fishing vessels to come in.\n\nThe solution?\n\nWorld Wide Fund for Pandas, a conservation organization, suggests that the government should mandate fishermen tag fish with a scannable code that is uploaded to a blockchain ledger. This way businesses and customers can confirm the source of any given tuna for sale at a retailer. This transparency will allow consumers to avoid contributing to an ill-gotten catch. It\u2019s possible that blockchain technology can operate as the means to close these governance gaps.\n\nFor More On Presale Token Big Eyes Coin (BIG)\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL"

        "content": "\u201cNot your keys, not your coins\u201d is a phrase that has reverberated around the world of crypto more and more in recent times. While a centralized exchange (CEX) and its order book model can offer a great user experience and convenience, numerous events over the last 12 months have highlighted their faults.\n\nFor your coins to be safe, you need complete control. Decentralized exchanges and their automated market maker (AMM) models may seemingly offer the solution, but these can also be beset with issues including impermanent loss and slippage. D5 Exchange, a new decentralized exchange (DEX), will offer the best of both worlds \u2013 the convenience and user experience of a CEX, but the safety of a DEX.\n\nPowered by Gridex Protocol, the beta version of D5 Exchange will be released in March, providing a secure, seamless, and complete on-chain trading experience. D5 uses Gridex\u2019s proprietary Grid Order Maker Book (GMOB) model to enable the instant trading of ERC20 tokens (more chains will be added in the future).\n\nWithout the need for additional permissions or smart contracts, anyone can further expand upon the protocol. The Grid Price Linear Movement (GPLM) algorithm manages transaction execution and settlement based on the GMOB model. The GPLM aims to use the same amount of resources as the Constant Function Market Maker (CFMM) algorithm in order to lower gas consumption when running on Ethereum.\n\nWith its Maker Orders protocol, users will benefit from a smoother trading experience thanks to the availability of liquidity composed of internal Maker\u2019s trading needs and aggregation of Uniswap V2, V3, and Curve as external liquidity. Additionally, the DEX will offer well-known Ethereum Layer 2 networks like Arbitrum and Optimism for quicker, less expensive transactions.\n\nMain features\n\nTo recap, the main features of D5 Exchange are:\n\nPermissionless listing and incentivized orders\n\nProvides the best rate from multiple liquidities\n\nComplete decentralization, so users are always in control of their assets\n\nNo impermanent loss and no slippage\n\nLow costs and high order fill rate\n\nAt its core, D5 Exchange provides the user experience of a CEX but the decentralization and transparency of a DEX.\n\nAbout D5 Exchange\n\nD5 is the first aggregator combining the power of Order Books and AMMs, providing a revolutionary on-chain trading experience. It is here to shake up the game with its innovative platform that brings user experience, decentralization, and transparency to the forefront. The future of DeFi is here, and D5 Exchange is leading the charge.\n\nTake advantage of this opportunity to join the DeFi revolution and reap the rewards!

        "content": "As the cryptocurrency market continues to grow in popularity, investors are looking for ways to predict the price of its digital assets better.\n\nThe second most valuable cryptocurrency on the market is Ethereum (ETH). With so many variables affecting the price of ETH, it can be difficult for investors to forecast its price accurately. Thus, investors are increasingly turning to artificial intelligence (AI) to help predict the price of cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum for several reasons.\n\nAI seemingly has the ability to analyze vast amounts of data; with so much data available on Ethereum and the cryptocurrency market as a whole, AI can quickly identify chart patterns and trends. In turn, Finbold has gathered projections made by CoinPriceForecast, the finance prediction platform that uses machine self-learning technology, to gauge Ethereum price for the end of 2023.\n\nAccording to the latest long-term forecast, retrieved by Finbold on February 23, Ethereum\u2019s price will climb above $2,000 by the middle of 2023 and hit $2,146 by the end of the year marking a 31% increase from today to the year\u2019s end.\n\nEthereum end of 2023 price prediction. Source: CoinPriceForcast\n\nEthereum technical analysis\n\nAs new data becomes available, AI can incorporate it into its analysis and adjust its predictions accordingly. AI can provide investors with more up-to-date forecasts as further information becomes available.\n\nHowever, technical analysis and the opinions of market analysts who have a sense of the sentiment in the crypto market on a day-to-day basis also need to be weighed in to have an overall view of the the cryptocurrency\u2019s future price outlook.\n\nEthereum\u2019s technical indicators on TradingView\u2018s one-day gauges are bullish, with the summary aligning with the \u2018strong buy\u2019 sentiment at 17 while moving averages are for the \u2018strong buy\u2019 at 14. Oscillators are pointing at \u2018buy\u2019 with 3.\n\nEthereum 1-day gauges.

Most likely, the trend will continue from here.\u201d\n\nLonging Ethereum. Source: Michael van de Poppe\n\nFinally, with Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade on Sepolia set for February 28, investors may see ETH\u2019s price surge sooner rather than later. With the cryptocurrency market continuing to grow and evolve, the use of AI in cryptocurrency investing will likely become even more prevalent.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "Over the past 7 days, Coinbase NFT has recorded crypto trading volumes of less than 5 Ethereum. However, a drop in sales does not discourage the company behind the marketplace, which still considers it a viable project.\n\nCoinbase not discouraged by drop in crypto volumes on its NFT marketplace\n\nAccording to data from Dune Analytics, Coinbase reportedly recorded NFT trading volumes of less than 5 Ethereum (the equivalent of about $7,700) over the past seven days.\n\nThis is a huge drop in Non-Fungible Token sales. Indeed, while there have been only 47 sales on Coinbase NFT in the past 7 days, in June last year, the marketplace had recorded records of more than 1,000 NFT sales in just 24 hours.\n\nIn this regard, Coinbase President and COO Emilie Choi reportedly stated that the company continues to view Coinbase NFT as a viable project. Here are her words in response to questions on the topic from shareholders:\n\n\u201cWe continue to see medium and long-term opportunities here. We\u2019ve got a very lean team on it now, but we\u2019re not throwing in the towel by any means.\u201d\n\nCoinbase NFT and its new goals compared to other marketplaces\n\nChoi\u2019s speech relates to what had already been pre-announced by the platform regarding Coinbase NFT\u2019s goals.\n\nRest assured, our mission for Coinbase NFT hasn\u2019t changed and we remain optimistic about our future as we continue building. We\u2019re excited to find more opportunities to work with with creators in the future. \u2014 Coinbase NFT \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f\ud83d\udcde (@Coinbase_NFT) February 1, 2023\n\nBasically, Coinbase\u2019s Non-Fungible Token platform, instead of competing with current leaders OpenSea and Blur in NFT sales, prefers to redefine its mission and focus on catering to creators.\n\nIndeed, it appears that the suspension of creator drops on the marketplace in early February would serve to let the platform focus on features and tools requested by NFT creators themselves.\n\nSome people seem to like this mission, to the point of preferring Coinbase NFT to OpenSea\n\nIn response to the news that @opensea no longer enforces creator royalties, we have blocked their marketplace and all others that participate in this practice. @Coinbase_NFT will be our preferred marketplace to buy and sell @DeathbatsClub . \ud83d\udc47 \u2014 M. Shadows (@shadows_eth) February 20, 2023\n\nNFT sales for the past seven days of OpenSea and Blur\n\nAs we continue to look at the charts from Dune Analytics, dominating the NFT marketplace scene in sales are OpenSea and Blur.\n\nIndeed, in the last week, Blur recorded NFT trading volumes worth nearly 76.5 ETH (the equivalent of about $127,000). The number of sales actually amounted to only 52.\n\nOpenSea, on the other hand, recorded 304 sales in the last week with an NFT trading volume of nearly 80 ETH (the equivalent of over $133,000).\n\nThis great competition between the two platforms has recently led OpenSea to want to implement 0% fees to win over the user base lost to Blur.\n\nIn contrast to Coinbase, which wants to target creators, both OpenSea and Blur are instead targeting users eager to get higher returns from their NFT investments.\n\nThat is why OpenSea reportedly dropped its 2.5% fee."

        "title": "LayerZero's Testnet Bridge Between Ethereum And Goerli Sparks Community Backlash - Crypto Mode",
        "content": "Developing for the Ethereum ecosystem often involves using one of its testnets. Goerli is, along with Sepolia, a fan favorite. Unfortunately, getting testnet ETH for development purposes can be difficult, although the solution by LayerZero isn\u2019t the best approach either.\n\nMore Liquidity For Goerli Developers\n\nIt is commendable to see a new approach to bring more testnet ETH to Goerli. Unfortunately, while there is a faucet developers can request funds from, it doesn\u2019t have an infinite supply. Pre-PoS, it used to generate coins through mining, but that is no longer the case. Goerli is subject to proof-of-stake rules, making itmore challenging to get testnet currency. Overall, there is a hard limit on available Goerli liquidity, which has become a hindrance.\n\nDevelopers relying on solutions like Blockdaemon can have an account manager send them some funds. Unfortunately, that supply isn\u2019t endless either. Eventually, the funds will run dry unless something changes. Developers already have to wait hours \u2013 if not days \u2013 to claim funds from the default faucet. LayerZero came up with a potential solution, although it meets some criticism.\n\nOne way of bringing more liquidity to the testnet is through a bridge. The testnet bridge lets users convert mainnet Ethereum liquidity into Goerli-based ETH. Moreover, the project has an initial Goerli-ETH price is $0.1, with a seeded pool on Uniswap. Users can convert between ETH and gETH, or ETH to mETH on the Goerli network. That should make it easy to create two-way liquidity and ensure developers don\u2019t have to twiddle their thumbs.\n\nThe Community Isn\u2019t Amused\n\nThe approach by LayerZero solves a pressing issue, but there are many uneasy questions. First, it introduces another ETH-based ticker on Uniswap, which may cause novice users to buy the \u201cwrong Ethereum\u201d. While they can eventually convert gETH to ETH again, they would also pay fees and potential slippage costs. That is not fair, yet it will likely cause issues eventually.\n\nSecond, the community consensus is how Goerli-ETH should be a public good. However, when tying that good to monetized services, things take a very dark turn \u2013 a bridge needs to make money. In addition, some people feel this will drain the faucet even further and prevent developers from using the testnet altogether. The Goerli-ETH supply is already limited, and making it a \u201cpremium feature\u201d through this bridge sends the wrong signal.\n\nPublic good? This is gonna drain faucets and restrain developers from using the testnet\u2026 What\u2019s going on @PatrickAlphaC @austingriffith ? \u2014 lulox.eth \ud83d\udc31 \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddf7 (@LuloxEth) February 22, 2023\n\nFurthermore, the liquidity on Goerli today could be used as liquidity for the Uniswap pool. That further strains the circulating supply and creates monetary incentives that shouldn\u2019t even exist. People now have an extra reason to hoard an already scarce asset and convert it to Ether to the highest bidder. That will have long-term consequences for Goerli-ETH."
