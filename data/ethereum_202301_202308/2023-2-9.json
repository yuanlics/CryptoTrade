        "title": "Ethereum price risks 20% correction amid SEC's crackdown on crypto staking - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s native token, Ether (ETH), saw its worst daily performance of the year as the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) stopped Kraken, a cryptocurrency exchange, from offering crypto staking services.\n\nOn Feb. 9, Kraken agreed to pay $30 million to settle the SEC\u2019s allegation that it broke securities rules by offering crypto staking services to U.S. retail investors.\n\nIn particular, the news pushed down the prices of many proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain project tokens. Ethereum, which switched to a staking-based protocol in September 2022, also suffered.\n\nOn Feb. 9, ETH\u2019s price plunged nearly 6.5% to around $1,525, the largest single-day decline since Dec. 16 of last year.\n\nETH/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView.com\n\nWill Ethereum staking survive the SEC crackdown?\n\nThe SEC's crackdown on crypto staking begins as Ethereum awaits the release of its key network upgrade, dubbed Shanghai, in March.\n\nThe update will finally allow Ether validators \u2014 entities that have locked approximately $25.6 billion worth of ETH tokens in Ethereum\u2019s PoS smart contract \u2014 to withdraw their assets alongside yield rewards.\n\nAs a result, multiple analysts, including Bitwise Asset Management\u2019s chief investment officer, Matt Hougan, consider Shanghai a bullish event for Ether.\n\n\u201cToday, many investors who would like to stake ETH and earn yield are sitting on the sidelines. After all, most investment strategies can\u2019t tolerate an indefinite lock-up,\u201d wrote Hougan in his letter to investors in January, adding:\n\n\u201cSo, most investors stay out of the market. But once that indefinite lock-up is removed, the percentage of investors willing to stake their ETH will explode.\u201c\n\nBut doubts have been emerging about the future of crypto staking in the U.S., with Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase crypto exchange, fearing that the SEC would ban staking for retail investors in the future.\n\n1/ We're hearing rumors that the SEC would like to get rid of crypto staking in the U.S. for retail customers. I hope that's not the case as I believe it would be a terrible path for the U.S. if that was allowed to happen. \u2014 Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) February 8, 2023\n\nMoreover, some analysts argue that banning Ether-staking services will force users to move away from Ethereum.\n\nNotably, Ethereum requires stakers to deposit 32 ETH (~$50,000) into its PoS smart contract to be a validator. As a result, retail investors often use third-party staking services that pool smaller amounts of ETH to enable validator status.\n\n\u201cIf the SEC bans crypto staking for the public, then a majority of Ethereum validators will have to come down,\u201d argues independent analyst Ripple Van Winkle, adding:\n\n\u201cBecause you need 32 ETH to stake. Which means the ETH network is going to experience issues.\u201c\n\nETH price sees bearish rejection\n\nFrom a technical perspective, Ether price is positioned for a potential 20% price correction in February.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin price hits 2-week low amid warning $22.5K loss means fresh dip\n\nNotably, on the daily chart, ETH price has been undergoing a pullback move after testing its multimonth descending trendline as resistance. It now holds the 200-day exponential moving average (200-day EMA; the blue wave) near $1,525 as support.\n\nETH/USD daily price chart.

Such a scenario includes the next downside target at $1,200, which coincides with a multimonth ascending trendline support.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Ethereum Mining: Understanding The Second Largest Cryptocurrency - Simplilearn",
        "content": "According to MarketCap, Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency, with a current value of $2,921.50. Recently, Bitmain, a company that manufactures ASIC chips for crypto-mining, has announced a release of an Application Specific Circuit(ASIC) miner for Ethereum Mining. Thus, indicating to its developers that the Ethereum Mining Industry is going to be doubling down at Proof-of-Work only.\n\nTill today almost 115,708,027 Ethereum has been mined with a trading volume of $29,107,123,138.\n\nIf you are interested in Ethereum and Ethereum Mining, then you are in the right place.\n\nIn this Ethereum Mining tutorial, you will look into the various concepts and components around Ethereum Mining.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nIntroduction to Ethereum\n\nEthereum is defined as a blockchain-based computing platform that enables its developers to build and deploy decentralized applications.\n\nEther is the cryptocurrency for Ethereum, which is used to build decentralized applications, smart contracts, and make standard peer-to-peer payments.\n\nEther acts as fuel for the Ethereum Network. It tracks and facilitates all the transactions in the network.\n\nEthereum Coin\n\nFeatures of Ethereum\n\nNow, have a look at the features of Ethereum that make it so different from other cryptocurrencies.\n\nEthereum ensures all the transactions in the Ethereum blockchain are cryptographically more secure.\n\nAll transactions performed under the Ethereum blockchain are immutable. That is, once the data is written and stored, it cannot change. This makes it more difficult to hack or manipulate.\n\nEthereum has the largest developer community globally, which gives it a tremendous advantage over other protocols.\n\nYou can instantly connect the applications built on Ethereum to hundreds of different protocols like finance and marketing, known as money legos.\n\nWhat is Ethereum Mining?\n\nIn simple words, Ethereum Mining is a process of creating and adding a block of transactions to the blockchain network of Ethereum.\n\nCurrently, it uses the Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism.\n\nAll transactions taking place in the Ethereum network need to get approved by the miners.\n\nMiners use a Hashing Scrypt (Ethash) to solve computationally hard puzzles for successfully mining the blocks of transactions, in the Ethereum Blockchain Network.\n\nThis process helps secure the network from attacks like hacking or manipulation of identity.\n\nEthereum Mining\n\nWhy Should You Mine Ethereum?\n\nThe primary goal for mining Ethereum is to make money.\n\nIt turns the act of securing the network into a relatively complex, but profitable business.\n\nMiners receive a certain amount as a reward for mining each block of the Ethereum Blockchain Network, including the transaction fees paid by the users.\n\nTypes of Ethereum Mining\n\nThere are three ways of performing Ethereum Mining :\n\nPool Mining\n\nSolo Mining\n\nCloud Mining\n\nPool Mining\n\nPool Mining is the easiest and fastest way to get started with Ethereum Mining.\n\nAlong with other people, you work together in a single pool. And if someone gets the hashcode correctly, they share the reward among everyone in the Pool.\n\nImportant Factors that you should consider before joining a Pool are:\n\nPool size\n\n\n\nMinimum Payout\n\n\n\nPool fee\n\nPool size is the factor that determines the number of blocks you find in the Ethereum network and its share rewards. As the number of miners increases, the chances to get rewards also increase.\n\nHowever, the more people, the smaller your share in the reward.\n\nMinimum Payout is the minimum amount of Ethereum you need to mine before it gets credited to your wallet.\n\nPools with large Minimum Payouts are not beneficial as you will have to wait in the same pool for a longer period before getting your reward.\n\nTherefore, pools with small Minimum Payouts are considered to be a safer option. You will get paid frequently without committing your time to a single Pool for too long.\n\nEvery pool has a certain amount of Pool fee associated with it. It is the amount you need to pay to continue using the pool. This amount is percentage-based, on the amount of Ethereum you are mining. It mainly varies between 1% to 3%.\n\nNote: It would help more if you went for Pool Mining because you might get a smaller reward, but you will not have to wait for days or weeks to get no reward.\n\nSolo Mining\n\nIn Ethereum Solo Mining, you will get rewarded only if you solve the puzzle and mine the Ethereum block first.\n\nNote: Here, since you are competing with many people and companies, you have to be very good at your work.\n\nSolo Mining is only profitable when you have plenty of resources with you, like a 100+ Graphics Card. But it has its disadvantages like:\n\nElectricity costs - Having so much equipment and other electrical devices like fans and lights may use a lot of electricity, leading to high electricity bills.\n\nSpace - Space is a real problem because not everyone has a considerable amount of area to set up all the resources and equipment needed for mining Ethereum.\n\nCloud Mining\n\nIn Ethereum Cloud Mining, you pay someone else with the equipment to mine Ethereum for you. You pay some amount of money as fees to them for investing their time and resources, and in return, they provide you with the reward they gain by mining Ethereum.\n\nBut this technique of mining Ethereum has some pros and cons too.\n\nPros\n\nYou are not responsible for any equipment damage.\n\nYou don't have to acquire all the necessary equipment and look for ample space to store it. You can sit back, observe the market and enjoy the reward for your investment in Ethereum Mining.\n\nCons\n\nIf the Ethereum price drops, then there is no way you are getting your money back. The money you invested, or the fees you paid to the miner, is lost.\n\nYou can't ask the other person to change their equipment according to your concern.\n\nEthereum Cloud Mining is considered a safer way for mining service providers to guarantee a profit for the resources they have purchased.\n\nHow Does the Mining Process Work?\n\nEthereum Mining follows a specific set of steps to function.\n\nA user requests a transaction with the help of the private key of his digital wallet account. Then the request is shared worldwide with the Ethereum network. Next, the requested transaction is added to a list of pending transactions that need to be added to the Ethereum blockchain network. The miner then verifies and validates the requested transaction and performs a complex mathematical puzzle on the transaction data. Once the requested transaction is verified and it stores a copy of it in EVM, the process of \"Proof-of-Work\" begins for the respective block. Then, the nodes of the Ethereum Network verify that the checksum of the state of the miner's block matches the checksum of their updated state of EVM after execution of all transactions. Only after that, the block is added to the Ethereum Blockchain Network. On successfully mining the block, it rewards the miner with some amount of Ether in their wallet. Then the requested transaction is approved and credited to the respective wallet/wallets.\n\nEach transaction is mined only once, but every participant of the Ethereum Network verifies it.\n\nHow to Mine Ethereum?\n\nTools you will need to be an efficient miner for Ethereum on your personal computer are :\n\nAn Ethereum wallet to store all your currency earned.\n\nGPU drivers or Graphics Card with a minimum of 3GB RAM.\n\nA mining software suitable according to your hardware like GPU.\n\nAnd a compatible operating system (Windows 7 or 10, 64 bit).\n\nCreate an Ethereum Wallet\n\nBefore getting started with mining Ethereum, you need to create an Ethereum Wallet to store all your Ether.\n\nTrezor Model T and Ledger Nano are the most reliable and secure wallets in the market of cryptocurrency.\n\nInstalling Your GPU drivers or Graphics Card\n\nAfter creating your digital wallet, you need to update all the hardware, i.e., drives in your system.\n\nYou can use two types of Graphics Cards, they are :\n\nAMD Graphics Card\n\nNvidia Graphics Card\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nInstalling Software for Mining Ethereum\n\nClaymore is considered the best software for mining Ethereum on GPU drives.\n\n1. Download the latest version of Claymore dual miner for your operating system. The latest version is Claymore11.0.\n\n2. Click on the latest version for Windows and download the zip file.\n\n3. Extract the files of Claymore v11.0 to a folder on your desktop for easy access.\n\n4. Open the folder to have a look at the files.\n\n5. Right-click on start and then on the edit option.\n\n6. Edit the Start.txt file and add these lines :\n\nsetx GPU_FORCE_64BIT_PTR 0\n\nsetx GPU_MAX_HEAP_SIZE 100\n\nsetx GPU_USE_SYNC_OBJECTS 1\n\nsetx GPU_MAX_ALLOC_PERCENT 100\n\nsetx GPU_SINGLE_ALLOC_PERCENT 100\n\nEthDcrMiner64.exe -epool -ewal -epsw x\n\n7. Choose your desired pool from these recommendations:\n\n\n\nPool Name\n\nPool Fee\n\nMinimum Payout (ETH)\n\nPool Address\n\nPool Size 2Miners 1.0% 0.01 eth.2miners.com:2020 Small Nanopool 1.0% 0.05 eth-eu1.nanopool.org:9999 Very Big Dwarfpool 1.0% 0.05 eth-eu.dwarfpool.com:8008 Medium Ethermine 1.0% 0.05 eu1.ethermine.org:4444 Very Big\n\nYou can find better search results than these according to your region.\n\n8. Type in your pool address instead of <Mining Pool Address>.\n\n9. Save your Start.txt file with your new updates.\n\nP.S. - While saving, select type as \u201cAll Files.\u201d\n\n10. Once you save, click on the Start.bat file, to begin mining Ethereum.\n\nWill the Proof-of-Stake Transition Kill Ethereum Mining?\n\nThe newly introduced concept of Ethereum 2.0 roadmaps plans to upgrade to Proof-of-Stake, a consensus algorithm in which it will provide all existing miners of Ethereum Network with a limited time to earn a return for their investment.\n\nIt is expected to be launched by the end of 2021 or the starting of 2022. It was supposed to be launched by October 2020, but the history of delays regarding this upgrade is worth talking about.\n\nNobody truly knows when Ethereum 2.0 will be completed and introduced to the Crypto-mining world.\n\nTherefore, Proof-of-Work mining is likely to be functional till 2022.\n\nProof-of-Stake\n\nIs Mining Ethereum Profitable?\n\nThe profit of any crypto-mining majorly depends on the cost of electricity in that particular area.\n\nAs a rule, anything below $0.12 per kilowatt consumed in an hour is considered profitable.\n\nYou can mine Ether and turn it into a vital source of income by analyzing these figures like hashrate of Ethereum, block reward, no. of blocks per day, and the coin price of Ethereum.\n\nYou can use an Ethereum Calculator to figure out your daily revenue basing it on these factors.\n\nEthereum Calculator\n\nOr you can use this formula too.\n\nDaily Revenue = (your hashrate * block reward *blocks in a day * coin price) / Total hashrate\n\nThe predictions are made that the ETH price can rise and become more stable in the coming few years. So, it is an excellent opportunity to invest in and save in Ethereum.\n\nHone all the technical and functional skills to build a Blockchain application using the latest tools and technologies.

The tech investor may have now changed his mind somewhat, but is still heavy on the industry as a whole.\n\nHe told Reason Magazine in an interview published Wednesday that, back then, he thought Bitcoin was a tech innovation that would develop to support several other applications just like the internet, but that it \u201cbasically stopped evolving.\u201d He now has his sights set on Ethereum being at the core of transformation.\n\n\u201cWhat happened was a bunch of other projects emerged and took that place, and the big one right now is Ethereum.

It promises to bring increased liquidity to the leading altcoin by unlocking ETH staked in the Beacon Chain. The expected release date for the Shanghai update is March 2023, marking the end of the Merge era.\n\nWhile the crypto community has some concerns about the potential selling pressure that could result from the update, it is important to note that the ETH release will occur gradually through a queue, potentially reducing the impact on the market.\n\nThe launch of the Beacon Chain enabled stakeholders to validate blocks and secure the ETH network while maintaining the predictability of security during The Merge, the biggest update on the cryptocurrency market in 2022.\n\nIn addition to the Q1 hard fork, the ETH network will also undergo two major upgrades later in 2023. These updates will further enhance the leading altcoin's position on the market.\n\nThe Surge\n\nEthereum creator Vitalik Buterin has stated that the primary focus of the upcoming update is to address the scalability challenges faced by the smart contract platform. The update will accomplish this by fragmenting the ETH database, enabling the network to scale while maintaining its decentralization.\n\nTo achieve this, the ETH network's information will be split horizontally, allowing it to distribute the load and reduce storage costs and hardware requirements. It is important to note that this update will not immediately result in a scalable Ethereum blockchain. Instead, EIP 4844 will create a separate blockchain for Layer 2, which will aid scalability solutions such as Arbitrum and Optimism in lowering their transaction fees and becoming truly competitive with other ETH competitors with lower transfer fees.\n\nEOF\n\nThe upcoming EOF (EVM Object Format) update will bring improvements to Ethereum's code execution environment, making the cryptocurrency platform more efficient and streamlining the process of creating smart contracts. EOF will also facilitate updates to the EVM and create a system to track resource usage of new contracts.\n\nThese upgrades bring Ethereum closer to its goal of becoming a large, decentralized computer that supports dApps with a user-friendly interface, low fees and a secure network for daily transactions.\n\nIt is important to note that updates in the cryptocurrency world are made through proposed improvements that are subject to change at any time."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThere\u2019s a lot at stake in how Kraken\u2019s settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission plays out for the crypto industry.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, the SEC announced that crypto exchange Kraken agreed to pay a $30 million fine for not registering the offering and sale of its crypto asset staking-as-a-service program. Just a day before, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong warned on Twitter that he\u2019d heard \u201cthe SEC would like to get rid of crypto staking in the U.S. for retail customers.\u201d\n\nOn its face, it sounds like something that should have been bad for all crypto staking services. But that\u2019s not quite how the news landed. The governance tokens for Lido and Rocket Pool, two of the largest pooled staking services, soared as high as 11% in the past day, according to CoinGecko.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s a sign that the market thinks centralized exchanges acting as staking intermediaries, like Kraken and Coinbase, should worry, but not the rest of the industry. In the past day, Coinbase Wrapped Staked ETH (cbETH) selling volume has outpaced buying at a ratio of almost 3:1, according to GeckoTerminal.\n\nStaked assets on proof-of-stake networks, like Ethereum, help keep networks running. They\u2019re how validators, whose hardware stores data and processes new transactions, prove they have skin in the game. Validators receive rewards for participating on networks, but can lose some of their staked assets for inactivity or other offenses.\n\nBecoming a standalone Ethereum validator, which is now the largest proof of stake network, isn\u2019t easy for most retail-level investors. A user would need 32 ETH, worth roughly $48,000 at current prices, to do it. Instead, users with more modest amounts of ETH to stake turn to staking-as-a-service and pooled staking providers.\n\nThose come in two different flavors: straightforward and liquid staking. The latter is meant to give users the best of both worlds: They get a share of validator rewards for their deposited ETH and a token, redeemable for their staked assets, that can be traded or used as collateral.\n\nAs a category, the 65 liquid-staking protocols tracked by DeFi Llama account for $12 billion, or 26%, of the $47 billion worth of assets in the DeFi ecosystem. That means they\u2019re the third-largest category behind $13 billion in lending, and $19 billion on decentralized exchanges, or DEXes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMore than $11 billion worth of the assets in liquid-staking protocols is Ethereum. And among the 16 protocols that support ETH staking, Lido is far and away the largest. It accounts for $8 billion, or 75%, of the funds that have been deposited.\n\nIt seems at least part of the problem the SEC had with Kraken\u2019s program was an oversimplification of staking to make it less intimidating for retail customers. A section of the SEC\u2019s complaint takes issue with the fact that Kraken itself determined the returns that its customers would receive, as opposed to the variable rate of rewards determined by the protocol.\n\n\u201cDefendants determine these returns, not the underlying blockchain protocols, and the returns are not necessarily dependent on the actual returns that Kraken receives from staking,\u201d the commission wrote.\n\nBy doing so, Kraken made itself too much of an intermediary, Alex Mogul, senior director of staking and infrastructure at Republic Crypto, told Decrypt.\n\n\u201cWhen you're depositing to Kraken and then Kraken handles the math, that\u2019s far and away easier than trying to switch the network that you're engaging with, then press transact to delegate stake. It is really complicated,\u201d she said.\n\nFor its part, Coinbase has said its staking program is not like Kraken\u2019s.\n\n\u201cStaking on Coinbase continues to be available and staked assets continue to earn protocol rewards. What\u2019s clear from today\u2019s announcement is that Kraken was essentially offering a yield product,\u201d Paul Grewal, Coinbase\u2019s chief legal officer, said in a statement yesterday. \u201cCoinbase\u2019s staking services are fundamentally different and are not securities. For example, our customers\u2019 rewards depend on the rewards paid by the protocol, and commissions we disclose.\u201d\n\nMogul, who leads the Runtime staking-as-a-service offering at Republic Crypto, said she hopes to see software, like better designed wallets, fill the gap that might now be left by centralized exchanges in staking options.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI still think we can build software products that abstract that complexity without sacrificing who's in custody of the assets,\u201d she said.\n\nOn the other end of the investor spectrum, Jaydeep Korde, Launchnodes co-Founder and CEO, said the Kraken settlement will push business towards decentralized alternatives.\n\nHis company offers non-custodial staking solutions for institutions or high-net-worth individuals who have the 32 ETH required to run their own node, but don\u2019t want to handle the tech on their own. The user owns the infrastructure used to operate a validator, but Launchnodes handles all the upkeep.\n\n\u201cBy running your staking operations on infrastructure you own, it avoids needing to trust compliant, regulated or non-regulated crypto businesses that are seemingly ever bigger governance and operational holes,\u201d he told Decrypt in an email."

        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is said to be considering a ban on crypto-staking services. In response, Charles Hoskinson of Cardano voiced his opinion on the subject, training his eyes on Ethereum, whose staking model he said is problematic.\n\nHoskinson: The locked stakes are a red flag\n\nAccording to Hoskinson, the fact that ethereum coins are locked in staking smart contracts that are completely inaccessible gives the impression that they are controlled goods.\n\nHoskinson asserts that staking ethereum also presents many challenges. The temporary transfer of one\u2019s assets to another party in exchange for compensation from that party resembles the sale of a regulated financial product. Charles believes cutting and bonding could be more effective instead of this system.\n\nIn the response tweet to Armstrong\u2019s first article, he further explained that non-custodial liquid staking is analogous to the mining pools that the bitcoin community has been using for the last 13 years.\n\nEthereum staking is problematic. Temporarily giving up your assets to someone else to have them get a return looks a lot like regulated products. Slashing and bonds not so good. Non-custodial liquid staking on the other hand is like the mining pools we've used for 13 years \u2014 Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) February 9, 2023\n\nAccording to the head of Cardano, his team tackled the issue of staking on the protocol to a model mostly governed by the community rather than a select group of users.\n\nShibetoshi, the doge founder, another renowned crypto personnel who remarked on Armstrong\u2019s thread, seemed somehow unsupportive of the ban and wondered why the government would let slip such a taxation opportunity bringing more weight and questions into the SEC\u2019s alleged move.\n\nwhy don\u2019t they want more easy tax money\n\n\n\nthe government is so weird \u2014 Shibetoshi Nakamoto (@BillyM2k) February 9, 2023\n\nWhat could this mean to the ecosystem?\n\nEven if the information is still considered a rumor, many involved in the business are noticeably getting ready for a real ban to be imposed by the market regulator.\n\nAccording to Hoskinson, the \u201cbasic misunderstanding about the real facts of operation and design\u201d will cause the SEC to classify all staking products under the same umbrella even though they each have unique characteristics.\n\nHe added that although most staking protocols have opted to construct centralized rather than decentralized systems, it is a move that will ultimately be detrimental to the industry.\n\nThe SEC has been given the authority to regulate cryptocurrencies pending a change in the regulatory landscape in the United States. As a result, the commission has initiated several enforcement actions against many companies, including Ripple Labs Inc. and LBRY.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

The Commission\u2019s chairman Gary Gensler previously said crypto exchanges offering staking services offer services similar to lending even if there are changes in the labeling.\n\nThe comment generated several heated responses from the crypto community over the Commission\u2019s understanding of crypto staking.

        "title": "6 best cross-chain bridges in 2023 - TechTarget",
        "content": "As the demand for different blockchain-based Web 3.0 technologies continues to grow, so too does the need to enable interoperability. This is something that is enabled with cross-chain bridge services.\n\nBlockchain is a distributed ledger technology that uses cryptography to provide assurance and integrity to data and transactions. Blockchain networks enable many types of services, including secured databases, immutable ledgers, decentralized applications (dApps), decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and cryptocurrencies.\n\nThere are many blockchain networks and cryptocurrencies that use different blockchain technologies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Avalanche, Polygon, Solana and Arbitrum. Enabling interoperability and exchange across different blockchain networks is an area where cross-chain bridges -- sometimes also referred to as blockchain bridges -- play an increasingly important role.\n\nWhat is a cross-chain bridge? A cross-chain bridge enables an exchange of information, cryptocurrency or NFTs from one blockchain network to another. It enables the flow of data and tokens across what would otherwise be siloed sets of data on different blockchains. With fiat currency there are many established ways for individuals and businesses to exchange money, creating a globally available and interoperable system of financial payments. Those systems include financial institutions, banks and credit cards that handle foreign exchange. In the world of blockchains, a cross-chain bridge serves an analogous purpose. Exchange across different blockchains for cryptocurrency is possible without a cross-chain bridge, but it is expensive and more time-consuming. Without the use of a cross-chain bridge, users must first convert a cryptocurrency token into a fiat currency, which often involves fees. They then use currency to get the other desired type of cryptocurrency, incurring more fees and taking time. One characteristic of a cross-chain bridge is that it enables users to exchange one cryptocurrency for another without first changing it to fiat currency. Cross-chain bridges aren't limited to just cryptocurrency value transfer either. An effective cross-chain bridge can also enable the transfer of smart contracts and NFTs from one blockchain environment to another. There are several approaches to enabling transfers with a cross-chain bridge. One common approach is using a wrapped token issued by the cross-chain bridge provider platform. With a wrapped token, the value of one token from a specific blockchain network can be encapsulated inside another token. Wrapped tokens are typically based on the ERC-20 technical specification for an Ethereum network. For example, WBTC is a Bitcoin token wrapped with an ERC-20 Ethereum smart contract. Another approach to enabling cross-chain bridge transfers is by using a liquidity pool. With a liquidity pool, a cross-chain bridge provider holds inventory -- or pools -- of various coins where one can be exchanged for another. Cross-chain bridges can also be a lucrative target for hackers. One of the largest attacks occurred in February 2022, when cross-chain bridge platform Wormhole was the victim of an attack in which the threat actor stole 120,000 wrapped Ethereum tokens -- worth an estimated $320 million at the time of the theft. BNB Chain, also known as Binance Smart Chain, was the victim of an attack in October 2022 that resulted in losses estimated at $570 million. Blockchain bridge analysis vendor Chainalyis has estimated that 69% of cryptocurrency funds stolen in 2022 have been attributed to attacks on cross-chain bridges.

        "content": "The world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum (ETH) has been showing great strength during this market recovery. Since the beginning of 2023, ETH has been up by more than 40% and is currently within a strong demand zone.\n\nAs of press time, ETH is trading 2.9% down at a price of $1627 and a market cap of $199 billion. The recent activity shows that $1600 could serve as strong support for ETH going ahead. Citing data from IntoTheBlock, popular crypto market analyst Ali Martinez reported:\n\nadvertisement\n\nNote that the $1,600-$1,650 level represents a significant area of support for #Ethereum. Onchain data shows that 1.94 million addresses purchased 8 million $ETH between $1,600 \u2013 $1,650. As long as this important demand wall holds, #ETH has a good chance of advancing further.\n\nETH has been currently facing strong resistance at $1,700. However, any breakout above these levels could help in pushing the ETH rally further.\n\nEthereum On-Chain User Activity Jumps\n\nAs per a data report from Analytex, user activity on the Ethereum platform surged significantly in the last month of January 2023. This has ultimately translated into the surge of average gas prices on the Ethereum blockchain network.\n\nCalculated in gwei, the smallest Ethereum denomination, the average gas price jumped by 29.27% in January 2023, in comparison to its previous month. The report also adds that the average number of unique Ethereum active wallets per day dropped by 10% to 387,475.\n\nFurthermore, there\u2019s a drop in the daily Ethereum transaction data by 0.8% from December to January. The average ETH transactions per day have been on a decline for eight months now.\n\nThe recent surge in user activity on Ethereum could also be due to an uptick in the DeFi activity recently. The total value locked (TVL) across different decentralized finance protocols surged during the last month of January 2023.\n\nThe upcoming Ethereum Shanghai hardfork is also driving staking in DeFi due to the expected opening of withdrawals from the Ethereum staking contracts in March 2023. It will be interesting to see if ETH can surge to $2,000 by the time of the Shanghai hardfork."

        "title": "What Is Proof of Work (PoW) in Blockchain? - Bitcoin - Investopedia",
        "content": "What Is Proof of Work (PoW)?\n\nProof of work (PoW) describes a consensus mechanism that requires a significant amount of computing effort from a network of devices. The concept was adapted digital tokens by Hal Finney in 2004 through the idea of \"reusable proof of work\" using the 160-bit secure hash algorithm 1 (SHA-1).\n\nFollowing its introduction in 2009, Bitcoin became the first widely adopted application of Finney's PoW idea (Finney was also the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction). Proof of work forms the basis of many other cryptocurrencies, allowing for secure consensus.\n\nKey Takeaways Proof of work (PoW) is a decentralized consensus mechanism that requires network members to expend effort in solving an encrypted hexadecimal number.\n\nProof of work is also called mining, in reference to receiving a reward for work done.\n\nProof of work allows for secure peer-to-peer transaction processing without needing a trusted third party.\n\nProof of work at scale requires vast amounts of energy, which only increases as more miners join the network.\n\nUnderstanding Proof of Work\n\nThis explanation will focus on proof of work as it functions in the Bitcoin network. Commonly called a cryptocurrency, Bitcoin is technically a token\u2014a representation of ownership of value on the Bitcoin blockchain. The ownership of the token can be exchanged for something of equal value, much like how you hand someone a dollar for a candy bar\u2014they now have the dollar and you have the candy bar.\n\nProof of Work Blockchains\n\nBlockchains are distributed ledgers that record all bitcoin transactions, similarly to how you would enter transactions in a spreadsheet. Each block is similar to a cell. Information such as transaction amounts, wallet addresses, time, and date are recorded and encrypted into a block header\u2014a hexadecimal number created through the blockchain's hashing function.\n\nThe hash from each block is used in the block that follows it when its hash is created. This creates a ledger of chained blocks that cannot be altered because the information from every block is included in the newest block's hash.\n\nHashes\n\nWhen a block is closed, the hash must be verified before a new block can be opened. This is where proof of work comes in. The hash is a 64-digit encrypted hexadecimal number. With modern technology, a hash can be generated in milliseconds for a large amount of data. However, miners try to guess that hash, which takes a very long time in computing terms.\n\nMining is the process of validating transactions by solving the hash and receiving a reward.\n\nNonce\n\nThe hash includes a series of numbers called the nonce, short for \"number used once.\" When a miner\u2014the program on a node that works to solve the hash\u2014begins mining, it generates a hash from publicly available information using a nonce equal to zero.\n\nSolving the Hash\n\nIf the hash is lower than the current network target, the miner has successfully solved the hash. The network target is a mathematical result of a formula converted to a hexadecimal number that dictates the mining difficulty.\n\nIf the hash is greater than the target, the mining program adds a value of 1 to the nonce and generates a hash again. The entire network of miners tries to solve the hash this way. On the Bitcoin blockchain, the miner that solves the hash is given the current reward for the work done.\n\nProof of Work vs. Proof of Stake\n\nThe two most popular consensus mechanisms are proof of work and proof of stake. Bitcoin's top competitor Ethereum used proof of work on its blockchain until September 2022, when the highly-anticipated transition to proof of stake was made. Here are some of the key differences between the two.\n\nProof of Work Validation is done by a network of miners\n\nBitcoin paid as a reward and for transaction fees\n\nCompetitive nature uses lots of energy and computational power Proof of Stake Validation is done by participants who offer ether as collateral\n\nEther is paid for transaction fees only\n\nLess computational power and energy used\n\nSpecial Considerations\n\nMining is a competitive process, so it has become a race between those with the most computational power. So, miners join pools to increase their chances of receiving a reward because it takes an enormous amount of computing work to be competitive.\n\nOn Feb. 9, 2023, the mining pool FoundryUSA accounted for nearly 32% of the Bitcoin network's three-day hashrate\u2014the number of hashes a network can perform per second. FoundryUSA hashed 89.81 exa hashes per second (EH/s)\u2014the pool generated nearly 90 quintillion (90 x 1018) hashes per second.\n\nSingle or individual PoW miners are not able to compete with pools for rewards.\n\nProof of work is also known for its energy consumption. The University of Cambridge tracks the Bitcoin network energy demand and uses a \"best guess estimate\" to determine its usage. The network uses as much energy as some small countries; however, it's important to note that industrial data networks and data centers use far more energy than the Bitcoin network.\n\nProof of work is also a much slower validation method than other mechanisms. For example, more transactions are taking place than the Bitcoin network can handle. Transactions are stored in a mempool waiting for validation, with average confirmation times between Jan. 1 and Feb. 9, 2023, ranged from seven to 91 minutes (confirmation is when your transaction is confirmed). Bitcoin keeps its block times at an average of 10 minutes\u2014compare this with block times on the Ethereum PoS network, which have averaged 12 seconds since September 2022.\n\nExample of Proof of Work\n\nProof of work requires a computer to randomly engage in hashing functions until it arrives at an output with the correct minimum amount of leading zeroes. For example, the hash for block #775,771, mined on Feb. 9, 2023, is:\n\n00000000000000000003aa2696b1b7248db53a5a7f72d1fd98916c761e954354\n\nThe block reward for that successful hash was 6.25 BTC and 0.1360 BTC in fees.\n\nThe nonce was 2,881,347,934, there were 1,519 transactions in the block, and the total value of the block was 1,665.9645 BTC. Remembering that a hash is generated and the nonce starts at zero, this block was hashed by a miner 2.8 billion times before reaching a number less than the target.\n\nWhat Does Proof of Work Mean? PoW requires nodes on a network to provide evidence that they have expended computational power (i.e., work) to achieve consensus in a decentralized manner and to prevent bad actors from overtaking the network.\n\nWhy Do Cryptocurrencies Need Proof of Work? Because they are decentralized and peer-to-peer by design, blockchains such as cryptocurrency networks require some way of achieving both consensus and security. Proof of work is one method that makes it too resource-intensive to overtake the network. Other proof mechanisms also exist that are less resource-intensive. Without a proof mechanism, the network and the data stored within it would be vulnerable to attack or theft.\n\nDoes Bitcoin Use Proof of Work? Yes. It uses a PoW algorithm based on the SHA-256 hashing function to validate and confirm transactions and issue new bitcoins.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nProof of work is a consensus mechanism used by many cryptocurrencies to validate transactions on their blockchains and award tokens for participating in the network. Proof of work is a competitive process that uses publicly available transaction information to attempt to generate a hexadecimal number less than the network target for that mining period. Under PoW consensus, thousands of mining programs work on one block until the hash is solved, then move to the next block.\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies and other Initial Coin Offerings (\u201cICOs\u201d) is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or other ICOs.

        "title": "Ethereum Instead of Bitcoin, says Marc Andreessen - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Marc Andreessen \u2013 founding partner of the tech-focused VC giant Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) \u2013 is now more bullish on Ethereum and Web 3 than he is on Bitcoin, contrary to his outlook in 2014.\n\nDuring an interview with ReasonTV published on Wednesday, the venture capitalist discussed the future of crypto adoption and regulation, alongside the role of Bitcoin as money.\n\nCrypto, Not Bitcoin\n\nAccording to Andreessen, crypto and Web3 represent \u201cthe other half of the internet,\u201d containing all of the functions people wanted the internet to have until now. This includes the ability to do business across the world on a financial layer of trust, in the form of blockchain technology.\n\nUsing that layer of trust, a host of financial assets can be represented: money, claims of ownership, house titles, car titles, assurance contracts, loans, internet art, and more.\n\n\u201cYou can build on top of the untrusted internet all of the capabilities you would need to have a full economy,\u201d Andreessen explained. \u201cThat\u2019s a giant idea \u2013 the potential there is extraordinarily high.\u201d\n\nSuch ideas aren\u2019t entirely new, coming from the entrepreneur. In a Washington Post article published in 2014, he predicted a new generation of the internet with wide-ranging applications forming on a platform of \u201cdistributed trust.\u201d At the time, he thought that specific platform would be Bitcoin \u2013 but now believes the premiere network has \u201cstalled out\u201d and \u201cstopped evolving.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I wrote that thing today, I would either say its Ethereum instead of Bitcoin, or I would just say crypto or Web3 instead of Bitcoin,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Ethereum currently has the most active fee marketplace, stemming from its active DeFi and NFT economy. It also has more active developers than Bitcoin, which BitMEX Research credits to its more flexible programming language and welcoming culture for use cases besides just money.\n\nIn a16z\u2019s 2022 State of Crypto Report, the firm outlined how certain web 3 platforms do a beet job of rewarding their creators that legacy web 2 giants like Facebook. Notably, the document contained no mention of the word \u201cBitcoin.\u201d\n\nThough unimpressed by Bitcoin\u2019s number of features, Andreessen believes Bitcoin can help increase economic freedom throughout the world as a form of money. Unlike some critics, he acknowledges that money can take various forms, so long as it\u2019s a tool used for trade.\n\nBanning Bitcoin, he added, is likely impossible. \u201cThe source code for it is available for free,\u201d he said. \u201cFor a government to ban Bitcoin, they\u2019re literally putting themselves in a position where they\u2019re banning math.\u201d\n\nCritics of A16z\n\nIn late 2021, Twitter co-founder and Bitcoin believer Jack Dorsey made an enemy of Andreessen, who blocked Dorsey on Twitter after being criticized for secretly owning the Web3 ecosystem. Dorsey has even mocked Web3 and its related VCs by launching his own decentralized identity application on Bitcoin, called \u201cWeb 5.\u201d\n\nA16z is one of the largest venture capital firms in crypto, pouring billions into token purchases \u2013 like Solana \u2013 and other forms of Web3 tech. Earlier this week, the crypto community expressed concern after the VC giant \u2013 which owns 4% of Uniswap\u2019s governance token, UNI \u2013 exerted its power to singlehandedly stonewall a new governance proposal."

Calling for things to be done.\u201d\n\nIn a Feb. 9 Twitter thread, Coinbase founder and CEO Brian Armstrong responded to \u201crumors\u201d that the SEC was thinking to ban retail consumers from staking crypto.\n\nRelated: CFTC head looks to new Congress for action on crypto regulation\n\n\u201cStaking is not a security,\u201d he said, adding it would be a \u201cterrible path for the U.S.\u201d if a staking ban was passed noting it was \u201ca really important innovation in crypto.\u201d\n\n\u201cHopefully we can work together to publish clear rules for the industry, and come up with sensible solutions that protect consumers while preserving innovation,\u201d Armstrong said."

        "content": "Ethereum Name Service (ENS) DAO, the decentralized community that oversees the domain project on Ethereum, ENS, has sold 10,000 ethereum (ETH) for $16.2m in USDC stablecoin.\n\nThe sale is the latest effort by a DAO to limit its exposure to volatile crypto by diversifying its treasury reserves into stablecoins.\n\nEthereum Name Service DAO sells ETH for USDC\n\nENS DAO swapped 10,000 ETH for USDC on Thursday, Feb. 9, 2023. The sale occurred on CoWSwap at 10:26 AM UTC. ENS DAO realized $16.2 million from the swap, according to on-chain transaction data.\n\nToday\u2019s trade comes after the DAO previously voted to sell 10,000 ETH. ETH sold came from the DAO\u2019s spendable treasury and amounted to 25% of its ETH reserves.\n\nDuring the vote, ENS DAO delegates agreed to sell coins on CoWSwap. Gnosis Co-Founder Martin K\u00f6ppelmann revealed that the sale incurred minimal slippage of 0.5%. Slippage refers to the loss incurred when swapping assets, the difference between the quoted price and settlement price of a token swap.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/koeppelmann/status/1623614547595517953\n\nK\u00f6ppelmann argued that the sale would have been a victim of Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) extraction worth $80,000 if it had been done on a normal decentralized exchange like Uniswap.\n\nENS DAO will use the funds realized to support the project for the next 18 to 24 months. Over half of the money will go to ENS Labs, the developer behind the project. ENS Labs reportedly requires about $11,500 daily to fund operations, amounting to $8.4m over two years.\n\nAnother bulk spending from the funds will go toward ENS DAO working groups. The DAO has three core working groups tasked with handling specific functions for the community.\n\nTreasury diversification for DAOs\n\nThe sale reduces the ENS DAO exposure to ether. It is also another treasury diversification route taken by the community. The DAO is currently looking to fund an endowment fund that will be used to attempt to earn yield from its reserve assets.\n\nDAOs faced their first bear market in 2022 and saw firsthand how their reserves could become devalued during sustained price downturns. It is because many DAOs keep the bulk of their assets in their native tokens.\n\nCurrently, communities are advocating significant treasury diversification. This can come in the form of holding stablecoins or investing in real-world assets like in the case of MakerDAO.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "According to data from DefiLlama, Ethereum staking service Rocket Pool reached $1 billion in total value locked (TVL) on Feb. 9. The move comes less than two years after the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol launched its mainnet on Nov. 9, 2021. Dubbed a liquid staking solution for Ethereum, Rocket Pool allows users to join an Ethereum decentralized node operator or run their own node.\n\nUnlike conventional staking solutions, the capital requirements are far less, as users can run their own node with just 16 Ether (ETH) as opposed to the network specified 32 ETH, with another 16 ETH coming from a pool of users who join a decentralized node operator. For the latter, the deposit requirement is only 0.01 ETH. Depositors receive liquid staking token rETH in exchange for their ETH, which proves the user is entitled to staking rewards over time and accrues yield.\n\nIn exchange for validating transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, Rocket Pool node operators receive up to 7.26% per year, while stakers receive 4.68%. Both rates are variable and are subject to node demand and supply as well as transaction volume on the Ethereum blockchain. In addition, rewards may also be nullified or amplified by changes in the market price of ETH.\n\nRocket Pool\u2019s TVL has steadily increased in value despite ETH\u2019s declining market price. Source: DefiLlama\n\nCurrently, the protocol has 385,344 ETH staked and 2,068 node operators. Rocket Pool\u2019s smart contracts have been audited by Sigma Prime, ConsenSys and Trail of Bits. The project also has a bug bounty program facilitated by Immunefi. According to Ethereum\u2019s developers, the blockchain\u2019s Shanghai upgrade is scheduled to come online in March. It will allow users to withdraw their staked ETH and accrued rewards since the network\u2019s successful transition to proof-of-stake in September 2022."

        "content": "A survey of 81 nonfungible token (NFT) collections on the Ethereum blockchain showed a sharp overall loss in market capitalization in 2022, according to a report from DappRadar released Feb. 9. Losses were not evenly distributed, however.\n\nThe Ethereum NFT market was worth $9.3 billion at the beginning of 2022, according to DappRadar\u2019s valuation, and that figure dropped to $3.7 billion by year-end \u2014 a loss of 59.6%. The price of Ether (ETH) impacted the valuations:\n\n\u201cIt is also important to consider that ETH lost 60% of its value last year, which had a strong influence on the value of the NFTs.\u201d\n\nThe NFT market peaked in February 2022 at $19.1 billion, outperforming Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether until the Terra collapse in May. By the following month, NFTs had lost 88% of their value. The market hit its year low at $2.2 billion at the end of November, the month of the FTX collapse. The market finished the year up 68% from that low. The report notes:\n\n\u201cThis retraction of the NFT market was not a reflection of NFT\u2019s utility, but rather a result of bad actors and market manipulations.\u201d\n\nYuga Labs accounted for two-thirds of the market in 2022, with its CryptoPunks and Bored Ape Yacht Club collections holding 46.7% of the market by themselves. The Otherdeed collection was Yuga Labs\u2019 loss leader, falling 86.15%.\n\nRelated: Should Bored Ape buyers be legally entitled to refunds?\n\nThe Azuki, Pudgy Penguins and Degen Toonz collections were the only ones \u201claunched in 2021 or early 2022 to experience significant market cap growth,\u201d rising 113.89%, 260% and 204%, respectively.\n\nNFT collections launched after the Terra collapse fared better. The report cites Potatoz (+134.68%), Renga (+211.63%), DigiDaigaku (+209.88%) and God Hates NFTees (+1,653.28%) as examples.\n\nThe report also traced the declining share of collectibles in the NFT market share. Collectibles started 2022 with over 90% of the market but held well below 75% of it in January 2023. Trading volume for NFTs in January 2023 amounted to $870 million."

This is probably the main cause of the broader collapse of the crypto industry, as during the collapse of FTX, the market cap of the entire NFT ecosystem crashed following the global crypto market.\n\nThese Were The Highest Earning NFT Collections On Ethereum Since 2022\n\nThe report noted that some projects launched during 2021 and early 2022 had \u201csignificant market cap growth\u201d of up to 260%. Among those projects were the Azuki, Pudgy Penguins and Degen Toonz collections, whose market cap appreciated by 113.89%, 260%, and 204%, respectively.\n\nAmong the newer NFT projects, which were launched after the collapse of Terra Luna are: The Potatoz with a market cap growth of 134.68%, Renga with 211.63%, DigiDaigaku with 209.88%, and God Hates NFT with 1,653.28%.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that all of these projects managed to see dramatic growth, despite the fact that ETH, the native currency of the Ethereum network, saw a 60% price drop over the last year due to the bear market.\n\nBored Ape Yacht Club Dominates The Market\n\nAccording to DappRadar, Yuga Labs, the parent company of the Bored Ape Yacht Club project, dominated the Ethereum network\u2019s NFT market, \u201cestablishing itself as a leading player in the NFT industry\u201d, despite the exponential fall of other projects.\n\nDespite Yuga Labs\u2019 collection accounting for 67% of the total value of the NFT market on Ethereum, Bored Ape Yacht Club\u2019s market capitalization saw a 64.92% depreciation falling from $2.6bn to $934m by the end of 2022.\n\nHowever, that didn\u2019t stop Yuga Labs from buying two of the largest NFT collections on the market, CryptoPunks and Meebits, for an undisclosed sum to date. Both collections are already seeing a significant rebound after suffering declines of up to 60% in 2022.\n\nBut now that the crypto market is showing signs of a recovery, probably the NFT ecosystem has some chance to breathe. And we might be seeing green pastures ahead as just recently, trading activity around blue-chip collections started to spike, and now there are even NFTs taking over the Bitcoin network."

        "content": "Crypto exchange Kraken on Thursday agreed to shutter its staking services for U.S. customers, and pay $30 million to the Securities and Exchange Commission as part of a settlement.\n\nWhy it matters: The top U.S. financial regulator has now spoken on staking, a process that compensates retail crypto investors for holding certain digital coins. The service offered on other major crypto exchanges like Coinbase.\n\nWhat they're saying: \"As part of the settlement, Kraken has neither admitted nor denied the SEC's allegations,\" a Kraken spokesperson said in a statement emailed to Axios.\n\n\"Starting today, with the exception of staked ether (ETH), assets enrolled in the on-chain staking program by U.S. clients will automatically be un-staked and will no longer earn staking rewards,\" the statement added.\n\nThe big picture: Ethereum staking validates transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. To do this, a user would lock up their tokens, or \"stake\" the native coin, in this case ether. They earn rewards in that token, in return for helping secure the network.\n\nYou can do this for any proof-of-stake protocols.\n\nKraken is among the top staking service providers, representing 7.6% of all staked ether, behind Lido's 29% and Coinbase's 13%. Though, Kraken can't unstake ether right now, because no one can.\n\nBetween the lines: The SEC's complaint specifically takes issue with pooled staking, rather than staking at large.\n\nZoom in: In order to offer staking services, an exchange like Kraken would pool customer assets transferred by them and stake them on their behalf, the SEC's complaint reads.\n\nIn doing so, there would be a contract between Kraken and their customers, that both transfers the customer's asset, and a promise on return.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s through staking-as-a-service, lending, or other means, crypto intermediaries, when offering investment contracts in exchange for investors\u2019 tokens, need to provide the proper disclosures and safeguards required by our securities laws,\u201d SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in the statement.\n\nBottom line: It would appear the SEC appears intent on proving it can keep the troubled crypto industry in line, by whatever means necessary."

Its design ensures the GHO oracle price is always fixed one-to-one with the U.S. dollar, as minting will be through assets supplied as collateral in the Aave Protocol.\n\nAave is a decentralized lending and borrowing platform that uses over-collateralization as a mechanism for ensuring the safety of deposited funds.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn this system, borrowers must pledge more collateral than the amount they borrow, which acts as a security for the lender in case the borrower is unable to repay the loan.\n\nThis creates a capital-efficient way to mint stablecoins while maintaining over-collateralized backing by a diversified set of cryptocurrencies supplied by those who deposit on Aave.\n\nFounder and CEO of Aave Companies Stani Kulechov said, \u201cWith the support and management of the Aave community, GHO\u2019s decentralized stablecoin can power a payment layer that can easily, securely, and efficiently transfer value across DeFi and TradFi ecosystems.\u201d\n\nAave DAO takes over\n\nThe GHO codebase is now available on Github for developers to examine and test before its expected release on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nHowever, the actual launch is dependent on the approval of the Aave DAO, the governing body of both the Aave Protocol and GHO.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs the stablecoin will be managed by the Aave DAO, anyone who holds AAVE, the platform\u2019s governance token, will have a voice in determining GHO\u2019s supply, interest rate, and risk parameters.\n\nThe Aave DAO will also be responsible for approving facilitators that can mint and burn GHO tokens. The Aave Companies recommended the Ethereum V3 market to be the first facilitator due to its extensive risk-mitigation features.\n\nUnlike other attempts at a decentralized stablecoin, the interest repaid by borrowers will go to the Aave DAO treasury rather than the asset suppliers\u2014as the asset suppliers are already earning interest on their supplied collateral.\n\nPer the press release, the stablecoin has already been audited by Open Zeppelin, SigmaPrime, and ABDK, and it is currently under audit by Certora. The code repository is also part of Aave\u2019s bug bounty program, rewarding those who find and report any vulnerabilities."

The speculation triggered by the tweet revolved around the potential impact of the SEC\u2019s new rulings on the crypto space.\n\n1/ We're hearing rumors that the SEC would like to get rid of crypto staking in the U.S. for retail customers. I hope that's not the case as I believe it would be a terrible path for the U.S. if that was allowed to happen. \u2014 Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) February 8, 2023\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nArmstrong\u2019s tweet suggested that the SEC might look to eliminate crypto staking for retail customers in the U.S. The reason cited for this move was the SEC\u2019s view of Ethereum as a security post the launch of its staking feature.\n\nArmstrong added that regulation by enforcement would force companies to move offshore. This would lead to more FTX-like problems for the crypto industry, according to him.\n\nPost-update FUD?\n\nArmstrong\u2019s tweet may trigger FUD in the crypto space, as many prominent Twitter accounts added fuel to the fire.\n\nThe situation was further compounded by the news of the SEC\u2019s investigation of the Kraken exchange. The reason cited for the investigation was the suspicion of the sale of unregistered securities.\n\nKraken, the second-largest U.S. exchange, is under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for the sale of unregistered securities and may settle in the coming days, according to Bloomberg. https://t.co/yrxxuMdAE2 \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) February 8, 2023\n\nImpact on Ethereum\n\nThese developments could potentially impact the growth of Ethereum, especially with the much-awaited Shanghai Upgrade. Despite this, at press time, the Ethereum network continued to set new records, with the number of non-zero addresses exceeding 94 million and the total number of ETH 2.0 staked addresses surpassing 527,000.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETH worth today?\n\nHowever, the number of large addresses on Ethereum declined during this period. Moreover, the number of addresses holding over 10 coins reached a one-month low of 350,897 at press time. This decline in the sentiment could possibly signal a reversal of the bullish interest in Ethereum.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigations and potential new rulings could impact Ethereum negatively. However, the network continued to grow at press time. It remains to be seen how the situation will impact the crypto space."

What\u2019s different from other crackdown efforts is that staking is a central feature of many blockchains such as Ethereum and key to potentially switching other cryptocurrencies away from a system that requires vast amounts of electricity.\n\n1. What is staking?\n\nIt\u2019s depositing Ether or other cryptocurrencies for use in what\u2019s known as a \u201cproof-of-stake\u201d system that helps run a blockchain network by ordering transactions in a way that creates a secure public record. Ethereum in September switched to staking to replace the \u201cproof-of-work\u201d system pioneered by Bitcoin, which continues to use it. Ethereum\u2019s switch was said to cut the network\u2019s energy usage by about 99%, an important step for an industry that has come under fire for the amount of electricity it uses.\n\n2. What are the \u2018proof of\u2019 systems for?\n\nCryptocurrencies wouldn\u2019t work without blockchain, a relatively new technology that performs the old-fashioned function of maintaining a ledger of time-ordered transactions. What\u2019s different from pen-and-paper records is that the ledger is shared on computers all around the world. Blockchain has to take on another task not needed in a world of physical money \u2014 making sure that no one is able to spend a cryptocurrency token more than once by manipulating the digital ledger. Blockchains operate without a central guardian, such as a bank, in charge of the ledger: Both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake systems rely on group action to order and safeguard a blockchain\u2019s sequential record.\n\n3. How are the two different?\n\nIn both systems, transactions are grouped into \u201cblocks\u201d that were published to a public \u201cchain.\u201d In proof of work, that happens when the system compresses the data in the block into a puzzle that can only be solved through trial-and-error computations that can potentially need to be run millions of time. This work is done by miners who compete to be the first to come up with a solution and are rewarded with new cryptocurrency if other miners agree it works. Proof of stake works by giving a group of people a set of carrot-and-stick incentives to collaborate on the task. An example: People who put up, or stake, 32 Ether (1 Ether traded at around $1,519 on Feb. 10) can become \u201cvalidators,\u201d while those with less Ether can become validators on Ethereum jointly. Validators are chosen to order blocks of transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n4. What\u2019s the incentive for staking?\n\nIf a block is accepted by a committee whose members are called attestors, validators are awarded new Ether. But someone who tried to game the system could lose the coins that were staked. Typically people who stake their coins are rewarded by earning yields of about 4% for staking-as-a-service users on Ethereum.\n\n5. What\u2019s the SEC\u2019s issue with staking?\n\nKraken and other centralized providers had been offering \u201cstaking as a service,\u201d which lets users stake their coins without buying or maintaining the computers needed for staking. The agency\u2019s action against Kraken makes clear that it considers this to be akin to crypto lending, in which providers would pay crypto depositors high rates of interest for lending out their coins. It\u2019s a practice regulators cracked down on last year, when a slew of lenders like Celsius Network, BlockFi and others collapsed. The SEC considers both crypto lending and staking-as-a-service programs to be securities, a designation that imposes a wide range of regulatory requirements that crypto used to think it was immune from. Kraken agreed to immediately cease offering or selling securities through crypto asset staking services in the US; it didn\u2019t admit or deny allegations in the SEC complaint.\n\n6. What does it mean for something to be a security?\n\nIn its most simple form, whether something is or isn\u2019t a security under US rules is basically a question of how much it looks like shares issued by a company raising money. To make that determination, the SEC applies a legal test that comes from a 1946 Supreme Court decision. Under that framework, an asset can be under SEC purview when it involves a. investors kicking in money b. into a common enterprise with c. the intention of profiting from d. the efforts of the organization\u2019s leadership. In staking-as-a-service, users deposit their coins with the expectation of earning a yield on them, while the service provider takes care of the technical side of things.\n\n7. Why does being labeled a security matter?\n\nFor starters, such designations may make running a staking-as-a-service program more expensive and complex. Under US rules, the label carries strict investor-protection and disclosure requirements. This burden would put smaller providers at a disadvantage compared to deeper-pocketed competitors. What\u2019s more, exchanges that try to continue offering the service would face continuous scrutiny by regulators, which could lead to fines, penalties and, in a worst case, prosecutions if criminal authorities ever got involved. It could also mean losing future funding from investors who may be skittish of those increased compliance burdens and regulatory scrutiny. Supporters of more regulation believe securities designations would result in more information and transparency for investors \u2014 and would ultimately bring more users into the services.\n\n8. What might a crackdown on crypto staking mean?\n\nThe crackdown only applies to staking-as-a-service providers focused on US consumers. Blockchains are typically secured by validators from around the world, so they will continue to function, assuming overseas regulators take a more lenient view of their services. This would further the split between heavy regulation in the US and the Wild West in some other parts of the world. There are questions about whether the tightening of regulations surrounding staking will impact so-called decentralized staking providers, which claim to be immune to them because they are not operated by a particular company or based in a particular place; in theory, such providers are just collections of software that execute transactions automatically. But many of these decentralized finance (DeFi) services are actually run by a core group of people whom regulators could potentially still hold responsible for noncompliance."

        "title": "This Mysterious Fund Could Be Behind The 40% Surge in Ethereum Prices - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Based on on-chain data, one mysterious crypto fund could be directly behind the recent Bitcoin, Ethereum, and digital asset rally.\n\nMysterious Fund Might Be Behind The Recent ETH Crypto Rally\n\nAccording to Lookonchain data streams, an unknown fund started strategizing its entry into crypto in early December 2022. Then, it was observed that they converted large chunks to USDC, a stablecoin, from its issuer, Circle.\n\nAfter that, the funds were converted to USDT, the world\u2019s most liquid stablecoin issued by Tether Holding, in five different addresses before being moved to exchanges.\n\n1/ A mysterious fund started pouring money into the crypto market ahead of this year's small #BullMarket. The fund started withdrawing $USDC from #Circle on Dec 7, 2022 and has over 10B $USDC as of today. Then exchanged for $USDT via 5 addresses, and deposited to exchanges. pic.twitter.com/n4UiVWSbHe \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) February 9, 2023\n\nSpecifically, on-chain data shows that whenever the fund minted USDC from Circle and converted to USDT before being moved to Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance, the Ethereum (ETH) price began increasing.\n\nBased on this correlation, analysts are convinced that the \u201crise in cryptocurrency prices has something to do with this fund.\u201d\n\nAs of February 9, the mysterious crypto fund has $1 billion USDC.\n\nBy shifting huge sums of USDT to exchanges whose order books are open to the public, the fund could have triggered a pump in Ethereum prices. From late December 2022, Ethereum and crypto prices began recovering from the lows registered in 2022. ETH prices have increased roughly 40% from December 2022 lows.\n\nEthereum is trading at over $1,600. Meanwhile, the price of Bitcoin is above $22,000.\n\nThe improvement of asset valuation follows a price slump that saw BTC drop to as low as $15,300 at the height of the FTX-induced fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD). FTX filed for bankruptcy in November, months after 3AC, a crypto hedge fund, went under. Both events triggered a crash in the market.\n\nIs There A Case For Ethereum Demand?\n\nWhy the crypto fund prefers Ethereum is yet to be known. However, Ethereum has shifted to a proof of stake system and is thought to be more environmentally friendly than Bitcoin, which still uses a proof of work consensus algorithm system that is more energy intensive. There are arguments that by using a staking system, the smart contracting platform stands to attract more investors.\n\nEthereum also dominates as the home of DeFi and NFTs. DeFiLlama shows that DeFi protocols in the network manage over $28 billion of assets. Lido Finance, a liquidity staking provider, currently dominates, managing over $8.3 billion.\n\nThe block utilization rate in Ethereum is consistently above 95%, pointing to the high level of demand. By attracting activity, there is demand for ETH, which is used to pay for gas, leading to more coins being destroyed, making it more inflationary. Ultrasound Money on February 9 indicates that 70,547.33 ETH had been burnt in the last month.\n\nFeature image from Flickr, Chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

According to the SEC, it is a violation of the U.S. securities law.\n\nThis major step by the SEC sent shockwaves in the crypto market causing the price of major cryptocurrencies drop. Ethereum (ETH), the second largest cryptocurrency, lost approximately 5.34% in the last 24 hours, bringing it back down to the level of $1.5k.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Price Struggles\n\nThe downtrend in ETH price is being driven by strong selling pressure.

With a live market cap of $188 billion, CoinMarketCap is currently ranked #2.\n\nThe Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade Will Have a Huge Impact\n\nIn March 2023, the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade will go live. ETH stakers will be able to withdraw their cryptocurrency currently locked in the ETH 2.0 smart contract.\n\nThere is plenty of room for the 14% ratio to rise, the bank said, given that the average for other proof-of-stake (PoS) networks is about four times as high, JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report Wednesday.\n\n\u201cAssuming the staking ratio converges over time to the 60% average of other major PoS networks, the validator number could increase from 0.5 million to 2.2 million and the yield would fall from 7.4% current to around 5%.\u201d\n\nNow that the cryptocurrency market is projecting a bearish trend, this upgrade seems the only hope for ETH holders.

        "content": "DeFi is shorthand for \u201cdecentralized finance,\u201d a way of conducting financial business utilizing peer-to-peer networks, blockchains, and other developing technologies to eliminate intermediaries and central oversight. In a traditional financial system, banks and various third parties like credit card companies facilitate essentially every step of the movement of money from one person to another.\n\nDeFi aims to allow for these transfers to occur in a secure way but without the scrutiny\u2014and the costs, privacy concerns, and occasional delays\u2014associated with these third parties.\n\nTools of DeFi\n\nDeFi has emerged as a focal point among cryptocurrency enthusiasts as the Ethereum network and its powerful smart contract capabilities have developed. Proponents of DeFi utilize various systems to lend, borrow, and trade cryptocurrencies. These include individual tokens\u2014and particularly stablecoins\u2014as well as exchanges, networks, and decentralized apps.\n\nDeFi Protocols\n\nOne reason Ethereum and smart contracts have been crucial to the development of DeFi is because of protocols. DeFi protocols are simply codes, procedures, and rules which govern the systems utilized in DeFi. Through DeFi protocols, participants in the ecosystem are able to trade, lend, stake tokens, and much more. These protocols must be accessible to all wallets so that anyone participating in the DeFi system can follow the same set of rules.\n\nWhat is MakerDAO?\n\nBy and large, DeFi protocols are autonomous programs encoded into smart contracts either on Ethereum or a similar blockchain ecosystem. Most protocols attempt to identify and improve upon one or more traditional financial processes. As an example, a DeFi protocol could aggregate data from various decentralized crypto exchanges in an effort to consolidate trading and liquidity pools in order to make transacting more straightforward for users.\n\nUnderstandably, many DeFi protocols use highly complex procedures in an effort to simplify and increase accessibility. When comparing different protocols, one metric that may be helpful is total value locked (TVL). TVL refers to the total underlying supply of tokens that is being secured by a specific application. The largest DeFi protocol as of mid-2022 by TVL is MakerDAO, with a TVL of over $7.5 billion as of June of that year. This protocol enables users to borrow and lend crypto tokens. Users lock their own crypto assets in exchange for tokens of a stablecoin called DAI. Participants can lend and borrow, while the MakerDAO protocol uses smart contracts to liquidate loans and sell collateral to support the stability of DAI.\n\nStory continues\n\nAn astonishing thing about DeFi protocols is how wide-ranging they are. There are protocols allowing users to move assets from one blockchain network to another, to swap various pegged assets, to create their own liquidity pools, to take and offer loans, and much more. DeFi protocols even allow users to put money away into savings account alternatives or to take on riskier, advanced investments like derivatives.\n\nSome of the Most Popular DeFi Protocols\n\nBesides MakerDAO, some of the other best-known and most popular DeFi protocols include:\n\nAAVE: AAVE is a lending protocol which has its own native token, also called AAVE.\n\nUniSwap: UniSwap is a decentralized exchange operating in the DeFi space. Users can earn native UNI tokens by offering liquidity.\n\nCurve: Curve is a liquidity aggregator bringing together assets that have the same peg, such as stablecoins.\n\n0x Protocol: 0x allows users to move assets from Ethereum to Polygon, where fees tend to be lower.\n\nCompound: Compound provides lending and borrowing capabilities that exist outside of a centralized financial system. It is a decentralized marketplace giving users the opportunity to lock crypto assets in order to participate in the loan market.\n\nCheat Sheet"

In 2021, it got into a spat with Coinbase over the exchange\u2019s plans to launch a lending feature in the US, and last year, it (and several states) settled with BlockFi for $100 million over the company\u2019s interest accounts.\n\nKraken will continue to offer staking outside the US via a separate subsidiary\n\nCoinbase CEO Brian Armstrong tweeted concern about \u201crumors\u201d the SEC would like to get rid of crypto staking in the US, claiming it\u2019s \u201cimportant innovation\u201d and \u201cnot a security\u201d \u2014 important since labeling it that way makes these businesses and potentially proof-of-stake blockchain operations like Ethereum 2.0 \u2014 subject to much stricter laws.\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler appears to disagree, which could be bad news for others offering staking to customers in the US. This agreement should \u201cmake clear to the marketplace that staking-as-a-service providers must register and provide full, fair, and truthful disclosure and investor protection,\u201d Gensler said in a press release.\n\nWhen news of the settlement broke via a report on CoinDesk at 2:30PM ET, the price of Ethereum dropped sharply, falling over 4 percent in 30 minutes.\n\nAccording to the SEC, Kraken took investors\u2019 crypto and put it into a staking pool with the hopes of earning rewards. (Those rewards are meted out for being part of the validation process used by some blockchains.) In return for having their crypto locked up, Kraken\u2019s customers would, in theory, earn interest on that crypto. But the regulator says that the returns Kraken promised were \u201cuntethered to any economic realities\u201d and that the exchange provided \u201czero insight into, among other things, its financial condition and whether it even had the means of paying the marketed returns in the first place.\u201d\n\nThe SEC also takes issue with the lack of consumer protections available for Kraken\u2019s staking service, saying that the exchange \u201cretained the right to pay them no returns at all.\u201d\n\nIn a statement posted on its blog, Kraken says it\u2019ll continue offering its staking services outside the US. It also says that its clients in the US will automatically have their non-Ethereum crypto unstaked and that their Ethereum stakes will be removed as soon as possible."

        "title": "Same brand stablecoins can carry different risks - Ledger Insights",
        "content": "When the FTX crypto exchange collapsed last year, the focus turned to the biggest exchange, Binance. People worried about the amount of the Binance USD (BUSD) stablecoin that the exchange holds because they thought it was self-issued. That\u2019s not entirely correct. Binance outsources the issuance of BUSD to New York-regulated trust company Paxos, which has a conservative approach towards reserve assets, holding them in cash or Treasuries.\n\nHowever, Paxos is only responsible for BUSD issuance on Ethereum, not the four other blockchains on which BUSD is available. \u201cThe NYDFS must approve our BUSD operations, including the blockchains on which BUSD tokens may be listed,\u201d Paxos told us via email. \u201cToday, BUSD is approved for issuance only on Ethereum. Paxos is not involved in the management or support of wrapped versions of BUSD.\u201d And it makes that clear on the Paxos website.\n\nBinance issues BUSD on other chains, including its own-brand blockchain Binance Chain. Together these amount to about a third of the total issuance of BUSD. It doesn\u2019t create it out of thin air but uses the Ethereum BUSD as the 1:1 backing asset. This wrapping of a token to make it usable on another blockchain network is commonplace in crypto, but not without risks. The obvious ones are who has keys to the wallets and how to ensure the 1:1 backing is in sync.\n\nNon-ethereum BUSD stablecoin wasn\u2019t always 100% backed\n\nIt turns out that BUSD on other chains was not always 1:1 backed in the past, although Binance said it rectified the process last year. It claimed the issues were a timing difference and it now rebalances more regularly.\n\nBinance locks BUSD on Ethereum in a specific wallet and issues the BUSD on the other chains, with Binance Chain making up most of it. Currently, this \u2018Binance-peg BUSD\u2019 accounts for $5.44 billion, a third of the total $16.3 billion on the Ethereum chain.\n\nIn the blog post about the mismatch of the backing assets, Binance refers to the BUSD issued on the other chains as Binance-Peg BUSD or PBUSD. But on the blockchains themselves, they appear as BUSD. The same branding as on the Ethereum chain.\n\nBlockchain explorers have a disclaimer for BUSD that it is pegged BUSD. \u201cIt is not issued by Paxos nor regulated by the NYDFS,\u201d reads the disclaimer. But how many people will view the explorer, especially if they hold stablecoins on an exchange?\n\nBUSD is not the only stablecoin where the core issuer is not responsible for issuance on all chains.\n\nUSDC is another example where the stablecoin on the popular Polygon blockchain is bridged. However this only accounts for around 2% of USDC\u2019s $41 billion issuance. The issuer of USDC, Circle, provides Bridged USDC terms of service allowing those with a Circle Account to redeem the Polygon USDC for dollars.\n\nHowever, Binance also wraps almost $900 million USDC on the Binance Chain, which is not directly covered by Circle\u2019s terms of service.\n\nUsing the same brand when there are different risks results in potential consumer misconceptions because they don\u2019t appreciate the difference.\n\nWhat\u2019s the solution?\n\nThere\u2019s a vast difference in trustworthiness between an issuer that\u2019s a regulated trust company such as Paxos and an unregulated blockchain startup that decided to wrap tokens. For all we know, the startup might leave the wallet keys available to all staff on Slack. Allegedly FTX did something similar.\n\nWrapped Bitcoins are tradable on the Ethereum network. The symbol is not BTC. It is wBTC. So an obvious solution is a branding indicator for wrapped stablecoins rather than an obscure disclaimer that a user might never see. So \u2018Binance-Peg BUSD\u2019 should be something like wBUSD or pBUSD. The same goes for bridged USDC.\n\nWhether or not that will make a difference remains to be seen. After all, Tether remains the most popular stablecoin despite evidence that it has not been fully backed at all times.\n\nFiat-backed stablecoins are meant to be lower risk tokens, so there\u2019s a need to be more conservative. It\u2019s generally accepted that issuers need to be regulated. But what about organizations that wrap stablecoins? It\u2019s still possible to achieve composability, such as creating programmable money based on stablecoins without handing over keys to large quantities of digital currency.\n\nIn other related news, there are reports that one of the Paxos regulators, the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), is probing Paxos. However, an NYDFS spokesperson told Bloomberg that it keeps in contact with regulated entities to understand crypto market risks.\n\nStablecoin fragmentation beyond wrapping\n\nApart from multi-chain issuance, there\u2019s additional potential for fragmentation within a brand. There could be multiple issuers of the same brand of stablecoin on the same chain. Or the same parent company might issue the stablecoin in multiple jurisdictions.\n\nUSDC is associated with issuer Circle, but the USDC stablecoin is governed by Centre, which originally planned multiple issuers for USDC. With different entities issuing the same brand of stablecoin, the issuers will always have different risk profiles.\n\nSingapore regulators plan to incorporate some international supervision where a stablecoin is issued in multiple jurisdictions, even if by the same entity.\n\nAs we\u2019ve seen with Europe\u2019s MiCA regulations, the crypto-asset sector moves quickly and it\u2019s hard for regulations to keep up. With stablecoin rules in the works in several jurisdictions, there\u2019s a need to consider wrapped stablecoins and other ways in which same-brand stablecoins carry different risks."

        "title": "A Brief History of DeFi - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nDecentralized finance, often referred to as DeFi, is a movement in the cryptocurrency and blockchain spaces that can be difficult to pin down exactly. It is both a large-scale vision for a new way of conducting financial transactions\u2014free from intermediaries, central authorities, and done exclusively in a peer-to-peer modality\u2014as well as an umbrella term for scores of non-custodial financial products and services known as protocols.\n\nDeFi is inextricably linked to the rise of cryptocurrencies, but it is not solely about crypto tokens. Below, we take a closer look at the history of DeFi and how it got to where it is today.\n\n2015: Launch of Ethereum\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYes, one could point to the launch of Bitcoin in 2009 as the beginning of the DeFi movement. This is true insofar as Bitcoin was responsible for the rise of cryptocurrencies more broadly as an industry. Bitcoin popularized the idea of decentralized tokens and related services like exchanges. However, the Bitcoin ecosystem is not built to enable DeFi protocols. Those rely instead on Ethereum (which was of course also indebted to Bitcoin for its own existence).\n\nOne of the key developments of Ethereum was the use of smart contracts which allow developers to create a wide variety of decentralized apps, including those related to DeFi. To this day, most DeFi protocols exist in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nNotably, the concepts of some of the most well-known DeFi protocols, such as MakerDAO, predate the launch of Ethereum. Maker is a lending protocol that allows users to borrow cryptocurrencies instantaneously, or to earn interest from lending out crypto tokens, and it also provides its own stablecoin. Maker was created in 2014, though it officially launched in 2017.\n\n2017: MakerDAO and Decentralized Exchanges\n\nBesides MakerDAO, a number of other popular DeFi protocols launched in 2017. Among them were some of the earliest decentralized exchanges, automated market makers that utilize liquidity pools to provide users access to trades with any ERC-20 token.\n\nEtherDelta was one of the first decentralized exchanges and a pioneer in allowing traders to exchange tokens without the use of a centralized authority. It remained significantly popular through the initial coin offerings of 2017 and beyond, but ran into difficulties when it suffered a major hack in 2017 and when its founder Zachary Coburn was charged with operating an unlicenced exchange in 2018.\n\n2017: ICOs\n\nSpeaking of ICOs, these offerings surged in popularity in 2017 and represent another step in the development of DeFi. ICOs allow non-institutional organizations and even individuals to participate in the funding of a new financial project. In this sense, they are a textbook example of the goals of DeFi. Again, Ethereum was key to the launch of many ICOs, as new token projects typically exchanged their crypto offerings for ETH. As with many popular and lucrative ventures in the cryptocurrency space, however, ICOs quickly began to draw bad actors and others searching for a quick payday without delivering much by way of useful tokens or developments.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStill, the ICO era led to the launch of some DeFi protocols which remain popular to this day, including lending and borrowing system Aave and peer-to-peer asset exchange network 0x.\n\n2017 and beyond: Shift toward pooled funds\n\nAt the same time that the ICO craze took off, protocol developers began to adapt the peer-to-peer focus of the DeFi movement to one relying more on pooled funds. This might be thought of as a \u201cuser-to-contract\u201d approach, since users would no longer directly interact with other users but rather would engage with smart contracts themselves.\n\nOne of the most popular protocols to utilize this approach was Uniswap, which launched in 2018. It utilizes liquidity pools and automated market makers to facilitate the exchange of any ERC-20 token and to offer users an incentive reward by adding liquidity to the market for those tokens. Uniswap remains one of the major DeFi protocols today.\n\nCompound was another protocol to emerge in 2018 and which helped to build the lending protocol space. However, it could be argued that Compound became most influential for the broader DeFi movement only in 2020, as we\u2019ll see below.\n\n2020: Market crash\n\nEarly in the COVID pandemic in March 2020, the price of ETH crashed, plunging by about a third in just a day. The dramatic price volatility led to a rapid increase in gas fees and liquidations, which in turn led to shortfalls for Maker. Maker created and auctioned additional native tokens in response.\n\nDeFi saw some of its earliest stress tests with the start of the pandemic in 2020, as values plunged.\n\n2020: Rapid growth\n\nLater in 2020, a number of factors led to the rapid growth of the DeFi space. First, Compound launched COMP tokens mid-year, providing an additional incentive for users to borrow and lend through this system and helping to bring about the controversial but popular practice of yield farming, in which users rapidly borrow and lend different tokens in an effort to achieve the best yields.\n\nCOMP also allowed users the ability to participate in governance of the Compound protocol, further decentralizing authority and inspiring many subsequent protocols to adopt similar rules.\n\nOther crucial developments for DeFi in 2020 include the advent of Yearn, which switches between different DeFi lending protocols to achieve gains, and SushiSwap, which attempts to gain liquidity from other protocols by incentivizing providers of liquidity with its own native tokens.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter 2020: Rising and falling\n\nSince 2020, new protocols have continued to launch, and the DeFi space has seen interest and values rise and fall along with the larger crypto industry. More and more DeFi protocols are launching on non-Ethereum blockchains, attempting to take advantage of improvements that have been made to the preexisting smart contracts format. While it remains to be seen how successful DeFi will be going forward, interest in this movement has climbed rapidly in just a few short years.\n\nCheat Sheet\n\nDeFi owes its existence to the launch of the Ethereum blockchain in 2015 and the rise of smart contracts.\n\nSome DeFi protocols, such as MakerDAO, were in development as early as 2014.\n\nDecentralized exchanges like EtherDelta emerged in 2017 alongside ICOs.\n\nCompound launched in 2018, setting the stage for new approaches to protocol governance and new incentive systems with the release of the COMP token in 2020.\n\nDeFi saw some of its earliest stress tests with the start of the pandemic in 2020, as values plunged.\n\nIn the last two to three years, new protocols have continued to launch, particularly on non-Ethereum blockchains."

SEC chair Gary Gensler said,\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s through staking-as-a-service, lending, or other means, crypto intermediaries, when offering investment contracts in exchange for investors\u2019 tokens, need to provide the proper disclosures and safeguards required by our securities laws.\u201d\n\nShould ETH investors press the panic button?\n\nThe news created doubts in the minds of ETH investors, which was evident in the fall in ETH balances on exchanges, per data from Glassnode. At the same time, the number of daily active addresses also dipped by 5%.\n\nInterestingly, staking activity remained immune to a greater degree, as revealed by the increase in ETH staked. Additionally, the growth in validators on ETH 2.0 also rose steadily. However, with more regulatory tightening on the anvil, these key staking metrics could be in the red in the days to come.\n\nThe weighted sentiment for ETH went deeper into the negative territory, signifying investors\u2019 uneasiness at the moment.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nAt press time, ETH fell by over 5% to trade at $1547.13. It had traded in a range since 20 February but was in real danger of breaking to the downside.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) went below neutral 50, which was a negative sign. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line went below the signal line, paving the way for bears to take back control. Moreover, the On Balance Volume (OBV) made lower-lows of late, adding evidence to the bearish idea."

        "title": "3AC Co-founders Unveil New Exchange, LocalBitcoins to Shut Down BTC Trading Services and More - Securities.io",
        "content": "Su Zhu, one of the co-founders of the failed crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) on Thursday, confirmed on Twitter the news of the launch of Open Exchange (OPNX), whose offerings scope entails trapped user crypto funds. The disgraced crypto-preneur added in the post accompanying the official announcement from the platform that the waitlist is currently open, giving access to an avenue for claims trading and derivatives. The newly unveiled exchange will use the FLEX token to realize its tokenomics model. Zhu said plans to build the platform arose following consultation with creditors and other key figures, including Coinflex CEO Mark Lamb, who endorsed the idea.\n\n3AC execs launch crypto claims exchange as LocalBitcoins winds down operations\n\nThe OPNX platform \u2013 the first public marketplace for crypto claims \u2013 is backed by Kyle Davies, the other co-founder of Singapore-based 3AC, which declared bankruptcy last year. As reported earlier, the trio previously sought to raise as much as $25 million to launch a new exchange dubbed GTX, targeting the crypto claims market estimated to be worth over $20 billion. The idea drew heavy backlash from the crypto community, who expressed their disapproval of the move.\n\nIn other exchange news today, Finland-based Bitcoin exchange LocalBitcoins notified users that it is shutting down after a decade of facilitating peer-to-peer transactions. The exchange cited the harsh conditions bred by the bear market as the reason for halting services after a ten-year run which the team behind said it was proud to have been in operation. Though it primarily focused on Bitcoin in its initial days, the platform started introducing support for other alts in 2021. Along with the closure announcement, the company shared a timeline for the progressive suspension of exchange activities, with trading being halted by Feb 16. Users will still be allowed to withdraw their assets after the date until February 2024.\n\nThe P2P trading platform's shutdown is the latest blow to the crypto sector on the back of mounting regulatory pressure in several jurisdictions around the world.\n\nBinance suspends USD withdrawals and deposits via banks\n\nEarlier this week, Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, notified users that it had paused all deposits and withdrawals in USD via bank transfers. The crypto exchange said it is working to reinstate the feature as soon as possible. The pause doesn't affect alternative funding methods, including Google Pay, Apple Pay, credit cards, and bank transfers in other fiat currencies such as Euros. The Binance.US team separately confirmed that its customers remained unaffected by the interruption of dollar withdrawals and deposits.\n\nBinance CEO Changpeng Zhao said via Twitter that only a small section of Binance customers, the 0.01% of monthly active users who leverage the cash transfer option, were impacted. Nevertheless, he acknowledged that this situation presented a bad experience. Zhao noted that while some banks are stepping back from supporting crypto, others are entering the market, insisting on the need to continue developing for the long term, despite the setbacks from last year's events.\n\nSignature Bank is retreating from the crypto scene\n\nThe dicey landscape ensuing the bankruptcy of the FTX exchange compelled Signature Bank to reduce its crypto exposure and shed off as much as $10 billion in customer deposits. Banking groups have lately been hesitant to conduct business with crypto firms amid warnings from regulators who pledged to monitor institutions that choose to work with these firms. Market regulatory bodies have especially shown keenness to prevent any potential risks posed by crypto from affecting the traditional banking system. The Federal Reserve Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) have all warned of significant risks in engaging with crypto.\n\nCoinbase CEO remarks rekindle staking conversation as a means of preserving innovation\n\nIn a lengthy post shared on Twitter late Wednesday, Coinbase exchange CEO Brian Armstrong expressed concerns about the US Securities and Exchange Commission seeking to scrap crypto staking to retailers. Armstrong went into detail on how a \u2018rumored' move to abolish centralized Ethereum staking providers would stifle innovation, adding that the current approach to regulation is flawed. Ethereum staking has been a trending subject in the lead-up to the Shanghai upgrade, with liquid staking tokens like Lido benefiting the most from the narrative.\n\nCardano founder Charles Hoskinson also offered his views on the matter, specifically describing Ethereum staking as \u2018problematic'.\n\n\u201d Temporarily giving up your assets to someone else to have them get a return looks a lot like regulated products [\u2026] It's sad that all proof of stake protocols might get lumped together due to a fundamental misunderstanding about the actual facts of operation and design. It's like comparing three-mile Island to a modern 4th generation nuclear reactor because they both use the word fission,\u201c the Cardano founder wrote.\n\nHoskinson's response came as no surprise, given the mathematician and programmer has a track record of taking jabs at Ethereum. Following the Merge completion, which saw the mainnet switch to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, Hoskinson said that Ethereum shouldn't be viewed as the \u2018standard' PoS blockchain ecosystem.\n\nTo learn more about the two networks, check out our Ethereum vs. Cardano guide\n\nCoinbase NFT pauses artist drops to focus on other areas within the project\n\nLast week in a separate development, the NFT marketplace of Coinbase exchange shared an update notifying artists it has halted drops. Coinbase NFT shared in a clarification tweet that it was pausing new drops by artists on the platform. The platform denied claims that it was shutting down following news first flagged by Jessica Yatrofsky, a then Coinbase Partner who said she had received communication from the platform to indicate she could no longer release her XX GEN project.\n\nResponding to the alert, Coinbase NFT said it was refocusing efforts on other areas within its project and not closing shop entirely. While NFT trading has taken a hit over the past several months, the Coinbase NFT marketplace has particularly been dry. From more than 1,000 daily NFT sales during the peak days of June and nearly 600 daily unique users, Coinbase NFT now averages less than 20 NFT sales each day, and the number of unique buyers has not been more than 50 on any day this year.\n\nWeTransfer stages foray into NFT space following a partnership with Minima\n\nIn other NFT news, File hosting giant WeTransfer conveyed this week that it has delved into Web3 in an announcement also revealing a partnership with layer one blockchain platform Minima to introduce NFTs to its digital file-sharing network. This collaboration will allow users to mint digital collectibles directly from their mobile devices as Minima's blockchain peer-to-peer network is optimized for mobile use \u2013 a Minima node can run autonomously in the background. With the offering currently in its testnet phase, the NFT capabilities will be available in 180 countries when it launches next month.\n\nTesting the potential of NFTs\n\nMinima utilizes its native Minima token for peer-to-peer transfers on its lightweight layer one platform without the need for intermediaries. The partnership with the freemium model file-sharing platform will enable consumers to share digital assets and earn revenue in a more streamlined manner. The collaboration also aims to demonstrate the potential of NFT technology and its practical use within the crypto industry and other digital applications.\n\nMinima CEO Hugo Feiler termed the collaboration as one that gives the layer one chain an immediate presence in the digital art industry, attracting NFT artists who can earn royalties from selling their digital artwork. Feiler added that the partnership aims to support the growth and progression of creativity in a digital era increasingly focused on ensuring individuals maintain ownership and control over their creations.\n\nFeiler contends the partnership will also serve as a pilot to exhibit the viability of widespread adoption of NFT technology. WeTransfer now joins the ranks of other hosting providers like Google and AWS in powering blockchain-based operations on the cloud. The platform facilitates the transfer of large files, and recipients do not necessarily need an account to access the document. This likely means the platform is set up with the necessary infrastructure to seamlessly integrate to offer users the privacy they expect from blockchain technology.\n\nRevolut Bank customers can now stake Ether and ADA in their crypto wallets\n\nConcerns around staking in the US have made the subject a heated debate. It doesn't help that financial institutions in the US, like BankProv and Signature Bank, have been taking measures geared towards reducing their exposure to crypto. Meanwhile, Revolut Bank wants to give its European customers enhanced utilities for their crypto assets. The neo-banking platform, which gained full approval from the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to offer crypto services last September, has announced plans to empower its customers in the country and the European Economic Area with the ability to stake their crypto.\n\nCustomers could earn yields as high as 11.65% or as low as 2.99%, but the rewards are not guaranteed. The official announcement further detailed that the digital bank would support the locking of crypto in wallets for specific assets, including Ethereum, Polkadot, Cardano, and Tezos, with the minimum staking period varying per token. The staking functionality will debut this week in an initial soft testing phase, a rollout that will enable Revolut app users to earn passive income from their crypto holdings.\n\nTo learn more about Polkadot or Tezos, check out our Investing in Polkadot and Investing in Tezos guides.\n\nDeeper into crypto\n\nCrypto General Manager at Revolut Emil Urmanshin explained that staking is a crucial first step in the bank's 2023 roadmap, explaining that it means enhanced usability of users' crypto assets beyond just support for deposit and withdrawal transactions. Revolut's adoption of crypto has been a gradual evolution, starting with the introduction of trading capabilities for its user base in November 2017 \u2013 it has since provided trading services for nearly 100 various crypto tokens and assets.\n\nLater in 2021, the London-based fintech firm started allowing customers to transfer their crypto assets to external wallets and platforms. Since October last year, they have been able to spend their crypto using their Revolut debit cards. To further support its user base, Revolut has been running an educational program focused on the fundamental principles of blockchain and cryptocurrencies and incentivized by free crypto. The program rolled out in July 2022 and received a remarkable response, with over a million users completing the course in its inaugural month."

        "content": "In this article, we will examine some of the different cryptocurrencies and their fundamentals to predict whether their price will go up to the moon, or plummet to rock bottom. We will look at Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Big Eyes Coin (BIG).\n\nThough it is impossible to guess with certainty the price of many different cryptocurrencies, what we can do is look at the fundamentals of the cryptocurrencies and their price movements in the past to try to predict their potential price movements in the future.\n\nBitcoin: The Original Cryptocurrency\n\nBitcoin is becoming more and more popular as an investment choice because of its long-term development potential as a store of value. Having been released in 2009, Bitcoin has grown to become the most valuable cryptocurrency. Due to its potential for substantial long-term financial gains, many view Bitcoin as a promising long-term investment.\n\nBitcoin is very tempting for investors because it is decentralised, which means that no single body has authority over it or the ability to change its value. This makes it a viable replacement for traditional investments, which are frequently subject to influences like those of the government.\n\nFrom its price movements in the past, we can see Bitcoin continuing its upward momentum in the long term. Though volatility is to be expected, in the long run, Bitcoin is likely to outlast the rest of the competition, being one of the original cryptocurrencies.\n\nEthereum: Digital Silver\n\nInvestors are increasingly turning to Ethereum (ETH) as a viable investment choice. With good cause, too! Ethereum provides a secure, decentralised framework for building blockchain applications. Smart contracts can run on the platform, giving it a lot of utility in the blockchain space, and allowing developers to build dApps (decentralised applications) on the platform.\n\nIt is a popular choice for investors looking to diversify their portfolios since it provides several advantages and features.\n\nEthereum is likely to maintain its position as one of cryptocurrency\u2019s leaders due to its low transaction costs, rapid transaction speeds, and tremendous scalability. Aside from better security, increased returns on investment, and improved liquidity, investing in Ethereum can provide investors with several benefits.\n\nIn the future, Ethereum is most likely to maintain its position as one of the leading cryptocurrencies, and we can see its price retaining a steady position in keeping with Bitcoin.\n\nBig Eyes Coin: The New Meme Coin King?\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG) is one of the hottest new meme coins on the market right now. It has raised $24.5 million and counting!\n\nIt was developed on the Ethereum network and works to raise consumer awareness of the DeFi market while promoting DeFi to boost the amount of money coming into the DeFi ecosystem.One of Big Eyes Coin\u2019s key goals is protecting the seas. To benefit organisations that promote ocean conservation, Big Eyes Coin retains 5% of all tokens in an open charity wallet.\n\nWant to carry out your price prediction? On the Big Eyes Coin website, there is a calculator to look at your potential ROI if you invested now and what your returns could be if Big Eyes Coin increased in price!\n\nWe can easily see this coin skyrocketing, as it already has an incredible amount of momentum, and it champions a social cause that people are looking to get involved in.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThough no price prediction is certain, we can see all of these coins increasing in value due to their solid fundamentals and promising communities built around their respective cryptocurrencies. As always, ensure that you carry out thorough research before investing in any asset. Happy investing!\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG)\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "ChatGPT\u2019s ENS domain sold for 139x of its initial sale.\n\nRegistrations remain in shambles despite an increase in 24-hour trading volume.\n\nDespite not being a part of AI token, Ethereum Name Service [ENS] became part of the cryptocurrencies that have gained from ChatGPT\u2019s rise. According to the sales bot of the open naming system, the chatgpt.eth domain sold for 6 ETH on OpenSea.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ENS worth today?\n\nDomain sales spikes but registrations decline\n\nInformation from the NFT marketplace showed that a certain \u201cIshmilly\u201d was the seller. Meanwhile, LongDuck, who previously owned the domain, bought it for 0.043 ETH. At press time, the value of the asset was close to $10,000 when compared to the market price of Ethereum.\n\nFollowing the sale, ENS\u2019 collection volume rose 46% in the last 24 hours. Although the major sale may have played a role, the spike meant that there were other assets traded under the collection. This helped ENS remain top of the domain sales standings despite a 335% volume increase from another collection.\n\nThis sale also strengthened the impact ChatGPT has had on the crypto space. For example, tokens, Fetch. Ai [FET] and SingularityNET [AGIX] have recorded tremendous value increases since the AI tool gained widespread popularity.\n\nAt one point, ENS gathered so much registration that it recorded an extra one million domains in less than two months.\n\nHowever, this was in the third quarter (Q3) of 2022. But since then, the domain attention has only been Month-on-Month (MoM), according to Dune Analytics. At the time of writing, the domain registration count for February was 10,248.\n\nBut there is a chance that it could edge closer to the ones in December 2022 and January 2023, which was a slight difference.\n\nENS price rises as ChatGPT is one step ahead\n\nFurther, CoinMarketCap data revealed that ENS\u2019 token price picked up a 2.15% increase in the last 24 hours. The trading volume within the same period also increased by 20.26%. A simplification of the hike more tokens has been transacted than the day before, regardless of profit or loss accrued.\n\nInterestingly, it was possible that the crypto ecosystem would continue to see the effect of the increased AI adoption. This was due to the actions taken by Microsoft.\n\nRead Ethereum Name Service\u2019s [ENS] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nA few days back, the company invested in OpenAI, the firm who invented the ChatGPT tool. However, the technology firm went a step further by adding the tool to its search engine Bing.\n\nHence, this significant sale could propel a hike in ENS regulations provided the crypt community is interested."

        "content": "Five years from its inception, fan token platform Chiliz has launched its own layer-1 Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible blockchain ecosystem to support its growth.\n\nChiliz\u2019s fan token ecosystem has long been powered by Ethereum-based ERC-20 tokens, but the validation of the Chiliz 2.0 blockchain genesis block sees the ecosystem shift to its own layer 1.\n\nThe new blockchain uses a system of 11 active validators with proof-of-stake authority consensus, which is touted to provide faster block times, lower fees and energy usage.\n\nAccording to the project\u2019s documentation, Chiliz Chain 2.0 is a hard fork of BNB Chain, a go-to Ethereum fork. This means that the new layer-1 is EVM compatible, which is aimed to attract decentralized application developers to build within the environment.\n\nChiliz has made waves in the sports and entertainment space through its fan token app, Socios.

To knock crypto out of the park\n\nThe platform allows brands, teams and individuals to mint nonfungible tokens (NFTs), fan tokens and Web3-ready tickets, as well as develop DApps and Web3-based experiences and products.\n\nCointelegraph spoke to Socios CEO Alexandre Dreyfus back in November 2022 at Web Summit in Lisbon about the upcoming launch of the Chiliz \u20182.0\u2019 Blockchain. As he explained back then, the Chiliz chain already existed but was deliberately kept as a private ecosystem to protect intellectual property. At the time of that conversation, it had over 1.7 million wallets that participated in the issuance, minting and trading of fan tokens.\n\nDreyfus also pointed out the importance of Ethereum in providing the basis of its current ecosystem in correspondence on Feb. 9, highlighting both iterations of the Chiliz blockchain being forks of Ethereum:\n\n\u201cWe use the technology as a foundation, but we adjust it and enhance it for our needs, which is the protection of the IP and the sports property we are working with.\u201d\n\nThe launch of Chiliz 2.0 marks the transition to a \u201creal open layer 1,\u201c Dreyfus told Cointelegraph, with on-chain governance holding the power to whitelist certain nodes and developers to issue assets.\n\n\u201cWhat does it mean? It means that you cannot have a fake NFT, a fake fan token or whatever.\u201d\n\nThe CEO said that a patient approach, which allowed brands and franchises to maintain control of their image and property rights, was an important factor in the growth of its ecosystem over the past five years. The launch of the Chiliz blockchain is also aimed at handing back value to ecosystem participants:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a chain where mainly sports brands are going to govern, let\u2019s say Barcelona or PSG, are going to become a node and stake their CHZ to get rewards and participate in the growth of the network.\u201d\n\nThe sports industry continues to see synergies with blockchain-based firms. In January 2023, blockchain fantasy sports firm Sorare sealed a deal with the English Premier League to mint Ethereum-based digital player cards on its platform."

Discover SCENE\n\nBuzz around Bitcoin-based NFTs\u2014via the recently-launched Ordinals protocol\u2014keeps growing by the day, with record-setting mints on Thursday and high-value sales over the past day. And one established Ethereum NFT collection is reaping the benefits of going multi-chain, seeing its prices surge after revealing Bitcoin-based counterparts.\n\nOnChain Monkey, a collection of 10,000 Ethereum NFT profile pictures (PFPs) minted in 2021, used Ordinals to \u201cinscribe\u201d all of its existing artwork on Bitcoin over the past day. Now the NFT holders on Ethereum can also say that their respective collectibles live on Bitcoin, as well.\n\nPrices for the Ethereum NFTs have almost tripled since the announcement, with the floor price\u2014that is, the cheapest listed NFT on a marketplace\u2014for the project jumping from 0.79 ETH at the start of the day (per NFT Price Floor) to a peak of 1.75 ETH before settling to about 1.5 ETH (nearly $2,500) as of this writing.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOnChainMonkey is the first 10K collection to be inscribed on Bitcoin via Ordinals!

The analytics platform reports about $1.1 million in sales over the past day for a project with lifetime secondary sales totaling almost $39 million.\n\nMetagood, the startup behind OnChain Monkey, said it put all 10,000 NFTs onto Bitcoin via the Ordinals protocol using a single transaction, much as it did for the original Ethereum collection back in 2021.\n\nIn a Twitter Spaces today, Metagood co-founder Danny Yang said that enabling trading was the next step for the team but suggested that other tooling needs to be created around Ordinals to facilitate that feature. He also noted that Metagood plans to build a bridge between Ethereum and Bitcoin to let NFT holders switch between the two versions.\n\n\u201cThey are the same on both chains,\u201d an OnChain Monkey Discord moderator wrote earlier today. \u201cBuy on ETH and you will have access to the BTC version when the tools catch up.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe project\u2019s Discord server is filling up with users who claim to have purchased one of the Ethereum NFTs following the Bitcoin announcement and are asking for details on how it will work.\n\nOnChain Monkey is part of Metagood\u2019s push to use Web3 initiatives to fund programs that benefit communities. These include efforts to fund coral restoration and provide aid to Ukraine amid the Russian invasion. Metagood, co-founded by venture capitalist Bill Tai alongside Yang and Amanda Terry, raised $5 million in December.\n\nMetagood says that it minted the first 10,000 NFT project on Ordinals\u2014a claim that the creators of Bitcoin Punks, a clone of popular Ethereum project CryptoPunks, have also made.\n\nBitcoin Punks began inscribing its NFTs via Ordinals before OnChain Monkey, but opted to put each Punk as a separate inscription\u2014a process that stretched from Wednesday into Thursday. OnChain Monkey, on the other hand, committed its entire collection to Ordinals via a single transaction late Wednesday.\n\nEditor's note: This article was updated after publication to clarify when OnChain Monkey and Bitcoin Punks were inscribed via Ordinals."

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is currently on a see-saw trend trading on high and lows as it saw its global market capitalization dip by 2.68% to $1.06 trillion, from $1.08 trillion. The decline comes following an upward trajectory indicated earlier in the year. On the bright side, however, the total crypto volume did see a rise of 5.24% to $64.65 billion, up from $60.94 billion.\n\nWhile top currencies Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) traded in the negative, crypto experts remain optimistic that the market will be predominantly bullish throughout the year. Big Eyes Coin (BIG), however, continued with their presale success with brand new offers and benefits for investors.\n\nBitcoin: The Struggle at the Top\n\nHaving gained by 1.33% to surpass the $23,000 for a brief period, Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price dipped by 2.62% to trade at $22,618. The latest downtrend for Bitcoin places the top-ranked currency with a weekly decline of 4.91%.\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin held a market capitalization of $437 billion and was trading at a 24-hour volume of $29.2 billion.\n\nDespite the downward movement, experts indicate that Bitcoin is in the uptrend zone.\n\nEthereum: Hunting for a Rally\n\nWith the constant up and down trends over the past few weeks in the crypto market, Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) price has been sluggish and facing the uphill task of reaching the $1700 mark, albeit expert indications that it would do so in February. Similar to Bitcoin, Ethereum\u2019s price saw an overnight decline of 2.66% to trade at $1631.79.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum held a market capitalization of $199 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $8.6 billion.\n\nBig Eyes Coin: Going Big With Giveaways\n\nWhile the top two leading cryptocurrencies Bitcoin and Ethereum had a poor past 24 hours, Big Eyes Coin (BIG), which is relatively new to the crypto scene made steady gains while continuing to rake in investors during its presale phase. Now in its 11 out of 15 stages, Big Eyes Coin has raised $25 million in presale tokens, becoming the most successful presale in cryptocurrency in the last two years. And in a mark of celebration of becoming the \u201clargest presale ever\u201d, Big Eyes Coin announced on Twitter, @BigEyesCoin that it would be giving away five PlayStation 5\u2019s to investors.\n\nBuilt on the Ethereum Network, Big Eyes Coin has eyes on a $50 million presale target before it goes live on the market. The community-owned meme token is offering the bonus code LAUNCHBIGEYES200 through which investors could earn a 200% return on a purchase of a BIG coin when it goes live.\n\nBig Eyes Coin has laid out an eco-friendly roadmap where it says it will use its PoS protocol to reduce blockchain energy requirements by eliminating crypto mining, a large factor for over a million tons of carbon emissions to the atmosphere. A 5% of Big Eyes Coin\u2018s total token supply will also be set aside to be donated to multiple ocean-saving charities.\n\nSimilar to its eco-friendly ambitions, Big Eyes Coin provides a safe space with its contract code fully audited by Solidity Finance and shown to be 100% secure and has received KYC verification from CoinSniper to build a reputation for transparency and credibility.\n\nFind out more about Big Eyes Coin (BIG):\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

While the Crypto market generally recorded a 2.35% decrease in the last 24 hours, many assets faltered, but some tokens like LDO and RPL recorded exponential gains. Along with this, a recent tweet from Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong gave a push to Lido DAO\u2019s price rally.\n\nAs previously reported by the Coingape, Armstrong has heard rumors that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is planning to entirely ban crypto staking for retail investors.\n\nadvertisement\n\nCrypto News: Lido DAO and Rocket Pool Prices Skyrocketing\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, Lido DAO, and Rocket Pool\u2019s native tokens have soared nearly 11.22% and 15.83% in the last 24 hours. Many investors attributed this price surge to Ethereum\u2019s upcoming Shanghai upgrade that will enable users to withdraw their staked ETH tokens.\n\nRocket Pool \u2013 A decentralized Ethereum staking pool\n\nRocket Pool is a decentralized Ethereum staking pool that allows users to earn a commission from staking ETH and earn additional RPL. Along with liquid staking, Rocket Pool offers smart nodes: a custom node software allowing anyone to run a node on its network.\n\nRocket Pool\u2019s price today is $46.98, with a 24-hour trading volume of $46,090,877.

        "content": "The crypto industry is no less than a star-studded galaxy. While there are supernovas like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (Ether), and Ripple (XRP), new stars like Big Eyes Coin (BIG), Polkadot (DOT), Cardano (ADA), and Binance (BNB) are also glowing brightly.\n\nBig Eyes Coin has been stealing the limelight lately as the cat-themed meme coin has entered Stage 11 of its pre-launch activities. The meme coin has attracted eyeballs in a grand fashion by piling up a whopping $24.30 million in presales.\n\nAmong the hotcakes in the crypto world, Bitcoin and Ethereum are super hot but Big Eyes Coin has also started making its presence felt. While all three of them are considered cryptocurrencies, there are key differences that set them apart from each other.\n\nLet\u2019s have a look at the key differences that set them apart.\n\nUnderlying Technology\n\nA major factor that differentiates between Bitcoin and Ethereum is their underlying technology.\n\nBitcoin uses a simple scripting language for its transactions for a more streamlined approach to payments.\n\nEthereum, on the other hand, has a more advanced programming language, which enables developers to create a wider range of decentralized applications. This makes Ethereum a more flexible platform, and allows it to be used for a wider range of purposes beyond just payments.\n\nBig Eyes Coin is built on the Ethereum network, which means it also uses an advanced underlying technology that makes it ready to welcome the future with open hands.\n\nConsensus Mechanism\n\nBig Eyes Coin, Bitcoin, and Ethereum use different consensus mechanisms.\n\nBitcoin uses a proof-of-work mechanism, which requires miners to solve complex mathematical puzzles in order to validate transactions and add them to the blockchain. This process consumes a lot of energy and is computationally intensive, which has led to concerns about its sustainability.\n\nEthereum uses a proof-of-stake mechanism, which is less energy-intensive and requires validators to hold a certain amount of the cryptocurrency to validate transactions. This means that the validation process is less centralized, as it is not dominated by a small group of miners with large amounts of computing power.\n\nOne of the key selling points of Big Eyes Coin is its use of a new consensus mechanism called \u201cProof of Attention\u201d (PoA), which rewards users for actively participating in the network. This is a departure from the traditional \u201cProof of Work\u201d (PoW) and \u201cProof of Stake\u201d (PoS) mechanisms used by most other cryptocurrencies and is thought to be more energy-efficient and secure.\n\nSize and Kind of Community\n\nThe community and development behind each cryptocurrency is an important differentiating factor.\n\nBitcoin has a large and established community of developers, users, and businesses, who are actively working to improve the platform and make it more accessible to the general public.\n\nEthereum has a more decentralized and open-source development community, which allows for more collaboration and innovation.\n\nBig Eyes Coin has a strong and growing community of supporters and developers. This community is actively working to improve the cryptocurrency and make it more accessible and user-friendly for everyone. With its strong community support, Big Eyes Coin has the potential to grow and evolve quickly.\n\nUse Cases\n\nIt is important to consider the use cases and potential applications of each cryptocurrency before making a decision.\n\nBitcoin was created primarily as a form of payment, and is widely used as a store of value and a means of exchange.\n\nEthereum is a platform for decentralized applications, which has a wider range of potential uses and applications beyond just payments.\n\nBig Eyes Coin, a future-centric meme coin, focuses big on the privacy and security of its users. To achieve this goal, the cat-themed meme coin uses cutting-edge cryptographic technology that ensures confidentiality of transactions. This way, Big Eyes Coin lets its users stay private while making transactions, a feature that has the potential to make it popular in countries with stricter financial regulations.\n\nA New Dawn Is Here!\n\nAre you ready to welcome the new rising sun? Yes, we are talking about Big Eyes Coin, which is giving out a rollicking 200% bonus to its users as part of its promotional activities. If you want to join the exclusive group of BIG investors, use the promotional code LAUNCHBIGEYES200 to get your hands on the meme coin.\n\nBitcoin, Ethereum, and Big Eyes are very different from each other due to their certain features. Big Eyes Coin looks all set to finish among the leaders of the crypto industry, largely due to its unique attributes, including a combination network, rapid transaction times, low costs, a strong security focus, the possibility for widespread usage, eco-friendly infrastructure, and expanding community backing. Due to all these exclusive features, Big Eyes Coin is positioned to be a significant influencer in the cryptocurrency landscape in the future.\n\nFind Out More About Big Eyes Coin (BIG):\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nSushiSwap is making good on its January promises to launch a derivatives trading platform. But instead of building it from scratch, it\u2019s gone out and bought one.\n\nThe popular Ethereum-based decentralized exchange (DEX) announced the acquisition of Vortex Protocol today for an undisclosed amount.\n\nBuilt atop Sei Network, a blockchain using Cosmos\u2019 tooling, the on-chain trading platform will come under the SushiSwap umbrella as another product and will take a new name.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nVortex Protocol is a not-yet-launched decentralized derivatives exchange and will offer users 10x margin trading on a variety of assets. Sei Network and Sushi\u2019s newly-acquired Vortex Protocol will both launch on mainnet in Q2 of 2023.\n\n\u201cThis acquisition is a direct partnership between the SEI, Vortex, and Sushi teams to help bring to market the first fully on-chain perpetual DEX via Sushi,\u201d SushiSwap\u2019s CEO Jared Grey told Decrypt.\n\nThe co-founder of Sei Network Jayendra Jog said that conversations around the acquisition began at the end of last year.\n\nSushiSwap to launch on Cosmos\n\nThe move also means that SushiSwap will be one of the first Ethereum applications to make the move over to the Cosmos ecosystem. Another Ethereum-native derivatives exchange called dYdx has also signaled that it would aim to launch on Cosmos in Q2.\n\nThe advantage of building on Cosmos is that it lets developers spin up blockchains specifically tailored to a project\u2019s needs. From modifying the network's consensus mechanism or opting to run a native validator set (rather than turn to Cosmos for shared security), it\u2019s all in the developers' hands, says Jog.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe chose to make use of the Cosmos SDK [Software Development Kit] because it's extremely modular and extremely easy to get a chain off the ground,\u201d the Sei Network co-founder told Decrypt. \u201cAnd then you can tweak whatever you need to tweak to make that chain better.\u201d\n\nAnd this is precisely what Sei and Vortex have done.\n\nPurpose-built for spinning up decentralized exchanges, Jog explained that the Sei team has adjusted block processing on the chain, decreased finality to 300 milliseconds, and introduced a feature called parallelization that boasts up to 22,000 orders per second on its internal testnet.\n\nThese features, and \u201ca cross-chain thesis that we resonated with,\u201d are all part of what made the latest acquisition so enticing, said SushiSwap\u2019s Jared Grey."

        "content": "The consensus a cryptocurrency uses determines how transactions are formed on the blockchain. If a cryptocurrency uses a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus, transactions are confirmed by trusted validators on the network. However, for Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains, the crypto miner has to generate a target hash that is less than or equal to that of the block. Miners use devices that generate computations quickly to achieve this.\n\nBitcoin (BTC), the blockchain industry pioneer, utilizes the PoW consensus. However, Ethereum (ETH), the altcoin leader, has recently switched to a PoS consensus. Each mode of consensus has its merits and its downfalls, and this editorial piece will examine each crypto ecosystem and determine which is better.\n\nEthereum \u2013 Solving Scalability With PoS\n\nEthereum is undoubtedly one of the most prolific figures in the blockchain industry. The crypto giant has provided explosive returns for its users and recently switched to a PoS consensus to heighten its performance.\n\nPoW was Ethereum\u2019s initial consensus. However, in September 2022, Ethereum switched to a PoS consensus to combat its high energy consumption and low performance. The switch allowed Ethereum to increase its transaction speed to 100,000 per second, improving its scalability!\n\nAnother benefit that came from the switch to a PoS consensus was its reduction in energy consumption. The Ethereum platform reduced its carbon footprint by 99.95%, increasing its sustainability and the sustainability of the dApps built on the Ethereum network.\n\nEthereum\u2019s PoS consensus could have contributed to its recent positive market trend. The platform has increased its market capitalization by 6.16% in the past seven days at the time of writing. This positive trend has brought Ethereum\u2019s market capitalization to an eye-watering $204 billion, showcasing its importance in the crypto market.\n\nThe Pioneer Of The Crypto Market \u2013 Bitcoin\n\nAs many know, Bitcoin is the crypto market powerhouse. The platform has created many millionaires through its explosive growth from its inception. In July 2010, Bitcoin began trading at $0.0008. However, at the time of writing, the coin is worth $23,186.66, with an all-time high of $68,000.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s dominance is apparent because it was the first cryptocurrency in existence. The platform has survived each bear market that has destroyed other cryptocurrencies, even while utilising a consensus that limits its performance.\n\nIt is reported that Bitcoin uses the same energy annually as multiple countries! However, the PoW consensus that Bitcoin utilizes ensures a high level of security for the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nWhile PoS blockchains require validators to process transactions, PoW blockchains use miners to add new blocks to the blockchain. Although this method of consensus takes longer, it allows miners to earn crypto rewards in the mining process.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nAs mentioned above, each mode of consensus has its merits and downfalls. PoS blockchains focus on scalability, sustainability, and overall performance. On the other hand, PoW blockchains focus on security, crypto rewards, and providing a decentralized method of verifying transactions\n\nSo, which crypto giant out of Bitcoin and Ethereum hosts the better consensus? In the current state of the world, sustainability is now a priority. This is one of the main reasons why Ethereum has switched to a PoS consensus and why it is now the preferred mode of consensus within the blockchain industry.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "ETHEREUM GOVERNANCE: UNDERSTANDING THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS AND ITS IMPACT ON THE ... - Island Echo",
        "content": "Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain platform that enables developers to build and deploy decentralized applications (dApps). Unlike other blockchain platforms, Ethereum has a unique governance structure that allows its community to make decisions that shape the future of the network. This article will provide an overview of Ethereum governance and explore the process of decision-making, its impact on the network\u2019s development and direction, and the challenges and criticisms associated with it. Those who are prepared to take on the risks may be rewarded with rewards if the market goes up therefore for investing in cryptos check Immediate Edge.\n\nWhat is Ethereum Governance?\n\nEthereum Governance: An Overview\n\nEthereum governance refers to the process by which decisions are made and changes are implemented on the Ethereum network. It is a decentralized process that allows the community to collectively make decisions that impact the network\u2019s direction and development. Unlike traditional centralized systems, where decisions are made by a single entity, in Ethereum, decisions are made by a consensus of stakeholders, including developers, users, and token holders.\n\nArticle continues below this advertisement\n\nThe Decision-Making Process\n\nThe Mechanics of Ethereum Governance\n\nThe decision-making process in Ethereum is done through a series of proposals, discussions, and voting. The process starts with the proposal of a change or an improvement to the network, which is then discussed and evaluated by the community. If a consensus is reached, a vote is held to determine whether or not the change should be implemented. The outcome of the vote is determined by the number of tokens held by each participant, with each token giving the holder a proportional say in the decision.\n\nThe process of decision-making in Ethereum is transparent and open to all participants, allowing everyone to have a voice in shaping the future of the network. This system of decision-making ensures that the community has control over the direction and development of the network and that changes are made in the best interests of the majority of stakeholders.\n\nImpact on Network Development and Direction\n\nThe Influence of Governance on Ethereum\u2019s Evolution\n\nThe decentralized governance structure of Ethereum has had a significant impact on the network\u2019s development and direction. It allows the community to make decisions that are in line with their needs and interests, leading to the creation of new and innovative solutions. This has helped the network to evolve and adapt to the changing needs of its users and stay ahead of the curve in terms of innovation and progress.\n\nArticle continues below this advertisement\n\nOne of the most notable examples of Ethereum\u2019s governance in action was the decision to implement the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade. The upgrade aimed to address some of the scalability and security issues that were hindering the growth of the network. Through the Ethereum governance process, the community was able to make the decision to implement the upgrade, which has since been hailed as a major milestone in the network\u2019s evolution.\n\nChallenges and Criticisms\n\nThe Limitations and Controversies Surrounding Ethereum Governance\n\nDespite its many benefits, Ethereum governance is not without its challenges and criticisms. One of the biggest challenges is ensuring that the community reaches a consensus on important decisions. This can be difficult, as the community is often divided on key issues and there may be disagreements on the best course of action.\n\nAnother criticism of Ethereum governance is that it can be susceptible to manipulation by large token holders. This is because the decision-making process is based on the number of tokens held, rather than the number of people participating. This means that those with large token holdings have more influence over the decision-making process and can potentially sway the outcome of votes.\n\nArticle continues below this advertisement\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Future of Ethereum Governance\n\nEthereum governance is a critical component of the network\u2019s success and a key factor in its ability to evolve and adapt to changing needs. While it has proven to be effective in guiding the development and direction of the network, it is not without its challenges and criticisms. Despite these, the decentralized governance structure remains a unique and innovative aspect of Ethereum, allowing the community to have a direct say in the future of the network.\n\nAs the network continues to grow and evolve, it is important that the Ethereum governance process remains transparent and inclusive, allowing for a diverse range of voices to be heard. The future of Ethereum will be shaped by the decisions made through this process, and it is crucial that the community works together to ensure that the network remains a leader in innovation and progress.\n\nIn conclusion, Ethereum governance is a complex and dynamic process that has a profound impact on the network\u2019s development and direction. It is essential that the community understands the mechanics of the process and works together to ensure that the network remains a decentralized and open platform for innovation and progress."

        "title": "Comparing Bitcoin and Ethereum to find a Superior one - THISDAY Newspapers",
        "content": "Bitcoin has become the most hyped cryptocurrency worldwide in the last few years, with the largest market capitalization. Satoshi Nakamoto created an anonymous identity, but later, he left the project, and some other blockchain developers created Bitcoin. During the pandemic, Bitcoin has given unbelievable returns and have left precious metal behind. Anyone can invest in Bitcoin through The News Spy. The reason behind creating Bitcoin is a digitalized current monetary system where users can be on both of their own money.\n\nEthereum can be defined as a global software, and it is powered by blockchain technology to facilitate other Decentralized applications to carry on their product and services. Anyone can use it to create secure digital technology. Ethereum has its currency known as the ether, which is used to pay for the work supporting blockchain. But the users of Ethereum can also pay through tangible goods and services. Ethereum work on work of stake as it is less energy intensive and is about to launch its second version, known as Ethereum 2.0.\n\nComparison between Ethereum and Bitcoin\n\nProof of work and proof of stake\n\nBitcoin was not created, although it is mined with the help of superpower computers that use a heavy amount of electricity. At the same time, Ethereum uses proof of steak and does not create the hunger for electricity. The bitcoin consensus protocol is known as proof of work through which Bitcoin allows its network nodes to access recorded information and prevent it from specific cyber-attacks and hacks. In 2022 Ethereum moved from proof of work to proof of stake with interconnected upgrades, which will make Ethereum a more secure network.\n\nOne of the most significant criticisms of using proof of work is that it requires computational power, which is highly energy intensive. At the same time, proof of stake substitutes computational power with staking, which makes it less management intensive.\n\nPurpose\n\nBitcoin was created to digitalize the current monetary system and pull out the control of financial affairs from a single identity or government officials. Because Bitcoin does not involve any government authority in its economic matters, it can also be used to make anonymous payments from one country to another and from one source to another. Still, it was designed to facilitate monetized operations with the help of smart contracts.\n\nFuture\n\nThe Bitcoin ecosystem continuously grows due to its high return and price volatility. Also, Bitcoin is the oldest cryptocurrency which has gained too much hype in recent years. Bitcoin network is continuously lighting up with the different projects working on a second layer protocol which helps to take the transaction off the chain and results in a speeding up and more efficient monetary network.\n\nThe Ethereum ecosystem will grow with the increased use of decentralized applications in finance. Ethereum is also the home for many other decentralized investment plans like NFT defy and other decentralized applications. Ethereum holds a bright future due to its multiple uses.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum\n\nBitcoin can be used as a store of value and a medium of exchange, providing alternatives to traditional currencies. In contrast, Ethereum is used to find numerous applications like NFT and intelligent contracts. Bitcoin has the potential to push the economy toward complete digitalization. Many companies and economies use bitcoin to make and receive payments. In comparison, the Ethereum blockchain network is used by many developers to facilitate decentralization applications. You can also use the Ethereum blockchain for decentralized application investments like NFT, Dpps, and other decentralization investments.\n\nWrapping up\n\nBoth currencies have the same roots but different workplaces. Both coins have a bright future. Bitcoin can become a Medium of exchange in the coming future, whereas Ethereum can be used for other decentralized investments. On the other hand, one should be careful about Bitcoin and Ethereum prices as these are the most volatile currencies. The prices can be changed within minutes and let you fall into losses. Therefore, it is better to get the required knowledge before indulging them in your monetary system. It may not give you an excess profit, but it can save you from bearing losses.\n\nBottom line\n\nWith the details given here, it is clear that bitcoin is the most trusted and fair coin as per the technology needed in the modern world. So, make sure to opt for the most preferred coin in the crypto, which is none other than bitcoin today."

        "content": "Traders are reminded of a major development in the cryptocurrency world. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong expressed concerns about the possible elimination of cryptocurrency staking for retail clients by the SEC.\n\nLater, it was announced that Kraken, one of the longest-running crypto exchanges, reached a $30 million settlement with the SEC on the issue.\n\nIn recent hours, information has also emerged regarding regulators\u2019 persecution of large centralized stablecoin issuers.\n\nThese events come shortly after the White House\u2019s statement regarding its concerns about cryptocurrencies. Ironic situation when considering that several US regulators in recent years have received funding from the FTX exchange, and now find the future of cryptocurrencies in their hands.\n\nFunding that after the exchange goes bankrupt could be part of the bankruptcy recovery action and be returned.\n\nScrolling down the Top 30 list, only one green sign stands out.\n\nIt is that of Polygon (MATIC), which from last Friday\u2019s levels is registering a rise that exceeds 6%. The token, which plays an important role in the Polygon platform ecosystem, is on its way to ending its 6th consecutive upward week. After about 10 months, the MATIC digital token recovers $1.3, gaining more than 70% since the beginning of the year.\n\nAnalysis of Bitcoin (BTC)\n\nAfter sustained gains in January, Bitcoin (BTC) is set to close the week down for the 2nd consecutive time, with prices hovering around $21,800.\n\nShould these levels hold until Sunday\u2019s close, there would be a decline from the $22,900 with which the week began.\n\nScenario that should not surprise readers of these pages who follow the cryptocurrency market. As hypothesized in my last update published on Tuesday, an imminent close of the monthly cycle, expected between the end of this week and the beginning of next week, was being reported, which would be characterized by a continuation of the bearish trend.\n\nThe cyclical structure is taking shape confirming a final phase of a major cycle, such as the monthly cycle, in which prices are subject to downturns.\n\nHowever, the presence of an ongoing monthly cycle and its conclusion could be an important factor to consider when analyzing future market trends.\n\nTechnically, it is important that any continuation of the descent does not push prices too far down and in any case below $20,600. This level coincides with the last valid support built in mid-January during the last bullish run.\n\nEthereum (ETH) performance\n\nThe move backwards brings Ethereum (ETH) prices back to test the crucial $1,520 USD support. A level that has been an opportunity for a rebound several times since mid-January.\n\nRebounds that have been unsupported by new buying that has so far failed to confirm momentum beyond the $1,620 resistance, previous to the November highs.\n\nOver the weekend, it is important for ETH to confirm the holding of current support. A breakout of $1,500 could result in the stimulation of bearish speculation that would find space for a descent down to the $1,420 USD area, caused by the lack of validly built supports during the last ascent in January.\n\nIn the coming days or weeks, only an overtaking of $1,650 accompanied by volumes would create the conditions for a new bullish extension with the next target in the $1,750 USD area."

        "title": "Ethereum Classic (ETC) Price Prediction - - Blockzeit",
        "content": "The Ethereum cryptocurrency (ETH) is nowadays one of the most popular altcoins of the current generation. In 2022, this crypt became the second most popular, right after the master of cryptocurrencies \u2013 Bitcoin.\n\nA distinctive feature of Ethereum, unlike Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, is its usefulness as a software network that allows developers to create and launch new tools, applications, and NFT. Blockchain-based software network has many applications and applications in the world of technology, especially for games, music, entertainment, and decentralized finance (DeFi), which makes it one of the most popular and widely used cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhat happened to ETH?\n\nEthereum was founded in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin, and by 2022 has become one of the most popular coins and platforms for cryptocurrency transactions at the same time. ETN does not position itself as an alternative to Bitcoin. It is precise that, because, for a long time, it was this coin that was second in reliability and demand among users.\n\nJust a few months ago, Ethereum could be called the most reliable and profitable altcoin in existence. But as you may know, the world of cryptocurrency is so unpredictable and changeable.\n\nFrom its foundation until September 2022, Ethereum worked on the Proof of Work mechanism, which meant receiving a reward for solving complex mining tasks. Simply put, it is on this system that the mining process of almost any cryptocurrency works, and it began with the founding of Bitcoin. But on September 15 of this year, I will not be afraid of this word, a historic event occurred in the crypto industry \u2015 Ethereum announced the \u201cMerger\u201d project and switched to the Proof of Stake system. What could it mean and how it will affect Ethereum Classic price prediction? Let\u2019s discuss this.\n\nIf in the first case, every miner who has at least some capacities and resources has a chance to get a reward for the extracted block, then in the second case the system automatically selects the users who have enough cryptocurrency in their wallets, that is, there is a certain share of crypts in use.\n\nAnd now Ethereum switches completely to this algorithm of work, which terrifies the crypto community. Critics are shouting with might and main that it will not be at all soon, ETH lovers are anxiously eyeing the price drop, and newcomers do not know whether it is worth trying to mine a coin in 2022.\n\nIn general, the situation seems to be a stalemate. But even here, experts\u2019 opinions on the future of cryptocurrencies vary. So I would like to learn more about all possible predictions.\n\nForecasts for the future of ETH\n\nNow Ethereum is proudly called Ethereum 2.0 and opens a new era of the digital world before our eyes.\n\nImmediately after the procedure of switching to PoS, Ethereum dropped significantly in price and capitalization. Apparently, at this point, many users completely stopped believing in it. But after a little more than a month, the indicators gradually began to grow \u2013 the capitalization increased by more than $ 31 billion, and the exchange rate rose by $ 200.\n\nJudging by this situation, everything is okay with the Ether. And what do analysts think about this? Every expert claims that it is almost impossible to give a precise forecast, however, there are several opinions on this.\n\nSome experts bet that despite fluctuations, in 2023 the average price of one ETH will be about $ 2,000, while at first, it may fall to a minimum of $ 1,300, and in December it will rise to a maximum of $ 2,400.\n\nOther experts believe miners can get much more benefits from the transition than it seems. But the main thing is the opportunity to save on purchasing expensive mining equipment. They also believe that the negative reaction of miners to the changes is not entirely justified, because if you look at the coin in the long term, PoS opens up much more opportunities to users than PoW.\n\nAccording to the most negative scenario, ETN may break through the bottom with a rate of $ 330 in 2023, and this may happen approximately in May. But at the same time, by November, ETH will update its maximum \u2013 $ 2,500.\n\nAs for long-term forecasts, analysts are confident in the further growth of Ether. It is assumed that by the end of the decade, the cryptocurrency could reach $ 50,000 (to be precise, $50,788).\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nDespite Ethereum\u2019s competition and other elements that contribute to its ongoing volatility, \u0435here is a general feeling of enthusiasm that the original smart contract blockchain will endure these difficulties."

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum in Dubai: a new school will accept crypto payments for its tuition fees. In this way, the mass adoption of cryptocurrencies is also progressing in education. The news was also reported on Bitcoin Archive\u2018s official Twitter profile, which reads:\n\nJUST IN: Students can now pay tuition with #Bitcoin and crypto at the Canadian University of Dubai! \ud83d\ude4c \u2014 Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) February 9, 2023\n\nDubai increasingly keen on crypto: Bitcoin payments at schools\n\nAfter becoming home to multiple digital asset companies in recent months, Dubai wants to improve cryptocurrency adoption through other tactics. This time, a local school has reportedly said it wants to start accepting digital asset payments for things like tuition fees.\n\nThe Citizens School in Dubai, a wealthy city in the United Arab Emirates, said families will be able to pay tuition in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH). The two cryptocurrencies will be accepted as forms of payment, and will be automatically converted into the local currency (AED).\n\nCitizens School, which will open next September precisely in downtown Dubai, will have the structure of an international school, and will accommodate students aged 3 to 18.\n\nHisham Hodroge, CEO of Citizens School, said in this regard:\n\n\u201cIntroducing the ability to pay tuition using cryptocurrencies goes beyond simply offering an alternative payment method. It is rather a way to boost interest in blockchain technology. Citizens School intends to leverage this technology in many of its administrative and academic operations in the future.\u201d\n\nAs such, Bitcoin and Ethereum in Dubai will not be mere forms of payment. Instead, the UAE city seems to be focusing heavily on the adoption of blockchain technology and its organic integration.\n\nIndeed, lately we have seen the creation of very crypto-friendly regulations throughout the Emirates.\n\nThe exchanges Binance and FTX, for example, have recently received licenses to begin their operations in this state.\n\nDubai and the regulatory framework for crypto: not only Bitcoin\n\nThe decision of crypto payments in the school was driven primarily by recent actions taken by the city\u2019s authorities to establish a regulatory framework for digital assets and turn Dubai into a cryptocurrency hub.\n\nAdil Alzarooni, Founder of Citizens School, commented on the matter:\n\n\u201cA while back, cryptocurrency was just a floating term among savvy investors. However, today cryptocurrency is becoming much more mainstream, reshaping the traditional financial system. Similarly, Citizens is disrupting the education sector by reinventing every element of the learning experience.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Alzarooni noted that the addition of digital asset payments should strengthen the role of the younger generation in developing the country\u2019s digital economy.\n\nAs anticipated, there are also other pro-crypto actions taken recently by Dubai authorities.\n\nFor example, the two most recent companies to outline such intentions in Dubai are Bybit and Crypto.com. Specifically, Bybit has received approval in principle to conduct a full range of virtual asset businesses in Dubai.\n\nCrypto.com, on the other hand, has promised to start recruiting heavily in the coming months to establish a \u201csignificant presence\u201d in the UAE.\n\nDubai\u2019s new guidelines for virtual asset service providers\n\nAnother recent development involving Dubai concerns the new crypto guidelines for digital asset service providers. In which the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority\u2018s new set of regulations sets out requirements for crypto companies that cover everything from issuing and exchange services to advertising.\n\nAccording to Irina Heaver, a cryptocurrency and blockchain lawyer based in the United Arab Emirates, VARA has issued its \u201cComprehensive Market Product Regulation,\u201d which includes four mandatory regulations and activity-specific regulations that set the rules for the operation of VASPs.\n\nThe Dubai regulator also emphasized that all market participants, whether licensed by VARA or not, must comply with regulations for marketing, advertising, and promotions.\n\nIn general, regulators around the world are racing to establish oversight of cryptocurrencies after last year\u2019s market crash led to the implosion of many of the high-profile digital asset lending and exchange platforms.\n\nThe European Union is poised to approve its own licensing regime, while the United Kingdom, South Korea and other jurisdictions are rapidly forming their own frameworks\n\nIn any case, Dubai\u2019s new framework, which also covers advertising and promotion requirements for crypto companies, still needs final approval before it can be implemented."
