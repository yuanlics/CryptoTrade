        "title": "What's a Better Buy: Ethereum or Solana? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Since Ethereum (ETH -0.11%) was created in 2015 it has radically altered the cryptocurrency landscape. Thanks to an innovation known as smart contracts, developers could create blockchain-based applications that automatically run and transfer value when certain criteria are met.\n\nInitially, Ethereum was the only smart-contract-capable blockchain, but in recent years this has changed. New blockchains have come into existence that not only offer smart contract functionality, but also a slew of other features hoping to build off of Ethereum.\n\nOne of those blockchains is Solana (SOL -2.87%), a blazingly fast smart contract blockchain that has a considerable user base and is the 10th most valuable cryptocurrency by market cap. Many believe Solana could eventually outdo Ethereum as the premier smart contract blockchain, but those hopes might be greatly inflated.\n\nA looming problem\n\nFirst, let's address the elephant in the room: Solana's multiple outages. Over the past year, Solana has experienced at least six network outages, including the most recent one in February where the blockchain was down for more than 18 hours, disrupting a number of exchanges and apps running on the network.\n\nIn contrast, Ethereum has a proven track record of stability and reliability. Ethereum's network has been operating smoothly for years, even with the increasing demand for decentralized applications and smart contracts.\n\nThe undisputed DeFi champ\n\nAnother key factor to consider when comparing Ethereum and Solana is the total value locked (TVL) metric. TVL is an important measure of the adoption and usage of a blockchain in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi). Since DeFi functionality is one of the primary use cases for both Ethereum and Solana, evaluating TVL can be an easy way to compare the two.\n\nEthereum utterly dominates the decentralized finance (DeFi) market with a TVL of more than $31 billion, compared to Solana's TVL of just over $292 million. That means Ethereum supports 100 times more value in DeFi than Solana. Clearly, the competition isn't even close and demonstrates the greater adoption and usage of Ethereum's network in the DeFi market. From this perspective, Ethereum is a much more attractive investment option for those looking to tap into the growing DeFi niche.\n\nSpeed isn't everything\n\nFans of Solana often say that it has some of the fastest transaction speeds. While this is true, it distorts the purpose of a blockchain. One of the primary reasons blockchain technology is so profound is because it allows users to transfer value in a decentralized and secure fashion. While Solana prioritizes speed, it sacrifices higher levels of decentralization and security found in Ethereum.\n\nAlthough many are quick to point out that Ethereum moves at a snail's pace compared to Solana, they also fail to realize that there is serious progress being made to narrow this gap thanks to new solutions known as Layer 2s.\n\nThrough the use of Layer 2 solutions such as Optimism, Polygon, and Arbitrum, Ethereum is transformed into a lightning-fast network, while also maintaining its decentralized and secure nature. As these solutions continue to be developed and adopted, Ethereum's competitive advantage over Solana will likely become even more apparent.\n\nThe big picture\n\nSo, what does this mean for investors looking to pick between Solana and Ethereum? Although Solana may seem like a tempting option with its impressive speed, the lack of value it supports in DeFi and the sacrifices in decentralization and security make it a riskier investment, especially considering it still remains down more than 90% from its all time high.\n\nEthereum, on the other hand, has a proven track record and a solid foundation in the decentralized finance market. Its market dominance, along with the development of Layer 2 solutions, makes it a safer and more promising investment for those looking for long-term growth."

        "content": "The reason for differentiating reward withdrawals from full exits comes from how Ethereum\u2019s staking system works. Individual stakers or staking services have to lock up exactly 32 ETH to open a node and earn rewards for securing the network. Keeping the accrued rewards in the validator node does not improve the node\u2019s return. Acheson explained that it\u2019s logical for stakers to withdraw rewards, bundle the tokens and establish new nodes to increase potential returns."

        "content": "Prices of bitcoin and ether\u2014the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization\u2014are usually closely correlated, but that's changing after Ethereum's Shanghai Upgrade, and it could affect investments and risk management for cryptocurrency investors.\n\nKey Takeaways Ether and Bitcoin have moved together in the past, with the exception of the time period around The Merge.\n\nThe lack of correlation increased after Ethereum's Shanghai (Shapella) hard fork.\n\nAt the same time, bitcoin has continued its correlation with the Nasdaq.\n\nEther and Bitcoin's Correlation\n\nAccording to a recent report by Coinbase, the correlation between bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) has been declining since the beginning of 2023 and the rift widened after Ethereum's Shanghai (Shapella) hard fork. The upgrade, completed on April 12, allowed users to withdraw staked ether for the first time.\n\nThe BTC-ETH correlation based on a 40-day rolling window has fallen from 0.95 to 0.82 during that time. In the past, these two crypto assets have mostly moved lockstep.\n\n\n\nThe report attributes this trend to several factors, such as the increasing adoption of Ethereum-based decentralized applications (DApps), the growing popularity of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and the transition of the network from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.\n\nHow Declining Correlation Impacts Investments\n\nLower BTC-ETH correlation could have implications for portfolio diversification and risk management. For institutional investors, it could mean a change in their hedging strategies.\n\n\"The relevance of this falling correlation for institutional investors is that it can affect quantitative strategies that rely on cross hedging one asset for the other (or using ETH as a hedge for less liquid altcoins),\" said Coinbase analysts.\n\nFor investors who want to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency market, holding both BTC and ETH could provide more benefits than holding either one alone, as they could reduce the overall volatility and increase the potential returns of their portfolio.\n\nHowever, the report cautions that correlation is not a static measure and could change over time depending on market conditions and developments in both networks.\n\nBitcoin Still Correlated with Nasdaq\n\nBitcoin is often touted as a hedge against inflation and a safe haven asset in times of economic turmoil. However, a recent analysis by CoinDesk shows that the cryptocurrency's correlation with the ratio of Nasdaq 100 to S&P 500 index has increased significantly since late 2020, suggesting that bitcoin may be more sensitive to shifts in market sentiment and risk appetite than previously thought.\n\n\n\nThe ratio of Nasdaq 100 to S&P 500 reflects the relative performance of growth stocks versus value stocks. Growth stocks are typically associated with higher earnings growth potential and higher valuations, while value stocks are seen as undervalued and often pay dividends.\n\n\n\nAccording to CoinDesk, bitcoin's 90-day correlation coefficient with the Nasdaq-to-S&P 500 ratio rose to a record high of 0.79 in March 2021, up from -0.06 in September 2020.\n\n"

While its status appeared to be settled by the SEC\u2019s staff some time ago, the recent transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism has apparently given the current SEC Chair, Gary Gensler, an opportunity to re-examine the token.\n\nGensler is adamant that the crypto industry has been given perfect clarity on such matters, and has repeatedly declared that the rules for what constitutes a security are absolutely clear, transparent, and not open to interpretation.\n\nSo, is Ether, or ETH, a security, a commodity, or something else?\n\nLuckily we have gathered together all the experts who\u2019ve clearly answered this thorny question, in Blockworks\u2019 Ultimate Guide to Regulatory Clarity.\u2122\n\nWilliam Hinman, Director of the Division of Corporate Finance at the SEC, June 2018:\n\n\u201cBased on my understanding of the present state of Ether, the Ethereum network and its decentralized structure, current offers and sales of Ether are not securities transactions.\u201d\n\nLetitia James, New York Attorney General, March 2023:\n\n\u201cThe Tokens [including ETH] are securities because they each involve investments of money into a common enterprise with the expectation of profits due to the managerial efforts of the Tokens\u2019 respective founders, developers, and management teams.\u201d\n\nAlso Letitia James, New York Attorney General, March 2023:\n\n\u201cUnder both state and federal authority, ETH, LUNA, and UST are commodities.\u201d\n\nJay Clayton, Chair of the SEC, March 2019 (reinforcing Hinman, above):\n\n\u201cA digital asset may be offered and sold initially as a security because it meets the definition of an investment contract, but that designation may change over time if the digital asset later is offered and sold in such a way that it will no longer meet that definition.\u201d\n\nRostin Behnam, Chair of the CFTC, May 2022:\n\n\u201cI can say for sure Bitcoin, which is the largest of the coins and has always been the largest regardless of the total market cap of the entire digital asset market capitalization, is a commodity. Ether as well. I have argued this before, my predecessors as well said it is a commodity.\u201d\n\nGary Gensler, Chair of the SEC, April 2023 (refusing to answer the actual question):\n\n\u201cUmmm, I\u2026 I\u2026 it\u2019s\u2026 actually all securities are commodities under the Commodity and Exchange Act, it\u2019s that we\u2019re excluded commodities, but I would agree that a security cannot also be an excluded commodity and an included commodity.\u201d\n\nNow it\u2019s time for your multiple choice test.

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market has been experiencing significant turbulence lately, with Bitcoin, the most popular digital currency, dropping below the $30,000 price mark. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has also been affected, with its price dropping below the $2,000 mark and reaching the support price of $1,850. This has led to many investors wondering what will happen next. Will Ethereum crash to $1,000? Let\u2019s analyze in this Ethereum prediction article.\n\nWhat is Ethereum Blockchain?\n\nEthereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain platform that allows developers to build decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts. It was created in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin and has since grown to become one of the most popular blockchain platforms in the world.\n\nWhy is Ethereum Important?\n\nOne of the main reasons why Ethereum is important is that it enables developers to create decentralized applications that can run without the need for a centralized authority. This means that these applications can be more secure and less prone to censorship or manipulation. Ethereum also allows for the creation of smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts that can automate certain processes and eliminate the need for intermediaries.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis: Why is Ethereum Down?\n\nNow let\u2019s take a closer look at Ethereum\u2019s recent price action. Ethereum increased in prices from $1,400 and reached a high of $2,115. However, it retraced lower and reached the support price of $1,850. This is an important milestone for ETH, and future prices will be determined based on the next few days\u2019 price action.\n\nEthereum prediction: Will Ethereum Crash to $1,000?\n\nSo what can we expect from Ethereum\u2019s price in the near future? Based on current market trends, Ethereum should rebound from its current prices and reach $2,000 again. However, if the resistance price of $1,850 is breached lower, Ethereum is expected to crash lower and reach the next support at around $1,600. It\u2019s worth noting that Ethereum crashing to $1,000 is not in sight for now.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might also like\n\nMore from Altcoin"

Data from Etherscan as shared by Lookonchain shows that this wallet address reawakened with a massive amount of Ether tokens.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn Ethereum ICO participant woke up after 7.7 years of dormancy and transferred 1 $ETH to a new address.\n\n\n\nHe received 2,365 $ETH($4.42M currently) at Ethereum Genesis, the ETH ICO price is ~$0.31.https://t.co/hOfBSyml19 pic.twitter.com/yoMoB6vE9n \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 24, 2023\n\nTo revive the wallet, the ICO participant sent just one Ethereum token to a new address in what appears to be a functionality test. The ICO era wallet received a total of 2,365 during the public sale, which was priced at approximately $0.31 at the time.\n\nThis address has HODLed the tokens through the storm and, at present, the tokens are worth roughly $4.42 million. While it remains unclear what the reasons for the reawakening are, it can be inferred that the address is likely interested in staking the tokens now that Ethereum as a network now allows for such investment, as most institutional investors are currently doing.\n\nThe reasons could also be to liquidate the asset, but from antecedents, this owner has witnessed Ether hit its all-time high price above $4,000 and may not be so quick to offload the coin at this time.\n\nEthereum price growth as motivation\n\nReawakening the wallet may have different causes, but the trust in the potential of Ethereum to hit new milestones now that the Shapella upgrade is live remains good motivation.\n\nEthereum is currently changing hands at $1,846.50 as it is entering the week with a largely bearish stride. While the more than 11% slump over the trailing seven-day period can be tagged as a bad omen for the digital currency, it can spell an overselling move that can further attract more investors to accumulate the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe digital currency ecosystem is still very volatile, and Ethereum has what it takes to benefit from this industry feature."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s gas price reached a 10-month high.\n\nThe ETH price was affected by the gains collected by meme traders.\n\nThe reappearance of seemingly profitable memes has helped Ethereum [ETH] record a whooping 73% hike in gas fees. Throughout the week that ended on 22 April, several meme cryptocurrencies caught the attention of the crypto community.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nIndebted to the resurgence\n\nCoincidentally, these highly volatile assets, which were mostly traded on the Arbitrium [ARB] network, engaged in an exchange of ETH. According to IntoTheBlock data, the rise in gas usage made Ethereum $66.7 million within the timeframe.\n\nEthereum fees rose a whopping 73% this week, with meme coin speculation driving gas costs.#ETH #PEPE pic.twitter.com/5U6xBMVFur \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) April 22, 2023\n\nIt is worth noting that increased activity on the Ethereum network can cause congestion and drive up fees.\n\nAlthough memes are considered high-risk assets and subject to sudden spikes and drops, there were a bunch of them which exhibited incredible performances in the past week.\n\nSome of these recently emerged memes include PEPE, whose market cap hit 100x within a few days. ArbDogeAI\u2019s [AIDOGE] value increased by over 7,000% last week. And most lately, the focus has been on REKT.\n\nThough most of these assets were currently experiencing a correction, they were instrumental to the rise of ETH circulation. At the time of writing, Santiment revealed that ETH\u2019s circulating supply rose significantly from 12 April.\n\nWhile the momentum cooled off, the hike meant that a lot of ETH was used in transactions in the last seven days. However, there has also been a decline in the average gas used.\n\nGridlock and reversals\n\nAccording to Santiment\u2019s data, the average gas used has dropped to 43.99 Gwei. This reflected how traders have restrained from exchanging more ETH for other cryptocurrencies.\n\nInterestingly, Glassnode reported on 23 April that Ethereum\u2019s average gas price reached a 10-month high. In a number of cases, ETH gas fees increase when there is a high demand for cryptocurrency. So, the price increased for the average user in order to avoid clogging.\n\nMeanwhile, ETH\u2019s exchange inflow subsided at press time. The metric, which determines how much of the altcoin is flowing into exchanges, was at 18,200.\n\nBut over the week, there were several spikes that consented to increased activity since the memes were traded on Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs).\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC terms\n\nIt was a similar situation with the exchange outflow. As of this writing, the metric was at 5,563. But with a large difference between the outflow and inflow, this condition suggested more of an ETH selling pressure.\n\nAs expected from cryptocurrencies under the meme bracket, the hype around the aforementioned tokens has dropped. And due to their hit-and-miss nature, investors may be looking to reconsider their risk appetite."

        "title": "Layer 0 Blockchain Protocols Explained | Definition & Examples - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "This guide focuses on the Layer 0 Blockchain networks, explaining what they are, the problems they solve, and how they work, as well as offering a breakdown of their architectures. Additionally, the guide also features a few examples of noteworthy Layer 0 blockchains currently in the market and their use cases.\n\nWhat is a Layer 0 Blockchain?\n\nDefinition A Layer 0 Blockchain is a protocol infrastructure on top of which other blockchains (particularly Layer 1s) are built. Think of it as a blockchain for blockchains. It is a foundational layer that comprises hardware, miners, connections, and a support framework for other decentralized protocols enabling easy cross-chain interoperability, scalability, and shared security. It is the underlying physical layer of the blockchain network.\n\nSo far, there are four layers of blockchains. They are:\n\nLayer 0 ;\n\n; Layer 1 ;\n\n; Layer 2 ;\n\n; Layer 3.\n\nLayer 3 Blockchain is the application layer that builds on top of the blockchain protocols and provides decentralized applications, smart contracts, and other value-added services to the network.\n\nLayer 2 blockchain refers to a scaling solution that operates on top of the main blockchain protocol and aims to increase its throughput, reduce transaction fees, and enhance user experience. They are an alternative to Layer 0 but with far fewer benefits compared to their counterparts.\n\nMost leading blockchains currently in the market are considered Layer 1 or base layer protocols. They include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Litecoin (LTC). However, due to their growing popularity over the last decade, it has become evident that they are prone to some key drawbacks.\n\nThe challenges include what is known as the \u2018blockchain trilemma,\u2019 a phrase coined by Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin. According to Buterin, blockchain developers have to choose amongst three priority design aspects that will help define the focus of their protocols. These are scalability (speed), security, and decentralization.\n\nButerin posited that only two of these three aspects could be met for every decentralized protocol, but not all three. For example, Bitcoin, the flagship blockchain, is the most secure of its peers and (arguably) among the most decentralized, but it is slow, managing to process about five transactions per second (TPS) and a block production time of ten minutes.\n\nNewer blockchains have opted for scalability and decentralization while deprioritizing security, and this is where Layer 0 comes in. As you\u2019ll learn, these core layer protocols are designed to solve the biggest challenges facing Layer 1s, as described above.\n\nBlockchain Challenges Layer 0 Protocols Seek to Solve\n\nWith the growing popularity of blockchain technology, experts have managed to identify three main challenges that most decentralized network protocols face. These are:\n\nScalability ;\n\n; Cross-chain interoperability ;\n\n; Usability.\n\nThese three challenges represent the bulk of the issues faced by blockchains and their developers. Now, let\u2019s dig deeper into what they are.\n\nScalability\n\nScalability is a measure of how flexible a protocol is when handling an ever-increasing load of transactions. Most blockchains can easily handle low traffic typically experienced during their initial start.\n\nHowever, as they grow to accommodate a larger market share, they attract more traffic and users. This scenario leads to scaling challenges. As discussed before, blockchain designers have to decide which among three design aspects to focus on: scaling, security, or decentralization.\n\nMost of the newer protocols have placed a premium on scalability and decentralization through consensus mechanisms such as Proof of Stake (PoS). This way, they ensure that they can handle more transactions and achieve high flexibility when it comes to handling more users.\n\nTo achieve their target scalability objectives, most have sacrificed security, exposing them to attacks that have led to the loss of funds and critical information. This is what is the scalability trilemma every protocol designer has to go through when creating a new blockchain.\n\nInteroperability\n\nBlockchain interoperability is the ability for two or more blockchains to communicate and share resources. For instance, Bitcoin and Ethereum could be considered interoperable if applications created on either are able to communicate with each other.\n\nIt is, however, not the case in this situation and in most other cases since a majority of the current blockchains are created through unique designs adhering to custom protocols. The result is segregated and isolated services with varying user experiences.\n\nDevelopers have to learn varying skills and programming languages to adapt their applications or when creating new applications to run on various blockchain infrastructures.\n\nAs the blockchain scene matures, there is a growing need for the various decentralized applications (dApps) to communicate regardless of their host protocols. Different layered protocols, for instance, Layer 0s and Layer 1s, need to communicate to ensure the effective execution of tasks. The same is true of some Layer 1s and Layer 2 scalability solutions.\n\nThe most common solution for blockchain interoperability at the moment is using bridges, which are applications used to convert native tokens to be used on different protocols. However, there is a need for smoother interoperability as opposed to using bridges.\n\nFlexibility and usability\n\nFlexibility is the ease with which one can change from using one blockchain to the next. This is especially important for dApp developers looking to launch their applications on various networks.\n\nAt the moment, it is difficult designing one dApp to operate on multiple blockchains. For instance, a dApp created for Ethereum will not run on a competing chain, say Cardano or Solana. This means that a developer looking to launch a dApp on any or all of these platforms will have to create three versions of the same application.\n\nMore often than not, dApp developers will choose a single platform and create one version, thereby limiting their applications in terms of reach and features. There is a choice to make between launching an app on a scalable platform such as Solana or a more secure and decentralized one such as Ethereum.\n\nThere are merits and drawbacks to launching on any platform, but choosing one means losing out on the benefits of the other. This situation illustrates how inflexible the current blockchain development space is and why there is a need for a solution.\n\nHow Layer 0 Protocols Work to Solve These Challenges\n\nThere are three main elements that Layer 0 blockchain protocols have, and they are:\n\nMain chain; Side chain; Inter-blockchain transfer protocol.\n\nThese three elements complement each other to achieve the desired goals, which, for most L0 protocols, is providing interoperability and scalability for host networks. Here\u2019s a closer look into each element.\n\n1. Main chain\n\nAs the name alludes, the main chain is the central blockchain onto which transactions are recorded and kept immutably. It is the underlying infrastructure that runs the L0\u2019s governance and consensus mechanisms.\n\nThis means that information recorded from other derivative protocols or Layer 1s is kept on the main chain.\n\n2. Sidechain\n\nSidechains or base layer chains are protocols that are designed to host decentralized apps and scalability solutions. If you are a developer looking to launch your next dApp, you can do so on the side chain of an L0 blockchain.\n\nThe main advantage of using L0 side chains is that most Layer 0 protocols encourage the deployment of specialized side chains or Layer 1s, which means that end-user experiences are more controlled and optimized as opposed to using a single-layer blockchain.\n\nSide chain developers also have the option of designing their blockchains to use custom consensus mechanisms or opt to leverage the security of the underlying infrastructure or L0\u2019s consensus mechanism. This way, they can outsource the security of their network and focus on scalability and decentralization and thereby circumventing the scalability trilemma.\n\n3. Inter-blockchain transfer protocol\n\nThe final piece of the puzzle for Layer 0 blockchains is the cross-chain compatibility mechanism that enables various side chains to communicate with one another. A dApp on one blockchain platform can easily share data and information with another on a different side chain and with the L0.\n\nThere are several advantages to maintaining interoperability between various platforms, including enhancing specialization. Side chain developers no longer have to compromise on their creations. They now have the option of creating a highly-focused network that supports specialized dApps, which can share in/output data with other apps on different side chains to achieve their goals.\n\nPopular Layer 0 Blockchain Protocols\n\nLayer zero blockchain protocols are growing in number as more developers acknowledge the need and benefits of having more of these networks in place. So far, the more notable options in the marketplace include:\n\nVenom (VENOM) ;\n\n; Polkadot (DOT );\n\n); Cosmos (ATOM) ;\n\n; Avalanche (AVAX).\n\nAll Layer 0 protocols, like L1s, operate more or less in a similar manner, except for some nuanced features that help to differentiate them. Let\u2019s consider how these four L0 networks highlighted above operate and why they are worth an L1 developer\u2019s consideration for their next project.\n\n1. Venom Blockchain\n\nVenom Foundation\u2019s homepage\n\nVenom blockchain is a highly scalable, transparent, and secure Layer 0 network capable of processing as many as 100K \u2013 1M transactions every second. The protocol is Turing-complete, meaning that it can host self-executing scripts (smart contracts) like Ethereum and Solana.\n\nA standout feature of Venom is that it employs a hybrid consensus mechanism using both Proof of Stake (PoS staking) and Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT). Additionally, it is worth noting that the Venom Foundation, the entity behind the Venom L0 blockchain, is a fully regulated and registered institution by the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM).\n\nThe Venom blockchain maintains three distinct layers typical of layer zero networks, and they include:\n\nMasterchains \u2013 this is the main chain and the backbone of the Venom protocol that utilizes PoS and BFT consensus algorithms;\n\nWorkchains \u2013 these are specialized Layer-1 blockchains that can be used to achieve or serve various purposes.\n\nShardchains \u2013 these are blockchain partitions that are used to store and process a subset of the accounts running on the main chain. Sharding is what makes Venom highly scalable because the protocol can increase and reduce the number of shards dynamically according to demand.\n\n2. Polkadot (DOT)\n\nPolkadot homepage\n\nPolkadot is a creation of Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood which launched on mainnet in 2020. The network, considered a \u201cblockchain of blockchains,\u201d enables developers to launch fully-fledged decentralized networks, also called parallel chains or parachains.\n\nThe parachains are interconnected, ensuring easy communication and resource sharing through the main chain, also called the Relay Chain, which functions are the bridge between the various L1 blockchains.\n\nSimilar to Venom, Polkadot also uses sharding as a scalability solution in conjunction with nominated PoS staking, which is a slight variation on the PoS consensus mechanism. All in all, these features allow Polkadot to process between 1K and 100K transactions per second.\n\n3. Cosmos (ATOM)\n\nCosmos homepage\n\nCosmos is another popular Layer 0 blockchain with a history dating back to 2014. The network includes a mainchain called the Hub and multiple side chains called Zones.\n\nZones are, essentially, blockchains that can host decentralized apps and are able to communicate with other dApps through the network\u2019s Inter Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, thus enabling a seamless flow of data and information across the network.\n\nCosmos offers a suite of blockchain development tools called the Cosmos SDK (software development kit), which enables developers to whip up custom networks fast and cost-effectively.\n\nSo far, the Cosmos SDK has been used by developers to create several notable projects, including Binance\u2019s Decentralized Exchange (DEX). Cronos Blockchain, dYdX, Osmosis, Oasis Labs, Kava, and Evmos.\n\n4. Avalanche (AVAX)\n\nAvalanche homepage\n\nAvalanche was launched in 2020 by Ava Labs, a blockchain development studio led by former Cornell University associate professor Emin G\u00fcn Sirer. The project focuses on providing scaling solutions through its three constituent blockchain layers, i.e.: X-chain, C-chain, and P-chain.\n\nThe P-chain is the platform layer that handles governance by facilitating validator coordination, while X-chain handles asset swaps or exchanges. The last layer, the C-chain or contract-chain, is the layer that supports automated scripts (smart contracts) akin to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\n\nTogether, the X, C, and P Chains ensure that Avalanche is able to provide a base for launching and deploying dApps that are fast and scalable. The network is able to scale to infinity, with a sub-2 second transaction finality.\n\nFor consensus, Avalanche uses the common Proof of Stake, providing an avenue for blockchain investors to earn by staking their tokens and partaking in the network governance.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nBlockchain scalability is proving to be a major challenge hindering widespread adoption, hence the growing popularity of scaling solutions such as the Layer 2 and Layer 0 networks. The latter offers several advantages, including providing scaling platforms, and blockchain interoperability, among others.\n\nHowever, these L0 solutions are still in their early stages, and whether they manage to achieve their goals remains to be seen. The blockchain space is highly dynamic, with an ever-increasing number of new projects launching by the day. The only way to truly gauge the success of Layer 0 blockchains will be to gauge who uses them and the impact level of projects created on them.\n\nDisclaimer The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

Layer 0 blockchains are protocol infrastructure platforms on top of which other blockchains can be deployed. Essentially, they are blockchains for other blockchains.\n\nWhy are Layer 0s necessary? Layer 0 blockchains are essential because they enable seamless cross-chain interoperability and help fix blockchain scaling challenges.\n\nIs Ethereum a Layer 0? No, Ethereum is not a Layer 0 but rather a Layer 1 or base layer blockchain because it supports the deployment of decentralized apps. This is not a feature that is supported on the Layer 0 chains."

        "title": "Shibarium: Shiba Inu's Blockchain - DailyCoin",
        "content": "The upcoming Shibarium launch marks a critical turning point for Shiba Inu (SHIB). It signifies a long-awaited moment for the SHIB Army, when their beloved cryptocurrency evolves from a canine meme coin into a fully-fledged blockchain.\n\nShibarium promises to be the Shiba Inu community\u2019s home in the Web3 world. It represents the fulfillment of Ryoshi\u2019s vision and solidifies the Shiba Inu ecosystem. Led by Shytoshi Kusama, the Shib Army will finally leave Ethereum (ETH) forever and forge its own destiny with lower fees and newfound scalability.\n\nWhat exactly is Shibarium? What does this historic launch mean for SHIB holders, and what awaits the Shiba Inu community in this brave new world?\n\nWhat Is Shibarium?\n\nShibarium is a Layer-2 solution built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. Since Shiba Inu was first created back in 2020, the growth of its ecosystem has been restricted by Ethereum\u2019s scalability issues.\n\nHigh gas fees and slow network transactions on Ethereum have made dApps like ShibaSwap challenging to use, discouraging crypto newcomers from exploring Shiba Inu\u2019s potential.\n\nWith Shibarium, this is all set to change. By launching its own network, the Shiba Inu community will be able to grow its flourishing ecosystem without being inhibited by Ethereum\u2019s limitations.\n\nThe Shibarium blockchain will be faster and cheaper than Ethereum while still enjoying the base network\u2019s security.\n\nHow Does Shibarium Work?\n\nThe Shibarium blockchain uses a new consensus mechanism called Proof-of-Participation. In a PoP network, validator nodes are selected for verifying transactions and securing the network based on the number of BONE tokens they hold. This makes it far more energy efficient than Proof-of-Work chains like Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nLike most Ethereum Layer 2 networks, Shibarium will also operate an EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine), allowing developers to easily deploy Ethereum-based smart contracts and dApps on the new network.\n\nMoreover, Shibarium developers intend to create a permissionless bridge between the two networks, making it easy to migrate Shiba Inu tokens from Ethereum to Shibarium.\n\nShibarium History: The Story So Far\n\nRyoshi, the founder of the Shiba Inu, teased the idea of an entire blockchain dedicated to the community as far back as May 2021. In the now-deleted blog post, Ryoshi envisioned a network where developers and users could create and explore applications that would expand the Shiba Inu ecosystem.\n\nShytoshi Kusama, the lead developer, has kept information about the development of Shibarium behind closed doors. The blockchain has been in the works for years, with the secrecy and mystique only adding to anticipation and excitement.\n\nThat all changed in March 2023 with the release of the Shibarium beta testnet. Nicknamed Puppynet, the test network is open to the public. This allows every member of the Shib Army to test dApps and products and deploy smart contracts in a risk-free environment.\n\nThe Shibarium puppynet is expected to be the final step in the development process before the official mainnet launch of the Shibarium blockchain.\n\nThe Shibarium Launch\n\nOn August 16, 2023, it finally happened. Shytoshi Kusama, the Shibarium development team, and the SHIB Army had poured years of blood, sweat, and tears into the iconic network. While Shibarium went live as expected, the architects behind Shiba Inu\u2019s blockchain underestimated the demand.\n\nAmidst the excitement of Shibarium\u2019s launch, extreme demand sent the network into a fail-safe \u2018pause\u2019 state, effectively halting the network. As expected, this outage caused fear, uncertainty, and doubt throughout the Shiba Inu community. Who\u2019d have thought that after months of testing, Shibarium wouldn\u2019t be able to handle the influx of users on launch day?\n\nShytoshi Kusama wasted no time in running community damage control, announcing in a blog post that there were no inherent technical issues with Shibarium or the bridge to the network. The outage was a simple security feature designed to protect users if the network was overwhelmed.\n\nWhile the Shibarium development team had expected a surge of users on launch day, the reality was that they simply didn\u2019t purchase enough monthly compute units from Alchemy, their blockchain architecture provider.\n\nBased on testing, Shibarium is expected to need no more than 400 million monthly compute units. When the Shibarium launch expended over 160 million compute units in just half an hour, it became evident that Shibarium might be on track to become one of the most popular and active Layer 2 networks in the industry.\n\nThe Shibarium Bridge \u2013 Locked Funds\n\nEven after the halted network and ripples of FUD throughout the Shiba Inu community, the launch day drama was far from over. Wanting to be among the first to use Shibarium, hundreds of SHIB Army warriors attempted to bridge their funds to the network as quickly as possible.\n\nEager users were left wanting after the technical difficulties caused funds to be stuck in the Shibarium bridging contract with no means of escape until the network resumed. Over 1,000 ETH and 600,000 BONE were locked away and inaccessible, waiting for Shibarium to restart.\n\nIn typical Shytoshi fashion, the lead developer quickly put the community\u2019s mind at ease. He guaranteed the SHIB Army that there were no faults in the bridging contract and insured all locked funds if there are ongoing difficulties after Shibarium kicks into action.\n\nWhat Can I Do On Shibarium?\n\nIf you\u2019re familiar with Ethereum and any other Layer 2 networks built on top of it, like Arbitrum, Shibarium will offer a very similar experience. In the true spirit of a decentralized and permissionless blockchain, everyone will have complete freedom to create an application that they believe will bring value to the Shiba Inu community and ecosystem.\n\nDeFi\n\nDecentralized Finance on Shibarium will likely begin with ShibaSwap, Shiba Inu\u2019s native DEX. Users can trade cryptocurrencies through on-chain liquidity pools, taking advantage of Shibarium\u2019s high network speeds and low transaction fees.\n\nOther DeFi apps, like lending platforms, will bring greater liquidity to all tokens in the Shiba Inu ecosystem, like BONE, LEASH, and TREAT. The creativity of developers within the Shib Army only limits the potential for DeFi growth on Shibarium.\n\nShibarium NFTs\n\nThe Shibarium blockchain will provide a native home for all Shiba Inu ecosystem non-fungible tokens. NFT collectors will be able to buy and sell their favorite pieces without paying the prohibitive gas fees typical on Ethereum.\n\nThis isn\u2019t limited to current collections like Shiboshis and SHIB Metaverse Land Plots. Shibarium allows the Shiba Inu community to launch their own NFT collections and contribute to the ecosystem.\n\nShibarium MetaVerse\n\nSHIB: The Metaverse is an immersive virtual world where the Shib Army can gather to play and create Shiba Inu-inspired games, build digital businesses and show off their digital identity. It aims to create a digital environment that the SHIB community will call home.\n\nDeveloped using Unreal Engine 5.1, SHIB: The Metaverse is visually stunning. The virtual landscape features various Hubs and allows every user to create dynamic, customizable Avatars to explore the space.\n\nThere are 100,595 land plots in the SHIB metaverse, with each plot having various development and characterization options. Owners can do whatever they please with their virtual real estate, like opening digital stores or hosting events.\n\nShiba Inu Tokens\n\nThe Shiba Inu ecosystem is home to a range of digital assets, each serving a different purpose. Let\u2019s break down the role and utility of all the cryptocurrencies underneath the Shiba Inu umbrella.\n\nSHIB \u2013 The OG itself, SHIB, is the cornerstone of the Shiba Inu ecosystem.\n\nBONE \u2013 BONE plays a crucial role in the Shibarium network. It\u2019s the native gas token of the network, meaning it\u2019s needed to pay transaction fees on the Shibarium blockchain and can be staked to validator nodes to secure the network and create new blocks.\n\nLEASH \u2013 LEASH is a rewards token previously used to incentivize liquidity provision on ShibaSwap and give holders early access to SHIB Land Sales.\n\nTREAT \u2013 Still unreleased, TREAT is another rewards token to be distributed to BONE stakers and validators once they reach certain milestones.\n\nSHI \u2013 The native stablecoin of the Shibarium blockchain, SHI will be pegged to $1 and by a hedge against crypto market volatility.\n\nWhat Does Shibarium Mean for SHIB?\n\nThe launch of Shibarium is expected to be a positive catalyst for the growth of Shiba Inu. The network brings a wealth of utility to the entire ecosystem and gives the Shib Army a place to call home.\n\nPerhaps the biggest impact that Shibarium will have on the SHIB token will be felt through its unique burn mechanism.\n\nThe SHIB Burn\n\nSHIB has the largest token supply of any cryptocurrency on the market, with a total supply of one quadrillion tokens. While more than half of these tokens have already been burned, the Shibarium blockchain will introduce a creative new burn mechanic to permanently remove SHIB tokens from circulation and increase their scarcity.\n\nWhen transactions are processed on the Shibarium blockchain, 70% of every transaction base fee will be collected and stored in a locked contract. These fees are collected in BONE, the gas token of the network.\n\nOnce $25,000 worth of BONE has been accumulated, the Shiba Inu community can open the Burn Portal and initiate the token burn process. BONE is sent to the Ethereum Mainnet, which automatically trades to buy SHIB tokens, providing additional buy pressure. The smart contract then sends all the purchased SHIB to a burn address, making SHIB a deflationary asset in perpetuity.\n\nShibarium Pros & Cons\n\nThe Shibarium launch is arguably the most significant event in Shiba Inu\u2019s history, apart from perhaps the disappearance of Ryoshi. Its success or failure will have an enormous impact on the future of SHIB. Let\u2019s take a quick look at the benefits and drawbacks of the Shibarium network.\n\nPros\n\nScalability \u2013 Shibarium will be significantly faster and cheaper than Ethereum, making it far more accessible for most users.\n\nCompatibility \u2013 The network will be EVM compatible, making it easy for developers to port over Ethereum-based contracts and build a rich ecosystem of dApps quickly.\n\nBrings new utility to Shiba Ecosystem tokens \u2013 All Shiba Inu digital assets, including NFTs, will gain exciting new cases.\n\nSHIB Burn \u2013 The SHIB burn rate is expected to positively impact SHIB tokenomics, reducing the token supply and providing constant buy pressure to SHIB.\n\nSeparates SHIB from other meme coins \u2013 The launch of Shibarium gives SHIB new use cases and a far richer ecosystem than alternative meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE).\n\nCons\n\nLayer-2 competition \u2013 Between Arbitrum, Polygon zkEVM, and zkSync, the Ethereum Layer-2 race is brutal. From what we know of Shibarium before its launch, there is nothing to indicate it has superior technology than its better-resourced competitors.\n\nUncertainty around performance \u2013 Key metrics when analyzing the performance and capabilities of a network, like transaction throughput and finality, are still unclear.\n\nLack of incentives \u2013 Other new networks with more resources offer ecosystem grants to encourage developers to build dApps on their chain. Shibarium is yet to offer any funding for developers, meaning we might not see a great range of applications when the network eventually launches.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nOne thing that cannot be overlooked is the strength and tenacity of the Shib Army. Their enormous social media presence and community spirit have previously overcome all kinds of fear, uncertainty, and doubt.\n\nEven if Shibarium falls short of expectations and is technically inferior to alternative Layer 2s, Shiba Inu\u2019s resilient community will probably still use it. It\u2019s an extension of their culture and story, which, for the Shib Army, might be a stronger pull factor than blockchain performance.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nThe Shibarium launch is a massive milestone for Shiba Inu and its community. Shiba Inu is one of the largest cryptocurrencies in the space in terms of market cap, and the success or failure of Shibarium will likely have a domino effect of similar coins in the market.\n\nFAQs"

        "content": "As the crypto market experiences a bullish momentum, investors keep a close eye on developments in China, where the cryptocurrency narrative is undergoing significant shifts.\n\nOne of the most notable events is the \"Shanghai\" upgrade of Ethereum (ETH), spearheaded by its founder, Vitalik Buterin.\n\nHindustan Times - your fastest source for breaking news! Read now.\n\nThis article examines the similarities and differences between Ethereum and VeChain (VET), a China-based cryptocurrency, and analyses how these developments affect the larger Chinese crypto narrative. Additionally, we explore the concept of liquid staking wars and how it impacts these currencies.\n\nFinally, we examine whyBig Eyes Coin (BIG), a cryptocurrency that operates similarly to Ethereum and VeChain, is a solid investment opportunity going into the bull market.\n\nInnovation in Ethereum with the Shanghai Upgrade\n\nInnovation in Ethereum with the Shanghai Upgrade\n\nEthereum is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies globally, with a market capitalization of $241 billion. Its founder, Vitalik Buterin, is known for his constant efforts to upgrade the currency's capabilities.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade is one of the latest developments. It aims to improve the currency's scalability by introducing a new liquid staking mechanism. This mechanism allows users to stake their ETH tokens while keeping them liquid, making it easier to use them for other purposes.\n\nThis upgrade is essential for Ethereum's growth and allows the currency to handle more transactions while still being efficient.\n\nVeChain and the Chinese Crypto Narrative\n\nVeChain (VET) is another popular cryptocurrency in China, with a market capitalization of $7 billion. Unlike ETH, which focuses on general-purpose blockchain solutions, VET is explicitly designed for supply chain management.\n\nIt can track products' origins, quality, and shipping information. Given China's extensive manufacturing sector, VET's use case is highly relevant. Moreover, VET has also partnered with the Chinese government, providing legitimacy that other cryptocurrencies may not have.\n\nThese factors have made VET a favourite among Chinese investors, particularly those seeking investment in blockchain-based solutions.\n\nLiquid Staking Wars and Beyond\n\nLiquid staking has emerged as a significant concept in the crypto world, particularly in China. As Ethereum (ETH) introduces this mechanism, other currencies like Polkadot and Solana are developing similar solutions.\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG) offers a compelling opportunity to invest in a currency that operates similarly to ETH and VET.\n\nThis has led to \"liquid staking wars,\" where different currencies compete to provide the best solutions. While this competition is healthy for the industry, it also challenges investors.\n\nChoosing which currency to invest in requires careful consideration of each currency's specific strengths and weaknesses. In this regard, ETH's long-standing reputation and Vitalik Buterin's track record make it a solid choice for investors looking for stability.\n\nVET's targeted use case and government partnerships make it an attractive option for investing in China.\n\nAs Big Eyes Coin (BIG) is still in the presale stage, innovations by other currencies like ETH will inspire the trajectory taken by this alternative coin, which has been taking into consideration the rise in the prevalence of liquid staking.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade of Ethereum and the rise of VeChain in China exemplify the changing narrative around cryptocurrencies in the country.\n\nAs China seeks to embrace blockchain technology while maintaining control over its financial sector, currencies offering specific use cases and legitimacy are gaining favour among investors.\n\nMoreover, liquid staking is emerging as a crucial factor in currency selection. As different currencies compete to offer the best solutions, investors must carefully consider each currency's strengths and weaknesses.\n\nETH and VET are solid choices in this regard, particularly as the market experiences a bullish momentum. For investors looking to take advantage of this trend, Big Eyes Coin (BIG) offers a compelling opportunity to invest in a currency that operates similarly to ETH and VET. By staking BIG, investors can also earn rewards while maintaining liquidity, making it an attractive choice for those looking to enter the market.\n\nMore About Big Eyes Coin (BIG)\n\nWebsite:https://bigeyes.space\n\nTelegram:https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nTwitter:https://twitter.com/BigEyesCoin\n\nDisclaimer: This article is a paid publication and does not have journalistic/ editorial involvement of Hindustan Times.

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s recent Shanghai upgrade has led to a rise in the number of addresses holding at least 1 ETH.\n\nDespite the decline in active ETH, the total amount of staked ETH has been increasing.\n\nThe Ethereum Shanghai upgrade has passed, yet investors are still actively engaged and showing greater interest in the token. Although fewer active ETH is in circulation, the number of addresses holding at least 1 ETH continues to rise.\n\nRead Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nSmall Ethereum holders increase\n\nDespite experiencing a recent decline in price, Ethereum has continued to attract interest, as current data from Glassnode revealed.\n\nSince the Shanghai update, which made staked ETH available earlier this month, some addresses have shown positive activity.\n\nGlassnode\u2019s data revealed that the number of addresses holding 0.01 or more coins had been steadily increasing, and as of this writing, the figure stood at over 23.7 million.\n\nThe current figure marked an all-time high.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap\u2019s latest data, Ethereum (ETH) remains the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, currently valued at over $222 billion. As of this writing, the total supply of Ethereum in circulation stood at over 120 million.\n\nEthereum\u2019s active supply declines\n\nDespite the increasing number of addresses holding ETH, the supply of Ethereum that was active has been decreasing. Glassnode\u2019s \u201cAmount of Supply Last Active\u201d metric, which measures the percentage of active ETH between one week and one month, showed a decline.\n\nAs of this writing, the Supply Last Active was over 7.3 million ETH, and a visible decline could be seen on the chart.\n\nThe \u201ctotal supply last active\u201d metric indicates the total number of units of a cryptocurrency currently available. Also, it represents the most recent period in which any of those units were transacted or moved.\n\nThe decline in active ETH might be attributed to the volume of supply that was currently staked.\n\nNew Stake decreases as total stake increases\n\nUpon examining the staking statistics, it was evident that the number of staked ETH has been increasing. Currently, the total amount of staked ETH is almost 9 million.\n\nHowever, despite this rise, the volume of new stakes has experienced a significant drop recently. The observed chart shows that the number has decreased from around 93,000 daily to approximately 80,000.\n\nHow many are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nFollowing its ascent above the $2,000 price range, the value of ETH has experienced a decline in recent days. As of this writing, it was trading at around $1,839, representing a loss of over 1%.\n\nThe decline marked the second consecutive day its value had been in the red zone on a daily timeframe chart."

With experts suggesting that the market is now in a bull phase, investors are seeking out nascent investment opportunities like Big Eyes Coin (BIG) to maximize returns.\n\nExploring the Potential of Big Eyes Coin: An Investment Opportunity with Promising Prospects\n\nThe presale phase of Big Eyes Coin is drawing to a close on June 3rd, and the anticipation surrounding its launch is palpable. Having raised an impressive \u00a333.73 million to date, BIG has caught the attention of numerous crypto enthusiasts, with publications recognizing its potential to become the next big meme coin.

        "content": "The heavyweight showdown. The top 2 projects. Bitcoin and Ethereum. Which do you prefer? Which would you rather hold? That\u2019s our topic today. 1 BTC or 32 ETH.\n\nMost of us can\u2019t hold both as the cost is over $90,000. So most of us have to make a choice. Who do you think will win, bitcoin or ethereum? Let\u2019s find out.\n\nAdvantages of Buying 32 ETH\n\nThis argument starts with the fact we cover altcoins here.\n\nKing of Alts\n\nWe aren\u2019t called Bitcoin Buzz, but Altcoin Buzz. So, 32 ETH is the amount you need if you want to run your own validator. That would increase your returns too.\n\nCost/Value\n\nNext, 32 ETH costs more than 1 BTC. Right now, at $1865, 32 ETH costs $59,680. Bitcoin\u2019s current price is $27,625. This means 32 ETH costs twice as much as 1 Bitcoin. Does that mean ETH is more valuable? Or more scarce? Not necessarily.\n\nEthereum has almost 227 million unique addresses. The circulating supply is 120.4 million. That means the average holding per address is 0.52 ETH. And like many projects, they are top-heavy. ETH is more top-heavy than most.\n\nThe top 100 holders hold 39% of all the ETH. That means many of these 227 million holders hold very small amounts of ETH.\n\n10/ In the previous quarter, @Binance consolidated its wallets, which led to a spike in the number of active wallets. As a result, the average number of daily active addresses on #Ethereum saw a decline of 4% to 425K. pic.twitter.com/suMZSTlv61 \u2014 Messari (@MessariCrypto) April 21, 2023\n\nEcosystem\n\nOn the ecosystem, Ethereum wins hands down. Way more apps, protocols, volume, and fees than Bitcoin\u2019s ecosystem. Does this high concentration of ETH ownership concern you? Or not? Let us know in the comments below.\n\nDisadvantages of Buying 32 ETH\n\nNow for the anti-Ethereum side. Despite being #2 overall and the clear leader in DeFi and NFTs, Ethereum still sucks to use. And I am DEFINITELY NOT exaggerating when saying that. It could very easily lose its #2 position:\n\nCosmos has better-integrated apps and protocols.\n\nBNB Smart Chain is faster with lower fees.\n\nBitcoin is more secure.\n\nSolana is gaining ground fast on NFTs.\n\nPolygon\u2019s user experience exceeds Ethereum in every way.\n\nETH has near total reliance on L2s for using apps.\n\nEthereum\u2019s place as the silver to Bitcoin\u2019s gold is far from secure. Do you know what else never happens on Bitcoin? This. Last week, it was this $25 million exploit by someone attacking MEV bots. Ethereum is full of hacks, exploits, and security leaks.\n\nThat is the reality. And that NEVER happens with Bitcoin or its ecosystem. Never has. Extremely difficult to do with such high hash rates. Ethereum leads now but it has LOTS of competition.\n\nPolygon, which has its own sidechain and L2 solutions for ETH, just passed Ethereum in a number of daily active addresses for the first time. Ethereum is far more centralized than people want to admit.\n\nDaily Active Addresses within Ethereum's L2s Abritrum 24%\n\nOptimism 2.6%\n\nzkEVM 1.3%\n\nzkSync 71% pic.twitter.com/WKlv6CwdmD \u2014 Emperor Osmo\ud83e\uddea (@Flowslikeosmo) April 20, 2023\n\nFirst, we have a high concentration of ownership as mentioned earlier. Then there is the 70% premine that took place at its creation. Lastly, we\u2019ve already seen that the ETH Network can censor transactions at the US Government\u2019s request. It is definitely not a censorship-resistant network. Governments don\u2019t fear Ethereum. They collaborate with them.\n\nAdvantages of Buying 1 BTC\n\nMost of us at Altcoin Buzz use some Ethereum or EVM app on a daily basis. We bet most of you do too.\n\n\u2013 ETH is the Decentralized King\n\nBut you know what? Governments don\u2019t fear Ethereum. They don\u2019t work to ban Ethereum. Only Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the biggest threat to government-issued money. And that should tell you something about its value, too. And how powerful it is.\n\nBitcoin is the King. It\u2019s the most decentralized project and the only threat to government-issued money.\n\nLess Concentrated Ownership\n\nBitcoin\u2019s ownership is in way more hands than Ethereum. There are 45.7 million holders of the 19.3 million Bitcoin in circulation. That means the average holder has 0.42 BTC. That\u2019s more per average holder than Ethereum. And unlike Ethereum\u2019s 39%, the top 100 Bitcoin holders only own 13.6%. That\u2019s a huge difference.\n\nAll ownership and decentralization metrics are stronger and less concentrated for Bitcoin.\n\n#EconWatch: As #ElSalvador adopts #Bitcoin, 5 other Latin American countries are considering similar initiatives. Like El Salvador, all of these countries score extremely poorly on global corruption indices. #BTC is highly correlated with high levels of corruption. pic.twitter.com/EGToWp2bPk \u2014 Steve Hanke (@steve_hanke) June 26, 2021\n\nInstitutions Prefer Bitcoin\n\nLast fall leading into The Merge, Ethereum got much more institutional interest than usual. Especially since they can stake it easily on Coinbase or Binance and earn a rate like Treasuries on it.\n\nBut overall, institutions much prefer Bitcoin. To be fair, many are bullish on both. That said, there is more trading activity for Bitcoin. More companies have Bitcoin on their balance sheet. More than just Microstrategy\u2019s 140,000 BTC.\n\nLegendary VC investor and Bitcoin bull Tim Draper are telling his portfolio companies and making the general recommendation to hold at least 2 payrolls worth of cash in Bitcoin. That\u2019s in the wake of US bank closures and systemic problems now coming to the surface. For the average American company, that\u2019s equal to 1 month of all employee salaries.\n\nDisadvantages of Buying 1 BTC\n\nNow, the anti-BTC argument. While Layer 2 solutions like Stacks and Lightning Network are growing and adding more services, the biggest knock on Bitcoin is that its best utility is to HODL. Its opponents say that just holding and hoping it goes up is not a high utility for crypto.\n\nFirst bridging #USDT from Eth to Stacks was a great experience and very smooth \ud83e\udd17 Huge S/O to the whole @ALEXLabBTC Team for this amazing feature added to the ecosystem \ud83e\udee1 pic.twitter.com/YGa3Q1af04 \u2014 Algorithm.btc (@godfred_xcuz) April 21, 2023\n\nThere\u2019s no question that because its ecosystem is larger and everyone pays ETH for gas Ethereum has more general day-to-day utility right now. This map we are looking at is almost 2 yrs old and look how huge it is. It\u2019s only larger now.\n\nAnd if your favorite part of crypto is DeFi or NFTs or Games or Metaverse, then you probably favor ETH more than Bitcoin. Although Ordinals look like the real deal for Bitcoin.\n\nThe Decision\n\nBoth are getting more scarce. Bitcoin\u2019s inflation is 1.67%. The next halving is ~12 months away. Ethereum\u2019s inflation post \u2013 Merge is 0.88%.\n\nOn the other hand, Bitcoin is the most monetary, and money-like. Ethereum has the most protocols using it. So in the end, my own personal preference is that I would prefer to have.\n\nI know what I choose. What did you decide?\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f For more cryptocurrency news, check out the Altcoin Buzz YouTube channel.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f Check out our most up-to-date research, NFT and Metaverse buy, and how to protect your portfolio in this market by checking out our Altcoin Buzz Access group, which for a limited time, is FREE.

        "title": "Ethereum and how it has affected London's business sector in recent years - London Post",
        "content": "Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain-based platform that enables developers to create decentralized applications and smart contracts. The platform was created in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin, a Russian-Canadian programmer, and has quickly become one of the most popular blockchain platforms in the world.\n\nEthereum\u2019s history dates back to 2013 when Vitalik Buterin proposed the idea of a blockchain-based platform that could run decentralized applications. The platform was launched in 2015, and since then, it has grown rapidly, attracting a large community of developers and businesses.\n\nLondon has always been a hub for business and finance, and with the rise of Ethereum, the city\u2019s business landscape has undergone a significant transformation. In recent years, Ethereum has been increasingly adopted by businesses in various industries, including gambling. The use of Ethereum in the gambling industry has brought about significant advantages and changes, making it a topic of interest for businesses and investors alike. This paper aims to explore the impact of Ethereum on London\u2019s business sector, with a particular focus on its impact on the gambling industry.\n\nEthereum\u2019s impact on London\u2019s business sector\n\nEthereum has had a significant impact on London\u2019s business sector in recent years. The decentralized nature of the Ethereum platform and its ability to execute smart contracts has made it an attractive option for businesses in various industries. The use of Ethereum has enabled businesses to streamline their operations, reduce costs, and increase efficiency.\n\nOne of the significant advantages of Ethereum is that it has made transactions more efficient. Ethereum\u2019s blockchain technology enables businesses to execute transactions instantly without the need for intermediaries such as banks or financial institutions. This has made transactions faster, more secure, and more cost-effective. Additionally, Ethereum\u2019s smart contract functionality allows for the automation of transactions, reducing the need for manual intervention and streamlining business operations.\n\nEthereum\u2019s decentralized nature and open-source platform have facilitated the growth of new businesses in London. The platform has made it easier for startups to access funding through initial coin offerings (ICOs) and other crowdfunding methods. Ethereum\u2019s smart contract functionality has also enabled startups to create decentralized applications, providing new business opportunities in various industries. The ability to create decentralized applications on the Ethereum platform has provided businesses with new revenue streams, while also promoting innovation and creativity in the business sector.\n\nEthereum\u2019s impact on the gambling industry\n\nLondon is home to a thriving gambling industry, with various casinos and betting shops located throughout the city. The industry has been experiencing significant growth in recent years, driven in part by the adoption of new technologies such as blockchain and cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum has had a significant impact on the gambling industry in London. The use of Ethereum in gambling has brought about several changes, including the adoption of cryptocurrency payments, the introduction of smart contracts, and the creation of decentralized gambling platforms. These changes have made the gambling industry more transparent, secure, and fair.\n\nThe use of Ethereum in gambling has several advantages. First, it provides users with greater anonymity and privacy when making transactions, making it a popular option among online gamblers. Second, Ethereum\u2019s smart contract functionality enables the creation of decentralized gambling platforms that are transparent and fair. Third, Ethereum\u2019s fast transaction processing times and low transaction fees make it an attractive option for both gamblers and casino operators.\n\nOne of the significant advantages of using Ethereum in gambling is the availability of Ethereum casinos. These are online casinos that accept Ethereum as a payment method, providing users with a fast and secure way to deposit and withdraw funds. Ethereum casinos offer various benefits, such as high levels of security and transparency, instant payments, and access to a wide range of games. If you\u2019re interested in exploring the world of Ethereum casinos, you can check out a list of Ethereum casinos for a comprehensive review of the top options available.\n\nIn summary, Ethereum has had a significant impact on the gambling industry in London, bringing about several changes and advantages. The use of Ethereum in gambling has enabled greater transparency, security, and fairness, making it an attractive option for both gamblers and casino operators. The availability of Ethereum casinos has further contributed to the growth of the industry, providing users with a fast and secure way to access their favorite games.\n\nChallenges and future developments\n\nWhile Ethereum has had a significant impact on London\u2019s business sector, it has also faced several challenges. One of the primary challenges is scalability. Ethereum\u2019s current transaction processing speed is limited, making it difficult for businesses to scale their operations. Additionally, the volatile nature of cryptocurrency prices can make it difficult for businesses to manage their finances effectively.\n\nAnother challenge facing Ethereum in London\u2019s business sector is regulatory compliance. The use of cryptocurrency in business transactions is still a relatively new concept, and regulatory bodies are still developing guidelines and regulations for its use. This can create uncertainty and legal implications for businesses that use Ethereum in their operations.\n\nDespite these challenges, there are several potential future developments in Ethereum technology that could address these issues. One of the most significant developments is Ethereum 2.0, which is set to launch in phases over the coming years. Ethereum 2.0 is expected to significantly improve the platform\u2019s scalability, making it faster and more efficient. It will also introduce new features such as sharding, which will allow the network to handle more transactions at once.\n\nAnother potential development is the integration of Ethereum with other blockchain networks, such as Bitcoin\u2019s Lightning Network. This could enable faster and more cost-effective transactions across different blockchain networks, further improving the efficiency of Ethereum in London\u2019s business sector.\n\nThese developments have the potential to significantly impact London\u2019s business sector. The improved scalability and efficiency of Ethereum could enable businesses to scale their operations and handle larger transaction volumes, opening up new opportunities for growth and expansion. The integration of Ethereum with other blockchain networks could also facilitate greater interoperability between different businesses, making it easier to conduct cross-border transactions and collaborate on projects.\n\nHowever, these developments also bring with them potential risks and challenges. As Ethereum becomes more efficient and scalable, it may become more attractive to malicious actors looking to exploit vulnerabilities in the system. Additionally, the increasing complexity of Ethereum technology may make it more difficult for businesses to understand and navigate, creating barriers to entry for new adopters.\n\nOverall\n\nIn recent years, Ethereum has had a significant impact on London\u2019s business sector. Its decentralized and transparent nature has made it an attractive alternative to traditional payment methods, and its smart contract functionality has enabled the creation of new business models and opportunities. The adoption of Ethereum by businesses in London has facilitated more efficient transactions and has helped to support the growth of new businesses.\n\nOne of the areas in which Ethereum has had a particularly significant impact is the gambling industry. By enabling faster and more secure transactions, Ethereum has made it possible for online casinos to operate more effectively, and has helped to make the industry more accessible to a wider audience. The use of smart contracts has also made it possible to create new and innovative gambling products and services.\n\nWhile Ethereum has brought many benefits to London\u2019s business sector, it has also faced several challenges. Scalability and regulatory compliance are two of the primary challenges that must be addressed to ensure the continued growth and adoption of Ethereum in the city\u2019s business community. However, with the launch of Ethereum 2.0 and other potential developments in the technology, these challenges are being actively addressed.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nEmail\n\nLinkedIn\n\n"

        "title": "Crypto's Top Contenders: A Look At The Three Most Promising Cryptocurrencies Of 2023 - Bitcoin, Ethereum & Dogetti - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Cryptocurrencies have been around for over a decade, with Bitcoin (BTC) being the pioneer in the world of decentralized digital currencies. In recent years, other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum (ETH) and Dogetti (DETI) have emerged, offering unique features and potential to investors and enthusiasts. Despite this, some people are still skeptical about the benefits of crypto and question its relevance. In this article, we will explore why we should embrace cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogetti, and the potential they offer for trading and investment.\n\nReimagining Investment with Bitcoin: A Solid Crypto Asset\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has been around since 2009 and operates on a decentralised blockchain network, offering a secure and transparent way to transfer value without the need for intermediaries such as banks. With a maximum supply of 21 million coins, Bitcoin\u2019s deflationary nature has earned it comparisons to gold. Holding onto Bitcoin for the long term has the potential to yield substantial returns, making it a worthwhile investment to consider.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Smart Contracts: Revolutionising Decentralised Applications\n\nFounded in 2015, Ethereum (ETH) expands upon blockchain technology to enable the creation of decentralised applications and smart contracts. In contrast to Bitcoin, Ethereum\u2019s scope extends beyond basic transactions. The introduction of smart contracts is a game-changer, particularly in real estate transactions where the buying and selling process can be automated. Imagine being able to purchase a home without leaving your house! Smart contracts make this possibility a reality.\n\nDogetti: A Meme Coin Offering Passive Income for Investors\n\nDogetti is a new presale meme coin that aims to establish a robust community that rewards holders regularly. It operates on the Ethereum network and employs a unique 2% reflection protocol that distributes 2% of every transaction to all wallets, providing a passive income opportunity for its holders. As a result, Dogetti is gaining traction in the cryptocurrency world.\n\nDogetti token is primarily used for DogettiSwap, and the platform\u2019s tokenomics demonstrate its commitment to the community. The platform imposes a 6% tax on each transaction, out of which 2% is distributed to all token holders, 2% to charity, and the remaining 2% is used for token liquidity. In addition to financial gain, Dogetti strives to contribute to charitable causes and enhance the community\u2019s financial status as the platform expands.\n\nFurthermore, Dogetti offers a vibrant community with a range of promising opportunities. Investors can buy, sell, and trade DogettiNFTs and participate in decision-making through DogettiDAO. The cryptocurrency\u2019s robust and tight-knit community is dedicated to growing together, and Dogetti provides exciting prospects for future community involvement.\n\nCurrently, Dogetti is running a limited-time promo code \u201cDON50,\u201d which offers investors a 50% bonus for free.\n\nBitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogetti are distinct cryptocurrencies that offer potential for investment and trading. These currencies provide a decentralised and transparent medium to transfer value, grant access to global financial markets, and have the capacity to revolutionise various industries. Embracing their potential and backing the growth of new cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology can unleash their full potential and pave the way for a decentralised future.\n\nFor More Information On Dogetti (DETI):\n\nPresale: https://dogetti.io/how-to-buy\n\nWebsite: https://dogetti.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/Dogetti\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_Dogetti_\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"
