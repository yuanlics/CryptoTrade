        "title": "Is Ethereum (ETH) A Security Under US Law? - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nDetermining Ethereum\u2019s legal classification as a security will impact the cryptocurrency space, influence trading, issuance, and investment regulations.\n\nThe Howey Test defines asset security. Debate continues on Ethereum\u2019s classification.\n\nLegal clarity is vital to avoid regulatory uncertainty and to guide industry growth.\n\nEthereum\u2019s journey from ICO to decentralization has shaped its status.\n\nImportance Of Determining Ethereum\u2019s Legal Classification As A Security\n\nDetermining Ethereum\u2019s legal classification as a security is considered to be an important regulatory decision that would impact the cryptocurrency space. The reason is because securities laws affect regulations with trading laws, issuance laws, and investment practices.\n\nThe Howey Test, referenced by the Securities and Exchange Commision (SEC), defines whether an asset is a security. The outcome of this decision will also influence investor protection, market stability, and innovation in the crypto space.\n\nBackground On Securities And How Securities Are Regulated Under US Law\n\nThe regulation of crypto-assets, particularly in relation to securities is a complex issue. In general, securities sold or traded in the U.S. must be registered, and the registration process involves providing essential facts about the company\u2019s or cryptos properties, business, and the security itself.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s role includes minimizing compliance while ensuring investor protection. These regulations are designed to provide investors with access to relevant information about investments before and after investing, and to prevent conflicts of interest in the securities industry.\n\nDefinition Of Securities\n\nSecurities are fungible and tradable financial instruments to raise capital in both the public and private markets. Securities can include notes, stocks, bonds, certificates of interest, collateral trust certificates, and more. These instruments then serve as a means for individuals and entities to invest, speculate, and manage risk within the financial markets.\n\nThe term \u201csecurity\u201d covers a broad range of investments, and its definition can vary based on jurisdiction and context. Securities play a pivotal role in capital markets, enabling companies and governments to access funding while offering investors opportunities for potential returns and income.\n\nWhat Is The Howey Test? Explanation Of The Howey Test\n\nThe SEC is a U.S. government oversight agency responsible for regulating the securities markets and safeguarding investors. The SEC\u2019s jurisdiction extends to various aspects of financial markets, including investment banks, trading, financial dealings, product offerings, advertising, and fiduciary responsibilities.\n\nThe Howey Test is a legal framework used in the United States to determine whether a transaction qualifies as an investment contract and thus falls under securities regulations. The test originates from the landmark Supreme Court case SEC v. W.J. Howey Co in 1946.\n\nThe test consists of three main elements:\n\nAn investment of money,\n\nIn a common enterprise,\n\nWith an expectation of profits primarily from the efforts of others.\n\nIf these three elements are met, the transaction is considered a security, subject to the regulations set forth by SEC. The Howey Test serves as a fundamental guideline for classifying various financial arrangements and offerings in terms of whether they require compliance with securities laws and regulations, ensuring investor protection and transparency in financial markets.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Characteristics And SEC\u2019s Perspective On Ethereum\n\nEthereum is a decentralized blockchain platform known for its programmable smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). It enables developers to build and deploy decentralized applications on its network, offering features like transparency, immutability, and trustlessness. Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), is used for transactions and to incentivize network participants.\n\nThe U.S. SEC has indicated that whether a particular cryptocurrency, like Ether, constitutes a security depends on its specific characteristics and how it is marketed and sold. The SEC has noted that if a cryptocurrency operates as a security , it falls under its regulatory jurisdiction, subject to applicable securities laws. The classification of cryptocurrencies like Ethereum is based on the Howey Test and other legal considerations to determine their status as securities or commodities, impacting their regulatory oversight and legal compliance.\n\nSEC\u2019s Statements and Actions Regarding Cryptocurrencies And Tokens\n\nThe U.S. SEC has actively engaged with the evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies and tokens through its statements and actions. The SEC\u2019s emphasis on investor protection and market integrity has led to a series of public statements clarifying its position on digital assets. It has consistently emphasized that whether a particular cryptocurrency or token qualifies as a security depends on the underlying facts and circumstances, with the Howey Test being a pivotal framework.\n\nOn July 25, 2017, the SEC released an investigative report addressing the treatment of digital assets, specifically tokens offered by \u201cvirtual\u201d organizations through distributed ledger or blockchain technology. The report emphasized that these assets, often marketed as \u201cInitial Coin Offerings\u201d (ICOs) or \u201cToken Sales,\u201d could fall under the scope of federal securities laws. The SEC\u2019s stance was whether an asset is a security depends on the factual and economic nature of the transaction rather than the terminology or technology employed.\n\nThe investigative report on the case of \u201cThe DAO,\u201d a virtual organization that offered and sold tokens. The SEC concluded that these tokens were securities, thereby subject to federal securities laws. The report underscored that entities issuing securities via distributed ledger or blockchain technology must adhere to registration requirements, unless a valid exemption applies.\n\nAdditionally, unregistered offerings and securities exchanges facilitating trading in these securities could face liabilities.While the SEC is open to innovative technologies, its measured approach underscores the need to balance innovation with the protection of investors and the integrity of the markets.\n\nExamination Of SEC\u2019s Stance On Ethereum\u2019s Status As A Security\n\nThe position on whether Ethereum\u2019s status is a security or not is not so well defined. While Ethereum initially launched through a token sale, the SEC\u2019s perspective has evolved over time. Former Chairman Jay Clayton highlighted that as Ethereum decentralized and its network matured, it might not fit the traditional definition of a security subject to securities regulations.\n\nThe determination hinges on whether the sale of Ether, Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, involved the investment of money in a common enterprise with an expectation of profits primarily from the efforts of others, the key elements of the Howey Test. The SEC\u2019s cautious and nuanced approach reflects its commitment to balance innovation and investor protection in the rapidly evolving digital asset landscape.\n\nContrary to initial concerns, Gary Gensler, head of the SEC, reportedly indicated in 2018, that he also doesn\u2019t view Ethereum as a security based on his interpretation of its historical issuance and network distribution. He referenced his earlier remarks from a 2018 lecture at MIT, where he emphasized that Ethereum was likely offered and sold as a security during its initial coin offering (ICO) phase.\n\nGensler\u2019s statement aligns with the idea that the initial sale of a token could be considered a security offering, but over time, if the token\u2019s network becomes sufficiently decentralized, it may no longer meet the criteria of a security. This view holds significance for Ethereum\u2019s regulatory treatment and could impact how other cryptocurrencies are evaluated by the SEC.\n\nAnalysis Of Speeches, Regulations, And Enforcement Actions Relevant To Ethereum\n\nThe analysis of speeches, regulations, and enforcement actions relevant to Ethereum, offers insight into the SEC\u2019s evolving stance. Various officials\u2019 speeches have indicated the importance of evaluating the underlying characteristics of a cryptocurrency and its manner of distribution to determine its regulatory status. The issuance of guidance, the establishment of a framework, and subsequent statements by SEC officials have further clarified its position.\n\nConclusion\n\nDetermining Ethereum\u2019s legal status as security is key for cryptocurrency regulation and market prices. The SEC\u2019s approach using the Howey Test emphasizes investor protection, market stability, and innovation. While Bitcoin is often seen as a commodity, Ethereum\u2019s classification remains debated.\n\nClarity is crucial to alleviate regulatory ambiguity, fostering industry growth. Understanding securities and the SEC\u2019s role is essential; they govern investment instruments and ensure market fairness. Ethereum\u2019s evolving journey from ICO issuance to a decentralized network shapes its status. Former and current SEC chairs, Clayton and Gensler, offer nuanced perspectives on the definition of Ethereum.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat is the significance of determining Ethereum\u2019s legal classification?\n\nEthereum\u2019s classification impacts its regulatory treatment, influencing trading, issuance, and investment practices in the cryptocurrency space.\n\nHow does the Howey Test affect cryptocurrency regulation?\n\nThe Howey Test helps determine if a transaction qualifies as an investment contract, potentially subjecting it to securities regulations for investor protection.\n\nWhat is the SEC\u2019s role in regulating securities?\n\nThe SEC safeguards investors and maintains market fairness by overseeing securities markets, ensuring transparency, and preventing insider advantages.\n\nWhy is legal clarity important for cryptocurrencies like Ethereum?\n\nClear classification mitigates regulatory uncertainty, fostering industry development while balancing innovation and investor safeguarding in the digital asset landscape."

        "title": "If You Invested $100 in Ethereum, Here's How Much You'd Have Now - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "It's no secret that crypto has been struggling over the last couple of years. And after a whirlwind surge in 2023, prices are falling yet again.\n\nHowever, many cryptocurrencies have still proven to be incredibly lucrative long-term investments. For example, while the price of Ethereum (ETH 0.42%) has fallen by around 11% over the last month, it's still up more than 300% over the last three years -- and that's despite the brutal crypto winter throughout 2022.\n\nIf crypto prices rebound, we could see similar gains over time. And while past performance doesn't predict future returns, it can sometimes be encouraging to look at how much you could have earned if you'd invested years ago.\n\nHow far could Ethereum have taken you?\n\nEthereum is one of the biggest success stories to come out of the crypto market. Despite extreme volatility, it remains the second most popular name in the industry. It currently has a market cap of around $198 billion, making up around 20% of the entire crypto sector.\n\nWhile it certainly hasn't been immune to volatility, it's also fared better than many of its competitors. Its price is currently down by around 65% from its peak in late 2021, while Cardano has fallen by a staggering 87% in that time, and Solana has plummeted by around 91%.\n\nFor long-term investors who stuck it out through the rough patches, Ethereum has been a lucrative investment. Here's how much $100 of Ethereum would be worth today, depending on when you'd invested:\n\nDate Invested Ethereum Returns as of Today How Much $100 Would Be Worth Today Aug. 1, 2021 -30% $70 Aug. 1, 2020 333% $433 Aug. 1, 2019 671% $771\n\nThe short term can be rocky for crypto, and if you'd invested in late 2021 right before prices plummeted, your investment would have declined in value. But if you'd invested just four years ago and held through all the ups and downs, you'd have nearly 8 times your initial investment by today.\n\nIs Ethereum a good investment right now?\n\nAgain, past performance doesn't predict future returns. There are never any guarantees when investing, and this is especially true with crypto due to its speculative nature. No one can say, then, whether Ethereum will continue on its track of explosive long-term returns.\n\nThat said, Ethereum is one of the strongest players in the crypto space, and it has a slew of advantages. Its sheer size is one of them, as it's far and away the most popular network for decentralized applications -- such as NFT marketplaces, DeFi projects, and metaverse apps.\n\nEthereum's developers are also committed to consistently upgrading the blockchain to make it stronger and more useful. Last year, they successfully pulled off The Merge -- a landmark upgrade that moved Ethereum from the energy-intensive proof-of-work system to the far more efficient proof-of-stake model.\n\nThe Surge is one of the next eagerly awaited updates, and it aims to improve the network's speed and reduce transaction fees. These have long been two major pain points for Ethereum, and if developers are able to successfully pull off this update, it could be a game-changer.\n\nDownsides to consider before you buy\n\nWhile Ethereum has plenty of advantages, it won't be right for every portfolio.\n\nLike the crypto industry in general, Ethereum is still a speculative investment. Although it does have a fair amount of utility (especially compared to many of its competitors), its primary uses are also somewhat speculative right now. If NFTs, DeFi, or the metaverse become more mainstream, for instance, Ethereum could thrive. But if they never catch on, it could spell trouble.\n\nMuch of Ethereum's future success also hinges on its upcoming upgrades. If those updates take longer than expected to complete or there are significant hiccups during the rollouts, that could shake users' confidence -- and provide an opportunity for competitors to swoop in and grab market share.\n\nIn short, Ethereum is still speculative, but it's also one of the strongest investments in the crypto space right now. If you're willing to take on more risk for the chance to earn potentially lucrative returns over the long run, it may be a smart addition to your portfolio."

        "title": "This Ethereum Metric Has Sparked Centralization Concerns Over ETH Ownership - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Crypto blockchains are designed to be fully decentralized so that no single person or group has control. However, new data has shown that the top 10 Ethereum addresses control over 35% of the total ETH supply. For a network that was designed to be decentralized, this has sparked some serious concerns over how centralized ETH has become.\n\nThe 10 Largest Ethereum Addresses Hold Over 35% Of The Available Supply\n\nWhile sharing the metric on social media platform X, crypto market intelligence platform Santiment showed how holdings of the 10 largest Ethereum addresses have now climbed to 35% of the total supply.\n\nThis indicates that while small traders have been trying to offload their supply during the recent price crash, many ETH whales are taking the chance to buy the dip.\n\n\ud83d\udc33 The 10 largest addresses on the #Ethereum network are now holding over 35% of the available supply.

Data shows that these addresses held only 11.2% of the total supply in August 2018, and then rose to 24% in August 2022. The current level means these 10 largest holders have accumulated 11% more in the past year.\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 #Ethereum has been seeing its top 10 addresses expand and accumulate more and more of the total available coin supply. In 5 years, the top 10 largest addresses have gone from owning 11.2% to now 34.6% of $ETH.

One of Binance\u2019s wallets (Binance 7) holds over 1.66%, while the exchange also holds large ETH amounts in other wallets, making it the largest of any single entity.\n\nIn comparison, the top 10 addresses of Bitcoin, the largest crypto in the world, own only 5.35% of the total supply. This, of course, does not take into account Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s Bitcoin cache.\n\nETH price struggles amid centralization concerns | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nETH Centralization Concerns?\n\nWhales are known to have considerable control over the price movement of cryptocurrencies in the crypto market and large selloffs by these holders can lead to an increase in selling pressure from smaller investors, causing a dump in the price of ETH.\n\nHowever, considering the largest holder is the Ethereum is the Beacon Deposit Contract used for staking ETH, an increase in the contract spells positive news. More deposits into the contract signal that more investors are depositing to become validators in ETH 2.0.\n\nInterestingly, the number of wallets holding between 10 and 10,000 ETH has risen to 355,000, and 1,788 more 10-10,000 ETH wallets have been added since the beginning of June. Whale transactions in the past week alone have also crossed 23,073 ETH, the highest since May.\n\nAs for ETH\u2019s price, the token is currently trading at around $1,600, down 11% in the past month.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Kenya\u2019s move came three weeks after the country suspended Worldcoin\u2019s activities within its borders.\n\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. Department of Justice arrested Tornado Cash founder Roman Storm and charged him with crimes related to money laundering. Co-founder Roman Semenov, who was also named in the indictment, remains at large in Dubai.\n\nLast year, the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) banned Americans from using privacy mixer Tornado Cash, claiming that criminals had used it to launder money\u2014specifically naming the North Korean state-sponsored hacker organization Lazarus Group.\n\nEarlier this week, the legislative body of the Central African Republic (CAR) granted approval for the tokenization of land and natural resources to help the government position the country as an up-and-coming business destination in Africa.\n\nThe project launched last year with resource tokenization in mind; it is meant to facilitate investment in CAR through Sango Coin, a state-issued token\u2014though not a Central Bank Digital Currency\u2014backed by Bitcoin on a sidechain network. However, initial responses to Sango Coin\u2019s launch were lukewarm."

        "title": "Step-By-Step Guide: How To Bridge Ethereum On Different Blockchains - Milk Road",
        "content": "Introduction To Bridging\n\nAs of August 21, 2023, there are 204 blockchains listed on DefiLlama. Each chain is accompanied by unique protocols to explore, different levels of speed and security and a loyal community.\n\nThe problem? Blockchains are not able to communicate with one another.\n\nIf you hold assets on Ethereum, you are not able to use those assets in protocols that are deployed on other blockchains. And if you want to purchase a token on a blockchain like Optimism, you need to find a way to get your funds there.\n\nThat\u2019s where bridges come in. They allow users to send crypto from one blockchain to another, while ensuring that funds are transferred 1:1.\n\nNo blockchain is created equal. And with all of the recent hype around Layer 2s (L2s) and VC funding pouring into new chains, we decided to send the Milk Man into the multi-chain world.\n\nWhy Use A Bridge\n\nBridging to new networks can offer several benefits:\n\nFirst off, new blockchains are often filled with early opportunities. While Ethereum has been known to be the gold standard, it is more expensive to transact on and less scalable than other blockchains. This makes it difficult to deploy applications that require a high frequency of transactions, such as trading or gaming.\n\nEmerging blockchains are also a hotbed for new protocols to launch on. Being early to new trends and applications can pay serious dividends, but also brings greater risk. And when you account for the lower gas fees on other networks, it becomes much easier to transact and explore new things on-chain.\n\nLastly, interacting with a new blockchain could make you eligible for an airdrop. The biggest Layer 2 blockchains to date, Optimism and Arbitrum, both rewarded their early network users with a lucrative airdrop. And it is widely expected that others will follow in their footsteps.\n\nWhy We Bridged Ethereum\n\nIn Milk Road\u2019s case, we decided to bridge for two reasons:\n\n1/ To show Roaders what all the hype is about. We told you we would be getting our hands dirty, so it wouldn\u2019t be fair for us to only stick with Ethereum.\n\nWe want Roaders to see everything that the world of DeFi has to offer. And that includes getting out of our comfort zone to interact with new and innovative protocols.\n\n2/ To set us up to explore emerging protocols in the future. Bridging is the first step towards diving into other networks.\n\nThis will act as a precursor for some of the other things we will be doing with our public wallet. It also gives us the resources to be ready to take action on abrupt events, like the recent launch of Coinbase\u2019s blockchain.\n\nWhat We Did \u2013 Bridging Ethereum On Three Blockchains\n\nWe bridged 0.5 ETH to three different layer-2 blockchains:\n\nArbitrum\n\nWe bridged to Arbitrum because it has been the most widely adopted L2 by almost every metric. First off, L2Beat states that Arbitrum is currently holding ~56% of the total TVL locked in L2s.\n\nTVL refers to the amount of funds that are locked in smart contracts on the network. This includes funds that are being staked, providing liquidity to DeFi or being used in other activities such as lending. While not a perfect metric, TVL gives you a glimpse into the strength and adoption of a blockchain.\n\nAdditionally, Arbitrum is in a league of its own when it comes to deployed protocols and active users. Arbitrum\u2019s blockchain had ~150,000 daily active users on August 22nd. This was more than half of Ethereum\u2019s count on this day.\n\nLastly, Arbitrum is home to over 400 protocols, with many of these being native to the network. Arbitrum\u2019s ability to transact much cheaper than Ethereum has allowed new innovation to be launched. We will be exploring some of these in the future!\n\nOptimism\n\nOptimism is the clear second winner in terms of adoption. While it has significantly less TVL (27%) and protocols (179) than Arbitrum, it recently surpassed Arbitrum in daily transactions due to their ever-growing list of partnerships.\n\nOptimism recently launched the OP Stack, a way for others to utilize Optimism\u2019s resources to launch their own L2 networks. And its initial success has been very promising with two recent launches generating a lot of attention: Base chain and Worldcoin.\n\nSince Optimism has established itself as a major player in L2 wars, we want to have some funds here ready to act on future developments and opportunities.\n\nBase\n\nCoinbase recently launched their own L2, Base. And it has raised all kinds of excitement from the crypto community.\n\nIt started off with a tribute to Brian Armstrong called the $BALD coin. This coin was one of the fastest rising token launches ever, reaching $100M before there was even a way to withdraw funds from Base\u2019s chain. This token was later rug pulled with rumors the creator was SBF.\n\nMore recently, Friend.Tech launched on Base and took Twitter by storm. This application introduced a market to trade shares of creators and influencers. And it generated $1.5M in revenue on August 21st alone, only being beaten by Lido and Ethereum itself.\n\nThe ongoing craziness accompanied by the backing of Coinbase makes the Base chain a very interesting avenue to explore. It\u2019s anyone\u2019s best guess what happens next there.\n\nStep By Step: How To Bridge ETH\n\nStep 1: Choosing A Bridge\n\nThe first thing to be aware of is that there are many different bridges available to users. When choosing which is the best fit for your needs, there are two things to consider:\n\nCost: In addition to gas fees for using the network, bridges also contain a bridge fee charged by the protocol itself. These typically range anywhere from 0.05-0.30% of the transaction volume.\n\nTiming: Some bridges have a wait time until you can access your assets, often being 7 days. Other bridges may allow you to receive the funds in as quick as a few minutes, but these may bring higher costs or lower security.\n\nStep 2: How To Bridge\n\nNow that you are familiar with the concept, bridging assets is just as simple as making a swap. To show you, we are going to dive into a screenshot from Stargate\u2019s bridge:\n\nTo start, connect your wallet to the site and select \u201cTransfer\u201d from the top bar.\n\nThe top rectangle represents the origin, where you are bridging assets from. Simply select the token you want to transfer and the blockchain you want to transfer from.\n\nwhere you are bridging assets from. Simply select the token you want to transfer and the blockchain you want to transfer from. The bottom rectangle is your destination chain. Ensure you have the correct network selected and it will show you your expected output.\n\nEnsure you have the correct network selected and it will show you your expected output. Ensure that you have the gas fees to cover the transaction and confirm it in your wallet.\n\nDepending on network congesting and the involved networks, your assets should arrive in a few minutes.\n\nStep 3: Managing A Multi-Chain Portfolio\n\nNow that we have assets all over, we need a way to stay on top of our portfolio.\n\nHere\u2019s our two favorite ways to see our assets in one place:\n\n1/ MetaMask Portfolio dApp: This is the quickest method, as you can view your portfolio directly from your wallet. They also provide you with basic data and allow you to export everything to Excel yourself. Learn more about MetaMask Portfolio and how it works.\n\n2/ DeBank: DeBank is great for those who want to dive deeper. They offer a wider range of blockchains to track, and organize wallets by chain and activity. You can also use DeBank as a social media site. Give us a follow!\n\nBridging Directly In MetaMask Portfolio\n\nIn addition to buying crypto or swapping tokens, MetaMask also has a bridge built directly into their portfolio dApp.\n\nYou can access this feature by opening your wallet and navigating to the bridge tab on the home page:\n\nYou will then be brought to the portfolio dApp, where you simply need to choose the origin network, the destination and the token you want to transfer:\n\nIt is important to note that MetaMask offers a convenient way to bridge, but they have a higher fee than the average bridge.\n\nConcerns Around Bridging\n\nBridging has been revolutionary and opened up a whole new world for crypto users. However, bridges are not perfect and users should be aware of the risks associated with using them.\n\nFirst off, bridging costs users a fee just like any service. It is important to consider the bridge fee, amount bridged and current network fees to ensure you want to transact. You will also need to ensure that you have native tokens on the destination network to cover gas fees.\n\nAnother consideration is that in some cases, there may also be wait times to have your funds available. Sometimes this is done by the bridge itself in order to verify the funds and transactions. In other cases, congestion of the blockchain can cause delays.\n\nLastly and most importantly, bridges have been prone to hacks and exploits in the past. Since bridges need to lock large amounts of funds in smart contracts, they are attractive targets for bad actors on the blockchain.\n\nAnd this cannot be understated. In 2022, bridges were involved in \u2157 of the biggest hacks of the year. In total, 70% of all funds lost to exploits last year came from bridges.\n\nNext Steps\n\nNow that we have assets on several blockchains, things are going to start to get interesting! We will be exploring some new and interesting protocols in the near future and continuing to provide Roaders with the full tour of the blockchain.\n\nFor now, you can track our wallet on their own through DeBank. Simply go to their site, paste in our wallet address and follow our journey in real time under \u201cportfolio\u201d.\n\nHere is the Milk Road Public wallet address:\n\n0x455419210c0E31cC1aDEF14e1c8db81f1Dc80A83\n\nThis report is for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon as a basis for investment decisions, nor is it offered or intended to be used as legal, tax, investment, financial or other advice.

The creator of the Ethereum-alternative believes the token is likely to beat competitors Bitcoin and Ethereum, in terms of market capitalization, through its mass adoption.\n\nHoskinson\u2019s statements have failed to catalyze a recovery in the altcoin, and ADA price is at support at $0.2589, at the time of writing.\n\nAlso read: XRP price makes comeback above $0.50 as pro-XRP lawyer urges former SEC officials\u2019 testimony\n\nCharles Hoskinson believes Cardano can beat competitors\n\nCardano\u2019s competitors Bitcoin and Ethereum have the largest market capitalization in the crypto ecosystem. Hoskinson gave a talk at blockchain convention Rare Evo 2023, and shared his views of the recent developments in Cardano.\n\nDuring his speech, Hoskinson explained that Cardano is probably going to become the biggest cryptocurrency in the world. To back his bullish comments on the project, Hoskinson attributed the project\u2019s sustainability, scalability and interoperability set it apart from the approach taken by blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nA recent update in Cardano, the Alonzo upgrade, powers smart contracts on the altcoin\u2019s blockchain and supports dApps and DeFi projects and their development in the ADA ecosystem. Cardano\u2019s utility and potential market reach are therefore drivers that can beat Bitcoin, Ethereum and other projects in the ecosystem.\n\nAt the time of writing, ADA price is in a downward trend and exchanging hands at $0.2589. The altcoin is below its three long-term Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) at 10,50 and 200-day at $0.2665, $0.2890 and $0.3344.\n\nHoskinson\u2019s commentary did not act as a bullish catalyst for ADA price and it remains to be seen whether the altcoin will begin its recovery from the downward trend."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s ethOS phone, designed to seamlessly integrate with EVM chains and layer 2s, has created a significant buzz by selling out its pre-orders in a day. Contrastingly, Solana\u2019s mobile venture, the Saga phone, has resorted to a major price adjustment this month, decreasing its cost by 40%.\n\nWhat is ethOS?\n\nThe ethOS mobile device is an innovative adaptation of the Google Pixel 7a, embedded with the Ethereum-specific mobile OS, ethOS. With the ability to function as a lightweight Ethereum client, the phone can autonomously verify blocks and sync with the Ethereum network, eliminating the need for intermediary services such as Infura or Alchemy.\n\nSecurity and Compatibility Features\n\nThis groundbreaking phone comes with an in-built wallet and ensures effortless integration with various other wallet services. Although the Pixel 7a doesn\u2019t classify as a hardware wallet, it is equipped with a unique security component \u2013 a secure enclave \u2013 which specializes in encrypting and securely storing private keys.\n\nHow to Buy Ethereum Phone?\n\nA mere 50 devices were accessible during the pre-order phase, requiring potential buyers to mint and subsequently burn an ethOS NFT to reserve their phone. These exclusive NFTs have now found their way onto the NFT trading platform, OpenSea, with a few exchanging hands for as much as 3 ETH or approximately $5,000. This is astonishing, especially when juxtaposed against the standard Google Pixel 7A\u2019s U.S. market price of $499.\n\nIs Ethereum Phone Better than Solana Phone?\n\nDespite the ethOS phone\u2019s initial success wave, the Solana Saga phone appears to have grappled with slower sales. Since its debut in April 2023, data from FlipsideCrypto suggests a sale of just 2,120 units. To rejuvenate its sales trajectory, Solana Mobile has strategically reduced the Saga phone\u2019s price tag from $1,000 to a more enticing $599.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might also like\n\nMore from Altcoin"

At the time of writing this line, Cardano is ranked as the eighth-biggest cryptocurrency, with a market valuation of $9.05 billion.\n\nConversely, Bitcoin and Ethereum sit as the first and second largest cryptocurrencies, with market caps worth $506.21 billion and $198.07 billion, respectively.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nHoskinson Highlights Bitcoin & Ethereum Downsides\n\nAlthough Cardano is far behind Bitcoin and Ethereum in terms of valuation, Hoskinson still thinks ADA will eventually become the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency.\n\nPer Hoskinson, the inefficient governance models of the market leaders- Bitcoin and Ethereum- could help Cardano overtake them in the long term.\n\nHoskinson pointed out that Bitcoin\u2019s weakness could come from its static design. Notably, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency has not changed its design for 13 years.\n\nAdditionally, he said Ethereum\u2019s dismissal of on-chain governance could also become a long-term liability for the crypto project, especially as it accumulates millions of users.\n\nHoskinson Makes Other Predictions\n\nFurthermore, Hoskinson also made other predictions, including the fact that Cardano might eventually become more than just a cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s [Cardano is] going to become the backbone of a new digital nation, a new society\u2014a place where we can finally begin to trust each other again, where we move from \u2018don\u2019t be evil\u2019 to \u2018can\u2019t be evil,'\u201d he added.\n\nADA Down 1.6% In 24 Hours\n\nMeanwhile, Cardano\u2019s native token ADA is trading at $0.25, down 1.6% over the past 24 hours. The crypto asset has been recording consistent declines since May 2023.\n\nAs reported earlier, ADA could register further dips, as a recent chart shows the coin is replicating its 2019 price movements."

        "content": "The total staked ETH was almost 28 million.\n\nStaked ETH currently makes up 21.8% of the total ETH supply.\n\nEthereum [ETH] staking has developed a distinct trajectory, separate from the price trends. As more of the circulating supply gets locked up in staking, one particular metric is experiencing a decline.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nEthereum staking on the rise\n\nRecent data from CryptoQuant indicated a steady upward trajectory in Ethereum\u2019s total staked value. As of this writing, nearly 28 million ETH were staked, in sharp contrast to the approximately 16 million ETH staked in January. This signified a substantial increase in staking volume.\n\nAccording to CryptoMarketCap, the total circulating supply of ETH had surpassed 120 million as of this writing. Additionally, data from Dune Analytics revealed that the staked portion constituted more than 21.8% of the total supply, implying that nearly 22% of the entire ETH supply was staked at press time.\n\nConsidering the daily staking rate, this proportion is anticipated to rise further. However, it\u2019s worth noting that while staking potential was on the rise, there was an opposing trend in the supply of ETH on exchanges.\n\nExchanges see less and less Ethereum\n\nIn January, the proportion of the entire Ethereum supply held on exchanges exceeded 11%. Nonetheless, this metric has undergone a substantial reduction in recent months.\n\nAs of this writing, the percentage of the circulating supply residing on exchanges hovered around 8.5%. Also, this shift signified a decrease from the January figure of over 13 million to approximately 10.7 million on exchanges.\n\nAdditionally, this reflected a scenario where an increasing number of holders were inclined to stake their ETH. Furthermore, it demonstrated that a smaller proportion opted to retain their holdings on exchanges.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nETH volume sees a slight decline\n\nThe decline in Ethereum\u2019s supply on exchanges has had repercussions on its trading volume, as highlighted by Santiment. The volume chart revealed that while ETH was still experiencing a respectable trading volume, it paled compared to the volume recorded at the start of the year.\n\nAs of this writing, the trading volume was approximately 5 billion. Furthermore, this figure falls several billion short of the average volume exceeding 7 billion observed around January."

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin Confirms Post-Merge Ethereum Centralization Concerns, Urges Not to \u2018Overly Catastrophize\u2019 It\n\nVitalik Buterin. Source: a video screenshot, Lex Fridman / YouTube\n\nEthereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin has said he is \u201cdefinitely\u201d worried about centralization risks following The Merge, the event when the current Ethereum Mainnet merges with the beacon chain proof-of-stake (PoS) system.\n\nThe Ethereum mastermind noted that Lido Finance, the largest provider of staking services for Ethereum, where around a third of staked ETH (stETH) has been deposited, could theoretically disturb the Ethereum network post-Merge.\n\n\u201cBut I also think it\u2019s important to not overly catastrophize the issue,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, if you have a third [of staked Ether deposits on the Beacon chain], you can\u2019t revert the chain or whatever,\u201d Buterin said in an interview with Fortune, adding:\n\n\u201cBut realistically, the worst that you could do is make finality stop happening for about a day or so, which is inconvenient, but it\u2019s not that terrible.\u201d\n\nButerin also mentioned that Lido does not act as a single entity but that \u201cthey have something like 21 delegates and nodes that are running these validators that are inside of Lido,\u201d he said, claiming that \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of good decentralization between them.\u201d\n\nLido is the largest provider of staking services for Ethereum. Generally, users who want to become Ethereum 2.0 validators and earn rewards need to stake a minimum of ETH 32, which is a high price.\n\nHowever, Lido enables users to pool their ETH and participate in staking even if they don\u2019t have the required ETH 32. The protocol distributes stETH tokens to users in return for their staked coins, which can be redeemed for ETH in the future or traded for other coins.\n\nThe Merge is Ethereum\u2019s long-anticipated update expected to happen by the end of the year.\n\nThe upgrade has several benefits, Buterin said, noting that it makes Ethereum more environmentally friendly compared to the current proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism. According to last year\u2019s estimate by a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, this upgrade can cut the energy used by the Ethereum network by at least 99.95%.\n\n\u201cAlso, proof of stake can increase the safety of the system. It makes it more expensive to attack,\u201d Buterin told Fortune. \u201cIt makes it easier to recover from an attack, which is something people don\u2019t think about.\u201d\n\nAnother benefit is that PoS is more censorship-resistant. That is because, Buterin says, \u201cminers are easier to detect and easier to shut down than just computers that are running validator nodes.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, at 10:33 UTC, ETH is trading at USD 1,156, up by 3% over the past 24 hours and down 4% over the past 7 days.

        "title": "Why blockchain will change our lives (and revolutionize the economy in the process) - EL PA\u00cdS USA",
        "content": "Blockchain is a silent technology. Its practical applications aren\u2019t as easy for ordinary citizens to visualize, when compared to the metaverse or artificial intelligence. And yet, it\u2019s the foundation of a major economic revolution.\n\nBefore discussing blockchain\u2019s potential, it\u2019s best to define what exactly we\u2019re talking about.\n\nIts beginnings are linked to cryptocurrencies \u2013 especially bitcoin \u2013 but its journey is much longer and will produce important changes in payment systems. Most central banks are already working on their digital currencies. Meanwhile, logistics, the video game industry, or the world of investment are transforming as a result of tokenization \u2013 the concept of turning real assets into digital replicas.\n\nBlockchain technology isn\u2019t just a database: it\u2019s a set of technologies that allow for the transfer of a value or asset from one place to another, without the intervention of third parties. In this sense, it proposes a new financial model, in which authenticity isn\u2019t verified by a third party, but by the network of nodes (computers connected to the network) that participate in blockchain. Hence, no transfer of value \u2013 whether it\u2019s money or another asset that has some kind of value \u2013 is carried out through an intermediary, but through a consensus, allowing information to be stored in a transparent manner.\n\nAs its name indicates, blockchain is a chain of blocks, which contain encoded information related to a transaction on the network. And, being intertwined (hence the word chain), the blocks allow for the transfer of data (or value) with a fairly secure encoding through the use of cryptography. \u201cWhat\u2019s truly new is that the transfer doesn\u2019t require a third party to certify the information. Rather, it\u2019s distributed in multiple independent and equal nodes that examine and validate it, without the need for them to know each other,\u201d explain analysts from the Spanish bank BBVA. \u201cOnce entered, the information cannot be deleted; only new information can be added, since the blocks are connected to each other through cryptographic encryption. Modifying data from a block prior to the chain is impossible, since it would have to modify the information from the previous blocks.\u201d\n\nSomeone consults the price of Ethereum on their phone. Cryptocurrencies utilize blockchain technology. Angel Garcia (BLOOMBERG)\n\nThe big banks are already preparing for what\u2019s coming. Citibank, for instance, has published a lengthy report on the economic impact of blockchain. Digital currencies (CBDCs) issued by the world\u2019s leading economies alone could be valued at $5 trillion by the end of this decade and would be accessible on the mobile phones of 2 billion people. 90% of central banks are currently running pilot programs involving the use of virtual currencies. However, the European Central Bank (ECB) thinks that the new digital euro won\u2019t be available for at least another three years, as several unknowns remain to be cleared up, particularly regarding privacy concerns.\n\nNew formats\n\nPerhaps Manisha Patel \u2013 a finance expert at the IMF \u2013 has some solutions to the issues with blockchain. Firstly, how would this technology help the most vulnerable?\n\n\u201cThese new digital formats are being explored by many developing economies, due to their potential to increase financial inclusion. They\u2019ll succeed if they\u2019re an affordable and widely-accepted payment instrument,\u201d Patel notes. But these countries will require extensive internet infrastructure and access to mobile phones, so as to overcome barriers. \u201cCustom proposals in each country can take several years,\u201d she warns.\n\nAnd what will happen to crypto assets if official digital currencies become popular? \u201cCryptocurrencies will survive as a form of payment within the underground economy, illegal activities and tax evasion. They compete with $100 bills,\u201d predicts Kenneth Rogoff, a former IMF chief economist. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be used for speculation and crime,\u201d agrees Emilio Capela, a partner at McKinsey & Company. However, several experts believe in redemption.\n\nEnrique Dans \u2013 a professor at IE Business School \u2013 values the freedom that comes from not depending on a central bank. And he gets excited when talking with his eight-year-old little brother about ethereum, \u201can open source community that, unlike bitcoin, takes much less energy to mine (manufacture),\u201d he says. \u201cWith this technology, the 2008 crash wouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201d\n\nAnother business that envisions mountains of money coming from blockchain is that of video games. Last year, some 3.2 billion players or gamers used the technology. These guys don\u2019t usually ask themselves what technology is behind their video games. However, with the Web3 ecosystem (defined by investor Packy McCormick as \u201can internet that\u2019s owned by developers and users, coordinated with tokens\u201d), they\u2019ll improve their experience when sitting in front of a computer. Newzoo \u2013 the consultancy that specializes in this intangible space \u2013 calculates that blockchain generates $184 billion annually from the video game sector.\n\nEverything was more or less on track\u2026 until bitcoin began to be surrounded by controversy. \u201cCryptocurrencies have [blighted] the reputation of blockchain. However, the technology on which they are based is very useful,\u201d clarifies Javier Pino, an expert from the Alliance for Financial Inclusion. Still, frauds, thefts and the bankruptcy of the FTX platform have left the crypto world with bad memories.\n\nConsumption plays a big role in this game (distributors will gain an advantage in efficiency with the massive use of block systems), which, despite everything, can still be financially lucrative. Two major technologies \u2013 blockchain and tokenization \u2013 want to share the future together. Tokenization changes everything, because almost everything is tokenizable: a line of credit, a venture capital investment, the purchase of a house, the rights to songs and images, shares, currencies, gold, a Picasso painting\u2026 Advocates argue that digital assets democratize investments that were originally meant for the elites, or create brand-new investments that didn\u2019t previously exist in the financial markets.\n\n\u201cTokenization can transform financial and non-financial infrastructure and public and private markets in the next five to 15 years,\u201d estimates Alkesh Shah, director of digital asset strategy at Bank of America Global Research. The tokenized digital stock market is estimated to reach between $4 and $5 trillion by 2030. \u201cIt already allows for a reduction in credit risk, increasing the liquidity of assets that were previously illiquid, or allocating capital more efficiently,\u201d the analyst explains.\n\n\u201cThe next generation of the markets [and] the next generation of the shares will be their tokenization,\u201d predicted Larry Fink \u2013 president and founder of BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager \u2013 in an interview with The New York Times from November of 2022. If Picasso reinvented painting by dispensing with the vanishing point, technological disruption is poised to reimagine finance. Two inseparable sciences also help: sociology and cryptography. 67% of millennials (those born after 1981) around the world prefer to be guided by computer recommendations (robo advisors) when investing, rather than by fellow human beings. The investment firm Schroders has even deployed a new mantra to adapt to this trend: \u201ctechnology and digital experience.\u201d\n\nTokens are also gaining ground as the largest inheritance in history is about to begin. In the coming decades, Schroders details that, for example, in the United Kingdom alone, the former baby boomers (those born between the late-1940s and early-1970s) will bequeath 5.5 trillion pounds \u2013 or $7 trillion \u2013 to millennials and generation Z, who will tend to put more money in non-traditional assets. \u201cCurrently, tokens aren\u2019t defined or regulated consistently in all regions\u2026 but [government] administrations will address that deficiency,\u201d analysts from Schroders predict.\n\nTokenization \u2013 blessed by Wall Street \u2013 has already reached the mainstream economy. Venture capital firms such as KKR, Hamilton Lane and Apollo are digitizing some of their funds through blockchain platforms. Those who understand the technology will recognize the platforms ADDX, Avalanche, or Polygon. Meanwhile, other finance giants \u2013 such as Goldman Sachs, HSBC, JP Morgan, Citi, and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u2013 have designed their own structures to trade digital assets. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to develop the use of these services on a large scale,\u201d emphasizes John Gladwyn, manager of Pictet Digital. In fact, Hamilton Lane has lowered the minimum investment required to access some of its funds from $125,000 to $10,000. And, late last year, KKR tokenized its healthcare fund via the Avalanche platform. Even the market value of tokenized gold surpassed $1 billion in March.\n\nConstant Innovation\n\nFinancial institutions understand that they have to constantly innovate or \u2013 like a recurring nightmare \u2013 they will suddenly be worthless. Until now, cryptocurrencies had the big problem of volatility. The way to get around this fence is with stablecoins. This digital currency is linked to a real currency, such as the dollar, to provide holders with stability. There were about $7.8 trillion in stablecoin transactions in 2022 alone. Still, hackers appear, as do speculators \u2013 both hindrances in any ecosystem where seas of money flow. This has caused doubts to emerge. \u201cThe stable versions [of bitcoin] are of little use as stores of value, because it\u2019s never clear if they have enough collateral [assets] to stabilize the currency in the event of [cyber] attacks,\u201d warns Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda Montalvo, a professor of Economics at Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona.\n\nWithin the uncertainties that come with all technologies, perhaps one of the spaces where there\u2019s more consensus resides in smart contracts. This programming software allows pre-established transactions to be carried out only after a series of requirements have been met. \u201c[This] guarantees a high level of accuracy and compliance,\u201d affirms \u00c1lvaro Casado, head of digital assets at KPMG. Smart contracts work through blockchain, so the terms of the agreements are saved in a database. They can be seen\u2026 but not changed. \u201cA clear beneficiary will be international trade, which uses an enormous amount of documentation and conditions. It could be automated with standardized rules and simpler trading options,\u201d Garc\u00eda Montalvo describes.\n\nWith these types of contracts \u2013 along with the tokenization of the supply chain \u2013 those who make a fortune counterfeiting, say, Louis Vuitton bags, would have a hard time. \u201cDolce & Gabbana or Gucci have already launched experiments selling digital garments, [which are] protected within that blockchain,\u201d says Javier Molina, an analyst at eToro. \u201cIf, as a customer, I buy the NFT or, say, a digital scarf, it\u2019s guaranteed that only I am the owner.\u201d Porsche and Mercedes are also getting into this technology.\n\nIt\u2019s not just about the money. In developing countries, adulterated medicines (between 10% and 30% of all pharmaceutical drugs sold) cost a million lives a year. Hence the value of tracing \u2013 of following the trail. \u201cWalmart [and] IBM have managed to track the path of orange juice from a farm in South Africa to the American consumer in just three seconds [with the help of blockchain technology],\u201d says Daria Krivonos, CEO of the Copenhagen Institute for Future Studies.\n\nAround 20% of the top 10 global food companies will use blockchain technology by 2025. One example of this phenomenon is BlockBar: a blockchain-governed platform that allows luxury beverage brands to issue NFTs on a collection of rare wines or spirits. The goal is to own these exclusive bottles and sell them on the secondary market. \u201cThe company stores them in state-of-the-art facilities and they can be shipped worldwide, or picked up at more than 250 duty-free outlets,\u201d says its president, Sam Falic.\n\nBig brands make a bet\n\nLittle by little, an ecosystem is taking root, one whose fertile ground is that of blockchain. Brands are building a community in relation to this technology. Adidas has created an NFT collection called Into the Metaverse; Balenciaga has designed different outfits for Fortnite game avatars, while Gucci sold a virtual bag on the Roblox video game platform for $4,000. Nike recently acquired RTFKT Studios \u2013 a digital shoe manufacturer.\n\nBut this technology not only lives in that thin digital air: it also exists on the ground. \u201cThe application of digital technologies and blockchain \u2013 if they\u2019re adjusted to local needs and we guarantee that small producers can also access them \u2013 could generate great benefits for the economy as a whole, and achieve greater efficiency, productivity, resilience and sustainability,\u201d lists M\u00e1ximo Torero, chief economist of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). He also warns that \u201cthere\u2019s a risk of aggravating inequalities if these advances continue to be inaccessible to women, young people or small producers.\u201d\n\nTokenization is a phenomenon that\u2019s increasingly becoming part of culture. Selling the music catalogs of successful artists to companies such as Hipgnosis \u2013 run by Canada\u2019s Merck Mercuriadis \u2013 is generating billions. The singers earn money that relieves them from financial pressure, while the firms make cash through the reproduction rights. Universal Music Publishing has paid about $600 million to Bob Dylan to acquire his catalog. Bruce Springsteen has sold 300 songs, 20 studio albums and 23 live albums for approximately $500 million, while Sting sold all his production to Universal after receiving more than $300 million. About 130 creators \u2013 such as Paul Simon, The Killers, Phil Collins, or Neil Young \u2013 have already liquidated their works.\n\nUntil now, investing in intellectual property was impossible for an average earner. This is where blockchain technology, tokenization and its ability to fragment pieces of cultural production come into play. For instance, the co-producer of Rihanna\u2019s song Bitch Better Have My Money has made $63,000 after tokenizing the rights to the song in an NFT. He divided it into 300 parts for $210 apiece through the AnotherBlock platform. The fragments were subsequently purchased by 205 people.\n\nSelling bits of paint as art\n\nTurning masterpieces into digital assets clearly opens up big business opportunities. But it also raises some ethical questions.\n\nRemnants of paint on the studio floor that belonged to artist Jackson Pollock. This was turned into an NFT. Pamela Hassell (AP PHOTO/ LAPRES\n\nThe conversion of artworks into digital assets to exploit their value is dividing the art world. In the last months of 2021, NFT-based crypto art was going through its winter. After the digital artist Beeple (Mike Winkelmann) sold a $69.3 million NFT (Everydays: The First 5000 Days) via Christie\u2019s, almost everyone in the industry thought the most absurd art orgy in history was over. \u201cThey\u2019re a scam, just like cryptocurrencies,\u201d shrugs philosopher Bartomeu Mar\u00ed. \u201cRight-wing anarchism was looking for a way to escape the financial control of the state and not pay taxes. I haven\u2019t seen any fabulous artwork in that format.\u201d\n\nBut the pursuit of money by human beings can never be exhausted. Jackson Pollock\u2019s studio has turned the paint residue that stains the floor of the deceased artist\u2019s workspace into NFTs. In association with the Web3 Iconic platform, the studio churned out 100 units from the stains. This past July 19, they were marketed online: all were sold in just three hours for around $450,000 (paid in dollars and ethereum). When Pollock worked, paint dripped down the wooden handles of his brushes.\n\nThe works of Rafael Lozano-Hemmer are exhibited in some of the most prestigious galleries in the world, such as the Pace Gallery in New York. Acquiring one of his works can cost over a million dollars. The Mexican artist tells EL PA\u00cdS his thoughts on the matter:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made sure that my name isn\u2019t associated with NFTs, due to its intricate relationship with cryptocurrencies,\u201d he summarizes. That being said, he defends that the format can be a means of survival for artists from communities that are poorly-represented in the market. \u201cHowever, I\u2019m less impressed with creators who have a privileged position \u2013 I think of myself \u2013 and still produce them,\u201d he criticizes.\n\nOver the course of nine days this past April, British artist Damien Hirst pocketed more than $20 million from the sale of 5,508 paintings from his spiral series \u2013 all of which were generated by artificial intelligence. 399 were turned into NFTs. Despite everything, art institutions such as Lacma, Castello di Rivoli, Buffalo AKG or Pompidou have included them in their collections. In this new climate, there\u2019s always the question about what will perish and what history will disdain.\n\nMeasures are being taken so that this tokenization cannot be done to the great masters. The Italian government halted NFT sales of masterpieces from the country\u2019s museums in July of 2022. Those who paid $80,000 for NFTs of Michaelangelo\u2019s Doni Tondo ended up making a bad business decision. While many museums engaged in this form of digital commerce during the pandemic to raise funds, Italy will no longer allow this to continue: it wants to protect its cultural heritage.\n\nThe person in charge of one of the great Spanish art galleries \u2013 who requests anonymity \u2013 is in agreement. \u201cThe collection belongs to the whole country. It would be devaluing the works if we [allowed them to be sold digitally] to specific people,\u201d he reflects. However, the Thyssen Museum in Madrid has decided to use this technological tool with the painting Les Vessenots pr\u00e8s d\u2019Auvers (1890), by Vincent Van Gogh. The institution is selling 100 digital versions of the painting for $33,00 apiece. They can be purchased on an NFT marketplace run by a local telecommunications company.\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PA\u00cdS USA Edition"

        "content": "In what could be a sign of the crypto market reaching the local bottom for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), the Net Unrealized Profit or Loss (NUPL) metric for the top two cryptocurrencies is showing a historical trend. In terms of trader sentiment, the euphoria around the spot Bitcoin ETF filings is starting to fade out, reflecting the same in the asset prices.\n\nAlso Read: DeFi Today: Uniswap Dominance, DYDX Rise And DeFi TVL At 2.5 Year Lows\n\nadvertisement\n\nOn-Chain Data Shows Dip In Bitcoin Relative Unrealized Profit\n\nAccording to latest dat from Glassnode, the BTC Relative Unrealized Profit has reached a five month low of 0.402 at the current price level. This means more and more traders are making losses and this is often a sign that the asset price is nearing the bottom. The current BTC price level still represents a significant improvement from the beginning of the year 2023, when the top cryptocurrency was trading at below $20,000.\n\nSimilarly, the number of addresses in profit based on 7 day moving average is at a 5-month low, reflecting signs of ETH price nearing the bottom. Earlier, CoinGape reported that the range between $1700 and $1577 is crucial for the next break or make move. A breakout from the $1700 range could likely result in a bullish move for Ethereum price.\n\nWhat Next For BTC Price Moves?\n\nWhile the crypto market has recently been subjected to a prolonged sideways movement in Bitcoin price around the $30,000 level, it was going hand in hand with the spot Bitcoin ETF filing related developments. In the first week of September 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is scheduled to deliver updates on several spot ETF filings including from Blackrock. However, it could most likely be the case that the SEC officials will pass off the first deadlines without much progress.\n\nAlso Read: Donald Trump\u2019s Surprise Return to X Fuels Surge in Trump NFT Sales"

        "content": "Ethereum price is struggling to rise above $1,700 against the US Dollar. ETH whales seem to accumulate, and the $1,620 support could be the key.\n\nEthereum is struggling to rise above the $1,680 and $1,700 levels.\n\nThe price is trading below $1,670 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,665 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could start a decent increase above the $1,670 and $1,700 resistance levels.\n\nEthereum Price Holds Support\n\nEthereum\u2019s price started a short-term upside correction above the $1,650 level.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nA slew of failures of centralized crypto exchanges and services over the past year has done little to stem consistent outflows from decentralized finance (DeFi) during that time, data shows.\n\nAccording to DefiLlama, less than $38 billion in value remains locked within DeFi protocols across chains, down from $178 billion at the industry\u2019s height in November 2021. Almost $21.8 billion of that is currently held in Ethereum protocols.\n\nThe overall figure even falls short of the ~$40 billion in total value locked (TVL) in DeFi shortly after centralized exchange FTX collapsed in November 2022, which cratered the amount of many assets locked within such protocols to a two-year low at the time. Centralized crypto lenders including BlockFi, Genesis, and Gemini Earn also collapsed amid the surrounding contagion.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThough TVL rose back to roughly $50 billion in April as the market recovered, the metric quickly retraced below $38 billion despite its underlying crypto values sliding relatively little over this period.\n\nThe $37.6 billion figure does not include funds locked in popular liquid staking protocols like Lido, which has more than doubled its TVL from $6 billion to $13.95 billion since FTX fell apart. As DeFiLlama notes, such protocols \"deposit into another protocol,\" so it's not counted in that tally.\n\nSimilarly, after launching in September 2022, Coinbase\u2019s staking service has accumulated an additional $2.1 billion worth of ETH. In total, such services contain another $20.2 billion in assets alone.\n\nLiquid staking allows investors to stake their assets and earn yield, while still having access to trading liquidity through pegged assets issued by the staking provider (such as cbETH and stETH).\n\nThis can be a more attractive alternative for investors than using a lending protocol like Aave, which forces users to lock their tokens and possibly be subject to unwanted protocol risk. At present, Aave\u2019s ETH and USDC yield rates are 1.63% and 2.43% respectively, versus Coinbase\u2019s 3.65% ETH staking rate, and 4.5% USDC rate.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAave\u2019s total value locked has fallen 21% over the past month to just $4.5 billion, while Curve Finance has slid 26% to $2.3 billion.\n\nOutside of DeFi, the United States Federal Reserve\u2019s hawkish monetary policy has driven up yields on short-term government debt, potentially looking more attractive to investors than what stablecoin yields can offer."

        "content": "Over the last week, Ethereum (ETH) has seen its price take a slight hit following the general market crash due to reports of a massive Bitcoin sell-off.\n\nAccording to data from CoinMarketCap, ETH is down by 5.01% in the last seven days, bringing its total price loss in the previous month to 10.80%.\n\nAlbeit, despite Ethereum\u2019s negative performance, the on-chain analytics platform, Santiment, has noted some positive developments in terms of whale activity.\n\nEthereum Experiences Highest Whale Activity In 4 Months\n\nOn Thursday, August 24, Santiment posted a report on X (formerly Twitter) stating that Ethereum has recorded its largest level of whale transactions in the last 16 weeks.\n\nAccording to the blockchain intelligence firm, there has been a notable increase in transactions by addresses with large ETH holdings following the token\u2019s fall beneath the 1,650 price mark last week.\n\n\ud83d\udc33 #Ethereum\u2018s network has picked up in large address activity during this drop below $1,650 and its highly volatile price conditions. The amount of wallets holding between 10 and 10,000 $ETH has risen back up to 355K, and $100K+ transactions have surged. https://t.co/X137U93ZYu pic.twitter.com/J9lyMoeBmf \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) August 24, 2023\n\nSentiment reported that Ethereum experienced 23,073 ETH whale transactions in the past week, marking the network\u2019s highest since May 4.\n\nIn addition, the report also stated that the number of wallets with 10-10,000 ETH had surged by 1,788 since the start of June, returning this metric to the previous high of 355,000.\n\nCould The ETH Market Experience A Boost Soon?\n\nBased on Santiment\u2019s report, it can be inferred that the decline in ETH\u2019s price has led to a buying spree by large investors anticipating a price surge, thus taking advantage of the current market dip.\n\nProviding more insight into this trend, Lookonchain, another market intelligence firm, has also reported on the ongoing accumulation of ETH.\n\nVia an X post on Thursday, Lookonchain stated that four whales have collectively purchased 56,100 ETH, valued at $94 million, in the last seven days.\n\nFollowing such heavy investments, it appears that ETH major investors are banking on the prominent altcoin to begin a market rebound soon.\n\nHowever, data from Coincodex states that general market sentiments around ETH remain bearish. At the same time, the Fear & Greed Index is set at 41, indicating that many other investors are still skeptical about the token\u2019s potential gains.\n\nETH is trading at $1,652.06 at the time of writing, with a 1.861% loss on the last day. In tandem, the token\u2019s trading volume is also down by 31.07%, valued at $5.67 billion.\n\nNotwithstanding, with a market cap value of $198.36 billion, Ethereum remains the second-largest cryptocurrency.\n\nETH trading at $1,652.4 on the weekly chart | Source: ETHUSD chart on Tradingview.com\n\nFeatured image from BBC Wildlife Magazine, chart from Tradingview.\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

The other, sporting the ticker symbol ARKY, will include both Bitcoin and Ethereum futures. These applications have been filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and are pending approval.\n\nThe objective of these actively managed ETFs is long-term capital appreciation. According to the prospectus, ARK 21Shares Active Ethereum Futures ETF, or ARKZ, will invest in standardized, exchange-traded Ether futures contracts that are cash-settled in U.S. dollars.\n\nThese contracts are regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and are likely to be traded on exchanges like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).\n\nIt's worth noting that these funds will not invest directly in cryptocurrencies but will instead seek exposure through futures contracts.\n\nIt's important to note that the funds do not offer direct exposure to \"spot\" prices of Ethereum or Bitcoin, and therefore might not fully capture the volatility or potential upside of the underlying assets.\n\nThese investment products also come with inherent risks such as \"contango\" and \"backwardation,\" which could affect pricing and erode returns.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s approval or disapproval of these ETF applications will be closely watched. As reported by U.Today, the regulator is gearing up to greenlight a host of cryptocurrency ETFs."

        "content": "Share:\n\nAfter a rather lull week, Bitcoin (BTC) price leads the cryptocurrency market into the weekend, where the volume of transactions is expected to be at the lowest. Like the largest altcoin by market capitalization, Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) prices have also not shown much activity this week, and this consolidation may prove detrimental, as markets tend not to wait for that long.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Weekly Forecast: BTC history forecasts another crash in Q3 ahead of Jackson Hole Symposium.\n\nBitcoin, altcoins, stablecoins FAQs What is Bitcoin? Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions. What are altcoins? Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an \u201cimproved\u201d version of it. What are stablecoins? Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility. What is Bitcoin Dominance? Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin\u2019s interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.\n\nBitcoin price could slip after weeklong consolidation\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price has not shown any directional bias this week and is zoning into the weekend at the same level as last week, $25,940. Considering prices do not hold out for very long during times when the market is bearish (like now) or bullish, it is possible that BTC could slide lower.\n\nCurrently, Bitcoin price is sitting on a solid support level, a demand zone marked in orange. Typically, this is an area characterized by aggressive buying. However, bulls are not acting, which could prove destructive for BTC holders.\n\nIf the demand zone fails to hold as a support level, Bitcoin price could slip through, converting it into a bearish breaker before revisiting the mid-March lows around $24,079.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is still headed south despite being under the dreadful 30 level. This shows that momentum is still falling. The histogram bars of the Awesome Oscillator (AO) are also in the negative, adding credence to the bearish outlook.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nNevertheless, weekends have been known to be dominated by large wallets looking to take advantage of retailers stepping back for the weekend. If this plays out, Bitcoin price could show momentum within the weekend.\n\nConversely, Bitcoin price could rise, breaking past the immediate barricade at $27,300 before extending north. A move up to the supply zone (blue) is likely in such a turnout to the order block dominated by sellers. Overcoming this region could set the tone for BTC to reclaim the territory above the psychological $30,000, possibly tagging the $31,804 resistance level. Such a move would denote a 20% climb.\n\nThe presence of bulls in the BTC market is already evident, indicated by the large volumes of green bars of the AO.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price holds at $26,100 range ahead of Jerome Powell\u2019s Speech at Jackson Hole Symposium.\n\nEthereum price stuck in a range\n\nEthereum (ETH) price remains stuck within the $1,699 and $1,630 range after the August 17 dump. Speculation of an ETH futures ETF approval gave the market some momentum but not enough to break out from the zone. Currently, momentum indicators, the RSI and AO, point to a weakening market, and the PoS token could slump.\n\nAs volume continues to reduce, Ethereum price could lose the $1,630 support level before extending south toward the $1,507 support level. This would constitute a 10% drop from current levels.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, if the ETH ETF narrative continues to drive the market, expect Ethereum price to fight out the current gloom and head north. While a break above the immediate barrier at $1,699 would be ideal, invalidation of the current bearish outlook would only occur after ETH converts the supply zone (green) into a bullish breaker, forging above it to reclaim highs above the $2,000 psychological level. This would indicate a 20% ascent.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum price outperforms Bitcoin on speculation that SEC may approve ETH futures ETF sooner.\n\nRipple price calculated next move\n\nRipple (XRP) is working out the next step after a rejection from the $0.5752 resistance level. Buying pressure from the demand zone (orange between $0.5040 and $0.4600) is present, though seemingly insufficient to facilitate a swift uptrend.\n\nUnless bulls resurface strongly, Ripple price may slip through the immediate support offered by the demand zone to tag the range zone at $0.4191 potentially, levels last seen during the August 17 crash, provoked by the BTC dip and worsened by Judge Analisa Torres allowing the US SEC to file an interlocutory appeal.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, increased buying activity could change the fate of Ripple price, sending it above the $0.5752 roadblock, thereby reclaiming the ground lost during the recent dip. A sustained uptrend could see XRP overcome multiple hurdles, but confirmation of an uptrend would only happen once the remittance token records a decisive daily candlestick close above the July 19 highs at $0.8193.\n\nAlso Read: XRP whale moves 29 million tokens to Bitstamp amid price slide"

        "title": "Is Cardano DEAD? Ethereum Fans claim THIS New Chain will Replace Cardano - CryptoTicker.io - Bitcoin Price, Ethereum Price & Crypto News",
        "content": "Two crypto platforms have consistently garnered attention: Cardano and Ethereum. While both aim to revolutionize the world of decentralized applications and smart contracts, their origins, philosophies, and technical foundations differ significantly. In this article, we delve deep into Cardano, a platform often touted for its research-driven approach, and Ethereum, the pioneering force behind programmable blockchain transactions. Is Cardano dead?\n\nWhat is Cardano?\n\nCardano is a decentralized, open-source blockchain platform that offers a more secure and sustainable infrastructure for the development and execution of smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Created with a research-driven approach, Cardano distinguishes itself by emphasizing peer-reviewed academic research to ensure scalability, sustainability, and security. It employs a unique proof-of-stake consensus algorithm known as Ouroboros, which positions Cardano as a more energy-efficient alternative compared to proof-of-work-based blockchains.\n\nWhen did Cardano Start?\n\nCardano was introduced to the cryptocurrency community in 2017 by one of the co-founders of Ethereum, Charles Hoskinson. Through his technology company IOHK (Input Output Hong Kong), Hoskinson set out to address challenges faced by earlier blockchain platforms, particularly in terms of scalability, security, and sustainability. Cardano\u2019s development journey began a few years earlier, with intensive research leading up to its launch.\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nEthereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain platform that enables developers to build and deploy smart contracts and decentralized applications. It introduced the concept of programmable transactions, thereby extending the basic functionality of a blockchain. While Bitcoin, the pioneer of cryptocurrencies, is primarily a digital currency, Ethereum is more about enabling decentralized digital applications. The Ethereum network is powered by its native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), which is used for transaction fees and computational services on the network.\n\nWhen did Ethereum Start?\n\nEthereum was proposed by programmer Vitalik Buterin in late 2013. Driven by his vision and in collaboration with other developers, the Ethereum platform underwent a public crowdsale in mid-2014 to secure funding for its development. Ethereum\u2019s network officially went live on July 30, 2015, when the genesis block was mined, marking the platform\u2019s inception. Since then, Ethereum has undergone multiple upgrades and has firmly established itself as one of the foremost platforms in the blockchain and cryptocurrency landscape.\n\nCardano\u2019s TVL Challenged by a Newcomer\n\nEthereum enthusiast Evan Van Ness recently highlighted on a prominent platform that Base, an Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) chain released just this year, has overtaken Cardano in terms of Total Value Locked (TVL). With evidence from DeFiLlama, Van Ness labeled Cardano as a \u201czombie chain.\u201d The data indicates that Cardano holds a TVL of $159 million, positioning itself at 14th place. This is in contrast to Ethereum\u2019s massive $21.7 billion TVL.\n\nThe Rise of Base: Coinbase\u2019s Layer 2 Chain\n\nLaunched in partnership with Optimism earlier in the year, Base, a product of Coinbase, has shown remarkable progress. Within a few months of its introduction, it has accrued a TVL of $185 million. The design principle of Layer 2 chains, such as Base, is to amplify the capabilities of the foundational blockchain \u2013 Ethereum in this instance. These Layer 2 solutions boost transaction speed, decrease transaction costs, and magnify scalability. Yet, they still retain the inherent security and decentralized traits of the primary blockchain.\n\nDeveloper-Centric Design and a Powerful Application Suite\n\nCoinbase designed Base with developers in mind. This approach has facilitated effortless synchronization with Coinbase utilities, features, and its user base. Among its diverse range of applications, BaseSwap, SwapBased, and Stargate have been significant contributors to its impressive TVL figures.\n\nIs Cardano DEAD?\n\nContrarily, Cardano showcases its suite of high-performing decentralized apps such as Minswap, Indigo, and Liqwid. It\u2019s pivotal to understand that the label of \u201czombie chain\u201d applied to Cardano by some proponents of rival networks might be overlooking Cardano\u2019s expansive ambitions and ongoing strides in the blockchain space.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might also like\n\nMore from Altcoin"

An anonymous entity scooped up a whopping 118,300 BTC (now valued at over $3 billion), becoming the third-largest holder of Bitcoin in the world in just three months. While the whale\u2019s true identity remains unknown, speculations range from major traditional financial institutions like BlackRock to crypto exchanges like Gemini.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRevival Of Whale Fossils\n\nMultiple ancient Ethereum whales have come out of a decade-long hibernation this year.\n\nOn July 19, a wallet holding pre-mined Ether that had remained inactive for eight years transferred assets worth over $116 million to a Kraken exchange wallet, sparking much curiosity. Another pre-mine address, dormant for 8.1 years, sprung to life recently, moving 191 Ethereum tokens with a valuation of approximately $317,724.\n\nThat said, whales buying up ETH even as prices dunk suggests another leg up might be on the cards soon."

        "title": "Ethereum ETF Race: ARK Files for Futures ETF Along With 18 Others - Crypto Briefing",
        "content": "Key Takeaways 18 Ethereum ETFs submitted this month.\n\nARK & 21Shares seek two new Ethereum futures ETFs.\n\nShare this article URL Copied\n\nYesterday, ARK Invest and 21Shares, submitted two new Ethereum futures ETFs to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe first, named Active Ethereum Futures ETF (ARKZ), focuses solely on Ethereum derivatives. The second, Active Bitcoin Ethereum Strategy ETF (ARKY), will cover both Bitcoin and Ethereum futures. Both of these products will invest in Ether futures that settle in cash via the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.\n\nThe filing states that the Active Ethereum Futures ETF plans to allocate over a quarter of its assets to Ether futures. The remaining assets will be diversified into liquid, short-term investment avenues like U.S. Treasuries, money market instruments, and repurchase agreements. Following a similar asset distribution pattern, the Active Ethereum Futures ETF also proposes to allocate more than 25% of its resources to Ether futures and balance the remainder with liquid, short-term assets.\n\nThis news closely trails Bloomberg\u2019s report from last week, indicating that the SEC might be on the brink of green-lighting an Ethereum ETF that invests in futures.\n\nAugust saw significant activity in this sector with the submission of 18 different Ethereum ETFs to the SEC. These applications hail from a diverse range of funds, including Volatility Shares, Bitwise, Roundhill, VanEck, Proshares, Grayscale, Direxion, Kelly ETFs, and Valkyrie. Breaking down the details, 10 out of these 18 ETFs are purely Ethereum-based, whereas the other eight propose a combination of Bitcoin and Ethereum investment strategies.\n\nStanding out among the submissions is the Ether Strategy ETF by Volatility Shares, positioned as the first exclusive ETH ETF in the lineup, with an expected approval date of October 11. Additionally, in the BTC and ETH mix, the Direxion Bitcoin Ether Strategy ETF is set for potential approval on October 16.\n\nEthereum is trading at $1,649 at the time of writing, a near-flat performance in the last 24 hours, according to CoinGecko."

        "content": "The collaboration showcases an effort to diversify investment options for potential investors in the cryptocurrency space.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s previous rejections have underscored the stringent regulatory environment surrounding crypto-based financial products.\n\nARK Invest and 21Shares, prominent investment firms, have submitted joint applications for two Ethereum [ETH] futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This move coincided with recent reports indicating that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might be on the verge of approving Ethereum ETF applications.\n\nThe proposed ETFs were detailed in a filing made to the SEC on 24 August. ARKZ is planned to allocate a minimum of 25% of its total assets to cash-settled Ethereum futures contracts. These include those available on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).\n\nConversely, ARKY will feature both Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum futures contracts in its composition. Empowered Funds will serve as the investment advisor for these Ethereum products.\n\nNotably, ARK Invest and 21Shares had previously collaborated to launch a spot Bitcoin ETF in the year 2021.\n\nThe SEC had previously rejected ARK Invest\u2019s initial two attempts for a Bitcoin spot ETF. The first request was in March 2022, and the other in January. Subsequently, they filed their latest Bitcoin spot ETF application in April, a couple of months ahead of the $10 trillion firm BlackRock\u2019s own application.\n\nEthereum ETF application filed amid\u2026\n\nThe SEC\u2019s scrutiny led to a significant development wherein several Bitcoin spot ETF applications were deemed inadequate. In response, ARK 21Shares and other applicants incorporated surveillance sharing agreements into their applications as a strategic measure.\n\nIn addition to their recent Ethereum ETF filings, these investment firms are also eagerly awaiting the outcomes of their applications for the \u201cArk 21Shares Active Bitcoin Futures ETF\u201d (ARKA) and the \u201cArk 21Shares Active On-Chain Bitcoin Strategy ETF\u201d (ARKC).\n\nThis move is indicative of growing interest within the investment community to tap into the evolving cryptocurrency market. Ethereum has garnered significant attention due to its smart contract capabilities and its role in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.\n\nThe partnership comes at a time when financial institutions are increasingly exploring opportunities in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nWhile the SEC\u2019s previous rejections underscore the stringent regulatory environment, the recent developments signal a potential shift in attitude. The anticipation of Ethereum ETF approvals indicates that regulators are acknowledging the maturation of the cryptocurrency market and its integration into traditional financial frameworks."

According to one of the project\u2019s founders, three of the co-founders were responsible for the recent suspicious transactions from the multi-sig wallet which resulted in the outflow of over $15 million worth of the meme tokens.\n\nRemaining PEPE In Multi-Sig Transferred To New Address\n\nAccording to a lengthy tweet on PEPE\u2019s official X (formerly Twitter) account, the recent unexpected transactions involving trillions of tokens were the actions of three of the project\u2019s four founders. One of the founders, who claims to be the only one remaining, told the PEPE community that the multi-signature was initially set up to require 3/4 signers present for approval.\n\nHowever, internal strife in the project led to constant conflicts which hindered its progress when it came to making donations or purchases with the multi-sig tokens due to the unavailability of signers. Three of the four people involved in the creation of PEPE reportedly left the project a week after its launch.\n\nAs per the remaining founder, the three ex-team members returned on August 25 and logged into the multi-sig wallet to steal 16 trillion PEPE that were subsequently transferred to centralized crypto exchanges including Binance, OKX, and Kucoin where they were sold. The former team members then removed themselves from the multi-sig and gave its full control to the remaining founder.\n\nThe actions of the former team members led to a 16% decline in PEPE\u2019s price since their transactions spooked investors and traders. The remaining founder confirmed that he had full control of the project\u2019s X account, its multi-sig wallet, and the 10 trillion tokens in the wallet. The founder added that the remaining tokens had been moved to a new address.\n\nI am shocked at what took place and would like to apologize for all of the fear and uncertainty and any losses the actions of these bad actors have caused members of our community.\u201d\n\nThe founder told the PEPE community that the project was free of bad actors and had \u201cclear roads ahead\u201d. They added that they were in talks with prominent members of the crypto community to guide the project going forward. The clarification from the founder led to a hike of over 11% in PEPE\u2019s price."

        "title": "Ethereum 2.0 Deposit Contract Reaches All Time High, Hacked Crypto Exchange Cypher Plans to Hold Public Token ... - Tekedia",
        "content": "The Ethereum 2.0 deposit contract, which holds the funds of users who want to stake on the new proof-of-stake network, has reached a new milestone. According to data from Etherscan, the deposit contract now holds over 28 million ETH, worth more than $4.6 billion at current prices. This is the highest amount of ETH ever locked in the contract, surpassing the previous peak of 8.4 million ETH in May 2021.\n\nThe deposit contract was launched in November 2020, ahead of the launch of the Ethereum 2.0 beacon chain, which is the first phase of the network upgrade. Users who want to become validators on the new network have to deposit at least 32 ETH into the contract and run a node that validates transactions and produces blocks. In return, they receive rewards in ETH for securing the network and participating in consensus.\n\nThe deposit contract is a one-way bridge, meaning that users cannot withdraw their funds until the merge of Ethereum 1.0 and Ethereum 2.0 transitioning will happened sometime in 2022. The merge marked the end of proof-of-work mining on Ethereum and the transition to a fully proof-of-stake network.\n\nThe growth of the deposit contract reflects the increasing interest and confidence in Ethereum 2.0, which promises to improve the scalability, security and sustainability of the network. According to data from Beaconcha.in, there are currently over 260,000 active validators on the beacon chain, with more than 100,000 pending validators waiting to join. The current annual percentage rate (APR) for staking on Ethereum 2.0 is around 6%, which is higher than most traditional investments.\n\nThe deposit contract also serves as a measure of the long-term commitment of ETH holders, who are willing to lock their funds for an indefinite period of time and support the development of the network. As more ETH gets deposited into the contract, the supply of ETH on the market decreases, which could have a positive impact on the price of ETH in the future.\n\nThe recent market crash has seen the price of Ethereum (ETH) drop to the $1600 range in August 2023, a level not seen since June 2023. However, not everyone is panicking. Some large investors, known as Ether Whales, have taken advantage of the dip and accumulated more ETH. According to data from Santiment, a blockchain analytics firm, the top 10 non-exchange ETH addresses have added more ETHERs to their holdings in the past days, worth about $94 million at current prices. This shows that these whales are confident in the long-term prospects of Ethereum and its network upgrade to Ethereum 2.0, which aims to improve scalability, security and energy efficiency.\n\nEthereum 2.0 is expected to be fully operational in late 2023 or early 2024, after several delays and technical challenges. The upgrade will transition Ethereum from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, which relies on miners to validate transactions, to a proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism, which rewards validators for staking their ETH. This will reduce the network\u2019s carbon footprint and allow for faster and cheaper transactions.\n\nThe Ether Whales are likely betting on the future growth of Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem, which hosts a variety of decentralized applications (DApps) in sectors such as decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), gaming and social media. Ethereum is the most popular platform for DApps, with over 3,000 active DApps and over 100,000 daily users, according to DappRadar. Despite the current market downturn, Ethereum\u2019s fundamentals remain strong, and its innovation continues. The Ether Whales may be ahead of the curve and scooping up ETH at a bargain price before the next bull run.\n\nHacked Crypto Exchange Cypher Plans to Hold Public Token Sale\n\nCypher, a crypto exchange that suffered a major hack in June, has announced its plans to hold a public token sale in October. The exchange claims that the token sale is part of its recovery strategy and that it has secured the support of its investors and users.\n\nAccording to a blog post published by Cypher on Monday, the exchange will issue 100 million CYP tokens, which will represent 20% of its equity. The tokens will be sold at a price of $0.1 each, valuing the exchange at $50 million. The token sale will be conducted on a decentralized platform called Launchpad, which is powered by Binance Smart Chain.\n\nCypher said that the token sale will help it raise funds to reimburse its users who lost their funds in the hack, as well as to upgrade its security and infrastructure. The exchange also said that it will use part of the proceeds to launch new products and services, such as margin trading, futures, and options.\n\nThe exchange added that it has obtained the approval of its existing investors, who have agreed to convert their shares into CYP tokens. Cypher also said that it has received positive feedback from its users, who have expressed their interest in participating in the token sale and supporting the exchange\u2019s recovery.\n\nCypher was hacked on June 15, when an unknown attacker exploited a vulnerability in its smart contract and drained $25 million worth of crypto assets from its hot wallet. The exchange suspended its operations and reported the incident to the authorities. Cypher said that it has been working with law enforcement agencies and cybersecurity experts to track down the hacker and recover the stolen funds.\n\nThe hackers managed to steal over $200 million worth of various cryptocurrencies from the exchange\u2019s hot wallets, as well as compromising the personal data of millions of users.\n\nThe hack was announced by Cypher on its official website and social media channels, where it apologized to its customers and assured them that it is working with law enforcement agencies and security experts to investigate the incident and recover the stolen funds. Cypher also said that it will compensate its users for any losses they may have suffered as a result of the hack, and that it has temporarily suspended all deposits, withdrawals, and trading activities on its platform.\n\nThe hack is one of the biggest and most devastating cyberattacks in the history of the crypto industry, and it has shaken the confidence of many investors and traders in the security and reliability of crypto exchanges. The hack also raises questions about the regulatory oversight and compliance of crypto exchanges, as well as the best practices for storing and managing crypto assets.\n\nHere are some tips on how to protect yourself and your crypto assets from such hacks:\n\nUse a reputable and regulated crypto exchange that follows high security standards and has insurance coverage for its users\u2019 funds.\n\nDo not store large amounts of crypto on exchange wallets, especially hot wallets that are connected to the internet. Use cold wallets or hardware wallets that are offline and more secure.\n\nEnable two-factor authentication (2FA) and use strong passwords for your exchange accounts. Do not share your login credentials or private keys with anyone.\n\nBeware of phishing emails, fake websites, and social media scams that may try to trick you into revealing your personal information or sending your crypto to malicious addresses.\n\n\u2013 Monitor your exchange accounts and crypto transactions regularly and report any suspicious or unauthorized activity to your exchange and law enforcement authorities.\n\nCypher is not the first crypto exchange to hold a token sale after a hack. In 2017, Bitfinex issued BFX tokens to compensate its users who lost their funds in a $72 million hack in 2016. The exchange later redeemed all the BFX tokens and replaced them with equity tokens called LEO.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nWhatsApp\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n"

        "title": "Ethereum Halving Date: What is Ethereum Triple Halving? Countdown - Bitcoinsensus",
        "content": "The Ethereum Triple Halving refers to a significant reduction in the rate at which new Ether (ETH), Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, is generated and consequently enters the market.\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, Ethereum does not have a halving event in its protocol. However, with upcoming Ethereum upgrades, the issuance rate of new Ether will decrease dramatically, mimicking the three consecutive Bitcoin halving events.\n\nThe Ethereum Halving Date is not a fixed date, but rather a period during which significant protocol upgrades are implemented ((most notably the transition to Ethereum 2.0 with Proof of Stake consensus).\n\nThese upgrades are crucial as they potentially influence Ether\u2019s price, the security of the network, and the overall development of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nTo trade ETH with leverage, sign-up for Bybit right now! Bybit\u2019s BIGGEST Bonus Campaign is now live! You can get up to a $30,000 Bonus when you fund your Bybit account with our Bybit link\n\nClaim up to $30,030 in Bonus 100x Leverage Start Trading\n\nThe Logic Behind Halving Events in Blockchain\n\nWhile Bitcoin\u2019s halving is a pre-set event that occurs approximately every four years, halving the block reward for miners, Ethereum\u2019s Triple Halving is a more gradual process resulting from multiple updates, including EIP-1559 and the transition to Ethereum 2.0.\n\nThese events, whether in Bitcoin or in Ethereum, are designed to reduce the rate at which new cryptocurrency enters the market. This can lead to decreased selling pressure from miners and potentially deflationary conditions, which can influence the asset\u2019s price.\n\nWhy the Triple Halving is a Major Event\n\nEconomic implications for Ethereum:\n\nA drastic reduction in Ether issuance is likely to have a profound impact on Ethereum\u2019s economic model. It could create scarcity, potentially driving up demand and the price of Ether.\n\nSupply dynamics and deflationary pressure:\n\nWith the implementation of EIP-1559, part of the Ether used in transaction fees is burnt, removing it from circulation. Combined with the reduced issuance of new Ether, this could potentially make Ether deflationary, a sharp contrast to its current inflationary model.\n\nEthereum Halving Date\n\n1) Tools and resources to track the Ethereum Halving Date\n\nWhile there is no fixed Ethereum Halving Date, investors and developers closely follow Ethereum\u2019s upgrade timelines. Websites like etherscan.io and ethresear.ch Provide detailed information on the progress of Ethereum network upgrades.\n\n2) How the countdown works\n\nAs opposed to a precise countdown, tracking the Ethereum Triple Halving involves monitoring the progress of various Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) and the rollout of Ethereum 2.0 phases.\n\nCommunity and developer discussions, as well as official announcements, provide insights into these significant changes.\n\nImpact on Ethereum\u2019s Price\n\n1) Historical analysis of price movements post-halving:\n\nWhile Ethereum doesn\u2019t have a history of halving events like Bitcoin, significant network upgrades have had varying impacts on its price.\n\nFor instance, after major upgrades, Ether\u2019s price has sometimes increased due to improved scalability and security. The \u2018Triple Halving\u2019, as a concept, might produce a similar scarcity effect, potentially driving up Ether\u2019s value.\n\n2) Speculations and expert opinions:\n\nVarious financial analysts and cryptocurrency experts speculate that reducing the issuance of new Ether could make it more scarce, which, according to basic economic principles, may drive up its price if demand remains constant or increases.\n\nHowever, the actual impact would depend on numerous factors, including overall market conditions.\n\nClaim up to $30,030 in Bonus 100x Leverage Start Trading\n\nWhat Does Triple Halving Mean for Miners?\n\n1) Changing rewards for miners\n\nThe metaphorical \u2018Triple Halving\u2019 would significantly decrease the issuance rate of new Ether, which is a substantial part of miners\u2019 rewards.\n\nMiners would increasingly rely on transaction fees as their source of income, a dynamic shift from the current block reward system.\n\n2) Adjustments and strategies for Ethereum miners\n\nAs block rewards decrease, miners may need to reevaluate their operations. Efficient energy usage will become more crucial, and some may need to transition to other more profitable blockchains or consider staking Ether if they transition to validating in Ethereum 2.0.\n\nAll You Need To Know About Ethereum 2.0 and Triple Halving\n\n1) Transition to Proof of Stake\n\nEthereum 2.0 marks the transition from the current Proof of Work consensus mechanism to Proof of Stake. This transition will dramatically reduce the energy consumption of the Ethereum network.\n\nIn a PoS system, validators replace miners in the creation of new blocks. This transition is part of the broader Ethereum upgrades that are metaphorically referred to as a \u2018Triple Halving\u2019 due to the expected reduction in Ether issuance.\n\n2) Relationship between Ethereum 2.0 and the Triple Halving event\n\nThe transition to Ethereum 2.0 is central to the concept of the \u2018Triple Halving\u2019 as it is expected to dramatically reduce the issuance of new Ether.\n\nThe upgrade to Ethereum 2.0 will improve the scalability, security, and sustainability of the network, and it plays a crucial role in the economic changes that the \u2018Triple Halving\u2019 concept highlights.\n\nHow to Prepare for Ethereum\u2019s Triple Halving\n\n1) Strategies for investors and miners\n\nFor investors, this period could present an opportunity to reconsider their portfolio allocations, potentially increasing their holdings in Ether if they believe the \u2018Triple Halving\u2019 will have a positive effect on its price.\n\nFor miners, considering a transition to staking (in anticipation of Ethereum 2.0\u2019s Proof of Stake mechanism) might be a strategy, or alternatively, evaluating other profitable blockchain networks for mining opportunities.\n\n2) Risks and rewards to consider\n\nInvestors need to consider the volatility that may come with these changes; while scarcity could drive up Ether\u2019s price, market dynamics are unpredictable.\n\nMiners face the risk of decreased revenues due to lower block rewards, but the transition to Proof of Stake in Ethereum 2.0 offers the potential reward of becoming a validator rather than a miner.\n\nFuture of Ethereum Post-Triple Halving\n\n1) Long-term implications for the Ethereum network\n\nA significant reduction in Ether issuance could lead to greater scarcity and potential deflationary pressures on the asset, influencing its value proposition.\n\nThe network\u2019s security dynamics will also change with Ethereum 2.0, shifting from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake.\n\n2) Expert predictions and possible scenarios\n\nSome experts predict that a substantial decrease in Ether issuance might lead to a price increase, similar to Bitcoin\u2019s price action after halving events.\n\nOthers caution that Ethereum\u2019s broader adoption and use case as a platform for decentralized applications may create different market dynamics.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe \u2018Triple Halving\u2019 is a metaphorical term referring to the significant reduction in new Ether issuance, akin to Bitcoin\u2019s halving events but achieved through Ethereum\u2019s network upgrades.\n\nThis shift has the potential to change Ethereum\u2019s economic model, making it more scarce and potentially impacting its price significantly.\n\nWhile there is no fixed countdown to a \u2018Triple Halving\u2019 event, the changes encapsulated by this term represent a pivotal point in Ethereum\u2019s development.\n\nThese changes will redefine the economic model of Ethereum and could have substantial implications for both investors and participants in the network.\n\nClaim up to $30,030 in Bonus 100x Leverage Start Trading\n\nHow to Trade Bitcoin (BTC)?\n\nTo understand the basics of Bitcoin trading, you can read our How To Trade Bitcoin Guide.

        "title": "Cardano Will Surpass Bitcoin and Ethereum to Become World's Biggest Crypto - Charles Hoskinson - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Charles Hoskinson, the visionary founder of Cardano, boldly predicted that ADA, the native token of the Cardano blockchain, is poised to dethrone the current cryptocurrency giants, Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nHoskinson\u2019s proclamation at the highly anticipated Rare Evo conference has sent ripples of excitement and speculation throughout the cryptocurrency community, sparking fervent discussions about the future landscape of digital assets.\n\nCardano, since its inception, has been a project rooted in innovation and dedication to forging a path toward a decentralized digital future. The platform\u2019s standout feature is its resolute commitment to on-chain governance\u2014an intricate decentralized decision-making process that actively engages the platform\u2019s community.\n\nHoskinson\u2019s assertion during his keynote speech echoed this commitment, emphasizing that Cardano aspires to become more than just a cryptocurrency. He envisions it as the bedrock of a novel digital nation, a realm where trust is revitalized, and integrity is inherent.\n\nKing Cardano?\n\nCentral to Hoskinson\u2019s visionary prediction is Cardano\u2019s distinctive commitment to on-chain governance. This novel form of decentralized decision-making empowers the community to directly participate in shaping the network\u2019s future.\n\n\u201cSo, that is our challenge, and this is why I think that Cardano is probably going to become the biggest cryptocurrency in the world,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think that it\u2019s going to become more than just a cryptocurrency. I think it\u2019s going to become the backbone of a new digital nation, a new society\u2014a place where we can finally begin to trust each other again, where we move from \u2018don\u2019t be evil\u2019 to \u2018can\u2019t be evil.'\u201d\n\nCardano (ADA) is currently trading at $0.2591. Chart: TradingView\n\nWhile Hoskinson\u2019s optimism for Cardano\u2019s future shines brightly, his keynote address did not shy away from critical evaluations of Bitcoin and Ethereum. He noted that Bitcoin\u2019s unaltered design, maintained for over 13 years since its inception, might become a vulnerability in the long run.\n\nEthereum\u2019s leadership, in contrast, dismissed the feasibility of on-chain governance. Hoskinson countered this stance by arguing that as crypto platforms evolve and encompass millions of users, adopting some form of on-chain governance could be a strategic advantage rather than a liability.\n\nDissenting Voices And Ongoing Debate\n\nWhile Hoskinson\u2019s proclamation has garnered admiration and anticipation, dissenting voices within the cryptocurrency community remain.\n\nEvan Van Ness, a prominent member of ConsenSys and an Ethereum advocate, criticized Cardano, labeling it a \u201czombie chain\u201d due to its position below Base\u2019s TVL (Total Value Locked).\n\nIt\u2019s been live for just a couple weeks, but @BuildOnBase has already flipped Cardano in TVL (even new and immature) L2\ud83d\ude80\n\nzombiechains \ud83d\udcc9 pic.twitter.com/LOe0oGxRek \u2014 Evan Van Ness \ud83e\uddc9\ud83d\udcb8 (@evan_van_ness) August 24, 2023\n\nThis critique isn\u2019t the first of its kind from Van Ness, who previously pointed out Cardano\u2019s perceived lack of transaction activity almost a year ago.\n\nWhether ADA can indeed ascend the ranks to surpass Bitcoin and Ethereum remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: the world of blockchain and digital assets is as dynamic and unpredictable as the markets they represent.\n\nFeatured image from Publish0X"

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) price exhibited selling pressure and shattered the primary cluster of $1800, signifying the beginning of a downtrend. Furthermore, ETH has shown a breakdown of the symmetrical triangle pattern, flowing near the immediate support of $1650.\n\nEthereum price action suggests buyers failed to sustain near $2000, faced rejection near the supply region, and glimpsed distribution in the last sessions. Moreover, ETH price has now descended below the 200-day EMA, indicating seller dominance on the charts.\n\nAfter the breakdown, Ethereum price dwelled in a range and made small candles, suggesting that buyers are trying to rescue the gains. Still, due to massive selling pressure, they are not thriving, resulting in consolidation. Moreover, ETH technical indicators suggest follow on selling toward the demand zone of $1100, as shown by the chart\u2019s path curve.\n\nETH price is trading near the mid trajectory, which, if it breaks, leads to a free fall toward the primary support of $1500. Buyers are trying to cover the region and attempt a recovery. However, selling pressure was witnessed on the charts with $1600 being tested multiple times this week.\n\nAt press time, ETH price was $1652 with an intraday drop of 0.60%. Moreover, the trading volume remained average at $6.60 Billion, and the pair of ETH/BTC is at 0.0633 BTC. However, the market cap of ETH is $202.39 Billion. Moreover, analysts maintained a sell rating and suggested a fall for the upcoming sessions.\n\nETH Price Floats Near Support of $1650 on Daily Charts\n\nSource: ETH Price Chart At TradingView\n\nEthereum (ETH) price was trading near the 50% Fib cluster and noted a setback from the top of $2000 in the last weeks. Moreover, the price action shows that ETH recorded a massive rally during the beginning of 2023 and endured in gaining, and sellers stayed on the back foot. However, the momentum is diverting now, and sellers again came into action, made aggressive short positions, and whipped the bulls, resulting in correction.\n\nEthereum on Short Term Charts Shows Seller Dominance\n\nSource: ETH Price Chart At TradingView\n\nEthereum price is hovering near the round mark of $1650 and shelving for an aggressive move in the following sessions. Higer up, resistances were placed near $1700 and $1750, near the 200-day EMA. On the lower side, the primary support of $1500 is there, which buyers will retest in the following sessions.\n\nThe RSI curve stayed near 50 and showed bearish divergence on the charts, suggesting an adverse price action and a down move for the following sessions.\n\nThe MACD indicator showed a bullish crossover and formed green bars on the histogram. However, price action still did not give a confirmation for buyers to make fresh long positions.\n\nSummary\n\nEthereum (ETH) price suggests a fall toward $1500, followed by $1200 in the upcoming weeks. Moreover, the price action indicates a negative outlook, and sellers persisted in making short buildup, which suggests that bears are dominating. Bulls were trapped, resulting in a continuous decline on the charts.\n\nTechnical Levels\n\nSupport Levels: $1500 and $1300\n\nResistance Levels: $1700 and $1850\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe views and opinions stated by the author, or any people named in this article, are for informational purposes only, and they do not establish financial, investment, or other advice.

        "title": "Bitcoin Spark: Harnessing the Power of Ethereum and Bitcoin to Change the Future of Finance - Blockzeit",
        "content": "Bitcoin Spark is gaining traction in the crypto world as it promises to revolutionize the future of decentralized finance by combining the strengths of Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nBitcoin price prediction\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price observed through a four-hour timeframe reveals a bearish sentiment with a pattern of \u201cThree Black Crows\u201d candlesticks. The prevailing bearish dominance is emphasized by the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicators moving into the oversold region. The immediate resistance is at $26,200. But, the presence of a bearish engulfing candlestick and a two-day candle pattern below this level suggests ongoing downward pressure. A continuation of this trend could propel Bitcoin\u2019s descent to $25,600. Conversely, surpassing the $26,200 level might pave the way for targeting resistance at $26,800, subsequently opening doors for further gains toward $27,300. Nonetheless, a breach below $25,200 could signify the potential for deeper losses.\n\nHow to mine Ethereum\n\nMining Ethereum no longer became possible since The Merge. Ethereum transitioned from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, which relies on miners, to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS), where validators are chosen to create new blocks and validate transactions based on the amount of Ethereum they hold and are willing to stake as collateral. While this transition did curb the issue of energy and speed, there are still concerns about centralization with PoS.\n\nBitcoin Spark\n\nBitcoin Spark is built on Ethereum. The project improves on the original vision of Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin\u2019s creator, introducing changes that usher in a new generation of cryptocurrency use cases. However, it does retain the favorable characteristics of Bitcoin, such as a limited supply of 21 million.\n\nBitcoin Spark will have increased block transaction capacity, reduced block time, and a significantly higher number of nodes than the Bitcoin blockchain. This ensures it has a higher transaction throughput while maintaining fast speeds and low costs.\n\nTaking from its predecessor, Ethereum, Bitcoin Spark will support smart contracts. However, it takes it a step further by having a multi-layered architecture with different contract execution systems but singular network finality. This layered model ensures scalability while promoting diversity by allowing the use of multiple programming languages, both high-level and low-level. Bitcoin Spark therefore boosts its utility, establishing itself as a blockchain with diverse applications extending a simple P2P payment system.\n\nThe Bitcoin Spark network introduces a cross between Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) known as Proof-of-Process PoP (PoP). The PoP requires miners/validators to stake and contribute processing power to the network in order to validate blocks and earn rewards. Bitcoin Spark, however, combines the PoP with a unique algorithm that reduces rewards per larger stake size and per additional power exponentially to ensure fairer distribution between larger and smaller miners. The Bitcoin Spark development team has ensured that the work and power required for mining BTCS is relatively low through the network\u2019s native application.\n\nThe Bitcoin Spark application allows users to mine by permitting access to their mining device\u2019s processing unit. The application can be installed on Windows, Linux, Android, iOS, and Mac OS devices and will work in an isolated virtual environment that doesn\u2019t interfere with operating system functions to ensure security. It will also adjust the processing power used to account for overheating, battery, and simultaneous usage requirements. However, miners will have the option of manually selecting the device resources permitted for mining use. Bitcoin Spark\u2019s innovative approach to network validation ensures true decentralization by enabling anyone to participate.\n\nNewly minted coins are the only way to incentivize validators to participate in many blockchains. However, Bitcoin Spark changes this notion. The processing power provided by miners is \u2018rented out\u2019 to organizations or individuals as remote computing power through the Bitcoin Spark network. The clients will pay with BTCS, which will be allocated to the mining pool to supplement BTCS minting rewards. Additionally, the Bitcoin Spark application and website will have small slots for community-policied advertisements, where 50% of the revenue generated will be transferred to miners and network participants. With such diverse revenue sets, Bitcoin Spark can not only survive but thrive in a Web3 world of singular use cases and closed revenue systems.\n\nThe Bitcoin Spark Initial Coin Offering (ICO) has gained significant investments so far and is currently in Phase 3, selling BTCS at $2.00, accompanied by a 12% bonus.\n\nFor more on Bitcoin Spark:\n\nWebsite: https://bitcoinspark.org/\n\nBuy BTCS: https://network.bitcoinspark.org/register"
