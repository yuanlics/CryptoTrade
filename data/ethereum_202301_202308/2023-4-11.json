        "title": "4 Things To Know About Ethereum's Shanghai Upgrade - Investopedia",
        "content": "Crypto watchers are setting their sights on Etherum this week, as the currency undergoes an upgrade that some think could have a negative impact on the price of the coin, at least in the short term.\n\nShanghai is an Ethereum upgrade that is scheduled to activate on Wednesday. Most notably, it will enable those who have previously staked their ether (ETH) on the network to make withdrawals for the first time, which some market commentators say could have negative implications for the ETH price going forward. The upgrade also includes the implementation of five different Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs).\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways Shanghai is a hard-forking upgrade to Ethereum that will complete the network's transition from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS).\n\nInvestors are worried the ability to withdraw staked ETH could have a negative impact on the price over the short term.\n\nOther technical improvements in the Shanghai upgrade are intended to improve the transactional aspects of ethereum.\n\nHere are four things to know about Ethereum's Shanghai upgrade and how it will impact the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nFinalization of the Move to Proof-of-Stake\n\nShanghai is the final step in Ethereum's move from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Proof-of-stake is considered a more energy-efficient way for verifying cryptocurrency transactions where validators are randomly selected based on the staked ETH as opposed to all validators competing to verify blocks first in proof-of-work.\n\nEthereum started as a PoW network but its PoS-based Beacon Chain, which ran along the live, PoW blockchain, was first launched in December 2020, and a merger between those two chains, known as The Merge, took place in September 2022.\n\nWhile Ethereum users have been able to stake their ETH since the launch of the Beacon Chain, they have not been able to unstake their ETH. The Shanghai update changes that in the form of EIP-4895 and finalizes this transition to PoS.\n\nInvestors Worry About Staked ETH Coming to Market\n\nThe ability to unstake ETH and their associated staking rewards earned so far has some investors worried, as it could enable many users who were previously unable to sell their staked ETH to dump their holdings on the market. Currently, roughly 15% of the total ETH supply is staked on the network.\n\nAccording to a report from CoinDesk, as much as $2.4 billion worth of selling pressure could hit the ETH market as a result of Shanghai.\n\nThat said, it should be noted that all of this staked ETH cannot be unstaked all at once. There is a limit to the amount of staking withdrawals that can take place per block, and one February estimate from Into The Block points out it would take around 60 days for 20% of validators (stakers on the network) to unstake their ETH.\n\n\n\nCrypto's Environmental Impact Debate in Focus\n\nShanghai's completion of Ethereum's transition to PoS also brings up crypto's ongoing debate about its potential environmental impact. PoW requires miners to prove their reliability to the network through the use of computer hardware, while PoS opts for an approach involving the staking of a crypto asset. For this reason, PoW uses much more energy than PoS.\n\nPoS proponents often refer to PoW as wasteful, while proponents of PoW, which is used in bitcoin and is unlikely to be removed from that crypto network, view PoS as less secure and prone to centralization.\n\n\n\nTechnical Upgrades for Ethereum Transactions\n\nOf course, the ability to unstake ETH is not the only change included in the Shanghai hard fork. For example, there is also EIP-3651, EIP-3855,, and EIP-3860, which are all intended to improve the efficiency of transactions on the Ethereum network and lower gas fees for various decentralized applications (dapps).\n\nIt should also be noted that there are a number of consensus-layer changes included in Wednesday's hard fork in the form of an upgrade known as Capella. For this reason, many Ethereum developers are referring to the combination of these two upgrades as Shapella (a combination of Shanghai and Capella)."

        "title": "The Shanghai Upgrade: Finalizing Ethereum's PoS Transition \u2013 Global X ETFs - Global X",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s transition to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) network marked the beginning of a major shift in Ethereum\u2019s infrastructure. In addition to overhauling the network\u2019s consensus mechanism and drastically reducing its energy consumption, the shift to a PoS system (\u201cThe Merge\u201d) also introduced the foundation needed to improve Ethereum\u2019s transactional capacity and scalability. These upgrades can be further explored in The Merge: Supercharging Ethereum.\n\nSince \u201cThe Merge,\u201d the network has been secured by validators who have bonded or \u201cstaked\u201d their ether (ETH) tokens to the Beacon Chain, Ethereum\u2019s consensus engine. The process of staking, however, has been a one-way street as the network has not allowed validators to withdraw their staked assets. For Ethereum to become a fully-operational PoS network and for \u201cThe Merge\u201d to be considered complete, the ability to withdraw staked assets is critical.\n\nIn this report, we will explore Ethereum\u2019s upcoming and highly-anticipated Shanghai Upgrade, a software update that will enable staking withdrawals and mark the final step of Ethereum\u2019s transition to PoS.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nSince the inception of the Beacon Chain, network participants have staked ETH to secure Ethereum network activity in exchange for ETH-denominated rewards. To date, the Beacon Chain has not allowed for the withdrawal of staked ETH or their associated rewards.\n\nThe Shanghai Upgrade, scheduled for April 2023, is expected to unlock the withdrawal of staked ETH from the Beacon Chain.\n\nRemoving the restrictions on staking withdrawals fundamentally changes the risk and liquidity considerations associated with staking. This change is expected to make Ethereum a more complete PoS network, and its native asset ETH a more capital-efficient vehicle.\n\nStaked ETH Is the Foundation of Ethereum\u2019s Security\n\nScheduled for April 2023, the Shanghai Upgrade includes various changes to Ethereum\u2019s code base, referred to as Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs). Among the changes being implemented in the upgrade, EIP-4895 is the most important as it allows for the withdrawal of staked ETH from the Beacon Chain.\n\nThe Beacon Chain is Ethereum\u2019s PoS consensus engine first launched in December 2020. The Beacon Chain is responsible for coordinating how the network\u2019s nodes come to an agreement about the state of the blockchain. In other words, it ensures that all nodes have a consistent copy of the blockchain\u2019s ledger and that all transactions are valid and secure.\n\nPrior to Ethereum\u2019s transition to PoS, the Beacon Chain operated in parallel to the Ethereum blockchain and served as a sandbox for developers to test the PoS code. During the event referred to as \u201cThe Merge,\u201d the legacy Ethereum blockchain merged with the Beacon Chain, effectively switching Ethereum from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a PoS network.\n\nSince the Beacon Chain\u2019s inception, network validators have been bonding or \u201cstaking\u201d ETH for the right to validate network activity. To date, about 18 million ETH, or around 15% of the circulating supply of ETH has been staked to the Beacon Chain, representing roughly $32.9 billion of economic security.1 In exchange for these services, validators have been earning ETH-denominated rewards issued by the network, worth approximately $2.3 billion as of the current price of ETH.2\n\nIn exchange for these rewards, staking participants have been required to lock their ETH to the Beacon Chain staking contract indefinitely. The inability to unstake ETH following \u201cThe Merge\u201d was an intentional choice made by Ethereum core developers as it ensured the new PoS consensus engine worked flawlessly in its initial stages. Unsurprisingly, the illiquidity associated with staking has sidelined many prospective stakers. With months of Ethereum operating under a PoS consensus mechanism, however, developers are now confident that the necessary conditions have been met to safely implement withdrawals from the Beacon Chain.\n\nThe Shanghai Upgrade Is Expected to Benefit Liquidity and Network Security Over the Long Run\n\nRemoving restrictions on staking withdrawals is expected to fundamentally change the risks associated with staking ETH to the Beacon Chain. Primarily, the Shanghai Upgrade removes the execution risk surrounding the software upgrade. Albeit small, the risk of unforeseen issues arising during software updates can be a concern for participants. Given that capital investment is a prerequisite for staking, execution risk can be enough to convince prospective stakers to remain on the sidelines. In addition, the implementation of staking withdrawals is expected to improve the liquidity profile of staked ETH, thereby reducing liquidity risk. In an asset class known for its volatility, the ability to efficiently enter and exit investment positions is paramount.\n\nThe seamless staking and unstaking of ETH from the Beacon Chain also holds implications for the capital efficiency of the Ethereum network and its native asset. ETH is an asset with a high degree of utility. It must be spent during the execution of any transaction on the Ethereum network, is a widely-accepted and high-quality form of collateral, and is used as a medium of exchange. With the implementation of staking withdrawals, staking and unstaking ETH will become a more efficient process, further expanding ETH\u2019s utility by providing users with a means of accessing a fairly liquid and passive income stream. In practice, this use case will be akin to depositing excess cash into a short-term money market fund until a more compelling need for the cash arises.\n\nThe Shanghai Upgrade is also likely to have positive downstream effects on the security of the Ethereum network. PoS networks such as Ethereum rely on the value of staked assets to protect the network from attacks. So long as no malicious actor controls a majority of the capital staked to the network, the network is able to resist any attempts to manipulate current or historical transactions. This relationship means that PoS networks can improve their economic security via a few avenues: price appreciation of staked tokens, an increase in the number of tokens staked to the network, or a combination of the two. As the implementation of staking withdrawals represents a relative reduction in the risks associated with staking, it is possible that the amount of ETH staked to the Beacon Chain may grow as previously sidelined participants are incentivized to capture staking rewards. Should this occur, Ethereum\u2019s economic security should become more robust all else equal.\n\nAfter the implementation of the Shanghai Upgrade, validators will have the ability to automatically withdraw accrued staking rewards. Those validators seeking to fully exit network staking will have to follow a gradual and dynamic release process intended to moderate the flow into and out of the staking contract in order to protect network security.\n\nOn the surface, the changes that the Shanghai Upgrade will bring to Ethereum are simple. This software update, however, will effectively complete Ethereum\u2019s transition to PoS and bring the network one step closer to realizing its long-term vision."

        "title": "Ethereum Shanghai upgrade unlocks US$34 billion in Ether, what does it mean for crypto prices? - Forkast News",
        "content": "Developers at Ethereum, the world\u2019s second-biggest blockchain with a capitalization of US$231 billion, are set to upgrade the software network on Wednesday with reported new features and improvements to efficiency, cost and security.\n\nHowever, the main feature of the so-called Shanghai upgrade \u2013 to take place at 10:27 p.m. UTC on Wednesday, according to the Ethereum Foundation \u2013 is the EIP-4895. This allows users to withdraw their staked Ether, or tokens deposited to support the operations of a blockchain in return for a passive income, usually in the form of more tokens.\n\nWith around 18 million Ether (US$34.5 billion) \u2013 or about 15% of the total supply \u2013 staked into the network, according to Etherscan, concerns emerged that holders could rush to sell Ether to lock in profits, which would drive prices lower. Ether has risen about 60% so far this year and recently traded at more than US$1,900.\n\nBut on-chain data provider CryptoQuant doesn\u2019t expect a flood of Ether sales, according to a report it released in February.\n\n\u201cWe argue that there would be low selling pressure for Ether from staking withdrawals after the Shanghai upgrade,\u201d CryptoQuant said, adding that the majority of the staked Ether was still holding losses compared to Ether prices when it was staked. Ether reached all time highs of more than US$4,600 in November 2021.\n\n\u201cTypically, selling pressure emerges when market participants are sitting on extreme profits, which is not the case right now for the Ether that has been staked,\u201d CryptoQuant said.\n\nCryptoQuant also pointed out that the currently locked Ether cannot be withdrawn simultaneously, estimating it may take up to a year to withdraw the total value staked in the network,\n\nOther benefits\n\nZhuling Chen, chief executive officer of crypto staking service provider RockX, said some short-term market volatility is to be expected following the upgrade, but he preferred to focus on the \u201csubstantial\u201d long-term benefits to the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n\u201cEthereum\u2019s capacity to handle more transactions per second increases, transaction costs decrease, and the security and efficiency of smart contracts improve,\u201d Chen said in a statement. The staking landscape will be transformed and Ethereum will become the benchmark yield for crypto, Chen added.\n\nThat\u2019s a view shared by Alex Esin, chief executive officer of P2P.org, which offers institutional staking and blockchain development services. Expect a substantial increase in staking activity in the year following the Shanghai upgrade, Esin said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe do not anticipate a massive unstaking once this functionality goes live,\u201d Esin said.\n\nGuilhem Chaumont, chief executive officer of crypto-financial service Flowdesk, points out the system to withdraw staked Ether could itself prevent a sell off in the token.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to realize that the withdrawal queue only allows a limited set of requests per day (115,200), so while there may be sustained downward pressure on the price, unstaking is not likely to cause a sharp, sudden dip,\u201d he said in an emailed comment.\n\nChaumont said it\u2019s more likely a sizable portion of Ether will remain staked \u201cwith staking rewards outperforming current interest rates.\u201d\n\nOverreact?\n\nKen Timsit, head of Cronos Labs, the accelerator of the Cronos chain that links the Ethereum and Cosmos blockchains, did caution that Ether stakers will monitor withdrawals after the Shanghai upgrade kicks in and may potentially overreact if there is significant withdrawal demand.\n\n\u201cOnce short-term volatility has been smoothed out, however, it is likely that the outcome will be neutral given that this upgrade has been priced into Ether value for some time,\u201d Timsit said in an emailed comment.\n\nDanny Chong, co-founder of Tranchess, a decentralized app that offers Ethereum services, said the Shanghai upgrade will lower the risks associated with liquid staking and \u201cshould see increased institutional participation.\u201d\n\nLiquid staking, also known as soft staking, allows investors to access their locked funds for other crypto-based activities while still earning rewards. Users with deposits locked on liquid staking platforms receive a tokenized version of their crypto assets, which then can be stored or traded elsewhere.\n\nThe total value of crypto assets locked in liquid staking services stood at US$17.3 billion on Tuesday, up from US$14 billion on March 1, making liquid staking the second-largest service in decentralized finance, following decentralized exchanges, according to data provider DefiLlama.\n\n\u201cEarning yield from liquid staking shares similarities with certain traditional financial instruments such as bonds or stocks that offer interest payments,\u201d Chong said. \u201cHence it would likely attract TradFi [traditional finance] participants who are familiar with such instruments.\u201d\n\nChen of RockX shared similar views: \u201cWe will see more innovations coming from direct and liquid staking solutions, and liquid staking will start playing a much larger role in the cryptocurrency space.\u201d\n\nSome cryptocurrency exchanges have also spotted opportunities to expand their staking products. For example, Singapore-based crypto exchange Bybit last month launched a new staking pool in time for the Shanghai upgrade.\n\n\u201cThe highly liquid and trading-integrated ETH staking options we will be rolling out around the time of Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade will open up many new opportunities for our users,\u201d Ben Zhou, chief executive officer of Bybit, said in a March statement.\n\nSee related article: What impact will Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade have on ETH and crypto markets?"

Hardhat \u2013 Hardhat provides a suite of Ethereum development environment tools to develop and test Solidity smart contracts. In this post, we use Hardhat to deploy our smart contracts and write tests for them.\n\nEthereum developer tools interact with the blockchain through your node through its JSON-RPC API, which serves as an interface for common blockchain interactions. There are two methodologies for access to your Ethereum node\u2019s JSON RPC API when using Managed Blockchain: Signature Version 4 (SigV4) and Token-based Access (TBA).\n\nSigV4 is a hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) mechanism that is used to authenticate AWS SDK calls. It provides several security guarantees, including request expiration timestamping at signing time, payload signature per request, and more.\n\nAlthough SigV4 has been the main way to authorize requests, it poses interoperability challenges with established community tools (such as Ethers.js, Hardhat, Foundry, and so on) that rely on a direct connection to an Ethereum RPC endpoint and aren\u2019t designed to create and append an AWS SigV4 signature to requests. As a result, customers have relied on middleware or custom proxies that were capable of signing mid-flight requests from applications using Ethereum developer tools to nodes hosted on Managed Blockchain.\n\nToken-based access, a new access method for Ethereum nodes on Managed Blockchain, presents a solution to this interoperability problem by allowing you to optionally use a token (accessor) to access your node rather than a SigV4 signature. Accessors can now be provided as part of the request object when communicating with the JSON RPC API for your Ethereum nodes. For a quick-start guide on how to create and use accessors to access these Ethereum JSON RPC API methods, refer to Introducing token-based access to Ethereum node APIs on Amazon Managed Blockchain.\n\nThe following figure illustrates the solution architecture.\n\nThe following sections outline how to configure, deploy, and test your cloud-based Ethereum development environment on the public Ethereum Goerli testnet. This guide utilizes the AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) to provide a templated deployment that automates much of the process of deploying the environment in a repeatable manner.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nTo follow the steps in this post, you need to install a few dependencies and prepare your local environment to use AWS CDK and deploy resources in your AWS account. Complete the following steps:\n\nInstall the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI).\n\nThe AWS CLI allows you to interact with AWS services from a terminal session. Make sure you have the latest version of the AWS CLI installed on your system, which you can install using the following methods: Windows \u2013 MSI installer (64-bit)\n\nLinux, macOS, or Unix \u2013 Bundled installer To use the AWS CLI to interact with AWS services, you must configure it with your AWS credentials and default region. In a terminal session, run the command aws configure, then follow the prompts to add your AWS access key ID, secret access key, and default Region. Leave the prompt for the default output format blank. To run the CDK application, you need to install Node.js with a version >=8.12.0. It is recommended that you use Node Version Manager (NVM) because it makes it easy to change your Node.js version on the fly for testing purposes. For instructions, refer to Installing and Updating. To access the EC2 instance that you create as your development environment, you need to create an EC2 key pair that you can use for SSH access to the instance: On the Amazon EC2 console, in the navigation pane, under Network & Security, choose Key Pairs.\n\nChoose Create key pair.\n\nFor Name, enter a descriptive name for the key pair.\n\nAmazon EC2 associates the public key with the name that you specify as the key name. A key name can include up to 255 ASCII characters. It can\u2019t include leading or trailing spaces.\n\nFor Key pair type, choose either RSA or ED25519. For Private key file format, choose the format in which to save the private key. To save the private key in a format that can be used with OpenSSH, select pem. To save the private key in a format that can be used with PuTTY, select ppk. To add a tag to the public key, choose Add tag, and enter the key and value for the tag. Repeat for each tag. Choose Create key pair.\n\nThe private key file is automatically downloaded by your browser. The base file name is the name that you specified as the name of your key pair, and the file name extension is determined by the file format that you chose.\n\nSave the private key file in a safe place. If you will use an SSH client on a macOS or Linux computer to connect to your Linux instance, use the following command to set the permissions of your private key file so that only you can read it:\n\nchmod 400 <key-pair-name>.pem\n\nInstall the AWS SDK\n\nTo deploy the AWS services that will be used for your Ethereum development environment, such as a node on Managed Blockchain and an EC2 instance, you use the AWS CDK. The AWS CDK accelerates cloud development using common programming languages to model your applications, translating code into AWS CloudFormation templates to repeatably deploy your applications and architectures in AWS. In this example, you write an AWS CDK application in Typescript, an extension of JavaScript using a Node.js runtime. Therefore, you need to install the AWS CDK Toolkit for Node.js using Node Package Manager (NPM).\n\nTo install the AWS CDK Toolkit, a command-line utility that allows you to work with AWS CDK apps, open a terminal session and run the following command:\n\nnpm install -g aws-cdk\n\nNote that on Windows, you\u2019ll need to run this as an administrator. On POSIX/UNIX systems, you may need to run this with sudo.\n\nYou can check the toolkit version by running the command:\n\ncdk --version\n\nDownload and run the AWS CDK application\n\nNext, you download the repository that contains the AWS CDK application for the Ethereum development environment deployment.\n\nFirst, run the git command to retrieve the repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/automated-goerli-development-environment Change directories to automated-goerli-development-environment/ to configure your AWS CDK application: cd automated-goerli-development-environment Configure the application for deployment in your preferred IDE (for example, VSCode) or using a command line editor like Vim. For example, to use Vim to edit your config file, run the following commands from the main project directory: cp ./configs/config_template.json ./configs/config.json vim ./configs/config.json In the Vim editor, choose i to enter Insert mode, which you use to modify a few key properties: { \"stackName\": \"BlogGoerliStack\", \"ec2Name\": \"AMB_Dev\", \"nickName\": \"AMB_Dev\", \"ec2Class\": \"t3\", \"ec2Size\": \"xlarge\", \"keyName\": \" <YOUR KEY NAME HERE> \", \"keyFile\": \" <./Key/YOURKEY.pem> \", \"userDataFile\": \"./Scripts/startup_user.sh\", \"cdkOut\": \"cdk-outputs.json\", \"timeBomb\": \"30\", \"awsConfig\": \"~/.aws\", \"clientIpAddr\": \" <Please add the CIDR IP address of client connecting to EC2> \", \"Mnemonic\": \" <your test 12 word seed phrase> \u201c **SEE IMPORTANT WARNING BELOW }\n\nReplace the keyName and keyFile properties with the name and path to your saved EC2 key file, respectively. Replace the placeholder for clientIpAddr with your IP address, which will restrict access to your development environment instance to only your IP address. You should also create a burner Ethereum wallet that you\u2019ll use to test with, which you import into this development environment using a mnemonic seed phrase (12 words) for a test wallet that doesn\u2019t have mainnet funds.\n\n***Note that you should not import an Ethereum wallet mnemomic seed phrase with funds or any wallet that you use on mainnet, because you risk losing your assets.\n\nAfter you have made your updates to the configuration file, save your changes in Vim by entering :wq and choosing Enter or Return on your keyboard.\n\nThis will write-quit, saving changes you made in Vim. Now you\u2019re ready to deploy your AWS CDK application and create your environment.\n\nTo deploy the application, run the following commands from your project directory: npm install cdk bootstrap cdk deploy\n\nThe initial deployment will take about 3 minutes to complete, but due to sync times for the public Ethereum testnet, the Ethereum node on Managed Blockchain will not be usable for approximately 35 minutes while the blockchain data is synced. When the deployment is complete, an EC2 instance with the tools required to develop, test, compile, and deploy smart contracts on Ethereum will be available to you. This includes the creation of resources required to access the Ethereum node as well, including the VPC, accessor token, and necessary security policies.\n\nUse your Ethereum development environment using SSH\n\nAfter your AWS CDK application is deployed and your Ethereum node on Managed Blockchain is synced, in a new terminal tab, run the following command to connect to your EC2 instance via SSH:\n\nssh -i ./Key/YOURKEYNAME.pem ec2-user@INSTANCE_IP_ADDRESS\n\nYou can find the value of the variable INSTANCE_IP_ADDRESS in the output of the cdk deploy command run in the previous steps.\n\nWhen you\u2019re connected to the EC2 instance, you can find boilerplate Solidity code for a simple smart contract along with node.js code to connect to the blockchain, compile the smart contract, deploy the smart contract, and run methods on the smart contract via blockchain transactions. Furthermore, the industry-standard developer tooling for Ethereum, Hardhat, is pre-installed with a sample script for testing the smart contract.\n\nThe following directory structure is created:\n\ndecentralized-app-for-goerli-nodejs/ \u251c\u2500 artifacts/ \u251c\u2500 cache/ \u251c\u2500 contracts/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500 CountPerAccount.sol \u251c\u2500 DemoApps/ \u251c\u2500 test/\n\nThe directories are described as follows:\n\ndecentralized-app-for-goerli-nodejs \u2013 Parent directory\n\n\u2013 Parent directory artifacts \u2013 Directory used by compiler\n\n\u2013 Directory used by compiler cache \u2013 Directory used by compiler\n\n\u2013 Directory used by compiler contracts \u2013 Solidity code for the smart contract CountPerAccount.sol \u2013 a sample smart contract\n\n\u2013 Solidity code for the smart contract DemoApps \u2013 node.js code for blockchain and smart contract access\n\n\u2013 node.js code for blockchain and smart contract access test \u2013 Directory containing scripts to run some sample tests on the smart contract using Hardhat\n\nRun the following command to run the static tests on the smart contract using Hardhat before deploying:\n\ncd decentralized-app-for-goerli-nodejs npx hardhat test\n\nIf you desire, you can use other Hardhat tools and commands in this directory.\n\nTo connect to the blockchain to deploy the smart contract, you will run the node.js application code in DemoApps . First, you will connect to the Ethereum Goerli testnet via your Managed Blockchain Ethereum node and the app will get the balances of several accounts derived from your mnemonic seed phrase that was imported in earlier steps. Then, it will perform a transaction to transfer the native cryptocurrency with which to pay fees, gEth (Goerli Ether), from one account to another.\n\ncd DemoApps node demoBlockChainAccess\n\nNext, you call the node.js application method to compile and deploy the smart contract:\n\nnode demoContract\n\nOnce deployed to the blockchain, the address of the deployed smart contract is automatically saved to the environment for smart contract access. The demoContractAccess method uses this smart contract address to run a transaction to call a method on the smart contract and return the results:\n\nnode demoContractAccess\n\nThe above method is to access the smart contract. In this method, the transactions are signed and sent to the blockchain through your Amazon Managed Blockchain Ethereum testnet node, and the result is printed to the terminal.\n\nYou have now set up your Ethereum development environment on AWS and compiled, deployed, and tested a smart contract. You\u2019re ready to build your own Ethereum application on top of this boilerplate example. Alternatively, you may also use an IDE like Visual Studio Code to connect to your EC2 instance.\n\nOPTIONAL: Connect to your development environment via VS Code\n\nOptionally, you can connect via VS Code:\n\nGo to the Visual Studio downloads website and download the VS Code for your appropriate environment. For detailed instructions, refer to the following based on your OS: macOS \u2013 Visual Studio Code on macOS\n\nWindows \u2013 Visual Studio Code on Windows Install the Remote Development Extension for Visual Studio Code. To configure the SSH config file, go to VS Code Command Palette by choosing Shift+Command+P (macOS) or Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows). Enter remote and choose Remote-SSH: Open SSH Configuration File 4.\n\nVS Code will present few locations for the configuration file.\n\nChoose the file in your /Users (macOS) or C:\\Users (Windows) folder. Enter the following in the SSH config file: Host AMB_DEV_ENV HostName _INSTANCE_IP_ADDRESS User ec2-user IdentityFile [location where the pem file you downloaded] (whole path like: \"/users/\u2026/Key/YOURKEY.pem\" After the SSH configuration is saved, connect to EC2 instance by choosing the green icon at the bottom of the VS Code page. Choose Connect to Host and choose AMB_DEV_ENV on the drop-down menu.\n\nOnce connected to the EC2 instance, you may use the same steps as you followed in \u201cUse Your Ethereum development environment via SSH\u201d from the terminal within VS Code.\n\nCleanup\n\nTo remove the AWS resources you created during the preceding steps, run the following AWS CDK command:\n\ncdk destroy\n\nThis command may take a few minutes to complete. Remember to back up any code updates or files you may have created in your environment before running this command, if desired.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this post, we showed you how to deploy a cloud-based IDE with which to build, test, and deploy smart contracts on the public Ethereum Goerli testnet via a dedicated Ethereum full node managed using Managed Blockchain. With this cloud-based development environment, developers can more easily build and test Ethereum smart contracts without having to manage an Ethereum node or manually configure an environment on their local machine.\n\nTo learn more about Token-Based Access, a new interoperability feature for Ethereum nodes on Amazon Managed Blockchain, read Introducing token-based access to Ethereum node APIs on Amazon Managed Blockchain.\n\nAbout the authors\n\nForrest Colyer is a blockchain specialist Solutions Architect at AWS.

        "content": "\n\nThings to know:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2013 Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade is live, allowing validators to withdraw their staked ETH.\n\n\n\n\u2013 Retrieving your staked ETH through Ledger Live with Lido or Kiln apps is not immediate. You will be able to unstake them around May 2023.\n\n\n\n\u2013 For Ledger Enterprise clients, the Shanghai upgrade will provide new incentives for institutions and corporates to stake their Ethereum assets as they will be able to unlock and withdraw their rewards, which significantly de-risk them as an investment.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Merge, a successful software upgrade that took place in September 2022, shifted the Ethereum protocol from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake blockchain. This upgrade was the initial phase of the five stages of Ethereum\u2019s development, as outlined by Vitalik Buterin, including \u201cThe Merge,\u201d \u201cThe Surge,\u201d \u201cThe Verge,\u201d \u201cThe Purge,\u201d and \u201cThe Splurge.\u201d\n\nIf you want to explore Ethereum\u2019s scaling roadmap, read this article where Charles Guillemet, CTO of Ledger, provides critical insights into the future of Ethereum.\n\nWhat Is The Shanghai Upgrade?\n\nEthereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade is a hard fork. This software upgrade implements EIP-4895, allowing validators to withdraw their staked ETH. So far, the staked coins remain blocked on the protocol, meaning users couldn\u2019t retrieve their rewards.\n\nAs the upgrade is now live, validators can:\n\nUnlock and withdraw their staking rewards.\n\nUnstake ETH and gain access to their entire balance.\n\nEarn rewards that will be distributed automatically.\n\nRe-stake to sign back up and start earning more rewards.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade also includes three other improvement proposals that tackle high gas fees, slow transaction processing time, and the overall performance of the network.\n\nFor Charles Guillemet, CTO at Ledger, \u201cThe Shanghai upgrade marks the completion of the blockchain migration to Proof of Stake, as well as a significant milestone in the evolution of Ethereum. This upgrade will bring more liquidity to the market and encourage those who were previously hesitant to stake their ETH due to uncertainties around locking time. It also highlights the Ethereum community\u2019s remarkable ability to update its protocol seamlessly.\u201d\n\nRead our Ledger Academy article to learn more about the implications of this significant upgrade.\n\nShanghai Upgrade: what does it mean for Ledger Live users?\n\nStaking with Lido through Ledger Live:\n\nWhile the upgrade is live, Ledger Live Lido users will only be able to withdraw their staked ETH from their Ledger Live app around May 2023. stETH holders will be able to unstake their stETH and in return receive ETH at a 1:1 ratio.\n\nWithdrawals will be handled through the following Request and Claim process:\n\nRequest: A user locks stETH as a withdrawal request.\n\nFulfillment: The protocol sources ETH to fulfill the withdrawal request, locks the ETH, burns the locked stETH, and marks the withdrawal request as claimable.\n\nClaim: The user claims their ETH.\n\nStaking with Kiln through Ledger Live:\n\nJust like with Lido users, Kiln users on Ledger Live will also be able to withdraw their staked ETH around May 2023 by following these simple steps:\n\nUnlock and connect their Ledger device to the Ledger Live app. Navigate to the Discover section. Select Kiln. Go to the Rewards tab and select the validator(s). Click Unstake. Review and verify the transaction using their Ledger device.\n\nOnce the validator goes through the exit and withdrawal queues, you can return to the Rewards tab, click the Withdraw button and claim your ETH.\n\nShanghai Upgrade: what does it mean for Ledger Enterprise clients?\n\nFor Ledger Enterprise clients, the Shanghai upgrade will provide new incentives for institutions and corporates to stake their Ethereum assets as they will be able to unlock and withdraw their rewards which significantly de-risk them as an investment. Unlocking rewards can also open new financial opportunities with the possibility to compound rewards though pool staking.\n\nFor Alex Zinder, Head of Ledger Enterprise, \u201cwith the coming clarity on the timing of the update, there is no better time than now to add ETH staking to your institutional yield strategy. Ledger is seeing great demand for ETH staking from its retail users, so, if you want to bring secure and compliant ETH staking to your retail audience, contact Ledger Enterprise.\u201d\n\nBy staking your digital assets with Ledger Enterprise, you can access a seamless, secure, all-in-one digital asset management platform, a fully customizable governance framework, real digital ownership, and 100% auditable and regulatory-friendly reporting.\n\nLearn more about how to stake with Ledger Enterprise here."

        "content": "The Shapella hard fork has officially been executed on the Ethereum mainnet \u2014 meaning that Ethereum validators can finally withdraw their staked Ether (ETH) from the Beacon Chain.\n\nThe long-awaited upgrade took effect at 10:27 pm UTC on April 12 at epoch number 194,048.\n\nWithin the first hour of the hard fork, a total of 12,859 Ether were unlocked in 4,333 withdrawals, according to Ethereum block explorer beaconchai.in.\n\nThe number of withdrawals, Ether processed and the number of withdrawal validators. Source: beaconcha.in\n\nCurrently, around 44% of validators, or 248,043 of the total active 559,549, can request a partial or full withdrawal.\n\nThe majority of withdrawals at this time range between 2.8 to 3.2 ETH, which suggests that it\u2019s mostly staking rewards that are being withdrawn at this time.\n\nThe Ethereum Shapella upgrade has been activated and withdrawals are processing! pic.twitter.com/Krly5GB2K7 \u2014 eric.eth (@econoar) April 12, 2023\n\nThe withdrawals come as only 3,996 validators signed up to the exit queue moments before the Shapella hard fork took effect, according to data from Rated Network Explorer.\n\nOf the total amount of withdrawable Ether, crypto exchange Huobi holds the largest share at 30%, followed by the decentralized autonomous organization PieDAO at 17.7%, according to data from blockchain analytics firm Nansen.\n\nTotal number of withdrawable Ether by entity.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum is expected to complete its highly anticipated Shanghai upgrade just minutes from now.\n\nThat means the network behind the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency will finally allow users to withdraw the ETH that has been locked up over the past two years.\n\nBut what does that mean for institutional investors? Will they be more attracted to the asset? Will big money be more attracted to the new, improved blockchain?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA bit of background first: Ethereum used to run on a proof-of-work blockchain\u2014just like Bitcoin. This energy-intensive consensus mechanism uses miners to solve complex equations with massive computers, all to generate new blocks and earn digital currency rewards.\n\nBut Ethereum last year moved to a proof-of-stake blockchain, which eliminated the need for miners and instead replaced them with validators: people who pledge Ethereum (Ether\u2014or ETH) to keep the network running.\n\nThe latest network upgrade will allow those validators to withdraw the ETH they\u2019ve staked to the network\u2014currently over $34.7 billion in cryptocurrency. Before the upgrade, those who\u2019d pledged ETH to the network could not take it out.\n\nThe upgrade means that there will now be more liquidity with investments, and this is attractive to large, conservative investors, according to Diogo M\u00f3nica, the co-founder of digital asset trust bank Anchorage Digital.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nM\u00f3nica told Decrypt that the lack of liquidity previously scared funds away from Ethereum. But with this upgrade, institutions which previously didn\u2019t stake cryptocurrency (and instead just bought ETH and sat on it) would now be interested in pledging ETH.\n\n\u201cI expect a flip to happen: the large majority of them [institutions] will stake and very few of them are going to have unstaked Ethereum,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the move will also attract big funds focused on having an ESG (environmental, social and governance) investment strategy: Ethereum is now far-more energy efficient\u201499.95% more, according to the Ethereum Foundation\u2014and therefore a greener digital asset.\n\nLachlan Feeney, founder and CEO of Australian blockchain consultancy Labrys, echoed M\u00f3nica\u2019s comments, and told Decrypt that he \u201cexpects more, not less, ETH to be staked\u201d in the long-term by institutions.\n\nThe upgrade \u201cshould alleviate risk for investors because their assets aren\u2019t locked, as they were prior to the upgrade,\u201d said Feeney.\n\n\u201cPreviously, institutional investors would likely have been reluctant to lock their assets without the option to withdraw,\u201d he said. \u201cNow that such an option exists, it de-risks their investment, removing the deterrent that previously existed.\u201d\n\nMarc Arjoon, a research associate at investment firm CoinShares, told Decrypt that hedge funds will be more attracted to Ethereum because they will be able to delta neutral hedge ETH\u2014an investment strategy that aims to reduce risk associated with price movements in the underlying asset.\n\nThis is because hedge funds that are shorting the price of Ethereum (betting on its future price to go down) will have some protection because they will be earning rewards on the staked crypto anyway, he explained.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf Ethereum\u2019s upgrade goes according to plan tonight, many are betting that the cryptocurrency will attract more mainstream, traditional investors, which could prove bullish for the price of the asset long term. Since the start of the year, ETH is up 60%, currently trading for around $1,916."

        "title": "Ethereum's Shapella upgrade to unlock $34bn in staked ETH - DLNews",
        "content": "In a development that may trigger a wave of selling, Ethereum\u2019s long-awaited Shapella upgrade is poised to commence today at around 22:00 UTC.\n\nThe big news: Users will be able to unlock Ether deposited into the blockchain\u2019s staking contract for the first time since December 2020.\n\nShapella will let stakers withdraw 18.2 million of previously locked Ether, currently worth over $34.1 billion. Many of the Ethereum faithful maintain the event could drive increased activity across the blockchain.\n\nSelloff fears\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nYet the release has raised fears of a decline in the price of the second most valuable cryptocurrency if the stakers cash in their unlocked Ether.\n\nEthereum staking is essential in validating transactions and maintaining the decentralisation of the world\u2019s top smart contract blockchain. Anyone with 32 Ether can spin up a validator on their computer, stake their coins, and receive a yield for helping process transactions.\n\nDepending on network conditions, stakers stand to earn between 4 to 6% annually, paid automatically by the network in Ether.\n\nNOW READ: Arbitrum reels from voting drama as concerns over decentralisation loom large\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nBefore Shapella, many potential stakers worried that they may never be able to withdraw their Ether after staking it. Others cited delays to the staking withdrawal upgrade or unexpected bugs in the upgrade\u2019s code as additional risks.\n\nBut as long as the Shapella upgrade is successful, these concerns should be alleviated.\n\n\u201cThe main benefit of the [Shapella] upgrade is the reduction of risk associated with staking,\u201d Valerie Tetu, the head of go-to-market strategy at liquid staking provider Lido Finance, told DL News.\n\n\u2018The main benefit of the upgrade is the reduction of risk associated with staking.\u2019 \u2014 Valerie Tetu\n\nAccording to Tetu, the upgrade will support the growth of staking activity, and motivate more staking tools and services to emerge and compete.\n\nLido is currently the biggest Ethereum liquid staking provider, with $11.52 billion worth of Ether staked through the protocol. It is also the top DeFi protocol, according to DeFiLlama data.\n\nTotal assets staked through Lido\n\nDaniel Dizon, founder of the liquid staking protocol Swell, said Ether staking will benefit from an \u201cimproved risk-reward profile\u201d once withdrawals are active. He said that the upgrade will result in \u201chigher staking rate participation, further bolstering the economic security of Ethereum.\u201d\n\nOne-way trip\n\nEthereum staking was, until now, a one-way trip. Users could deposit Ether into the blockchain\u2019s staking contract to earn yield, but could not realise any of their gains, or withdraw their initial stake.\n\nDizon said he expects liquid staking derivatives \u2014 tradable tokens which represent staked Ether \u2014 to rise in use following Shapella. He said liquid staking tokens have become popular among DeFi users because they let holders earn a yield on their Ether through staking and use it across other DeFi protocols.\n\nNOW READ: Recovering scammed assets should be easier with blockchain data but it\u2019s not\n\nNow that early depositors can queue their staked Ether for withdrawal, many in the Ethereum community worry about a surge in profit taking. That\u2019s because since staking went live in December 2020, the price of Ether has almost quadrupled.\n\n\u201cIt is difficult to ignore the possibility of added selling pressure around and after the upgrade based on the unlock mechanism,\u201d Josh Olszewicz, head of research at crypto asset management firm Valkyrie Investments, told DL News.\n\nOlszewicz said his \u201cneutral to bullish scenario\u201d is that most stakers will submit partial withdrawals for the yield they have generated, while leaving the majority of their Ether staked.\n\nStaking pools\n\nHowever, Olszewicz also said the greatest selling pressures may come from defunct crypto lenders or exchanges who have assets that need to be sold in order to recoup funds for creditors or interested parties.\n\nSpecifically, the Securities and Exchange Commission ordered centralised exchange Kraken to shut down its staking activities for US retail customers in February. Kraken currently accounts for 6.8% of all staked Ether, a large portion of which it will likely need to unstake and return to US customers.\n\nNOW READ: Litigator who challenged Operation Choke Point rallies crypto to fight \u2018illegal\u2019 regulatory crackdown\n\nShapella, which blends changes to Ethereum\u2019s execution layer (Shanghai) and consensus layer (Capella), is what industry insiders call a \u201chard fork\u201d \u2014 a radical change to a blockchain that requires all users to upgrade to the latest version.\n\nThe upgrade is the most substantial change to Ethereum since The Merge last September, which transitioned the blockchain from the energy-intensive Proof of Work validation system to the greener Proof of Stake approach.\n\nIn addition to enabling staking withdrawals, Shapella also introduces five EIPs (Ethereum Improvement Proposals) which make changes and improvements to the code used to create programs on the blockchain, and an update to the network\u2019s engine API."

        "title": "What Is The Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade? - Brave New Coin Insights",
        "content": "What Is The Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade?\n\nEthereum is the 2nd largest digital asset and the largest platform blockchain in the world. It is set to undergo its first major network upgrade since the \u2018Merge\u2019 in 2022. So what is the Shanghai Upgrade and what does it mean for the ETH price?\n\nThe latest Ethereum fork date has been confirmed for April 12th, 2023. Called the Shanghai upgrade it is the first major Ethereum upgrade since the Merge in September 2022.\n\nThe Ethereum foundation stated that the Merge was \u2018the most significant upgrade in the history of Ethereum.\u2019 The Merge witnessed the joining together or \u2018merging\u2019 of the execution layer with a consensus layer called the Beacon chain that had been running separately until then. The Beacon chain uses a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus model that replaced the Proof-of-Work (PoW) model that the mainnet previously used.\n\nWhat Is The Shanghai Upgrade?\n\nThe ETH Shanghai upgrade via Ethereum Improvement Proposal-4895 enables the withdrawal of staking rewards that were earned by participating in Ethereum Proof-of-Stake Consensus. Users will also be able to exit staking entirely and unlock their full validator balance. The Shanghai upgrade is affecting execution clients and this ETH fork is occurring in parallel with consensus client upgrade Capella.\n\nTogether, these updates are commonly referred to as \"Shapella\". Versions of the Upgrades on the Sepolia and Georli testnets are now complete and the functionality of ETH staking withdrawal has been clearly defined. The mainnet upgrade is now ready and is ETH fork date is set for April 12th.\n\nShapella is the first simultaneous upgrade of Ethereum\u2019s execution and consensus layers.\n\nHow Does ETH staking work?\n\nPost-Merge Ethereum operates as a single blockchain with two layers. The execution layer is where Ethereum transactions are processed and then broadcast to the rest of the network and the consensus layer manages transaction settlement and finality via the proof-of-stake consensus model.\n\nEthereum staking refers to participation in Ethereum\u2019s transaction validation. Users lock-in, or \u2018stake\u2019 their ETH tokens on the blockchain in order to earn transaction validation opportunities that secure the network in exchange for rewards.\n\nThe key outcome of Shapella will be to allow the ETH validators who manage proof-of-stake consensus to shift their balances, currently locked on the consensus layer, to an execution layer address. This is simply an address that any everyday user of the Ethereum network is familiar with. This means validators will finally be able to unstake their ETH and staking rewards.\n\nPerhaps the most significant impact of the Shanghai upgrade will be that it will the first time in recent history when the entire ETH staking community will be able to change how, who, and where they stake their Ethereum.\n\nEthereum functions as a decentralized network of validators who collectively secure and push forward the blockchain. Ethereum underpins a broader social community and stakers can use their stake to essentially vote on what network consensus will look like. If more stakers prefer assigning their stakes to a large institutional custodian then Ethereum will be less democratic than a consensus with a majority of independent stakers.\n\nStaking on Ethereum can occur in many ways including \u2014\n\nSolo staking and running independently\n\nUsing a non-custodial staking service like Consensys Staking\n\nUsing a liquid staking service like LIDO\n\nSo far, because ETH staking withdrawals have not been available, Ethereum holders have been constrained in how they stake and signal their values. The Capella upgrade will offer an opportunity for stakers to vote with their stake. This may mean withdrawing their previously locked stakes and liquidating or shifting their stake to a staking method that more aligns with their values.\n\nNew Features \u2014\n\nCapella delivers the ability to update the withdrawal credentials of an Ethereum validator from the older 0x00-type (derived from a BLS key), to the newer 0x01-type (derived from an Ethereum address).\n\nIt will allow for partial withdrawals, or the periodic and automatic \u201cskimming\u201d of earned, consensus layer rewards from an active validator\u2019s balance (that has more than 32 ETH).\n\nIt will enable full withdrawals, or the reclaiming of an \u201cexited\u201d validator\u2019s entire balance.\n\nEthereum Upgrade \u2013 What Do The Charts Say?\n\nAs the chart above shows, there has been a significant drop in the amount of Ethereum on centralized exchanges since May 2020. In general, a lower amount of a digital asset on an exchange, compared to those held in self-custody, is a bullish signal. More Ether on exchanges means a higher likelihood of incoming selling pressure. This suggests that the selling pressure emerging from Shanghai staking unlocks may be less intense.\n\nLiquid staking protocol Lido dominates the ETH staking ecosystem. Liquid staking is popular because it addresses the main drawback of staking\u2014long lock-ups. When users deposit their ETH for staking through a liquid staking protocol, they receive back a tokenized version of the asset they deposit 1:1, with Lido ETH staking this asset is called stETH.\n\nOver time, if the user chooses to continue staking, the stETH position will continue to get larger but the user can withdraw and sell their stETH at any time without having to wait for a cool down or unlock period as a validator would.\n\n31.2% of all Ethereum staked is currently staked using Lido, 22.4% is staked unidentified (individual), 12.6% is staked with Coinbase, 6.8% is staked with Kraken and 5.7% is staked with Binance.\n\nIn a comment sent to Brave New Coin Ilya Volkov, CEO and co-founder of YouHodler, a Swiss-based international fintech platform providing a variety of Web3 crypto and fiat services, offered insights into why the market share of centralized exchanges offering staking services has slid. \u201cCentralized exchanges are no longer able to offer staking services in the U.S. So, ETH will be withdrawn from these exchanges and staked elsewhere (e.g decentralized staking services). At the moment, the SEC cannot prevent users from staking ETH tokens via an individual node or via decentralized staking services.\u201d Volkov says.\n\nWith Shapella, the number of node operators and types of validators can be accommodated by Lido. Following Shapella, Lido is set to introduce a staking router and a modular infrastructure. This will mean staking deposits will be spread to a much more diverse set of validators and Lido will have more diversity and security in how it manages user\u2019s stakes.\n\nFollowing Shapella, users of Lido will be able to withdraw ETH 1-for-1 directly from Lido. More information on the changes Lido will make to its protocol Shapella can be found here.\n\nThe Ethereum Price Leading Into Shanghai Fork\n\nIn the lead-up to the Shanghai upgrade, the price of Ethereum has soared. The asset is up ~28.9% in the last 30 days. The strong performance may not be driven purely by the excitement around the Shanghai hard fork, though, given the strong performance of other large-cap digital assets. In fact, Ethereum is actually lagging as in the last 30 days the Bitcoin price (BTC) is up ~42.8% and the XRP price is up ~39.8%.\n\nThe correlation between ETH and BTC is also high and has been historically high. This suggests that either the same factors drive the price of both assets or one asset leads the other. BTC\u2019s strong performance in the last month has been driven by its position as the \u2018highest beta monetary irresponsibility hedge.\u2019 Bitcoin has enjoyed excellent momentum as traditional financial markets have stuttered in recent months.\n\nYears of excessive money printing and low-interest rates that are now being reversed are creating chaos throughout global credit markets. Additionally, the government backstopping of a number of American banks and notable Swiss bank Credit Suisse has created concerns about the stability of global financial markets.\n\nGold has soared and continues to establish new all-time highs. Safe havens like the US dollar and Treasury bills have been affected by the chaotic interest rates \u2013 increasing the appeal of assets like BTC, gold, and silver.\n\nThe price of ETH and other digital assets maybe be benefiting from their close macro connection to BTC. They don\u2019t have the same \u2018flight to quality\u2019 digital gold narrative that Bitcoin has \u2013 but are rising because of osmosis.\n\nThe Ethereum Price After The Shanghai Upgrade\n\nThere are some concerns that the large unlock of staked Ether will lead to a wave of selling pressure as stakers can finally regain liquidity, but some observers say the unlocked ETH liquidity will be swept up by new demand to stake. There is also a view that ETH staking will increase post-Shanghai, given the new flexibility offered to stakers.\n\nAt YouHodler, Volkov tells Brave New Coin that he expects volatility around the time of the Shanghai fork because of factors like the potential failure of the upgrade to implement on time.\n\nHe also points to a futures market where there has not been a significant increase in the number of short orders for ETH placed. This suggests that this market is unclear on whether Shapella will be a bullish or bearish event. Check here for more on what futures data tells us about where the smart money sees price going.\n\nDespite being the most staked asset in crypto, the ratio of staked ETH is just 15.64% of the total ETH supply according to stakingrewards.com. This compares poorly to the ratio of staked assets on other major proof-of-stake chains like BNB-chain, Cardano, and Solana, all of which have ratios of staked assets sitting above 70%.\n\nThis suggests that the adoption of Ethereum staking has been slow and that so far at least, the inability of validators to unstake has held up the adoption of Ethereum staking.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe upcoming Shanghai upgrade represents a significant milestone in the development of Ethereum consensus and the broader cryptocurrency market. With the ability for ETH validators to finally unstake their tokens and withdraw their rewards, there is likely to be a significant shift in how staking functions on Ethereum. Ethereum validators will finally be able to vote with their stake and will be able to shift to their preferred type of consensus participation.\n\nWhile there are concerns about potential selling pressure following the unlock, the strong performance of ETH and other digital assets leading up to the upgrade suggests that a bullish wider crypto market may outstrip any increased selling pressure.\n\nThe impact of the Shanghai upgrade on the cryptocurrency market remains to be seen, but it is clear that Ethereum continues to play a significant role in the development of Web 3.0 and the future of decentralized finance."

        "content": "In this issue\n\nEthereum: Upgrade anxieties Apple: Bitcoin hideout Hong Kong: Wooing Web3\n\nFrom the editor\u2019s desk Dear Reader, When it comes to showing the extent to which digital assets have become integrated into our lives, the metaphors don\u2019t come much more vivid than the news that the Bitcoin white paper has been hidden in Apple\u2019s MacOS operating system for the past six or so years. And the fact that the white paper has been slipped into an Apple technology rather than into another form of tech doubles down on that message: Like cryptocurrencies currently are to traditional finance, Apple was once an underdog in its industry. Its evolution into one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies demonstrates the transformative power of innovation, and a similar sense of pioneering innovation hints at the possibilities for crypto and other digital assets. Yet regulators are still playing catch-up. Perhaps nowhere is this more evident than in the United States, where the Securities and Exchange Commission, alongside other authorities, has this year launched a series of occasionally controversial enforcement actions against crypto companies, despite a slew of unanswered questions and official disagreements on how to regulate digital assets. Bitcoin is an excellent example of the regulatory muddle. The original crypto was defined as a virtual currency and a means of payment by the U.S. Treasury a decade ago, classified as a commodity by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission a year later \u2014 when the Internal Revenue Service designated it as property \u2014 and treated as physical cash in the Biden Administration\u2019s infrastructure bill, which became law in 2021. If Apple\u2019s technology had been subject to such confusing, conflicting regulatory reasoning, alongside enforcement action that some in the crypto industry \u2014 and even some in the regulatory community \u2014 consider little more than arbitrary, would it ever have grown into one of the most successful companies of all time? For digital assets to develop to the extent that their untapped potential is fully realized, the regulatory roadblocks must be cleared and rules must be made rational and predictable \u2014 as is required for the development of any young industry. A good place to start would be settling the ongoing impasse between the SEC and the CFTC over whether cryptocurrencies are securities or commodities. We are the custodians of a brave new era in the evolution of finance that\u2019s already embedded in our financial ecosystem. We must not let its promise be diminished because regulating it is challenging. Digital assets present authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere with a challenge, but, more importantly, an opportunity. They need to step forward and take it. Until the next time, Angie Lau,\n\nFounder and Editor-in-Chief\n\nForkast\n\n1. Fork up\n\nEthereum\u2019s Shapella upgrade will offer increased utility for stakers, but it has prompted concerns over possible downward pressure on the token\u2019s price. Image: Canva\n\nEthereum\u2019s long-awaited Shapella upgrade, also known as the Shanghai hard fork, is scheduled for mainnet activation on Thursday, April 13, at 6:27 a.m. Hong Kong time, at epoch 194048, according to an announcement by the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nEthereum holders have been looking forward to the Shapella upgrade, which promises to enable stakers to withdraw their ETH from the Beacon Chain for the first time while claiming staking rewards.\n\nThe upgrade is the most significant since The Merge transitioned Ethereum from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to its current proof-of-stake setup last September.\n\nDaily ETH staking deposits shrunk from 55,456 ETH on March 31, to as low as 11,728 ETH on April 11, according to BeaconScan data.\n\nInvestors worry that the upgrade could significantly increase selling pressure on ETH, since more than 18.2 million ETH worth US$34.16 billion is staked on the Beacon Chain, or 15.15% of the token\u2019s total supply, according to Dune.\n\n\u201cThe voluntary [validator] exit count surges higher as Shanghai approaches,\u201d tweeted James Straten, a data analyst at CryptoSlate, adding that there may be \u201ca lot of potential sell pressure,\u201d due to the large sum of staked ETH.\n\nHowever, crypto exchange Gate.io said the impact of sales \u201cmight be small,\u201d as only 1% of the circulating ETH supply consists of staking rewards, with a high probability of withdrawal.\n\nLido Finance, the largest liquid staking protocol, will enable staking withdrawals only from early May, Lido developer Kadmil.eth said in a Twitter space on April 6. That could further reduce selling pressure because more than 31% of total staked ETH was staked through the protocol.\n\nEther fell 2.4% in the past 24 hours to US$1,874 and is overall flat for the past week, according to CoinGecko. ETH remains 37.4% lower than its prices a year ago and is down 61.6% from its all-time high in November 2021.\n\nForkast.Insights | What does it mean? Most Ethereum upgrades are strictly crypto affairs, but the upcoming Shanghai upgrade has exacerbated a split between regulators in the United States. That\u2019s because ETH\u2019s move to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, allowing users to stake and earn interest on their holdings, is now considered \u2014 by the Securities and Exchange Commission, at least \u2014 to make it a security. Historically, the SEC was satisfied with ETH\u2019s designation as a commodity. But the arrival of staking rewards has changed that. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has publicly stated that interest-bearing contracts fundamentally change what ETH is, because those contracts are essentially financial services, making them securities instruments. But the Commodity Futures Trading Commission begs to differ. It has held the view since 2014 that ETH is a commodity and has been saying as much in Senate hearings. CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam has stressed that the derivatives watchdog would not have allowed ETH futures products to be listed on exchanges it regulates \u201cif we did not feel strongly that it was a commodity asset.\u201d The outcome of this regulatory rift is likely to shape the future of crypto more broadly. If ETH is designated a security, all the companies offering staking services \u2014 such as Coinbase, Binance, Ledger and eToro \u2014 are likely to have broken the law. Some have already faced legal challenges for offering these services. If ETH is classified with certainty as a commodity, it\u2019s likely to become a magnet for hedge funds and other large finance sector players awaiting regulatory clarity. For now, however, ETH\u2019s future remains subject to some uncertainty.\n\n2. Buried treasure\n\nBitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s white paper has been secretly distributed to MacBook users for the past six years, but may be removed from future versions of MacOS. Image: Canva\n\nThe Bitcoin white paper, the theoretical outline of the network underpinning the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency, has been hidden inside every version of the operating system used by Apple\u2019s Mac computers shipped since at least 2018.\n\nThe white paper was hidden within MacBook\u2019s Virtual Scanner II, a function disabled by default.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s unclear who hid the paper in the system, it was first discovered by MacOS community forum user bernd178 and shared in April 2021. However, the document\u2019s concealment only came to widespread attention with its re-discovery by blogger Andy Baio, who wrote a blog post about it last week.\n\nBaio said he didn\u2019t know why the paper was hidden in the operating system, but suggested that an engineer had put it there.\n\n\u201cA little bird tells me that someone internally filed it as an issue nearly a year ago, assigned to the same engineer who put the PDF there in the first place, and that person hasn\u2019t taken action or commented on the issue since. They\u2019ve indicated it will likely be removed in future versions,\u201d Baio wrote.\n\nThe world\u2019s first cryptocurrency has risen 6.6% since a week ago, to US$30,029, and has climbed 36% over the past 30 days, according to CoinGecko. But it\u2019s still 24.1% lower compared to a year ago, and more than 56% lower than its all-time high of US$69,045 in November 2021.\n\nForkast.Insights | What does it mean? Bitcoin has always had admirers, and it seems an engineer at Apple is one of them. While some are interpreting this as further evidence of the wild theory that Steve Jobs was Bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto, the answer is probably a little less exciting. Software engineers have long hidden things inside operating systems for other engineers or curious users to discover. Jokes by program designers were inserted into the code of MS-DOS as long ago as the 1980s, It seems the white paper, located inside a folder with assets used for internal testing by Apple engineers, was a prank in the same vein. The same folder also contains other random images and PDF files that are used to simulate the process of scanning and exporting documents and images with the app, without actually needing a scanner. Although Apple was aware of the issue, it seems the engineer in charge of removing the white paper hasn\u2019t gotten around to the task of removing it yet. Is it a sign of Nakamoto\u2019s return? Don\u2019t bet your BTC on it.\n\n3. Chan-neling positivity\n\nHong Kong Financial Secretary Paul Chan\u2019s naming of Web3 as a policy priority reinforces recent moves by authorities to develop the city as a digital asset hub. Image: GovHK/Canva\n\nPaul Chan, Hong Kong\u2019s financial secretary, has proposed further Web3 development as one of three key themes in the city\u2019s fiscal budget and that now is the \u201cbest time\u201d to do so, according to a blog post published on the website of his office.\n\n\u201cThe digital economy and the application of Web3 have great potential for development and have triggered a positive response from society,\u201d Chan wrote.\n\nChan added that he is optimistic about Web3 development despite \u201cvirtual assets having fluctuated significantly\u201d and the recent closures of virtual asset exchanges.\n\nChan\u2019s comments come two months after Hong Kong detailed a new licensing regime for crypto service providers that is set to take effect in June. The framework may eventually extend to retail crypto trading, which has been restricted in the territory.\n\nThe finance secretary added that the Web3 push will prioritize developing industry regulations while focusing on real-world use cases such as the tokenization of green bonds and using blockchain to \u201csimplify the supply chain process and reduce costs.\u201d\n\nChan made his remarks ahead of a busy week for the city\u2019s Web3 industry, with the Hong Kong Web3 Festival under way on Wednesday, and the government hosting a two-day Digital Economy Summit starting Thursday."

The mainnet hard fork is now scheduled to take place on April 12, 2023, at epoch 194048, as announced during the Ethereum All Core Developers Execution (ACDE) call on March 16, 2023.\n\nIt is anticipated that the Shanghai Capella Upgrade will implement EIP-4895, enabling the unstaking of ETH tokens and bringing the network one step closer to a completely functional proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain network. This upgrade is crucial for those who wish to become validators on the Ethereum 2.0 network, as they were required to stake at least 32 ETH to the network, which was sealed indefinitely. With the Shapella enhancement, this issue will be resolved.\n\nIt should be noted that the Shanghai-Capella upgrade launch was delayed by one month due to Sepolia testnet execution delays. Nevertheless, the upgrade is eagerly anticipated, as it represents a major move forward in Ethereum\u2019s evolution into a more efficient and scalable blockchain platform.\n\nIt is worthwhile to review Ethereum\u2019s recent transition from proof-of-work consensus mechanisms to proof-of-stake consensus mechanisms. On September 15, 2022, Ethereum underwent the Merge, one of the most significant transitions in the history of cryptocurrencies. This is the first phase in Ethereum\u2019s long-term plan to reduce gas fees, increase transaction speeds, and maintain its position as the world\u2019s largest blockchain platform capable of smart contracts."

        "content": "Ethereum's Shapella upgrade is live, allowing stakers to withdraw ETH for first time in 28 months.\n\nBy: Samuel Haig \u2022 Loading...\n\nBreaking News\n\nEthereum\u2019s long-awaited Shapella upgrades are now live, allowing those who staked ETH in the blockchain network to withdraw their cryptocurrency for the first time.\n\nOn April 12, Ethereum Shanghai and Capella forks, colloquially called \u201cShapella,\u201d upgraded the network\u2019s execution and consensus layers respectively at epoch 194,048 to support Beacon Chain withdrawals.\n\nShapella is a major step in Ethereum development, introducing vital functionality to the network. ETH stakers, responsible for securing the Ethereum blockchain, are now able to withdraw their crypto from the Beacon Chain for the first time, 28 months after staking first went live, as part of Ethereum\u2019s transition to the Proof of Stake consensus algorithm from Proof of Work.\n\n\u201cThe Shapella Upgrade represents a game-changing development that positions Ethereum for sustained growth and success,\u201d Chen Zhuling, Founder and CEO of RockX, a Proof of Stake node collective.\n\nShapella was Ethereum\u2019s first upgrade since The Merge transitioned the network to Proof of Stake consensus from Proof of Work, which reduced Ethereum\u2019s energy consumption by 99.9% and new ETH issuance by more than 90%. Proof of Stake requires participants in the network to deposit the blockchain\u2019s native cryptocurrency, while Proof of Work requires node operators to contribute energy.\n\nStakers in the Ethereum network get rewarded in ETH in exchange for their deposits. Ethereum stakers now must decide what to do with their accumulated rewards and initial position \u2014 a bond of 32 Ether.\n\nWill Stakers Exit Ethereum en Masse?\n\nThe implications of Shapella were fiercely debated by the crypto community as April 12 approached, with many pundits tipping that the upgrade could lead to a flood of ETH getting dumped on the open market.\n\n\u201cThere are a significant amount of accumulated rewards since the genesis of Ethereum, and node operators will now have access to them,\u201d Darren Langley, general manager of decentralized staking provider, Rocket Pool, told The Defiant, adding that stakers will have \u201cseveral options available to them.\u201d\n\nBut Langley thinks a post-Shapella staker exodus is unlikely, predicting that the majority of validators will choose to re-stake their to accumulate more rewards.\n\n\u201cThere is no evidence to suggest that operators will withdraw from staking in any great numbers,\u201d Langley continued. \u201cNode operators can exit now and be first in the queue to withdraw but we are not seeing exits build-up, which suggests most will continue to stake.\n\nDeFi Alpha Premium Content DeFi Daily | Weekdays\n\nDeFi Alpha Letter | Weekly\n\nDefiant Podcast Transcript | Weekly\n\nInbox Dump | Saturday\n\nWeekly Recap | Sunday Looking for Alpha? Become a premium member of The Defiant and join our DeFi Alpha community. Start for free\n\nSuperphiz, an organizer for the EthStaker community, told The Defiant that staking is bound to increase after Shapella. \u201cThe current participants took a huge risk that withdrawals would eventually be enabled,\u201d he said. \u201cNow that staking is de-risked, institutional investors are sure to experiment in the process.\u201d\n\nEthereum\u2019s devs also placed a limit on the number of validators that can withdraw each day. The limit is 1,800, equating to 57,600 ETH or less than 0.05% of Ether\u2019s supply, according to Glassnode.\n\nStaking Participation\n\nEthereum is currently the largest PoS network by staked capitalization with $35.8B, despite the figure only representing 15.6% of ETH\u2019s supply, according to Staking Rewards.\n\nFor comparison, more than 60% of the circulating tokens for Cardano, Solana, and Avalanche, the second, third, and fifth-ranked PoS networks, are currently staked.\n\nDaniel Bar, the founder of Bitfwd Capital, told The Defiant that enabling validators to withdraw at any time will lead to greater rates of staking participation.\n\n\u201cWhile some believe it\u2019ll lead to an increase in sell pressure, I see it the other way around: [Shapella] will strengthen the confidence market participants have in staking ETH to generate yield,\u201d Bar said.\n\nMike Silagadze, the CEO of Ether.fi, a liquid staking platform, said there is \u201cno question\u201d that Ethereum staking participation will increase post-Shapella.\n\n\u201cI think there are a huge number of folks who have been interested in staking, but have stayed on the sidelines because they were worried that ETH staking withdrawals might never be enabled,\u201d Silagadze said. \u201cWith that FUD addressed, I think we\u2019re going to see a steady influx of newly staked ETH in the coming weeks that far outstrips withdrawals.\u201d\n\nWill the Price of Ether Hold Up?\n\nWhile the price of ETH was up 20% in 30 days, some analysts fear Shapella will result in the market falling as some validators move to sell off their stake.\n\nThe latest Digital Asset Fund Flows report from CoinShares suggests institutional investors are waiting to see how Shapella will impact the markets before betting on the markets. According to the report, only $600,000 flowed into institutional ETH products over the week of April 11.\n\n\u201cDespite the Shapella upgrade occurring on the Ethereum network on April 12, [ETH] inflows have been relatively minor,\u201d CoinShares told The Defiant.\n\nBut Evans said Shapella will have a comparatively small impact compared to macroeconomic forces.\n\nArthur Hayes, the co-founder and former CEO of BitMEX, told The Defiant that fears that Shapella will drive violent short-term price volatility are \u201cgreatly exaggerated.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a cap on the amount of withdrawal actions that can be executed per block, which greatly limits the overall speed at which staked ETH can be withdrawn,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cFolks will also be staking additional ETH now that withdrawals are enabled and they know they can get it back. Combined, these flows paint a murky picture as to what the magnitude of the sell pressure will actually be.\u201d\n\nEvans said Shapella will have a comparatively small impact compared to macroeconomic forces.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll likely see some volatility over the next few days and weeks as the market adjusts to the new functions that allow for withdrawals, but this will pale in comparison to broader market movements that remain sensitive to macroeconomic news,\u201d Evans said.\n\nMark Monfort, the director of web3 venture firm, NotCentralised, said that many stakers may have locked up their Ether at higher prices and be unwilling to realize a loss. \u201cWith the current price of Ether lower than when many users staked their funds, it\u2019s also possible that these holders may not want to sell at a loss, which could limit the impact on the market,\u201d Montfort told The Defiant.\n\nHsuan Lee, co-founder and CEO of Blocto, said the long-term benefits Shapella will deliver to stakers and other staking service providers will significantly outweigh any short-term volatility caused by Ether withdrawals.\n\n\u201cExpectations of short-term price volatility\u2026 will give way to major market gains in intermediaries such as staking pools and crypto exchanges, notwithstanding incremental institutional interest in the asset class,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat Does Shapella Mean for LSDs?\n\nLiquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs), which allow users to access liquid tokens representing underlying staked Ether while earning staking rewards, posted impressive growth amid the absence of staked Ether withdrawals.\n\nThe TVL of Lido, the largest LSD protocol, surged 92% to $11.3B since the start of the year, while its decentralization-focused rival, Rocket Pool, is up 112% at $1.2B, according to DeFi Llama. Their respective tokens, LDO and RPL, also rallied 138% and 120% since the start of January, according to CoinGecko.\n\nHowever, whether LSD protocols can sustain their impressive growth in a post-Shapella world is unclear, as the activation of staked Ether withdrawals solves one of the core problems underpinning the value proposition of LSDs.\n\n\u201c[Shapella] could have both positive and negative implications [for LSDs],\u2019 Monfort said. \u201cOn the one hand, the ability to withdraw staked Ether could make liquid staking less attractive for some users, as they no longer need to rely on a third-party provider to access their funds. On the other hand, liquid staking providers may still offer benefits such as liquidity and convenience, which could continue to attract users.\u201d\n\nThe LSD tokens offered by leading providers like Lido and Rocket Pool enjoy numerous integrations with leading DeFi protocols, such as Aave, MakerDAO, and Curve, providing yield opportunities that are not available to regular Ethereum stakers.\n\n\u201cMany stakers who withdraw will re-stake the bulk of their ETH rewards back to liquid staking providers like Lido and Frax,\u201d said Lee. \u201cThese players are in the best position to capture these flows, as they provide potential for immediate liquidity through on-chain pools, expansive utility of liquid staking tokens as collateral across DeFi, and convenient accessibility to innovative restaking primitives like EigenLayer.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s next for Ethereum?\n\nEthereum\u2019s next major upgrade is expected to focus on EIP-4844, also known as proto-dank sharding. The fork is expected to take place around the start of 2024.\n\nResearchers anticipate that EIP-4844 will reduce the costs associated with transacting on Ethereum Layer 2. The upgrade will replace the blockspace-intensive \u201ccalldata\u201d currently tied to transaction data with \u201cblobs.\u201d Unlike calldata, Blobs do not compete with Ethereum transactions for gas usage, significantly reducing the blockspace needed to process transactions on L2.\n\nIn a recent appearance on The Defiant Podcast, Carl Beekhuizen of the Ethereum Foundation said the cost of storing data on-chain is the primary bottleneck restricting the scalability gains available at Layer 2.\n\n\u201cIf you scale to thousands and thousands of transactions, then all of a sudden it costs a lot just to [store the data] on-chain,\u201d Beekhuizen said. \u201cThe idea behind Danksharding and EIP-4844 is to provide really cheap data storage\u2026 so the L2s can provide cheap transactions to their users.\u201d\n\nOnce the upgrade takes effect, the Ethereum network will begin deleting historic transaction data that is older than 30 days, with infrastructure providers like the Etherscan block explorer expected to take on the responsibility of storing older data.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of the Ethereum consensus protocol is not to guarantee storage of all historical data forever,\u201d Buterin said. \u201cRather, the purpose is to provide a highly secure real-time bulletin board, and leave room for other decentralized protocols to do longer-term storage.\u201d\n\nEIP-4844 will also pave the way for Ethereum to become sharded, where Ethereum\u2019s computational load is split across its L2 ecosystem and processed in parallel to deliver further scalability gains."

        "title": "Ethereum price metrics hint that ETH might not sell-off after the Shapella hard fork - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ether (ETH) price has increased by 58% year to date, but it has far underperformed the market leader Bitcoin (BTC). In fact, the ETH/BTC price ratio has dropped to 0.063, its lowest level in nine months.\n\nAnalysts believe that the majority of the movement can be attributed to the Ethereum network's upcoming Shapella hard fork, which is scheduled for April 12 at 10:27 p.m. UTC.\n\nEther / Bitcoin price ratio at Binance. Source: TradingView\n\nThe Ethereum network upgrade will allow stakers to unlock their Ether rewards or stop staking entirely. By April 11, over 170,000 ETH withdrawals were requested, according to the analytics firm Glassnode. However, the total staked on the Beacon Chain exceeds 18.1 million ETH, which has traders fearful until more information on ETH\u2019s potential selling pressure becomes available.\n\nIs the price impact of the Shapella fork already priced in?\n\nThe staking unlock was widely known and expected, so traders could have anticipated the movement. Some analysts have gone so far as to call the hard fork a \u201cbuy the news\u201d event.\n\nLiterally everyone: \u201cEthereum Shanghai is a buy the news event because everyone thinks it is a sell the news event\u201d pic.twitter.com/TpyL1TDnPj \u2014 HORSE (@CanteringClark) April 9, 2023\n\nUsing a meme, trader CanteringClark is likely expressing dissatisfaction with the theory, but to invalidate the hypothesis, one must investigate potential reasons for ETH\u2019s underperformance other than the much anticipated hard fork.\n\nFor starters, the Ethereum network\u2019s average transaction fee has been above $5 for the past five weeks, and the Shapella fork does not address the issue, despite minor improvements. This alone lowers the chances of a bullish breakout following the upgrade, as most decentralized applications (DApps) and projects will continue to prefer second-layer and competing networks.\n\nFurthermore, volume at Ethereum-based decentralized exchanges (DEX) has fallen by 84% since a weekly peak of $38.2 billion on March 5. The most recent data for the week ending April 2 was $6.4 billion, according to DefiLlama. In the same period, competing blockchains saw 60% lower volumes on average, a sign that Ethereum lost market share.\n\nAccording to Paul Brody, EY\u2019s global blockchain leader, one reason for Ether\u2019s price underperformance relative to Bitcoin could be \u201cthe battle to keep Ethereum sufficiently and properly decentralized.\u201d Brody cites exchanges as highly centralized custodial validators, as well as some semi-centralized players and staking pool operations that invest funds from tens of thousands of individual crypto wallets.\n\nEther derivatives display balanced bets between bulls and bears\n\nLet's examine Ether derivatives metrics to determine the current market position of professional traders. For example, the open interest in Ether options for the weekly expiry on April 14 is $510 million, with neutral-to-bullish call instruments outnumbering protective put options by 36%.\n\nThose ETH options bulls could come up empty-handed because 60% of their bets were placed at $2,000 or higher. As a result, if Ether\u2019s price remains between $1,800 and $1,900 on April 14 at 8:00 am UTC, the outcome is balanced between call and put options. Furthermore, an expiry price between $1,900 and $2,000 represents a mere $100 million advantage for bulls, which is unlikely to justify the cost of a price pump.\n\nFutures markets should also be examined to determine whether the Shapella hard fork has caused investors to become more risk-averse. Ether quarterly futures are popular among whales and arbitrage desks, and they typically trade at a slight premium to spot markets, indicating that sellers are requesting more money to postpone settlement.\n\nAs a result, futures contracts in healthy markets should trade at a 5% to 10% annualized premium \u2014 a situation known as contango, which is not unique to crypto markets.\n\nEther 3-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe premium on Ether futures is currently 2%, down from 4% the previous week. Despite being below the 5% neutral threshold, it shows no excessive short demand.\n\nRelated: Validator service to use API for ETH staking process\n\nTraders should monitor staking unlock requests\n\nBased on Ether derivatives, there is no reason to believe professional traders expect a significant price correction as a result of the staking unlock. Nonetheless, given the high transaction fees and declining DEX activity, the chances of a \u201cbuy the news\u201d event are slim.\n\nProfessional traders would have used derivatives instruments to bet against Ether\u2019s price because the event was widely publicized, which hasn\u2019t happened given the ETH futures\u2019 premium. There are no obvious reasons for a rally, but derivatives traders do not anticipate any panic selling. So, unless the number of staking unlock requests significantly increases, Ether should remain near $1,900 for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "The upcoming Shanghai upgrade will mark Ethereum's complete transition to a proof of stake network. Photo: Getty (Dennis Diatel Photography via Getty Images)\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain's Shanghai upgrade is about to be launched, unlocking more than 18 million ether, worth around $34bn (\u00a327.3bn).\n\nYahoo Finance UK spoke to industry experts about the effect that the increase could have on the crypto market.\n\nThe value of ether (ETH-USD) has been rising since November 2022, after the collapse of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nOn Tuesday, ether rose 6.1% to $1,920. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) breached the $30,000 mark, rising to $30,129.\n\nEthereum's Shanghai upgrade\n\nEthereum's Shanghai upgrade is set to launch on 12 April, and will conclude Ethereum's transition to a 'proof of stake' blockchain, making it over 99% less energy intensive than the 'proof of work' blockchain which powers the Bitcoin network.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe new upgrade will make over 18 million ether, worth about $34bn, available for withdrawal. This has led to fears of a sudden dump of supply on the market, causing a short term haemorrhaging in price.\n\nJim McDonald, CTO of London staking firm Attestant, told Fortune: \"The price of Ethereum is expected to dip sharply right after Shanghai as about 50% to 70% of early withdrawers cash out as the price of ETH has more than quadrupled since December, and there are profits to be had,\"\n\nHowever, some analysts forecast that the short-term price impact may be more muted as withdrawal queue restrictions and 'stakers' holding their ether could prevent a sharp price dip.\n\nEthereum 'stakers', those who currently have their ether locked in the blockchain's validation process, will need to wait for a period ranging from days to months to access their ether. This depends on whether they staked individually or through pools and service providers.\n\nRead more: Crypto live prices\n\nCEO of P2P.org Alex Esin told Yahoo Finance UK: \"We don\u2019t think it\u2019s likely many ether 'stakers' will rush and are not expecting to see a massive withdrawal spike.\n\n\"This is because many who have already staked on the Beacon Chain have a high-risk tolerance and are not holding out for the withdrawal date, those who may need to withdraw for other reasons will need to weigh this up against the growth expected from the Ethereum ecosystem and ETH strength expected over the next year.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"From a price perspective, we expect to see upward pressure as more people who previously were not comfortable locking away their ETH begin to participate in staking. As the ETH staking ratio increases, more ETH will be removed from the market pushing the price higher.\u201d\n\nOther analysts say that Shanghai could make Ethereum more attractive for long-term investors and increase competition in crypto custody, as major banks show growing interest in the sector.\n\nRead more: Ethereum soars 8% \u2013 closes in on $2k ahead of Shanghai upgrade\n\nGuilhem Chaumont, co-founder of Flowdesk, said that the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade is a key de-risking event that may attract more institutional players to participate in staking or offer related services to clients.\n\nHe said: \u201cGiven the recent turmoil in the banking sector, there may be demand from institutional and retail investors looking for alternative assets to invest in and we may see a greater volume and engagement with the ecosystem post-Shanghai upgrade.\n\n\"For institutions in particular, Shanghai presents a key de-risking event. Prior to the upgrade, financial institutions looking to offer staking services may have been hindered due to the fact that they were locking up funds for a potentially indefinite period of time. Now that withdrawals are being enabled we may see more of these institutional players participating in staking or offering services to their clients.\"\n\nPotential risks of the Shanghai upgrade\n\nValerie Tetu, head of go-to-market strategy at Lido Finance, emphasised the need for strict security due diligence and testing to mitigate potential smart contract risks during and after the Shanghai upgrade.\n\nShe said: \"Staking withdrawals enabled by the Shanghai upgrade represent a significant milestone in the development of the Ethereum blockchain. Withdrawals will allow stakers to participate in securing the network with more confidence while increasing the capital efficiency of the tokens they decide to allocate.\n\n\"While the upgrade is well-positioned to drive more staking activity and participation, potential smart contract risks need to be considered and mitigated. All ecosystem stakeholders have the responsibility to commit to strict security due diligence standards and testing.\"\n\nWhat is Ethereum's Shanghai Upgrade?\n\nThe upcoming Shanghai upgrade follows Ethereum's previous 'merge' upgrade in September and will mark its complete transition to a proof of stake network.\n\nRead more: Germany considers following Italy in banning ChatGPT\n\nThe upgrade will reduce Ethereum's energy consumption by 99.9%.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade will allow ether 'stakers' to withdraw their staked ETH for the first time.\n\nStaking involves earning financial rewards for contributing to the blockchain's network and supporting its functionality.\n\nWatch: Philip Hammond on CBDCs, stablecoins and crypto's place in global finance | The Crypto Mile\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe adage \"buy the rumor, sell the news\" often passes for sound fiscal advice.\n\nNot today.\n\nIn the minutes following the successful implementation of Ethereum's historic Shanghai upgrade, which Wednesday evening enabled the withdrawal of staked ETH by the network's participants, the price of ETH remained largely unchanged, even ticking slightly upwards.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nETH stayed steady in the minutes following the merge, crawling up just a hair\u2014.21%\u2014 to $1919.50 at writing, according to CoinGecko. That's up roughly 3% since yesterday evening.\n\nMore significant than those paltry gains is the fact that ETH did not drop sharply in price following Shanghai's successful implementation, as was widely expected. Often, traders buy up stocks or cryptocurrencies in anticipation of a major event impacting that asset, then sell it off en masse once the event occurs.\n\nThat's what happened in September, when the merge event transitioned Ethereum to proof of stake. Despite the event's remarkable technical success, ETH plummeted some 8% immediately following the news, as traders offloaded their positions.\n\nShanghai, while certainly significant to the Ethereum ecosystem, appears to have avoided making the same impact on ETH. The upgrade completed Ethereum's shift to a proof of stake network\u2014in which users stake ETH with the network to validate on-chain transactions, and are reward for that participation with newly generated ETH\u2014by enabling the withdrawal of staked ETH from the network. Previously, the $35 billion worth of ETH deposited with Ethereum had been locked up and inaccessible.\n\nMaking a dip in ETH's price post-Shanghai even more likely was the fact that the upgrade would permit tens of billions of ETH to be withdrawn, sold, and flood the market. Analysts expected more than $300 million worth of ETH to be liquidated immediately following Shanghai's launch.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut neither that factor, nor Shanghai's position as a notable, tradable moment in Ethereum's history, appear to have impacted ETH's price whatsoever, at least not yet. Why?\n\nOne reason may be that the majority of staked ETH has been deposited with Ethereum via intermediary staking pools and centralized crypto exchanges, many of which issue staking tokens to customers. In that sense, much of the capital supposedly kept hostage pre-Shanghai has actually been liquid for some time.\n\n\"Most people have been able to sell [staked ETH] for quite some time, because the majority of ETH is being staked through platforms with liquid staking programs, like Lido or Rocket Pool,\" Jacobc.eth, head of product at Ethereum layer-2 Mantle, previously told Decrypt. \"So I don't think [Shanghai] actually represents a major shift in the economics of Ethereum.\"\n\nMatthew Niemerg, co-founder of privacy-enhancing blockchain network Aleph Zero, recently concurred: \u201cTo be more direct, it's priced in,\u201d he said.\n\nThe difference between Shanghai's market impact, and that of the merge in September, could also be seen in how both events impacted ETH's price in the days leading up to their execution. In the five days preceding the merge, ETH's price dropped 10%. It would go on to drop another 15% in the days following. In the five day leading up to Shanghai, however, ETH climbed up 3%."

        "content": "The Ethereum network\u2019s Shapella upgrade, scheduled for around 10:30 pm UTC on April 12, has induced significant uncertainty among traders, according to a report by Kaiko.\n\nThe upgrade will enable staked Ether (ETH) withdrawals from the Beacon Chain for the first time since its launch in December 2020. According to previous estimates, the upgrade will add nearly 1.2 million to 3 million worth of ETH selling pressure in the first few weeks. This is one of the main reasons traders appear to be taking a cautious stance ahead of the upgrade.\n\nKaiko\u2019s report shows that ETH is lagging behind Bitcoin (BTC) in spot and futures trading volumes, while options market data shows traders are actively adding short-term hedging positions.\n\nEther displays muted trading data\n\nEthereum\u2019s market share in U.S. dollar trading volume compared to Bitcoin declined to March 2021 lows near 30%, per Kaiko data, showing that Ether has \u201cstruggled to maintain pace\u201d with Bitcoin spot volumes. During Ethereum\u2019s last big upgrade, the Merge, its market share relative to Bitcoin reached a high of 53%.\n\nSimilarly, the relative increase in the open interest (OI) volumes for Bitcoin has surpassed Ethereum considerably with the April 10 price surge above $30,000.\n\nOpen interest volumes for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Source: Kaiko\n\nThe ratio between Ethereum\u2019s spot and perpetual trading volumes also reflects the lack of trading interest. The ratio has dropped below the levels attained before the Merge.\n\nLastly, the options market also reflected the uncertainty around the upgrade. The report found that the implied volatility for Ethereum options contracts expiring in April has trended higher than all timelines for Bitcoin. It suggests that an increasing number of traders are looking to hedge their positions.\n\nEthereum and Bitcoin implied volatility. Source: Kaiko\n\nWhen the demand for options increases, it implies that the market expects greater price swings in the underlying asset and, therefore, higher implied volatility. The report added:\n\n\u201cAll ETH expiries have moved closely with one another while the longer BTC expiries have remained stable, again indicating that there is more uncertainty\u2014particularly in the long term\u2014in the ETH derivatives markets.\u201d\n\nETH/USD daily price chart.

The ETH/USD pair faces resistance at $2,000 from the technical and psychological points of view. The Moving Average Convergence and Divergence indicator, a momentum oscillator, has remained flat through Ether\u2019s latest price rise, showing a lack of bullish momentum.\n\nEthereum\u2019s falling market share compared with Bitcoin and muted trading interest relative to the Merge highlights the uncertainty in the market due to potential selling pressure after Shapella.\n\nThe lack of trading volumes and high options implied volatility can induce significant price volatility over the course of the month, especially when considering that sell pressure is expected to last for three to eight weeks after the upgrade.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade Goes Live, Unlocking $34 Billion in Staked ETH - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nETH withdrawals are now live.\n\nAt 6:27 pm EST, Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade was successfully implemented, enabling the withdrawal of staked ETH and effectively finalizing the network\u2019s years-long transition to proof of stake.\n\nLast September, Ethereum successfully executed its highly anticipated merge event, forever changing both how ETH is created and how transactions on the Ethereum network are validated. The upgrade saw Ethereum transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism in which users stake ETH with the network to validate on-chain transactions, and are rewarded for that participation with newly generated ETH. Since ETH staking debuted in 2020, participants have deposited over $34.56 billion worth of ETH with the network.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThose funds, however\u2014and the rewards generated by them\u2014were not accessible to users, even after the merge. Only now, with Shanghai\u2019s implementation, are those funds available for withdrawal. And only now can Ethereum\u2019s transformation to a proof-of-stake network be considered complete.\n\nThe road to Shanghai has been a long one, marked by repeated concessions made by Ethereum\u2019s core developers to hasten the upgrade\u2019s release. Shanghai was originally meant to include numerous other improvements to the Ethereum network, including proto-danksharding\u2014a streamlined data-sampling process that would make layer-2 transactions on the network substantially cheaper and faster\u2014and EOF, a suite of much-needed updates to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), the mechanism underlying the network that deploys smart contracts.\n\nThose updates were nixed from Shanghai, however, to ensure that ETH withdrawals were rolled out as quickly as possible. Even minute tweaks to Ethereum\u2019s encoding methods were punted from the upgrade, despite the fact that such decisions could mire the network in years of technical debt.\n\nThe pressure to release Shanghai made sense: the security and accessibility of tens of billions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency were on the line. And any flaws in the upgrade's execution could have spelled massive trouble for the network\u2014not just from upset users, but also from massive intermediaries like Lido and Coinbase that currently represent the majority of staking power on Ethereum. Government regulators are no doubt also watching closely.\n\nLuckily though, those immediate concerns are now in the rearview mirror. Once Ethereum reached its 194,048th epoch at 6:27 pm EST, the network's mainnet began forking to integrate the Shanghai upgrade. During the epoch, eight slots were missed, a standard amount typically representing nodes that had not yet updated their clients for Shanghai. But the Ethereum network continued processing transactions, the signal of a successful upgrade. Immediately thereafter, staked ETH withdrawals began processing smoothly.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEthereum Shapella Upgrade was a STUNNING SUCCESS \ud83e\udd73\ud83c\udf89\ud83d\ude80 WE MADE IT! \u2014 Ethprofit.eth \ud83e\udd87\ud83d\udd0a (@Ethprofit) April 12, 2023\n\nStakers who directly deposited at least 32 ETH (roughly $61,000 at writing) with Ethereum will now be able to withdraw the profits reaped by their deposits, or their entire deposit. That process is expected, due to demand and limited block space, to take several days.\n\nStakers who deposited their ETH through intermediary staking pools or centralized crypto exchanges will have to wait a bit longer. Lido has said staked ETH withdrawal capability will be introduced for customers in about a month; Coinbase, for its part, said its customers may have to wait several months before their staked ETH is accessible. Each intermediary ETH staking service will unroll withdrawals on its own timeframe."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai/Capella upgrade \u2014 also known by the portmanteau Shapella \u2014 may not be the technical marvel of last year\u2019s \u201cMerge\u201d or introduce turbocharged speeds to the network.\n\nVolumes of over 100,000 transactions per second will have to wait for future \u201cdanksharding\u201d upgrades, according to the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nBut the hard fork remains an important step on Ethereum\u2019s roadmap to the future, i.e., further shoring up the network\u2019s new validation mechanism while (potentially) removing barriers for institutional investors.\n\nCurrently scheduled for 10:27 pm UTC on April 12, the upgrade will allow stakers to unlock their Ether (ETH) rewards \u2014 or even exit staking entirely \u2014 for the first time since September\u2019s Merge.\n\nIt's happening\n\n\n\nShapella is scheduled on mainnet for epoch 194048, scheduled for 22:27:35 UTC on Apr. 12, 2023\n\n\n\nClient releases compatible with the upgrade are listed in the announcement below https://t.co/I0hSv9lnjz \u2014 timbeiko.eth \u2600\ufe0f (@TimBeiko) March 28, 2023\n\nPre-fork publicity hasn\u2019t matched that surrounding last autumn\u2019s change of consensus mechanisms from proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake (PoS). \u201cThis time, we won\u2019t have a war room,\u201d Freddy Zwanzger, Ethereum ecosystem lead at Blockdaemon, told Cointelegraph. Still, \u201cthere\u2019s always risks\u201d when one reshuffles the deck like this.\n\nEthereum\u2019s stakers and validators will shortly be able to withdraw $32 billion of Ether from the Beacon Chain, which accounts for about 15% of the ETH\u2019s circulating supply, according to Coinbase\u2019s April 5 newsletter. Some worry that the upgrade, also known as the Shanghai hard fork, may lower the overall number of validators and put selling pressure on the network, among other concerns.\n\n\u201cEvery hard fork brings some upgrade risk,\u201d Paul Brody, EY\u2019s global blockchain leader, told Cointelegraph, especially in cases like this where you\u2019re enabling withdrawals. On the technical side, there could be bugs latent since \u201cday zero\u201d in some of the network\u2019s staking smart contracts, for example, that may not emerge until the withdrawal date \u2014 though Brody doesn\u2019t think that\u2019s likely.\n\nThe upgrade should mitigate risks for investors. \u201cLower volatility plus a yield makes for a more familiar and less risky asset to hold long-term,\u201d Rich Rosenblum, co-founder and president at GSR, a crypto market-making firm, told Cointelegraph.\n\nMore institutional investors?\n\nWill Shapella really attract more institutional investors to the blockchain, as some believe? Research and brokerage firm AB Bernstein stated in a late-February research report that the upgrade could bring in staking from new institutional investors, and Blockdaemon\u2019s Zwanzger, whose firm has many institutional clients, foresees more interest in Ethereum staking opportunities from large professional investors. Some institutional investors have been reluctant to lock up funds without a clear withdrawal option.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s probably going to be a queue for the first couple of weeks,\u201d Zwanzger said. \u201cSo they might be better off waiting until that comes down to normal levels.\u201d\n\nAccording to Rosenblum, \u201cOnce the PoS network is fully operational, more institutions will feel comfortable holding ETH, especially once the staking yield becomes more accessible.\u201d\n\nEY\u2019s Brody, on the other hand, doesn\u2019t see much of a change. \u201cA lot of the big institutional investors that we know and work with are basically sitting on the sidelines. They want to comply, but they want to be more comfortable that they know what the rules are.\u201d Comprehensive crypto reform legislation in the United States would probably be more likely to get them off the sidelines.\n\nLonger-term risks\n\nSo what about regulatory risk, particularly in the United States? For years Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether were thought to be impervious to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) scrutiny, with many U.S. regulators tacitly agreeing that the native coins for decentralized systems like these were more like commodities than securities, placing them under the Commodity Futures Trading Commission\u2019s jurisdiction. But with Ethereum\u2019s move to a staking validation mechanism, some think the SEC may now have Ethereum in its sights.\n\nStill, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t consider it a significant risk for the network,\u201d even if that happens, said Zwanzger. The Ethereum protocol is global, and not all jurisdictions will likely share the SEC\u2019s view of what needs regulating. Of course, other countries could ultimately choose to follow the U.S., so one never knows.\n\nOthers worry that Ethereum\u2019s move to staking may herald increasing network centralization. In March, Cointelegraph reported that \u201cconcentration of ETH staked through third parties raises concerns over decentralization at Lido and Coinbase in particular.\u201d\n\nRecent: Crypto audits and bug bounties are broken: Here\u2019s how to fix them\n\n\u201cThe battle to keep Ethereum sufficiently and properly decentralized is probably one of the most important ones out there in terms of governance and organization,\u201d Brody told Cointelegraph. If any single staking partner were to have 33% of the ecosystem, that \u201ccould potentially \u2014 and I say potentially \u2014 have an impact on transaction finality, although you would get slashed for doing so.\u201d If any single or cooperating group of entities controlled two-thirds of the staking infrastructure, \u201cyou would have the potential to change the governance of the chain\u201d \u2014 something that would be \u201cvery suboptimal,\u201d he said.\n\nBut these dangers remain largely theoretical given how things have evolved since the Merge. \u201cA relatively vibrant staking ecosystem\u201d has emerged, said Brody, with \u201ca few highly centralized custodial players\u201d but also \u201csome semi-centralized custodial players\u201d like Lido, which is a liquid staking pool leader that invests with funds from tens of thousands of individual crypto wallets. There are also prominent staking groups that are \u201ctrying to be more fully decentralized,\u201d like the Rocket Pool, he added.\n\n\u201cAs long as this remains a very competitive ecosystem,\u201d dangers from centralization are unlikely, Brody continued. Moreover, as more enterprise users join the network and become de facto stakeholders, including \u201cFortune 1000\u201d companies, the system \u201cbecomes quite heavily decentralized.\u201d\n\nZwangzer said that centralization was more of a threat in the pre-Merge days when a few proof-of-work pools dominated ETH mining. In any event, he added:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this is going to become a problem as long as we can keep the centralized [cryptocurrency] exchanges at bay.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe golden age of digital monopolies\u201d\n\nOne might wonder why decentralized digital networks are even important for commerce and society. Cointelegraph posed this question to EY\u2019s Brody, who believes that public blockchains, especially Ethereum\u2019s, \u201care going to be the big global winners,\u201d with the caveat that public blockchains will first need to be \u201cprivacy-enabled.\u201d\n\nDecentralized blockchain-based networks simply offer the world\u2019s best hope to develop monopoly-resistant global digital marketplaces, he said. \u201cWe live in the golden age of digital monopolies\u201d like Amazon, Google and Facebook, mainly because that is simply the nature of networks. According to Metcalfe\u2019s Law, as a network grows, its value increases exponentially. The first to market has a good chance to dominate.\n\nBut monopolies come at a social and economic cost. New York University finance professor Thomas Philippon has estimated that monopolies cost the median American family $300 a month, and the inefficiencies they entail \u201cdeprives American workers of about $1.25 trillion of labor income.\u201d According to Brody, \u201cIf we want to fully digitize the economy, and we want to do it without digital monopolies, we should be doing it on public decentralized systems.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, EY Global has been devoting significant resources to \u201cindustrializing blockchain privacy technology\u201d through its Starlight project, a zero-knowledge proof compiler that enables secure, private business logic on the public Ethereum blockchain. The project is still in beta, but developers can now experiment with building privacy-enabled features for solidity smart contracts. The goal is to enable blockchain-based business agreements where business logic is shared at the network level, but privacy from potential competitors is still preserved.\n\nThis last point is critical. In the business world, no company wants another firm to know its commercial secrets, after all. A pharmaceutical manufacturer, for instance, may want to track its medicine packets through its supply chain, beginning with the drug\u2019s raw materials, through to distributors and hospitals.\n\nEach packet can be attached to a nonfungible token recorded on a public blockchain. The pharma firm may also want to attach some business agreements as well. For example, a distributor selling one million units of the manufacturer\u2019s drug could trigger an automatic rebate payment to the distributor via a smart contract. But the pharma firm doesn\u2019t want the whole world to know about this rebate agreement.\n\n\u201cWe are starting to build a blockchain-based inventory management system that\u2019s going to use privacy technology to manage those individual tokens,\u201d said Brody. It\u2019s starting on a private chain, but they \u201care building it with privacy technology because they want to go on to the public chain so that anybody can join with them using these standards.\u201d Brody added:\n\n\u201cSo essentially, you\u2019ll be able to take an entire business contract and supply chain operations and run it under privacy on public Ethereum at a cost-effective level.\u201d\n\nTasks like tracking products and attaching business agreements to digital ledgers may seem mundane, but their economic impact could be huge. \u201cSomewhere between 2 and 5% of all the money on earth in corporations is spent administering stuff, keeping track of it, moving it around,\u201d said Brody. \u201cBy using smart contracts and tokenized assets, we could drive that down dramatically.\u201d\n\nFeature: The state of the Bitcoin Lightning Network in 2023\n\nAll of this brings us back to Shapella and why such upgrades matter. A trouble-free launch would be further evidence that Ethereum is still on course to achieve the three key goals laid out in the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s roadmap: scalability, security and sustainability. Or as Blockdaemon\u2019s Zwanzger told Cointelegraph:\n\n\u201cIt also will reinforce the confidence in the network and in the protocol design so that a developer launching a project can be sure that, for example, gas fees and scalability will not be a big problem over the next one or two years.\u201d"

        "title": "Will Ethereum Recover? Here\u2019s What Will Help ETH Go Up Again - CoinCodex",
        "content": "Will Ethereum Recover? Here\u2019s What Will Help ETH Go Up Again\n\nMany cryptocurrency investors are wondering if Ethereum will recover from the bear market and reach new all-time highs.\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH is trading about 60.6% down from the all-time highs it reached in November of 2021. In order to evaluate Ethereum\u2019s chances of closing this gap and ascending to new highs, we\u2019ll analyze what has been happening in the ETH markets and point out some of the key fundamental factors which could drive Ethereum\u2019s recovery.\n\nBefore we tackle the question of whether Ethereum will recover, let\u2019s take a look at the context in which the Ethereum market finds itself right now. One of the more important questions we should ask ourselves is whether ETH has already found a price bottom in 2022 or if we could see even lower price levels in the future.\n\nHas Ethereum bottomed out already?\n\nEthererum has already recovered to some extent from the bear market lows it hit in June 2022. The price of ETH bottomed out at around $940, which was reached on June 18, 2022.\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH is trading at about $1,870, which is an increase of 98.9% compared to the June 2022 low. This makes it quite likely that the $940 price level was the bottom of the ETH bear market.\n\nStill, it\u2019s worth keeping in mind that there is a chance ETH could still explore new lows. The 2022 ETH crash was significant, but quite a bit softer than the price drop ETH saw in 2018. If history is going to repeat itself, ETH could find a bottom below $940 before the next crypto bull run.\n\nEthereum reached its all-time high in the 2021 cryptocurrency bear market, when ETH hit a peak of $4,850 in November 2021. When Ethereum hit its $940 low in June 2022, that represented an 80.6% decline from peak to bottom.\n\nIn the previous market cycle, Ethereum reached a peak of $1,570 in January of 2018. It bottomed out in December 2018 at a price of $84. This was a decrease of 94.6% from peak to bottom.\n\nFactors that will help Ethereum\u2019s recovery\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering whether Ethereum will go back up in the future, let\u2019s take a look at some of the main catalysts that could have a positive impact on the ETH price.\n\nLayer 2 technologies are making Ethereum much cheaper and faster to use\n\nOne of Ethereum\u2019s biggest issues so far has been its lack of scalability. This became painfully evident in the 2021 bull market, when very strong demand for transactions on the Ethereum network resulted in exorbitant transaction fees. This provided a tailwind for competing blockchains like BNB Chain, Avalanche and Solana, which attracted users with lower fees and faster transactions. Even though competing chains often made compromises regarding decentralization, the fees on Ethereum were high enough that many users were willing to take the trade-off.\n\nOne of the main ways in which developers are approaching Ethereum scalability is by creating layer 2 platforms that leverage the security of the highly decentralized Ethereum network while performing some operations off-chain for increased efficiency.\n\nSo far, most Ethereum layer 2s have been using optimistic rollups technology\u2014this category includes the likes of Optimism, Arbitrum and Boba Network. However, there are also layer 2 projects based on zero-knowledge rollup technology, which is more difficult to implement but could deliver much bigger efficiency improvements. Some examples of such projects include ZKSync, Scroll and Polygon zkEVM.\n\nThere\u2019s also efforts on the Ethereum base layer to improve scalability. For example, the EIP-4844 proposal, also known as \u201cProto-Danksharding\u201d, seeks to made it cheaper for rollup-based layer 2s to add data to Ethereum blocks.\n\nEthereum\u2019s successful move to Proof-of-Stake and reduced ETH issuance\n\nIn September 2022, Ethereum moved away from its previous Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism and adopted Proof-of-Stake. This did not only make Ethereum much more friendly to the environment, but has also made ETH a better investment.\n\nThe reason why the transition to Proof-of-Stake has made ETH a better long-term hold is that the new Proof-of-Stake system needs to issue much fewer ETH to sustain itself.\n\nWhen Ethereum had Proof-of-Work consensus, the protocol had to issue around 13,000 ETH daily in order to reward miners. Meanwhile, only about 1,600 ETH needs to be issued per day to compensate stakers in the new Proof-of-Stake system.\n\nCombined with the previously introduced EIP-1559 upgrade, the transition to Proof-of-Stake is providing deflationary pressure to the supply of ETH. According to ETH supply tracker ultrasound.money, the supply of ETH has decreased by 83,989 ETH since the upgrade to Proof-of-Stake. If Ethereum were still using Proof-of-Work, the supply would have increased by 2.34 million ETH in the same time period.\n\nEthereum is firmly positioned at the top of the smart contracts sector\n\nEthereum has established itself as a center of innovation in the crypto and blockchain space, as major developments like decentralized finance and non-fungible tokens were initially popularized on Ethereum before other blockchain projects also came on board.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum represents close to 60% of the decentralized finance ecosystem in terms of Total Value Locked (TVL), according to DeFi aggregator DeFiLlama. Ethereum-based rollups have also seen traction in DeFi, with Arbitrum ranking as the 4th largest DeFi platform and Optimism taking 6th place.\n\nAnother measure of Ethereum\u2019s dominance is the amount that users are willing to pay in fees in order to transact on the Ethereum network. According to cryptofees.info, the Ethereum network has collected $5.8 million in daily fees on average over the last 7 days. The next closest blockchain, Bitcoin, has collected about $750,000 in daily fees in the same time period.\n\nIf we are going to see another cryptocurrency bull market, it\u2019s likely that Ethereum will be one of its biggest beneficiaries.\n\nEthereum has already established a dominant position in the smart contracts sector, and has a development community and ecosystem that\u2019s unmatched in the crypto and blockchain space. With the rapid improvements we\u2019re seeing in Ethereum layer 2s, Ethereum is poised to offer sufficient scalability for the next generation of decentralized protocols.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth highlighting that ETH gained a lot of strength against BTC in the 2021 bull market, and the ETH/BTC pair has kept most of its gains even during the crypto bear market.\n\nEthereum 2023 price prediction\n\nNow that we\u2019ve taken a look at the most important fundamental factors that could help Ethereum\u2019s recovery, let\u2019s check out what the price prediction algorithm is suggesting in terms of ETH price action.\n\nCurrently, the ETH price prediction for 2023 is forecasting that the price of Ethereum will drop in June and July of 2023, although it is not predicting new lows in the Ethereum market. Per the prediction, the lowest price ETH will reach in 2023 is around $1,050.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ethereum price prediction on CoinCodex is a lot more optimistic over a longer time period, and is even predicting that ETH will break new all-time highs and approach the $10,000 mark in 2024.\n\nOf course, making a prediction becomes increasingly difficult the further into the future the algorithm is trying to forecast, so it\u2019s important to keep in mind that these projections are based on past price performance and current technical indicators.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to say for sure whether ETH will go back up, but we can safely say that Ethereum\u2019s chances are as good as any other cryptocurrency\u2019s.\n\nIn the coming months and years, Ethereum is expected to see significant improvements in scalability, which will allow it to serve a larger number of users in the next cryptocurrency bull run.\n\nEthereum is also likely to be at the center of any major innovations in the blockchain space, as it\u2019s the most obvious place to build blockchain-based applications thanks to its strong ecosystem of developers and development tools.\n\nETH could also be one of the best cryptocurrencies to hold over the long term due to the deflationary pressure introduced by the transition to Proof-of-Stake and the EIP-1559 upgrade. In addition, Ethereum staking provides an extra incentive for users to hold on to their ETH."

        "title": "When levees break, liquidity flows \u2014 Analyzing Ethereum Shapella and liquidity staking derivatives - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The Ethereum network\u2019s planned Shanghai hard fork is nearly here. Planned for April 12, this is the first major upgrade since the Merge in September 2022. The \u201cShapella\u201d upgrade (a combination of the two major proposals, Shanghai and Capella), includes EIP-4895, which enables validators to withdraw staked ETH from the Beacon Chain (Consensus layer) to the EVM (execution layer). The execution layer is the fun and friendly Ethereum thausers have come to know and love.\n\nWhy is this a big deal? With just over 18 million ETH currently staked (valued at just over $33 billion at the time of writing), some of which has been locked up for years, the possibility of these tokens flooding an already teetering market is enough to get some holders ready to sell the news once withdrawals are enabled.\n\nFor holders who are both long and short ETH post-withdrawals, it\u2019s likely to be a significant event, and on-chain activity suggests many feel the same: activity around liquid staking derivatives (LSDs) can be a useful gauge for what the market might do post-unlock.\n\nLiquid Staking Derivatives could exert influence over Beacon Chain unlocks\n\nWhat are liquid staking derivatives? They are a relatively new financial instrument born of DeFi that functions like bearer instruments for staked ETH. Similar to how borrowing and lending protocols give users a share token to represent locked collateral (think Aave\u2019s a-tokens), staking ETH generates a wrapped asset used to claim the equivalent amount of Ethereum from the staking platform. When a staker deposits ETH with major platforms like Lido, Rocket Pool, Frax, Stakewise and now Coinbase, they receive a platform-specific flavor of LSD. Because staked tokens are illiquid, these wrapped assets allow stakers to continue earning rewards while securing the network without completely giving up the opportunity to participate in other activities within DeFi.\n\nLiquid staking derivatives aim to solve these problems by allowing staked assets to be traded on secondary markets. This means that stakers could access the value of their staked ETH before the Shanghai upgrade enables withdrawals or, in the future, while maintaining their staked position. For example, a staker could use their wrapped ETH as collateral on another platform, or cover an unexpected expense by selling their LSD on a secondary market.\n\nRocket Pool, Lido, Coinbase and Frax\n\nThough the markets have seen what seems to be an increasing string of green days, with Ethereum rapidly catching up to Bitcoin\u2019s year-to-date performance, ETH's gains are set against a backdrop of volatility among LSDs and staking tokens.\n\nLido\u2019s LDO hasn\u2019t recaptured its high from early March and has maintained a resistance at $2.75. The largest staking protocol by nearly an order of magnitude, Lido currently offers some of the highest staking rewards among major providers, with an average APY around 10%. The high rewards are no surprise: Lido took in nearly 50 million ETH in fees and 5 million in revenue in March, with April on track to meet or exceed those numbers.\n\nLDO versus ETH price. Source: TradingView\n\nRocket Pool\u2019s RPL fared much better, with a 25% increase over the last thirty days. The wrapped asset issued by the number three staking provider by TVL, rETH, has historically traded at a premium to ETH and other LSDs, likely a result of the provider\u2019s reputation as the most decentralized staking solution available to holders today, making rETH a desirable LSD to hold.\n\nOver the last thirty days, Rocket Pool has seen over $46 million in inflows, with many likely hoping to cash in on rETH\u2019s premium when withdrawals are enabled. Rocket Pool\u2019s average APY according to DeFiLlama is around 3.65%, which isn\u2019t as high as other providers, but with over 1,800 active Rocket Pool nodes, the decentralized nature of the protocol is attractive. Addresses holding RPL have been steadily increasing as well.\n\nConversely, LSDs from the two top staking providers, Lido and Coinbase, both trade at a discount to spot ETH. Together representing nearly 90% of all staked ETH, it\u2019s unsurprising that Lido and Coinbase have both come under scrutiny as centralizing entities given their concentration of staked ETH.\n\nEthereum LSD providers share of staked ETH. Source: DeFiLlama\n\nDespite RPL\u2019s impressive performance and StakeWise\u2019s native token SWISE\u2019s 15% gain, Frax seems to have come out as the winner.\n\nFrax Ether has seen the most significant jump in total value locked over the last 30 days compared to the other top 10 staking providers at 14% growth for a $244 million valuation. Despite the increase in TVL, Frax totaled only $3.1 million in inflow over thirty days, putting the protocol just above StakeWise\u2019s $2.6 million.\n\nTotal value locked in Frax. Source: DeFiLlama\n\nLiquid staking derivatives like the wrapped Ether offered by staking providers is an important part of the Ethereum ecosystem much like plasma is an essential part of human blood. DeFi, NFT trading and GameFi are all interlinked, sometimes more subtly than others.\n\nLSDs perform an important function of maintaining liquidity within the Ethereum ecosystem. Currently, over 15% of all Ether that exists is staked with a Beacon Chain validator (meaning this doesn\u2019t include any ETH being used as collateral on borrowing/lending platforms).\n\nConsidering that a non-trivial amount of that ETH has been locked for years, through one of the toughest bear markets on top of that, indefinitely freezing this much capital (worth over $33 billion at the time of writing) would have a lasting and noticeable effect on the entire ecosystem.\n\nOver the last 30 days though, trying to hedge against the chaos post-Shapella by holding unstaked ETH didn\u2019t perform much better than holding an LSD: ETH is up 31% compared to stETH\u2019s 30%, rETH\u2019s 30%, while Coinbase\u2019s cbETH is up 32% and Frax\u2019s LSD is up 34%.\n\nOverall, liquid staking derivatives are an important development in the staking ecosystem, as they help to address some of the challenges associated with staking, while also expanding the pool of potential participants in the ecosystem.\n\nRelated: Ethereum traders show uncertainty ahead of April 12\u2019s Shapella hard fork: Report\n\nWithdrawals being enabled for staked Ethereum on the Beacon Chain means that proof-of-stake Ethereum has reached a point of sufficient stability and security, and the stakers who participated in securing the network will be able to retrieve their staked funds.\n\nRegardless of the immediate impact of enabled withdrawals, proof-of-stake Ethereum\u2019s continued success relies on incentivizing ETH holders to validate the network, and liquid staking derivatives have proven to be an effective mechanism to do so.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Personal finance author and investor Ric Edelman has outlined his top strategy for navigating the digital asset markets.\n\nEdelman, who is also the founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals (DACFP), says in a new Real Vision interview that he\u2019s currently \u201coverweight\u201d in his exposure to crypto.\n\nThe investor says that many investors, especially those new to the space, could be better off just sticking to Bitcoin and Ethereum. He says he currently has more ETH than BTC due to his belief that ETH may offer more use cases to the commercial world.\n\n\u201cI will tell you what I generally recommend to folks, what your crypto allocation ought to be. Number one, just Bitcoin. It\u2019s the biggest, it\u2019s the oldest, it\u2019ll be the last man standing if it does blow up. Number two, Ethereum, the second biggest coin which has, I believe, a greater level of commercial application than Bitcoin. I personally own more Ethereum than Bitcoin, but not by much because the two are a big deal.\n\nYou could build a portfolio of just those two, Bitcoin and Ethereum. Together, they represent 70% of the total crypto market. They\u2019re the Coke and Pepsi of crypto. Just do the two of them and call it a day.\u201d\n\nEdelman is also a fan and investor of the Bitwise Top 10 Crypto Index Trust (BITW) which aims to track a basket of the 10 biggest digital assets.\n\n\u201cThird, if you want to be more diversified, I\u2019m a big fan of the Bitwise Top 10 Crypto Index trust, which is a grantor trust, there\u2019s a lot of detail to how these things work. I\u2019m an investor in Bitwise [and] a big fan of the company.\n\nThey call it the S&P500 (Standard and Poor\u2019s 500) of crypto, it\u2019s the top ten coins market cap weighted. So Bitcoin and Ethereum represent 70% of the fund, and then you got eight other coins that represent the fast growers, because the biggest won\u2019t necessarily be the fastest growers.\u201d\n\nO\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nCheck Price Action\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nSurf The Daily Hodl Mix\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The imminent unlock has led to speculation about the potential impact on the cryptocurrency market, especially considering that much of the locked volume is already liquid due to staking liquidity providers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStaking liquidity providers have been issuing liquid tokens in exchange for locking Ethereum in contracts, allowing investors to access and trade their staked assets without needing to wait for the unlocking event. This has created a situation where a significant portion of the locked, staked Ethereum is already circulating on the market, potentially reducing the immediate impact of the $34 billion unlock.\n\nEthereum is about to finalize its transition to proof of stake with the upcoming #Shapella fork.

How will the price react? pic.twitter.com/IyOm38kAdE \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) April 10, 2023\n\nHowever, it is still uncertain how the market will react to the unlocking event, as some investors may choose to sell their newly accessible Ethereum holdings, potentially putting downward pressure on the price. Others may decide to hold onto their Ethereum, anticipating further price appreciation as the network continues to evolve and improve with the transition to PoS.\n\nThe shift to a PoS consensus mechanism is expected to make Ethereum more energy-efficient, scalable and secure. This could result in increased demand for the cryptocurrency, as more developers and users are drawn to its improved capabilities. In the long term, the successful implementation of PoS could bolster Ethereum's position as the leading smart contract platform, driving further adoption and demand for the digital asset.\n\nAs more Ethereum is staked and withdrawn from contracts, the supply-demand dynamics could shift, potentially leading to an increase in the value of the asset."

        "content": "The Shanghai upgrade will unlock millions of ETH currently being staked.\n\nNot all locked ETH will be unlocked at the same time.\n\nShapella also consists of smaller upgrades that will go live on Wednesday.\n\nEthereum (ETH), the most used blockchain in the industry, will undergo a historical upgrade to its network in a few hours. The Shanghai upgrade is set to enable ETH staking withdrawals and permanently move Ethereum to the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.\n\nHowever, not everyone understands what this upgrade actually means. Let\u2019s look at the Shanghai upgrade and its implications for Ethereum and its users.\n\nWhat is Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai Upgrade?\n\nEthereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade is a hard fork of the Ethereum blockchain that will take place on April 12 at 11:27 PM UTC. The Shanghai upgrade will come bundled with Capella, another upgrade. The two upgrades, known as Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIP), are called Shapella.\n\nIt's happening \ud83c\udf8a\n\n\n\nShapella is scheduled on mainnet for epoch 194048, scheduled for 22:27:35 UTC on Apr. 12, 2023 \ud83d\udcc6\n\n\n\nClient releases compatible with the upgrade are listed in the announcement below \ud83d\udc47https://t.co/I0hSv9lnjz \u2014 timbeiko.eth \u2600\ufe0f (@TimBeiko) March 28, 2023\n\nThe Shapella upgrade is known chiefly for enabling ETH staking withdrawals. Until today, Ethereum users had to deposit and lock 32 ETH to become validators and help secure the Ethereum network.\n\nWith the Shanghai fork, also known as EIP-4895, validators can finally withdraw their staked ETH for the first time since 2020. There are currently over 18.1 million ETH, worth $34 billion at the time of writing, locked in the Beacon Chain deposit contract.\n\nDoes this mean that all 18.1 million ETH will be available for withdrawal immediately? No, validators will be able to withdraw only 43,000 ETH per day, potentially limiting the impact on ETH\u2019s price.\n\nOther Upgrades Inside Shapella\n\nWhile EIP-4895 is the most known upgrade within Shapella, there are other minor upgrades that the Shapella fork will bring.\n\nOne of them is EIP-3651, aimed at lowering gas costs related to Maximal Extractable value (MEV) payments when accessing the COINBASE address (COINBASE doesn\u2019t refer here to the crypto exchange but to a piece of software that allows developers to receive new tokens).\n\nAnother upgrade is EIP-3855. This upgrade introduces a new instruction PUSH0, which lowers gas costs for developers. EIP-3860 limits developer gas costs in specific cases, and EIP-6049, deprecates the SELFDESTRUCT opcode to limit gas costs.\n\nThe Shapella upgrade will take place on April 12 at 11:27 PM UTC. Readers can watch it live on YouTube and follow it on social media platforms like Twitter.\n\nShapella Watch Party\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nNo one knows exactly how the price of ETH will react to ETH staking withdrawals being enabled.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nEthereum\u2019s Shanghai/Shapella upgrade is one of the biggest upgrades in recent years. Ethereum validators will finally be able to withdraw their staked ETH. If the event negatively impacts the price, investors can scoop up some cheap ETH.\n\nRead more about ETH staking withdrawals:\n\nEthereum Staked ETH Withdrawals Coming Next Week: What It Means for You\n\nRead more about the rising NFT sales on Polygon:\n\nPolygon NFT Sales Surpass Solana, Now Trail Only Ethereum"

It completed the transition last September following the \"merge,\" an upgrade that combined the Ethereum mainnet with the proof-of-stake beacon chain.\n\nUsers who've staked their Ethereum, however, haven't been able to withdraw their initial deposits or rewards. But all that changes later today.\n\nGlassnode researchers today stated in a report that of the newly unlocked sum, approximately 70,000 ETH will come from validators exiting the network, pulling their staked holdings with them. The report indicates that there are 253 depositors waiting to do precisely this, but analysts added that \"withdrawals are most likely related to a change in their technical setup, rather than exiting their position.\"\n\nThe remaining 100,000 ETH is expected to come from users withdrawing their staking rewards to sell on the market. Glassnode analysts said they only expect roughly $133 million worth of ETH to \"actually become liquid\" following the activation of withdrawals.\n\nProof-of-stake networks work by having validators secure the network, as opposed to miners on proof-of-work blockchains like Bitcoin. Anyone can become a validator on Ethereum by staking 32 ETH (roughly $60,000) and begin earning rewards for doing so. If a validator acts maliciously, they face a penalty known as \"slashing\" that deducts ETH from their staked sum.\n\nDespite projecting upwards of $326 million in Ethereum potentially hitting the market, Glassnode's report concludes that the move \"is expected to be a lot less dramatic than many have painted it to be,\" adding that should the Shanghai upgrade go off without a hitch, it \"will bolster a growing staking industry.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's also worth noting that withdrawal requests will enter a queue, and not all withdrawal requests will be processed on day one. Individual stakers may have to wait at least two or three days before receiving their funds, and stakers making use of pooling services such as Lido or centralized providers like Coinbase might need to wait weeks if not months. This means that any ETH being withdrawn from the staking contract won't hit the market all at once.\n\nWho's selling staked Ethereum?\n\nOther analysts, including CoinShares research associate Marc Arjoon, agree that the effects of Shanghai on the Ethereum market will likely be muted in the short term.\n\nArjoon told Decrypt that this has a lot do with liquid staking solutions such as Lido Finance\n\nThough withdrawals for Lido Finance are also contingent on withdrawals on Ethereum also becoming available, users have been able to swap their staked Ethereum tokens (stETH) for ETH on exchanges like Curve Finance.\n\nWhen depositing Ethereum on a liquid staking platform, users get an equivalent staked version of Ethereum that can be used elsewhere in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi), such us non-custodial lending and trading platforms.\n\nWhy Ethereum Bulls Are Turning to LSD\n\n\"If those takers wanted to exit the market, they could simply sell their tokens on the secondary market for a one-to-one ratio,\" he told Decrypt.\n\nArjoon also believes that many of the \"tech-savvy\" stakers who have the 32 ETH needed to become validators are unlikely to sell their stashes.\n\n\"They decided to stake their ETH with an indefinite lockup period, and that's likely because they believe in using ETH as a store of value,\" said Arjoon. \"That\u2019s why I also think that that cohort majority is unlikely to sell.\u201d\n\nSo who's dumping their staked ETH? \"Different entities like businesses, colleges, and other things that just can't be identified using the [wallet] addresses,\" are the most likely to sell, said Arjoon. \"To be conservative, I would say that 50% of those entities would withdraw and sell their ETH.\"\n\nThe views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice."

        "content": "Ethereum price started a downside correction from the $1,940 zone against the US Dollar. ETH might revisit the key $1,840 support in the near term.\n\nEthereum failed to clear the $1,925 and $1,940 resistance levels.\n\nThe price is trading below $1,880 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $1,870 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could further lower but the bulls might be active near the $1,840 support.\n\nEthereum Price Corrects Lower\n\nEthereum\u2019s price attempted more upsides above the $1,925 and $1,940 resistance levels. However, ETH struggled to settle above the $1,925 resistance zone, similar to Bitcoin.\n\nAs a result, there was a bearish reaction below the $1,900 level. The bears were able to push the price below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,850 swing low to the $1,938 high. Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $1,870 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nEther price is now trading below $1,880 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. It is also showing a few bearish signs below the $1,865 support.\n\nIf there is a recovery wave, the price might face resistance near $1,880 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The next major resistance is near the $1,900 zone. The main resistance is now forming near the $1,925 and $1,940 levels.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nA close above the $1,925 level with a follow-up move above $1,940 might send the price toward the $2,000 resistance. The next major resistance might be $2,120. Any more gains could set the pace for a test of the $2,200 resistance.\n\nMore Losses in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,880 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,850 level or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,850 swing low to the $1,938 high.\n\nThe next major support is near the $1,840 zone, below which ether price might decline toward the $1,825 level. If there is a break below $1,825, the price might extend its decline toward $1,780.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is now gaining momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 60 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,840\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,880\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

The medium-term trend for Ethereum has been bullish, with ETH increasing by 43.99% in the last 3 months. The long-term picture for Ethereum has been negative, as ETH is currently displaying a -39.74% 1-year price change. On this day last year, ETH was trading at $ 3,181.03.\n\nEthereum reached its all-time high price on Nov 10, 2021, when the price of ETH peaked at $ 4,867.17.

This results in an overall Bullish sentiment for Ethereum.\n\nCrypto market is currently experiencing Greed\n\nCurrently, the Fear & Greed index is at 68 (Greed), which signals that investors have a positive outlook on the market. The Fear & Greed index is a measure of sentiment among cryptocurrency investors. A \u201cGreed\u201d reading suggests that investors are currently optimistic about the cryptocurrency market, but can also be an indication that the market is overvalued. A \u201cFear\u201d reading, on the other hand, signals that investors are currently hesitant about the cryptocurrency market, which potentially represents a buying opportunity.\n\nEthereum moving averages & oscillators\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at what some of the most important technical indicators are signaling. We\u2019ll be going through key moving averages and oscillators that will allow us to get a better idea of how Ethereum is positioned in the market right now.\n\nPeriod Daily Simple Daily Exponential Weekly Simple Weekly Exponential MA3 $ 1,869.81 (BUY) $ 1,908.19 (BUY) - - MA5 $ 1,867.63 (BUY) $ 1,881.86 (BUY) - - MA10 $ 1,853.27 (BUY) $ 1,860.58 (BUY) - - MA21 $ 1,811.93 (BUY) $ 1,818.06 (BUY) $ 1,495.93 (BUY) $ 1,616.17 (BUY) MA50 $ 1,703.47 (BUY) $ 1,732.82 (BUY) $ 1,552.97 (BUY) $ 1,723.73 (BUY) MA100 $ 1,615.95 (BUY) $ 1,638.67 (BUY) $ 2,364.91 (SELL) $ 1,836.91 (BUY) MA200 $ 1,460.29 (BUY) $ 1,608.62 (BUY) $ 1,474.06 (BUY) $ 1,585.49 (BUY)\n\nPeriod Value Action RSI (14) 63.10 NEUTRAL Stoch RSI (14) 63.84 NEUTRAL Stochastic Fast (14) 69.60 NEUTRAL Commodity Channel Index (20) 66.67 NEUTRAL Average Directional Index (14) 24.40 NEUTRAL Awesome Oscillator (5, 34) 136.94 NEUTRAL Momentum (10) 65.49 NEUTRAL MACD (12, 26) -0.21 NEUTRAL Williams Percent Range (14) -30.40 NEUTRAL Ultimate Oscillator (7, 14, 28) 55.77 NEUTRAL VWMA (10) 1,842.74 BUY Hull Moving Average (9) 1,901.75 SELL Ichimoku Cloud B/L (9, 26, 52, 26) 1,770.42 NEUTRAL\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI 14) is a widely used indicator that helps inform investors whether an asset is currently overbought or oversold. The RSI 14 for Ethereum is at 63.10, suggesting that ETH is currently neutral.\n\nThe 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA 50) takes into account the closing price of Ethereum over the last 50 days. Currently, Ethereum is trading below the SMA 50 trendline, which is a bearish signal.\n\nMeanwhile, the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA 200) is a long-term trendline that\u2019s calculated by taking an average of the ETH closing price for the last 200 days. ETH is now trading below the SMA 200, signaling that the market is currently bearish.\n\nThe bottom line about this Ethereum prediction\n\nAfter considering the above factors, we can conclude that the current forecast for Ethereum price prediction is Bullish. ETH would have to increase by 14.08% to hit our $ 2,186.82 target within the next five days. Moving forward, it will be important to monitor the ETH market sentiment, the key support and resistance levels, and other metrics. However, we have to keep in mind that the cryptocurrency markets are unpredictable, and even the largest crypto assets display a lot of price volatility.

        "content": "web3/ Unsplash\n\nEthereum's Shanghai Upgrade is fast approaching with an expected implementation set for tomorrow. And users of the network are anticipating what the upgrade\u2019s effect on the network will be. Concerns are beginning to circulate that with excitement of tokens being unlocked could create a cascade of sell action, which would result in the price of ETH falling.\n\nThe great unstaking\n\nWhile there are concerns, experts in the space are suggesting that we are unlikely to see a mass sell off. This is in part due to the fact that unstaking of Ethereum will take time to be processed \u2013 with the length of delay varying from 5 days to 4 months depending on the amount being withdrawn.\n\nThis might prevent to some extent a large portion of ETH being unstaked and sold at the same time. Additionally, ETH is still trading significantly below its market highs, so the incentive to immediately sell the ETH-based profits of staking is further diminished.\n\nA long time coming\n\nThe withdrawal of staked ETH is one of the most highly anticipated events in the crypto industry at the moment. And with more than 18m ETH staked since its Beacon Chain went live, the implications of the change for the network could be substantial.\n\nSome exchanges such as Kraken have also been coming under increasing regulatory scrutiny for their offering of staking services, as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) believes that in some instances they could be considered securities."

        "content": "A widely followed crypto strategist is warning that Ethereum (ETH) rival Polkadot (DOT) has one big fundamental weakness.\n\nThe anonymous host of InvestAnswers tells his 443,000 YouTube subscribers in a new strategy session that a lot of development is happening within the ecosystem of the interoperability protocol.\n\nHowever, he says Polkadot is experiencing a lack of adoption, which he notes is an ominous sign for any blockchain project.\n\n\u201cPolkadot has an incredibly good [development] score when compared to the rest. But adoption is in the toilet. It has flatlined again, along with many others. It is critical, absolutely critical, for a chain like a mall to have customers. You can have the best technology in the world, but if it\u2019s not adopted. you\u2019re wasting your time. And that is the predicament that Polkadot is in right now.\n\nAgain, really good tokenomics, not too good of a SCP (smart contract platform) score for many different reasons. And here, adoption is nowhere to be seen\u2026\n\nA quick and dirty summary here: the tokenomics are solid, development score is solid, SCP is number 10 out of 20 \u2013 beyond the top 20 they are just ghost chains that\u2019ll never go anywhere. And the real issue is adoption.\u201d\n\nAccording to the crypto strategist, Polkadot could solve its adoption issue overnight if the blockchain develops a killer use case that attracts millions of new users.\n\n\u201cCrypto is not loyal. And we\u2019ve seen how some chains will gradually wither away. But some can explode and flourish unexpectedly. I don\u2019t know if Polkadot is going to be one of those. I don\u2019t know if some of their sub-chains will be very successful. We can\u2019t tell. But what I have seen is users are fickle. And if they have a value proposition product market fit that\u2019s second to none, millions of users could go overnight.\u201d\n\nPolkadot is trading for $6.31 at time of writing, up 1.7% in the past 24 hours.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "ETH Battles With $1.9K as Shanghai Upgrade Looms (Ethereum Price Analysis) - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "In recent months, Ethereum has experienced a significant surge in price, surpassing multiple resistance levels. However, the bullish momentum appears to be fading, and the cryptocurrency is currently having difficulty in continuing its upward trend. As of now, ETH is struggling to maintain its position and surpass a significant resistance region.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nIn March 2023, Ethereum\u2019s price saw a significant rally when it found support at the 200-day moving average of $1.4K. However, as the price approached the crucial resistance level of $2K, the bullish momentum began to wane.\n\nBecause of that, the strength of the $2K resistance zone, and the divergence between the price and the RSI indicator, ETH seems more likely to enter a consolidation correction zone soon. It\u2019s essential to keep a close eye on the RSI indicator, as it\u2019s nearing the overbought zone, which could increase the chances of a correction or reversal.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nThe rally came to a halt when it reached the upper trendline of the ascending channel in the 4-hour timeframe. Although the price tried to surpass the trendline a second time, it was rejected, leading to a slight drop. If the cryptocurrency manages to break through the $2K resistance region and the upper threshold of the channel, it could spark a bullish rally toward the next resistance level.\n\nHowever, if the price declines, the mid-boundary of the channel and the $1.7K level will serve as crucial support zones. Notably, ETH has formed a double-top price action pattern at the $2K resistance region, confirming the bearish scenario.\n\nOn-chain Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nEthereum\u2019s price has increased in recent months, approaching the $2,000 level. While some investors are optimistic that the bear market is ending, the futures market shows a concerning signal.\n\nThis chart displays the Taker Buy Sell ratio for Ethereum, which determines whether the bulls or the bears are executing their orders more aggressively and helps forecast short-term market movements. Positive values are considered bullish, while negative ones are interpreted as bearish.\n\nCurrently, the Taker Buy Sell ratio has been consistently decreasing and has fallen below zero. This suggests that a pullback or even a reversal in Ethereum\u2019s value may occur in the following weeks. It is important to monitor this metric closely as it provides valuable insights for the short term."

        "content": "Shanghai-Capella upgrade to Ethereum blockchain continues shift away from energy-intensive \u2018mining\u2019 system to \u2018proof of stake\u2019\n\nThe price of the Ether token rose about 3 percent in early trading on Tuesday ahead of a planned major upgrade of the Ethereum blockchain on Wednesday.\n\nThe so-called Shanghai-Capella or \u201cShapella\u201d hard fork is designed to give investors access to more than $30 billion (\u00a325bn) of Ether that has been \u201cstaked\u201d or pledged on the blockchain since December 2020.\n\nThe system introduced in 2020 allowed investors to stake or deposit Ether tokens on the blockchain in exchange for interest.\n\nAbout 15 percent of all Ether is staked, amounting to more than $30 billion in market value, according to Dune Analytics.\n\nWithdrawals\n\nThe latest upgrade follows last September\u2019s overhaul called the \u201cMerge\u201d, which replaced the blockchain\u2019s formerly energy-intensive proof-of-work system for verifying transactions with a proof-of-stake system, paving the way for Shanghai.\n\nWednesday\u2019s upgrade unlocks some 18 million Ether, but only partial withdrawals of 1.1 million \u2013 the coins earned as staking rewards \u2013 will be immediately available to withdraw.\n\nThe partial withdrawals will take several days to process, meaning they are unlikley to place selling strain on the market, industry analysts have said.\n\n\u201cIf all partial withdrawals are attempted just after the Shapella fork (which seems highly improbable), it would take around four and a half days for these ETH profits to enter the market,\u201d said IntoTheBlock head of research Lucas Outumuro in a Friday research note.\n\nSEC scrutiny\n\nThe availability of staking withdrawals is expected to make Ether more attractive to investors in the long run.\n\nBut regulatory issues may pose a concern for Ether, with the US Securities and Exchange Commission warning in recent months that it considers staking services offered by centralised exchanges to be an illegal sale of securities.\n\nRegulators have increasingly cracked down on cryptocurrencies this year, following a string of collapses of major crypto organisations in 2022, including that of the TerraUSD token and the exchange FTX.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade completes the migration away from the energy-intensive proof-of-work system, posting questions for Bitcoin, which has remained with the older system.\n\nAlex de Vries, a data scientist at De Nederlandsche Bank, has estimated that the Merge reduced Ethereum\u2019s energy consumption by at least 99.84 percent."

What the Shapella update means for Ethereum, and the next steps on the blockchain\u2019s roadmap. \uec24 Key cryptoverse quotes. Rep. Tom Emmer\u2019s searing remarks to SEC Chair Gary Gensler during a congressional hearing, and reactions to a new stablecoin bill. \uec24 Noteworthy numbers. The price tag for a pair of digital Air Force 1s, and other key stats from the week.\n\nRAISE THE STAKES\n\nEthereum\u2019s Shapella upgrade was a success. What\u2019s next for the blockchain?\n\nLast Wednesday, Ethereum pulled off its second major upgrade in less than a year, known as Shapella. This latest technical milestone \u2014 following last September\u2019s Merge \u2014 enabled ETH stakers to withdraw locked-up ETH for the first time ever, finalizing the blockchain\u2019s transition to the 99% more energy-efficient Proof-of-Stake (PoS) system for verifying transactions. But Ethereum still has an extensive roadmap of improvements ahead, including updates that will enhance its scalability, security, and usability.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of how ETH\u2019s price reacted to Shapella and what\u2019s coming next on its roadmap.\n\nHow has ETH\u2019s price responded since the upgrade?\n\nIn the days since the upgrade, ETH has risen roughly 10%, hovering above $2,000 for the first time since May 2022. This came as a surprise to some analysts who believed that ETH was going to face major selling pressure after the upgrade, due to pent-up demand for withdrawals; ETH staking was first introduced in December 2020, and more than $32 billion was locked up before Shapella went live.\n\nWhy hasn\u2019t there been a surge of ETH withdrawals?\n\nLess than 5% of the total staked ETH has been withdrawn since April 12. Stakers are potentially staying put for a significant, yet simple, reason: about half of the nearly 18 million staked ETH is operating at a loss and holders are likely hesitant to withdraw and sell in the red.\n\nExcessive sell pressure and withdrawals were also constrained by limits on how many withdrawals can be processed by Ethereum\u2019s network at a time. Currently, 800,000 withdrawals can be processed per week. Additionally, staked ETH is just 15% of ETH\u2019s circulating supply, compared to a 60% average for other PoS networks, leading some to believe there will actually be a surge in staking, not withdrawals.\n\nWhat\u2019s coming up on ETH\u2019s roadmap?\n\nThe final transition to PoS is just the first of many post-Merge network improvements that aim to make Ethereum more usable and scalable. Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin has outlined several of the blockchain\u2019s next (rhyming) phases:\n\nThe Surge, tentatively scheduled for late 2023 or early 2024, will increase Ethereum\u2019s scalability through a practice called \u201cdanksharding,\u201d which essentially divides large pieces of data into smaller ones, allowing more transactions to be processed. Buterin\u2019s goal is for Ethereum to be able to process 100,000 transactions per second, up from about 30 right now.\n\nThe Scourge is the most recent addition to the roadmap, and it involves improvements that would prevent censorship of transactions and exploitative bot-driven trading. Both are seen as centralization risks for Ethereum, which is a decentralized network.\n\nThe Verge refers to technical upgrades that will allow users to become network validators \u2014 computers responsible for verifying ETH transactions \u2014 without having to store massive amounts of data.\n\nThe Purge will remove old network history to ease bottlenecks and further reduce the amount of hard drive space required for validators. This means that services like Etherscan, which makes it easy to access historical data on the network, will be expected to take on the responsibility of storing older data.\n\nWhy it matters\u2026 The second major network upgrade in less than a year is a monumental accomplishment for Ethereum, especially after years of delays leading up to the Merge. Now, all eyes will turn to whether the forthcoming upgrades can fulfill Vitalik Buterin\u2019s vision of Ethereum as a \u201cfully scaled, maximally resilient platform.\u201d\n\nTAKES\n\nGary Gensler gets grilled, Shaq gets served, and more notable quotes from the cryptoverse\n\nHot seat\u2026 \u201cSEC rules make no sense for blockchain companies. You've been an incompetent cop on the beat,\" said Rep. Tom Emmer (R-MN) to SEC Chair Gary Gensler during a tense hearing held by the U.S. House Financial Services Committee about the SEC\u2019s strategy of regulating crypto via enforcement. Crypto proponents in Congress were especially critical of Gensler for supposedly operating outside the regulatory authority of the SEC in the absence of a comprehensive crypto regulatory bill.\n\nSaga genesis... \u201cI can\u2019t remember the last time I went to anything but a phone \u2026.everything I do, I start with my phone, except for web3,\u201d was how the lead software engineer at Solana Mobile explained one of the core use cases for the Solana Saga, a new Android phone from Solana Labs which comes integrated with web3 functionality.

O\u2019Neal, who is named in the suit alongside A-listers like Tom Brady and Larry David, was finally reached this week after what the plaintiff\u2019s lawyer alleged was \u201cmonths of running from us.\u201d\n\nNUMBERS TO KNOW\n\n$104 million\n\nThe amount of money investors moved into institutional Bitcoin funds last week, according to a Monday research report from CoinShares.

        "title": "Wanchain: The Best Ethereum Bridge - Altcoin Buzz",
        "content": "This is a guest post from Temujin Louie, VP of Marketing and Growth at Wanchain. All opinions shared here are his.\n\nUndoubtedly Ethereum is one of the most important blockchain networks in the world. Ethereum continues to play a significant role in shaping the future of the industry. It\u2019s known as the birthplace of smart contracts and decentralised applications. In fact, Ethereum remains the de facto choice for many blockchain projects. That\u2019s due to the network\u2019s unmatched developer community and user base.\n\nHowever, Ethereum\u2019s incredible popularity has proven to be a double-edged sword. Ethereum has introduced millions of new users to the potential of Web3. Yet, this unprecedented demand has put pressure on the network\u2019s capacity, resulting in slow transaction times and high fees. This has given rise to several sidechains and Layer 2 networks. Their goal is to lower the Ethereum network\u2019s load by processing transactions off-chain before settling them on-chain. These secondary networks are built on top of the Ethereum blockchain and inherit the mainnet\u2019s security apparatus. Networks like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon.\n\nBridging from ETH to its Layer 2s\n\nArbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon are separate networks that operate independently from Ethereum. You cannot do a direct transfer of ETH and other Ethereum-based assets to these networks without the use of bridges. As such, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon each offer an in-house bridge to Ethereum. Unfortunately, these in-house bridges have several shortcomings that limit their usability. Namely:\n\nThey are slow.\n\nThey are expensive.\n\nAnd they do not allow for transfers between the various Ethereum Sidechains and Layer 2 networks. It\u2019s like driving in a city that only has one-way streets. You can\u2019t go from Arbitrum to Polygon without going through Ethereum first. And it\u2019s not necessary.\n\nArbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon emerged to address Ethereum\u2019s shortcomings. And like them, third parties have also emerged to improve these in-house bridges. The fastest, cheapest, and most secure of these is without doubt Wanchain\u2019s ETH XFlows.\n\nA better way to bridge: ETH XFlows by Wanchain\n\nETH XFlows is a decentralised cross-chain solution that enables native-to-native cross-chain transfers between blockchains. This includes networks that settle transactions on Ethereum. In other words, where native ETH is. It leverages the power of Wanchain\u2019s cross-chain bridges to\n\nprovide fast, easy, and cheap non-custodial ETH transfers between chains\n\nAnd without the need for centralised exchanges or wrapped tokens.\n\nIn other words, when using ETH XFlows to move native ETH between chains, the user always receives native ETH on the destination chain.\n\nETH XFlows is currently live on Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon.\n\nETH XFlows vs in-house bridges\n\nHere is how Wanchain\u2019s ETH XFlows compares to the in-house bridges on speed and cost.\n\nWanchain\u2019s ETH XFlows is the best combination of speed and cost, outperforming the in-house options in every route, all without sacrificing decentralisation.\n\nArbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon\u2019s in-house bridges allow users to move ETH to-and-from Ethereum. But that\u2019s all. They won\u2019t let you connect to the various sidechains and Layer 2 networks. This is understandable as each is motivated to promote the usage of their own Ethereum scalability solution.\n\nWanchain\u2019s ETH XFlows is not bound by these conflicting motivations. Our motivation and design are only to maximize benefits to users. As such, ETH XFlows also supports direct transfers between Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon.\n\nWanchain\u2019s ETH XFlows is the best choice for people looking to move their ETH to, from, and between Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon! It\u2019s fast, cheap, decentralized, and seamless. And Wanchain is non-custodial too. It is the perfect tool to take advantage of the best Web3 opportunities on all networks.\n\nSo why wait?

        "title": "Ethereum 1-Month Realized Volatility Drops To Rare Level Seen Only Thrice In History - NewsBTC",
        "content": "On-chain data shows that Ethereum realized volatility has now declined to rare levels observed only three times before in history.\n\nEthereum 1-Month Realized Volatility Has Plummeted To Just 39.8%\n\nAs per data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the month of December 2022 was historically quiet for both Ethereum and Bitcoin. The \u201crealized volatility\u201d is an indicator that measures the standard deviation of daily returns from the mean for the market in question.\n\nThe indicator is usually taken over a rolling window, with the one-week and one-month versions being generally the most useful timespans for it. In the context of the current discussion, the relevant metric is the one-month realized volatility.\n\nWhen the value of the metric is high, it means the asset\u2019s price has been showing greater fluctuations from the average recently. Such a trend implies that the market is providing a high trading risk currently. On the other hand, low values suggest returns haven\u2019t deviated much from the mean, and hence that the price has been stuck in stale consolidation.\n\nNow, here is a chart that shows the trend in the one-month Ethereum realized volatility over the last few years:\n\nLooks like the value of the metric has declined in recent days | Source: Glassnode on Twitter\n\nAs displayed in the above graph, the Ethereum one-month realized volatility has plunged to just 39.8% recently, suggesting that the past month has had very little diversity in day-to-day returns. This current level of the indicator is actually a historically low value, and as is apparent from the chart, there have only been three instances in the history of the crypto where the price has been this stable.\n\nInterestingly, after each occurrence of the volatility hitting these lows, the price has made a sharp move and the indicator has jumped back up. An important example of this was back in November 2018, when the value of ETH collapsed toward the bottom of the bear market in a sudden move, after the metric had reached these rare levels.\n\nGlassnode also points out that, just like for Ethereum, the one-month realized volatility for Bitcoin has also plunged to historical lows recently, as the below chart highlights.\n\nThe value of the metric seems to have hit very low values recently | Source: Glassnode on Twitter\n\nAs you can see above, the Bitcoin one-month realized volatility has only been lower than the current value (24.6%) a few times in the entire history of the crypto. A notable instance here was also in November 2018, where, just like ETH, BTC crashed down to form its bottom.\n\nIf these historical trends are anything to consider, then the current extremely low values in the one-month volatility for Ethereum and Bitcoin could mean both the cryptos may soon see a significant spike in the metric soon, but the accompanying price move could be toward either direction.\n\nETH Price\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum\u2019s price floats around $1,300, up 8% in the last week.\n\nETH has shot up during the past day | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Kanchanara on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, Glassnode.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Number of New Ethereum Smart Contracts Falls 60% in 2023 - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum prices might be solid, and bulls are looking to drive the coin toward $1,700, but on-chain data points to dropping activity from developers judging from the number of new smart contracts deployed in the first three weeks of January.\n\nNumber Of Smart Contracts Deployed On Ethereum Falling\n\nThe number of new smart contracts deployed over the past few weeks, since the beginning of 2023, has fallen by more than half. The number of new smart contracts deployed on January 1, 2023, stood at 139,699.\n\nHowever, a total of 56,370 smart contracts were deployed on Ethereum on January 23, a solid recovery from the 10,079 figure registered on January 14, but still a long way from its January 1 levels.\n\nThe contraction over the past three weeks represents a 60% drop from January 1 levels, a concern for analysts. Ordinarily, the number of contracts deployed on a smart contract network points to on-chain activity, and the more dApps there are on any frontier, in DeFi, NFTs, gaming, and more, the higher the probability that this activity could spill into price action since ETH, the native token of Ethereum, is used to settle network fees.\n\nWhenever there is a spike in on-chain activity, the demand for block space is higher, requiring developers to use more ETH for a slot in a block.\n\nFalling contracts deployment coincides with the exemplary performance of ETH prices over the month. ETH prices have rallied from $1,200 on January 1 to $1,659 on January 20. Even though bulls are yet to push the coin above $1,700, an immediate resistance level that, if broken, could see ETH prices float to new Q1 2023 highs.\n\nHistory shows a direct correlation between the number of contracts deployed and price action since developers often double down their efforts whenever prices are trending higher, deploying more contracts. This trend is not validated in the performance from early January, considering the divergence between spot prices and the number of contracts launched.\n\nEven though there was a near 5X spike between January 14 and January 23, there could be a significantly higher number of contracts if this action were aligned with ETH prices.\n\nNevertheless, smart contracts on the Ethereum network saw solid growth in 2022. A report by the software firm, Alchemy, showed that over 100,000 dApps were launched in 2022.\n\nTransaction Fees Falling\n\nThe average transaction fee on Ethereum has been on the rise since the beginning of the year, according to data from Cryptoquant. From January 1, fees have more than doubled, rising from $2.92 to $3.99 on January 23.\n\nEven though fees are relatively higher now compared to the start of the year, they are multiples lower than in May 2022 when the average fee to post a simple transfer was $22. Subsequently, deploying smart contracts, depending on their complexity, was multiples higher.\n\nFeature image from Canva, Chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Tron outperforms Ethereum and Polygon on this front but still fails to chart new 2023 highs - FXStreet",
        "content": "Share:\n\nTron has observed significantly higher daily active users; 1.7 million across the chain against the likes of Ethereum, BNB chain and many others.\n\nConsequently, the number of on-chain transactions also exceeds Ethereum by nearly seven times.\n\nTron price is still struggling to observe decent gains, trading at $0.066 even as Bitcoin price crosses $30,000.\n\nTron has established itself as a core Decentralised Finance (DeFi) chain and has also managed to do the unthinkable by surpassing Ethereum in some ways. However, beyond the usage of Tron\u2019s native token, TRX is still struggling to leave a positive mark on the chart.\n\nTron leads in daily active user count\n\nTron has emerged as a capable DeFi chain with over $5.5 billion in total value locked (TVL) across its 17 protocols. In comparison, Arbitrum, with over 280 protocols, has only $3 billion in TVL, while Binance\u2019s BNB Chain has only $6.5 billion locked with nearly 580 protocols.\n\nThe appeal that it generates in the DeFi market has pushed its adoption significantly in the spot market as well. As per analysis, the daily active users on Tron sit at 1.7 million, outshining the likes of Ethereum, BNB chain and Polygon, with each having 317,000, 1.1 million and 387,000 daily active users, respectively.\n\nTron daily active users\n\nHowever, the chain\u2019s exceptional performance is not limited to simply gaining the attention of the users but also to their participation in the network. On-chain data noted that the daily transactions on the network sit at a little over 1 million for Ethereum, while Tron processes close to 7.7 million transactions. But even though the chain usage is garnering the attention and presence of the users, it is not reflected in the asset\u2019s price action.\n\nTron daily transactions\n\nTron\u2019s native token, TRX, in the last three months, has only noted an increase of 17.04% in its price, which is significantly lower in comparison to ETH. The world\u2019s second-biggest cryptocurrency breached the $1,900 mark for the first time in eight months and charted a new year-to-date high following a 43% rally.\n\nTRX/USD 1-day chart\n\nOne reason behind this could be the purpose of the cryptocurrency, which limits its real-world use cases. TRX is used only on the Tron network to pay the content creators, consequently gaining no attention apart from this and trading. Ethereum, on the other hand, is used as a payment system for verifying transactions, justifying its presence and movement on wallets.\n\nMoreover, TRX mostly sits in wallets until a major event occurs, such as the FUD of Tron founder Justin Sun\u2019s arrest in Hong Kong earlier on April 11. Even then, the intra-day trading hours\u2019 volatility was minimal, as noted in the 2% decline of the cryptocurrency.\n\nThus while Tron might be winning in terms of usage, Ethereum is winning in terms of use cases and demand which, at the end of the day, impacts the value of the entire network."

        "content": "The software that underpins the second-biggest crypto coin ether is due for a software upgrade on Wednesday that will give investors access to more than $30 billion of the digital tokens.\n\nKnown as Shapella, the latest upgrade to the Ethereum blockchain will enable investors to redeem an offshoot of ether tokens that they have deposited in return for interest on the blockchain network over the past three years.\n\nSuch so-called \"staked ether\" tokens currently account for about 15 percent of all ether tokens, according to data firm Dune Analytics, and are worth some $31 billion.\n\nThe upgrade is due for around 2230 GMT, according to a tweet by Tim Beiko of the Ethereum Foundation, a body that speaks for the Ethereum network.\n\nThe changes will likely lead to heightened volatility for ether, investors have predicted.\n\nSome believe that widespread redemptions could lead to a wave of selling, in turn weighing on the price of ether, whose market value of about $230 billion is topped only by bitcoin.\n\n\"The release of this previously unrealised investment may lead to significant downward price pressure if it is immediately liquidated,\" Deutsche Bank analysts said in a note.\n\nIn its last significant upgrade, Ethereum in September drastically reduced its energy usage \u2013 a move proponents said would give Ethereum an advantage as it seeks to surpass bitcoin.\n\nBut ether has continued to lag its larger rival, gaining just under 60 percent this year versus a more than 80 percent jump for bitcoin.\n\nAfter trillions of dollars were wiped from the crypto market in a bruising 2022, the sector has rallied in 2023 on expectations that central bank interest rate hikes are slowing.\n\nEthereum has grown popular in so-called decentralised finance applications, which offer financial services while avoiding traditional industry gatekeepers such as banks.\n\nIt remains, however, little used in mainstream commerce or finance.\n\nAlso read: The three recent crypto attacks and hacks that you must know"

He then sold it earlier today on the Uniswap DEX at $79 per each GMX, making 1,696 Ethereum worth $2.26 million in total. His net profit was $214,000.\n\nAs for GNX, he bought it on Binance, paying $8.36 per coin, and now sold them for $6.86.

        "title": "Ethereum is Top Alt-Coin but Others Make for Better Investments. - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) has long been considered the top alt-coin on the market, and for good reason. It\u2019s the second-largest blockchain in the world, behind Bitcoin, and has often performed quite well for investors.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t been the case, though in the last 12 months. In that time period, as of April 6, ETH has dropped 43.68% in value. It has rebounded decently in the last month, bumping up 18.27%. That has brought its total value to $1,868.18.\n\nMany people are wondering whether Ethereum, the top alt-coin, is the best investment. The quick answer is maybe not. Below, we\u2019ll look at a price prediction for Ethereum to see what it\u2019s all about, as well as look at five other alt-coins that could make for much better investments.\n\nThey are Love Hate Inu (LHINU), DeeLance (DLANCE), Metropoly (MET), Ecoterra (ECOTERRA) and RobotEra (TARO), and they\u2019re all currently in presale.\n\n>>>Buy The Best Coin Now<<<\n\nEthereum Price Prediction\n\nBelow is an Ethereum price prediction on where the value could go in the next few years.\n\nYear Expected low Expected high 2023 $1,913.83 $2,201.94 2025 $2,011.77 $3,017.66 2030 $8,640.50 $10,368.60\n\nIf the above price prediction holds true, then Ethereum will gain 51.17% in value between the end of this year and 2025. Then, from 2025 through 2030, it could be expected to gain another 329%, all the way above the $8,600 mark.\n\nThose returns might sound fantastic in the traditional asset market, but in cryptocurrency, they\u2019re not all that impressive. This is especially true of a big crypto like Ethereum. With the volatility it has experienced in recent times, a promise of a little more than 50% by the end of the year isn\u2019t all that encouraging.\n\nInvestors would also have to hold onto their asset for another seven years before they could realize the really big gains above $8,600. That\u2019s an eternity in crypto.\n\nAs such, there are some other alt-coins that are likely much better investments. We detail five of those below.\n\n>>>Buy The Best Coin Now<<<\n\nLove Hate Inu Revolutionizing Online Surveys\n\nThe online survey market is exploding, and Love Hate Inu (LHINU) is set to disrupt it all. Based on the blockchain, the platform is ensuring that all polls will be open and transparent, and won\u2019t be able to be manipulated in any way. Users will have to stake $LHINU tokens to take part, which makes it more legitimate and also allows them to remain anonymous.\n\nThere are loads of growth opportunities for Love Hate Inu, including the possibility for international brands to offer sponsored polls with rewards such as NFT discount codes to those who participate. Love Hate Inu is still in presale but won\u2019t be there for long. Buy now to get the best price.\n\n>>>Buy Love Hate Inu Now!<<<\n\nDeeLance Providing a Better Freelance Platform\n\nFreelancing has become commonplace in today\u2019s work environment, yet the platforms that help connect freelancers with potential employers still aren\u2019t perfect. Enter DeeLance (DLANCE), a new Web3 freelancing platform that\u2019s about to change all of that.\n\nThere are many unique aspects to the platform, including the fact that all work will be minted into NFTs. This ensures that the companies that are paying for the work truly own it. It also protects freelancers from being stiffed on payments and helps to resolve issues before they can blossom into something larger.\n\nDeeLance just began its presale, which makes now the best time to buy.\n\n>>>Buy DeeLance Now<<<\n\nMetropoly Opening Real Estate Investing to All\n\nThrough Metropoly (MET), people can invest in real estate for as little as $100. This gives them the opportunity to own a slice of luxury real estate around the world and take advantage of all the fruits that it has to offer.\n\nThe platform is going to explode in value, and is timed really well, as real estate performs great during inflationary times. That\u2019s why now is the best time to buy Metropoly as it\u2019s still in its presale stages.\n\n>>>Buy Metropoly Now<<<\n\nEcoterra Incentivizing Recycling\n\nEcoterra (ECOTERRA) is a new Recycle2Earn platform that\u2019s incentivizing people to recycle more. In an effort to help save the planet, the platform is also making it easier for manufacturers to obtain recycled materials that they can then use to create new products. This is an all-encompassing platform, then, making it easy for recycling to happen in a seamless fashion.\n\nEcoterra is one of the leading green crypto projects in the world, yet it\u2019s providing investors with an amazing opportunity now since it\u2019s only in presale. Hurry and buy before you miss out, or before the price increases with the next presale stage.\n\n>>>Buy Ecoterra Now<<<\n\nRobotEra Providing New NFT Opportunities\n\nUsers on RobotEra (TARO) will enter the beautiful metaverse of Taro, where they can become robot avatars and help to rebuild the planet after a long war. To do so, they\u2019ll gather the resources from the planet, create robot companions and work with other users on the platform.\n\nIn the process, entirely new NFT communities will be created, and people will be able to join in and share on all the excitement and creation. Since it\u2019s all based around the $TARO token, the project is set to soar in value.\n\nIt\u2019s in presale stage 2 now, so hurry and buy before you miss out.\n\n>>>Buy RobotEra Now<<<\n\nBuy These Alt-Coins Instead of Ethereum\n\nEthereum is the most well-known alt-coin on the market, but that doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s the best investment \u2013 even if it\u2019s the most valuable in terms of actual overall price. As you can see above, there are many concerns with Ethereum\u2019s price prediction in the future, which is why many investors are staying on the sidelines with it for now.\n\nInstead of jumping in on Ethereum, you\u2019d be better off investing in other alt-coin projects such as Love Hate Inu, DeeLance, Metropoly, Ecoterra and RobotEra. All are in various stages of presale right now, though, so don\u2019t delay any longer if you want to get in on the best price available.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

One of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the market is Ethereum (ETH), which has seen a surge in demand from both individual and institutional investors. Recently, an ETH whale that purchased billions of Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens last week has now started to buy RenQ Finance (RENQ), indicating a growing interest in the platform. In this article, we will explore the details of this whale\u2019s investment in RENQ and what it could mean for the platform\u2019s future.Over the past week, the values of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have declined by almost 3 percent, causing a significant impact on the market capitalization of all meme tokens. However, crypto whales were quick to take advantage of the drop, with some making purchases of billions of Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens. Whalestats, a platform that tracks cryptocurrency whale activity, reported that an Ethereum (ETH) whale address called \u201c\u201d acquired 131.4 billion SHIB tokens worth approximately $1.48 million in a single transaction. This purchase was made during a period when the price of SHIB had dropped by 10% over a week. As of writing, the average price for SHIB was $0.00001098, and its 24-hour trading volume had declined by 55% to $130.4 million. Further analysis shows that Shiba Inu has the highest monetary worth of all tokens owned by the top 100 ETH holders, with a total of SHIB tokens worth $601 million, accounting for 11.94% of their overall assets. Despite the decline in its burn rate by around 4% over 24 hours, the Shiba Inu coin has entered the top 10 most-bought tokens list, which tracks the activity of the largest cryptocurrency buyers in the last 24 hours. Additionally, the dead wallet received around 31.5 million SHIB tokens. It is noteworthy that the same Ethereum whale that purchased billions of SHIB tokens last week has now started purchasing RenQ Finance (RENQ) tokens, indicating a growing interest in the project and its potential for growth and profit. As the RenQ Finance platform moves towards its mainnet launch, investors are optimistic about its potential and the value it can provide.The same ETH whale has started to invest in RenQ Finance (RENQ). The exact amount of RENQ tokens the whale has purchased is unknown, but their investment has generated a lot of buzz in the crypto community. RENQ is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that offers a range of financial products and services, such as non-custodial trading, staking, and liquidity provision. The platform uses a multi-chain approach, meaning it is built on several blockchain networks, including Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Polygon. This approach allows for greater flexibility and scalability, making it an attractive option for investors looking to participate in DeFi.The ETH whale\u2019s investment in RENQ is a significant indication of the platform\u2019s potential for growth and profitability. The whale\u2019s investment is likely due to the platform\u2019s innovative technology and its potential to solve some of the major challenges faced by traditional finance systems. Additionally, RENQ\u2019s ability to attract investments from significant players in the crypto market bodes well for its future success. As RENQ\u2019s presale stage four closed earlier than expected and stage five began with great force, raising $7,930,204 out of $9,335,000, investors are optimistic that the ongoing stage will sell out fast too. The launch of RenQ Finance\u2019s mainnet is also highly anticipated and is expected to offer users a full range of DeFi products and services.The investment by the ETH whale in RenQ Finance (RENQ) is a positive sign for the platform and its potential for growth and profitability. RENQ\u2019s multi-chain approach, non-custodial platform, and support for financial products set it apart from other decentralized exchanges in the market. With the ongoing presale stage, RENQ\u2019s strong community support, and significant investments, the platform is well-positioned to make a significant impact in the DeFi space.

The key factor behind this rapid gain is Bitcoin rising above $30,000.\n\nThe most prominent digital asset Bitcoin is up 6.5% thus the price of Ethereum is also up by 3.58% with the currency trading at $1,923 at press time. Meanwhile, the trading volume shows a 61% increase at $9.7 billion in the last 24 hours.\n\nEthereum Shanghai upgrade, Ethereum\u2019s latest hard fork, scheduled for tomorrow, implements major Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)-4895 and many others and also enables validators to withdraw nearly $18 million worth of ETH tokens.\n\nWith the current ETH prices, more than half of the staked ETH (9.7 million out of 17.9 million) is currently at a loss. pic.twitter.com/232BRTOIb7 \u2014 CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) April 5, 2023\n\nHowever, analysts are assuming that, after the Shanghai upgrade, selling may occur due to the increase in withdrawals. On the other hand, an increase in BTC price washes away all the negative news and could take ETH price towards $2,000 soon.\n\nHowever, Ethereum\u2019s price has been bullish since November as the price action formed an ascending parallel channel. At that point, the bulls attempt to propel ETH towards the key $2,000 level at the upper boundary of this channel.\n\nSpecifically, the 20-day simple moving average has been an unbreakable support area for the past several days. Conditions seem favorable for the $2K region, and the Shanghai upgrade could accomplish this minor feat tomorrow.\n\nSupport levels \u2013 $1700 and $1400\n\n\u2013 $1700 and $1400 Resistance levels \u2013 $2000 and $2500\n\nDon\u2019t miss out on the latest developments in the world of crypto.

DeFi giant RenQ Finance (RENQ) has closed its Presale Stage 4 four weeks ahead of schedule, raising over $6.5 million in total.Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is set to undergo a significant upgrade known as the \u201cShanghai\u201d upgrade. This upgrade will introduce several new features, including a reduction in the gas fees required for transactions and the implementation of new security measures. Furthermore, the upcoming Shanghai upgrade of Ethereum, also known as the Shapella upgrade, is set to take place on April 12, 2023. One of the major developments associated with this hard fork is the implementation of Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4895, which will allow validators to withdraw their staked ETH from as far back as December 2020. The Shapella upgrade is expected to significantly enhance the user experience for Ethereum users and attract new investors to the network. Allowing validators to withdraw their assets, it will provide greater flexibility and accessibility, making the network more user-friendly. This upgrade is part of Ethereum\u2019s ongoing efforts to remain a leader in the DeFi space and maintain its position as one of the top cryptocurrencies in the market. With the implementation of EIP-4895 and other proposed improvements, Ethereum is poised to continue its growth and expansion in the years to come. Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has been experiencing positive market sentiments as investors continue to pour money into the cryptocurrency. The cryptocurrency has been on a steady upward trajectory, with its price reaching new highs in recent weeks. The surge in Bitcoin\u2019s price can be attributed to several factors, including increased institutional adoption, a reduction in supply due to halving events, and positive sentiment towards the cryptocurrency market as a whole. Additionally, the increasing popularity of decentralized finance (DeFi) has also played a role in Bitcoin\u2019s growth, as investors seek out alternative investment opportunities in the market. In general, the overall sentiment of the cryptocurrency market has shifted from neutral to positive. Bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency, has experienced almost a 70% rise in value this year and is currently hovering around the fresh levels of $28,000. In March, BTC surged by 19.8%, marking its best month since January 2023 when it gained 38.7%.RenQ Finance (RENQ), a DeFi platform that offers innovative financial products and services, has closed its Presale Stage 4 four weeks ahead of schedule, raising over $6.5 million in total. The platform has gained popularity among investors due to its commitment to security and interoperability, as well as its innovative approach to DeFi. RenQ Finance\u2019s successful presale is a testament to the growing interest in DeFi platforms and the potential for these platforms to revolutionize the financial industry. With the presale closed, the platform is expected to launch its mainnet in the coming weeks, offering users access to its suite of DeFi products and services.The cryptocurrency market continues to experience positive growth and market sentiments, with Ethereum gearing up for its Shanghai upgrade, Bitcoin experiencing steady growth, and RenQ Finance closing its presale stage ahead of schedule.

In early April, Ethereum was trading at $1.8k, much to the delight of the Ethereum community, especially after its bearish run during the turbulence in the crypto market.\n\nMoreover, the ETH/BTC graph also rose by 4.75% month-to-date, meaning Ethereum outperformed Bitcoin, crediting to the growing buzz around the Upgrade. Experts think of the Upgrade to lead Ether into a prolonged bullish run. The conditions are favorable for a surge, possibly a sustained stance in the $1.8k-$2k in April.\n\nUptrends in the ETH/BTC charts have statistically led to similar trends in the Altcoin market, notes Crypto analyst Miles Deutscher. As it turns out, ahead of the Shanghai Upgrade, \u201cgreenshoots\u201d have started to appear in the Alt market, as pointed out by GSR CEO Rich Rosenblum. Our experts have rounded a list of the top 3 crypto assets for investors to look out for this Alt Season: Lido DAO, Solana, and the brand new Big Eyes Coin.\n\nLido DAO to rise with Ethereum\n\nAs one of the platforms that allows the staking of Ethereum, the token for Lido Finance, Lido DAO (LDO) is guaranteed to benefit from the Shanghai upgrade. The coin has witnessed increased buyer momentum due to the upgrade already. LDO may overcome the next block at $2.92, but in the event of a highly bullish scenario, it may overcome the resistance level at $3.27. This value would be a 30% increase from its current price of $2.50. However, the Altcoin remains at risk of profit-taking and increased selling pressure, which will adversely affect its course, leading to a decline of about 20% in value.\n\nSolana may prepare for Breakout\n\nThe track record for the price of Solana (SOL) reveals an inverse head-and-shoulders setup, meaning two peaks, called shoulders, separated by a low called the head. A trendline connecting the two peaks, called the neckline, shows the resistance level. If the price reaches above the neckline, it indicates a strong, bullish breakout for SOL. With the recent surge that finished just below the line, analysts are predicting an uptrend to $37.21, which would signify an increase of 71.09%. However, a breakdown of the $18.66 support level due to any macroeconomic event might negatively skew the price of the altcoin.\n\nBig Eyes Coin to end Presale on June 3rd\n\nThe up and coming feline memecoin, Big Eyes (BIG) has just announced the end of its presale. Spanning across 12 stages, this has been the biggest presale for a memecoin in two years, having raised a staggering $33.5 million.\n\nThe memecoin has always created quite the stir with its innovative and user-centric features. For instance, transactions with BIG are exempt from buying and selling tax, the initial supply, 80% of which will be available on launch, will be locked in a liquidity pool for 2 years, and 5% of their collection will go to a charity wallet that supports ocean sanctuaries.\n\nAdditionally, Big Eyes also introduced the Lootbox Scheme, wherein users can buy Lootboxes to win random rewards that are always worth more than the price of the Lootbox itself. Recently, the scheme was paired with a card collection, which can be minted as NFTs.\n\nHowever, our team recommends BIG\u2019s next scheme, the final one before the launch itself. Users can win a bonus of upto 250% if they buy BIG or Lootboxes. With a high ROI, this is one offer not to be missed.\n\nAll users need to do is use the code BULLRUN250.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nWhile the Shanghai Upgrade is around the corner, Ethereum is witnessing a significant surge, and is predicted to sustain it. This can directly affect the price of altcoins, kickstarting what may be the next Alt Season. As a liquid-staking platform that supports the staking of Ether, Lido DAO will benefit from the Shanghai upgrade, and in case of a highly bullish run, increase by 30% from its current price. However, increased selling pressure and profit-taking may adversely affect it. Solana prices seem to show an inverse head-and-shoulder setup, and if it were to make it past the neckline, it can establish a bullish breakout. However, it is still subject to the volatile nature of the market, and any macroeconomic event might hinder its progress. Big Eyes Coin on the other hand, are promising a strong run after their upcoming launch, by creating a strong community and user-centric schemes. With the last chance for buyers to win 250% bonus, this is one coin that investors must not overlook.\n\nFind out more about Big Eyes Coin (BIG):\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "What is Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai Upgrade and What Does It Mean For Staking? - Bitbuy",
        "content": "What is Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai Upgrade and What Does It Mean For Staking?\n\nEthereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade (also known as the \u201cShapella\u201d) will take place on April 12, 2023. This is the last step in Ethereum\u2019s transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), and it represents a major upgrade for users looking to stake ETH.\n\n\u200d\n\nShanghai or \u201cShapella\u201d consists of several different Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), but the most notable difference is that it will enable withdrawals, or unstaking, of ETH that was previously locked in a smart contract. This opens a range of new possibilities for staking and has already generated a great deal of excitement within the industry.\n\n\u200d\n\nWhat does this mean for Bitbuy users?\n\nBitbuy is celebrating the Shapella upgrade by providing boosted ETH rewards for one month. For one month following Apr 12, Bitbuy ETH stakers can earn 4.07% - 6.0%*, which are the highest staking rewards of any regulated exchange in Canada.\n\n\u200d\n\nIf you are already staking at Bitbuy, then you do not have to take any action. Your staking will automatically receive boosted staking rewards for the upcoming month. If you haven't staked on Bitbuy yet, learn more on how to start staking Ethereum and earn rewards!\n\n\u200d\n\nAs a Bitbuy user, you will now have the flexibility to unstake your Ethereum in-app. When you initiate the unstaking process, your funds will move into an exit queue, where they will remain for about a week, before becoming liquid. You may not want to unstake if you believe in the long-term potential of Ethereum, or if you want to take advantage of our boosted rewards rates.\n\n\u200d\n\nWe want you to maximize and compound your returns. As a result, your rewards will be automatically restaked, allowing you to continue earning rewards, until you decide to unstake. It is important to note that any re-staked ETH will go through the network\u2019s standard bonding period of 45 days (subject to change) before they start earning additional rewards. Any amounts that are already staked will not need to go through the bonding period.\n\n\u200d\n\nBy staying informed about the details of your investments, you can make thoughtful decisions that help you maximize your potential returns. New bonding and unbonding periods will be introduced for ETH staking. With a bonding period of 45 days (subject to change), users will start earning rewards on their staked ETH after the bonding period is over. And with an unbonding period of 7 days, users will have the flexibility to unstake their funds when they need to and receive them back into their account after 7 days. Plus, any rewards accrued during the bonding period will be automatically released to the user's wallet and restaked, maximizing their returns with a compounding effect.\n\n\u200d\n\nIf you have any other questions, check out the FAQs on the upgrade or contact our Support team.\n\n*Boosted ETH staking rewards promotional period ends on May 12th at 11:59PM EST, and the promotional staking reward rate of 4.07% - 6.0% is calculated on a yearly basis.\n\n\u200d\n\nOverview of Ethereum\u2019s \u201cShapella\u201d Upgrade and its Impact on Staking\n\nThe name \u201cShapella\u201d comes from a mix of Shanghai \u2013 the city-host of the ETH Devcon 2 conference, and Capella \u2013 the brightest star in the northern constellation of Auriga.\n\n\u200d\n\nEthereum has two layers \u2013 the execution layer and the consensus layer. The Execution used to be the main layer, while the consensus layer was introduced as part of the initial merge to Proof of Stake. Shapella consists of upgrades to both layers simultaneously, each with a distinct name (Shanghai and Capella). This upgrade is expected to improve the efficiency and security of the network, leading to a more seamless user experience.\n\n\u200d\n\nEven though Ethereum is the world\u2019s largest Proof of Stake blockchain, currently only 15% of Ethereum is staked, while other blockchains have a staking participation closer to 50%. Until now, users who have staked their ETH have not been able to unstake their ETH, and the added flexibility is expected to make staking more attractive for investors.\n\n\u200d\n\nUnlock the potential of crypto staking with a secure and regulated platform with Bitbuy.

        "title": "Ethereum-Based Frax Finance (FXS) Is Up 64%, Is There Still Opportunity? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "In the last seven days, the Ethereum-based project Frax Finance is the second biggest winner within the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap. With a price increase of 64%, the FXS token is only behind Decentraland (MANA), which has surged 76% within the same period.\n\nWith the massive pump, Frax Share Token (FXS) has moved up to the 63rd position in the ranking by market cap and has seen a bullish rally since January 2. While the price was $4.09 on that day, FXS was at $9.06 at press time.\n\nWhen the price briefly rose above $10 yesterday, the gain was over 140% since January 2. In the 1-day chart, FXS has broken the resistance zone established in May last year between $7.40 and $8.20 and is now facing resistance at $10.02.\n\nThe first two attempts to break this resistance have failed for now, so a retest of the former resistance zone could be on the cards before the Frax token continues to rally. This would also be a much-needed correction, as the RSI on the daily chart is still at 83.\n\nThe weekly chart confirms the extremely bullish picture for the FXS token. Once the price consolidates in the daily chart and subsequently breaks the $10.02 level, the way would be clear for a rise toward $13.\n\nThe price level served as strong support in November and December 2021, before FXS rallied to an all-time high of $52.80 in January 2022.\n\nWhat Do The Fundamentals Of Frax (FXS) Suggest?\n\nAs NewsBTC reported, Frax Finance is benefiting from the liquid staking (LSD) narrative that emerged earlier this year and has since caused all LSD tokens to skyrocket. However, it is questionable whether the hype can continue for a longer period of time.\n\nAs Jordi Alexander, CIO of Selini Capital explained, the Ethereum Shanghai hard fork could be in for a rude awakening:\n\nETH staking is going to explode after the Shanghai fork allows withdrawals- esp. now as Metamask integration makes it easy for Dummies. But LSD tokens are overvalued in anticipation of this \u2013 revenue is not going to change much, bc reward yields will plunge as staking % goes up.\n\nBut analyst Thor Hartvigsen doubts whether the same will be true for Frax Finance. The analyst shared five reasons via Twitter why Frax Finance will be a key player in DeFi this year.\n\nThe first reason is that Frax offers the largest APR among liquid staking providers at 6-10%, while its nearest competitor is only around 5%. The main reason for this difference is that frxETH can be used in DeFi applications such as the ETH/frxETH Curve pool.\n\nThe second reason Hartvigsen cites is that Frax Finance has made extensive improvements since its inception, in particular, it has improved its model (FRAXV2) and \u201chas become a huge liquidity engine with a range of products.\u201d\n\nThese include algorithmic market operations (AMOs), FraxSwap, FraxLend, FraxFerry (native bridge design), ETH liquid staking, and FPI (US inflation rate linked stablecoin).\n\n\u00a4 Frax Finance has been crushing it lately\ud83d\udd2e And with their growing ecosystem of DeFi products, $FXS has a TON of upside in 2023. Here are 5 reasons why @fraxfinance will be a central player in DeFi this year and how you should be taking advantage of this \ud83e\uddf5 1/19 pic.twitter.com/epFMEgY4HF \u2014 Thor Hartvigsen (@ThorHartvigsen) January 17, 2023\n\nThird, it\u2019s the AMOs that make Frax special, as they don\u2019t just let collateral sit dormant, but use it in various DeFi applications. It also offers some of the highest stablecoin yields, which significantly strengthens FXS by increasing liquidity on Curve.\n\nLast but not least, Hartvigsen points to Frax\u2019s roadmap to reach a market cap in the trillions and become the risk-free underlying in DeFi. The analyst touts the Fed Master Account (FMA) as the biggest innovation:\n\nA FMA is dollars deposited directly into the FED treasury\u2019s ledger and grants access to US Treasuries. The FED gives a status on the ledger once a day which essentially is the ultimate audit. This would make FRAX one of the closest things to a \u2018risk free dollar\u2019. It\u2019s a very ambitious goal however and likely a few years away.\n\nFeatured image from Inside Out, Charts from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "The Top Cryptocurrencies To Invest In 2023: Ethereum (ETH), The Sandbox (SAND) and Collateral Network (COLT) - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "2023 has been an excellent year so far for crypto investors, with the continued decline of consumer confidence in banks, worries about persistent and sticky inflation with a secondary wave, and massive adoption from multinational corporations. The upside of owning digital assets has never been greater, and analysts have selected Ethereum (ETH), The Sandbox (SAND), and Collateral Network (COLT) as the best tokens to buy in this year.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\n\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nThe entire crypto space watches Ethereum (ETH) currently. Last year, Ethereum (ETH) successfully shipped The Merge, transitioned to Proof of Stake (PoS), and opened the potential to generate passive income via staking. With the Shanghai upgrade rapidly approaching, Ethereum (ETH) withdrawals will go live, and Ethereum (ETH) staking will be a complete product.\n\nAnalysts disagree over whether there will be a net inflow versus net outflow when Ethereum (ETH) withdrawals go live. Still, prominent figures such as Chris Burniske, Partner at PlaceHolder Venture Capital, remain incredibly bullish on Ethereum (ETH) long term. Price predictions for Ethereum (ETH) remain positive, with an expected range between $37,50 and $4,300 for Ethereum (ETH) in 2024.\n\nThe Sandbox (SAND)\n\nThe Sandbox (SAND) is a virtual gaming world on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain that allows people to own and monetize their experience with NFTs. The Sandbox (SAND) has pioneered in the Metaverse space and remains one the largest Metaverse real estate brokers in crypto. Currently, The Sandbox (SAND) is holding its April festival, which will feature a month of exciting activities and prizes within the ecosystem.\n\nThe Sandbox (SAND) token powers the entire ecosystem and is used to purchase/ trade all assets and land within this virtual reality. Price predictions for The Sandbox (SAND) in 2024 range between $1.21 and $1.39, a decent upside potential from The Sandbox\u2019s (SAND) current price of $0.63.\n\nThe Sandbox (SAND) is a token that investors bullish on the long-term potential of the Metaverse should hold, and analysts cite that The Sandbox (SAND) has a great early starter advantage compared to other Metaverse projects.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nCollateral Network (COLT)\n\nCollateral Network (COLT) rests at the frontier of DeFi and will likely become an established blue chip protocol within the next bull market. Every cycle sees innovations, and then new projects leverage these innovations to deliver new services. Collateral Network (COLT) unlocks liquidity for real-world assets and is the first decentralized lending protocol for tangible off-chain assets.\n\n\n\nCollateral Network (COLT) brings real-world assets on-chain using 100% asset-backed NFTs, which the protocol mints whenever a user collateralizes an item such as real estate, fine art, rare whisky, vintage cars, etc. This NFT can then be traded/ sold on the secondary market or used to access loans provided by a global pool of capital (lenders).\n\nCollateral Network (COLT) provides institutional-level liquidity and marks a huge step forwards for real-world assets in DeFi- one of venture capital firms\u2019 key predicted growth areas. The COLT token provides discounts on interest rates for borrowers, reduced trading fees on the marketplace for lenders, and access to auctions where distressed assets will be sold at below-market value.\n\nCOLT has multiple sides of organic buy pressure, and analysts have already forecast a 3,500% gain by the time the presale ends, further stating that early investors in COLT could see a 100X when the token launches on centralized exchanges.\n\nFind out more about the Collateral Network presale here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.collateralnetwork.io/\n\nPresale: https://app.collateralnetwork.io/register\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/collateralnwk\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Collateralnwk\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "SignUpToken.com Boosts Millionaire Campaign Amid French Embrace of Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency is facing pressure from US regulators after the collapse of FTX and the closure of crypto-oriented banks. Silvergate Capital, for example, lost extensively in the wake of the FTX crash, as there was a bank run with over 60% of deposits withdrawn in one quarter. Following this, Silvergate announced its wind-down and other crypto-focused banks such as Signature also crashed. Major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have also been affected, with Bitcoin currently trading at around $28,409 and Ethereum at $1,810 per coin. As we analyze this, we will also assess the emergence of an innovative new cryptocurrency called SignUp Token.\n\nU.S Cracks Down On Cryptocurrency\n\nThe US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has sued Binance for violating trading and derivative laws by offering derivative trading services to US customers without a derivative license. This lawsuit, filed on March 27, accuses the crypto exchange of elevating commercial success over complying with regulations and discarding US federal laws while strengthening its customer base in America. This move represents a growing suspicion among US regulators that cryptocurrency\u2019s unregulated nature cannot be sustained and must be brought into line.\n\nBig French Whopper For Cryptocurrencies\n\nAmid this uncertain regulatory environment, France has emerged as a cryptocurrency haven. Burger King, for example, now accepts cryptocurrency payments through its partnership with Instpower, which deploys power bank rental machines across the different store locations in Paris. This underlines the stark contrast between France and the US in their confidence in cryptocurrency. Such embracing could help cryptocurrencies maintain their trading levels, and France\u2019s sizable market for investment could spark a reversal in fortunes.\n\nSignUp Token Is A Radical Yet Simple Idea\n\nAn intriguing new crypto initiative, SignUp Token, is also worth noting. Unlike traditional approaches that require presales or an initial coin offering (ICO), SignUp Token seeks to gain one million email sign-ups before it enters the crypto exchanges. The advantage of this approach is that those who register their emails get a healthy headstart over other investors, as they will be the first to know when the new token will enter the crypto market.\n\nIn conclusion, the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency is uncertain, with US regulators cracking down on the industry. However, France has emerged as a cryptocurrency haven that could potentially help cryptocurrencies maintain their trading levels and even reverse the recent downturn. Moreover, the innovative SignUp Token initiative offers a new approach to launching a crypto coin that could benefit investors. The future of cryptocurrency is uncertain, but with unique initiatives and welcoming markets, there is still hope for this digital finance economy.\n\nFor those interested in what SignUp Token has to offer, visit their website at signuptoken.com. This unique approach could potentially make someone a millionaire by simply signing up for an email newsletter.\n\nSignUp Token:\n\nhttps://signuptoken.com/\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Comparing Arbitrum, Optimism And Polygon: How Ethereum Layer 2 Blockchains Are Impacting Upcoming ... - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) blockchains are increasingly gaining popularity in the crypto industry, and they have become an essential service for investors. L2s are designed to make transactions on the Ethereum network more cost-effective compared to Layer 1 blockchains. The crypto industry has witnessed the emergence of several L2 blockchains that compete for market share on the Ethereum blockchain, and the top three are Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism. These three L2s have experienced significant support in the market, but their performances vary, and this report takes a look at their respective performances to determine the best performer.\n\nRise in Total Value Locked (TLV)\n\nThe total value locked (TVL) on the top three Ethereum Layer 2 blockchains has grown significantly since their inception. However, there has been a substantial difference in usage and TVL on the blockchain. Arbitrum, which is the latest blockchain to gain widespread popularity, has taken the lead in terms of TVL and usage.\n\nThe Layer 2 upgrade presently boasts the fourth largest total value locked (TVL) in decentralised finance (DeFi), surpassing $2.2 billion. Of the three L2 networks, Arbitrum has the highest TVL, with over $2.2 billion locked, while Polygon has a TVL of only $1.07 billion, which is over 50% lower than Arbitrum. Optimism has the lowest TVL of the three, with $923 million.\n\nOptimism beats Arbitrum And Polygon\n\nIn terms of usage, Arbitrum is the leader, with a 24-hour trading volume of $583 million, whereas Polygon has a 24-hour trading volume of $148 million, and Optimism has a trading volume of $38 million. With the release of tokens for all three L2 networks, their performance can be evaluated against one another. Although some networks have performed better than others, the margin between them remains quite narrow.\n\nArbitrum\u2019s price has surged 10% in the last day to $1.26. However, Optimism has done even better, with its price crossing $2.28, a 10.39% increase in the same time period. Polygon is the worst performer of the three, with an 8% gain that has brought its price to $1.14. Despite underperforming, Polygon still holds the largest market capitalization among the three, amounting to $10.35 billion, while ARB and OP have market capitalizations of $1.6 billion and $716 million, respectively.\n\nHow Ethereum\u2019s Layer 2 Supports New Crypto\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) Layer 2 upgrade has contributed to a significant price increase of 4% for Ethereum (ETH) in the past month. This upgrade is expected to have a positive impact on smaller cryptocurrencies that rely on the Ethereum (ETH) network for transactions and activities. One such promising meme currency that falls into this category is Dogetti (DETI).\n\nDogetti (DETI) is a new entrant in the meme coin market that is trying to compete with the giants Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Similar to other meme coins, Dogetti (DETI) focuses on accessible, irreverent marketing, cute characters representing the token\u2019s community, and relies heavily on the Ethereum (ETH) network\u2019s solid foundation.\n\nWith the upcoming Layer 2 upgrade and other improvements and extensions that the Ethereum development team is working on, Dogetti (DETI) could emerge as one of the winners in the meme coin presale sub-market niche. It is an excellent opportunity to look into Dogetti (DETI) and other similar coins that leverage the reputable and long-standing Ethereum network.\n\nThe three top Ethereum Layer 2 blockchains have made significant progress in the crypto industry, providing a very needed service to investors. However, their performances vary significantly, and Arbitrum is currently leading the way in terms of TVL, usage, and token price, followed by Polygon and Optimism. As L2 blockchains continue to evolve and gain wider acceptance, it will be interesting to see how their performances evolve and which one will come out on top in the end. One is that these developments will definitely boost upcoming altcoins like Dogetti.\n\nFor more information about Dogetti (DETI):\n\nPresale: https://dogetti.io/how-to-buy\n\nWebsite: https://dogetti.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/Dogetti\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_Dogetti_\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Signuptoken.com Steps Up Millionaire Campaign as Bitcoin and Ethereum Find Shelter in France - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The landscape of cryptocurrency could be changing as it finds itself embroiled in pressure from U.S. authorities. The spectacular collapse of FTX was followed by multiple crypto-orientated banks closing while Binance Holdings now faces heat from American regulators. But away from America, there is a different atmosphere in France, where cryptos like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are embraced rather than confronted with regulations. As we look at how economic conditions for cryptocurrency could change through investment in the French market, we\u2019ll also analyze a new crypto initiative called Signuptoken.com that could potentially make a millionaire out of someone for simply signing up to an email newsletter.\n\nU.S. Authorities Are Clamping Down On Cryptocurrency\n\nCryptocurrency has suffered from visible market volatility and shifting economic conditions following the collapse of the FTX last year. This prompted an immediate downturn in the prospects of the cryptocurrency market as investors began losing confidence. Major crypto-related banks began suffering, a prominent example being Silvergate Capital. A crypto-friendly bank, it bled extensively following the FTX crash as there was a bank run with over 60% of deposits withdrawn in one quarter as customers withdrew around $8.1bn.\n\nAlmost imminently, Silvergate announced it would be winding down its operations and other crypto-focused banks such as Signature also began feeling the strains and eventually crashed, prompting a bout of severe market volatility. Major cryptos such as Bitcoin and Ethereum have felt the pinch of the economic squeeze, struggling to maintain bullish runs. Bitcoin is currently trading at around $28,409 while Ethereum is selling for $1,810 per coin.\n\nThe downturn in market trends in cryptocurrency is not new. But what feels different this time is the mounting seriousness of U.S. authorities in cracking down on cryptocurrency. The United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) sued Binance for violating trading and derivative laws. The lawsuit was filed on the 27th of March and accused the worldwide crypto exchange of offering its derivative trading services to customers in the USA without applying for a derivative licence.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges Binance of having elevated commercial success over complying with regulations and said Binance had discarded U.S. federal laws whilst strengthening its customer base in America.\n\nThe move, which took many by surprise, represents a growing suspicion among U.S. authorities that cryptocurrency\u2019s unregulated nature cannot be sustained and must be brought into line.\n\nBitcoin & Ethereum: Is France the New Haven?\n\nMarket trends are such that if a lucrative industry struggles in one such market it may find opportunities elsewhere. Keen to secure the lucrative investments of cryptocurrency, France has demonstrated a considerably more embracing nature of the digital finance economy in comparison to its American counterparts.\n\nAn example of this has been the fast food chain Burger King revealing that it was accepting cryptocurrency as payments for transactions in Paris. It\u2019s done this by partnering with Instpower which will deploy power bank rental machines across store locations in the French capital. It underlines the stark contrast between France and the U.S. in the confidence in cryptocurrency. This could mean a boon for cryptocurrency which has much to offer people who prefer its decentralised nature compared to the regulations of centralised banks and financial institutions. Furthermore, the blockchain technology of a cryptocurrency like Ethereum has been revolutionary for application developers and underlines what cryptocurrency has to offer in comparison to traditional financial markets.\n\nIt could also be argued that the embrace of France as a sizable market for investment could help a coin like Bitcoin maintain its trading levels and eventually continue climbing in its market capitalisation. The value of major cryptos is often tied to external events such as the FTX crash and the closure of major crypto banks. This could prompt a positive reversal in fortunes and spark life into the cryptocurrency market that has been scarred by the recent implosion of major crypto banks.\n\nSignuptoken.com Offers An Easy Way To Become A Millionaire\n\nThe traditional approach for a crypto coin to launch itself has been through presales or an ICO. Although this works fine, other formats can be explored. Signuptoken.com is an intriguingly shrewd example of that.\n\nNot needing a presale or any kind of prepayment, instead, it pushes for one million email sign-ups before it enters the crypto exchanges. There are some noteworthy benefits to this, including the advantage of being the first to know when the new token will enter the crypto market, giving anyone who registers their email a healthy headstart on engaging with the new crypto over other investors.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in what it\u2019s offering, have a look below:\n\nWebsite: https://www.signuptoken.com\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_SignUpToken_\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/SignUpToken\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Well-known crypto analyst Chris Burniske has boldly predicted the future of Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency in the market. Burniske, known for his insightful commentary on digital assets, recently took to Twitter to express his thoughts on the potential of ETH.\n\nFor the haters that have been negative on $ETH at $1, $10, $100, and $1,000, but refuse to let data change their views, see ya at $ETH $10K \u270c\ufe0f \u2014 Chris Burniske (@cburniske) April 9, 2023\n\nAs more and more individuals turn to blockchain technology for various purposes, including financial transactions and smart contracts, the demand for ETH is likely to increase significantly.\n\nAccording to Burniske\u2019s tweet, many skeptics have been negative about Ethereum at various price points, including $1, $10, $100, and $1,000. However, he believes these critics will be proven wrong in the long run.\n\nHe predicts Ethereum could soar to $10,000 by 2025, a staggering increase from its current price point. Nevertheless, he did not provide any specific reasons for his prediction.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Shapella Upgrade: Impact On ETH Price & Staking\n\nEthereum (ETH) has recently crossed the $1,900 mark, reaching its highest level since August 2021. The second-largest market cap cryptocurrency currently trades at $1,896, with a 3.11% gain over the past 24 hours and a 5% increase over the past seven days.\n\nEthereum\u2019s upcoming hard fork on April 12, Shapella, aims to address staked ETH withdrawals, leading market participants to believe it may increase the price.\n\nHowever, according to Brian Mosoff, CEO of Ether Capital, the Shapella upgrade is unlikely to impact the price of ether significantly. Mosoff believes that the upgrade will not cause a rush to liquidate and lead to pressure on the cryptocurrency\u2019s price.\n\nInstead, he expects more ETH to be locked into staking, either from solo stakers or structured products, leading to changes in trading in the coming months.\n\nThe Shapella upgrade is Ethereum\u2019s final shift towards fully implementing its proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. It will allow users to withdraw from the ETH they have staked, lower fees, and create more room on the blockchain to handle transactions.\n\nMosoff also expects that the upgrade could attract a new group of investors, as it provides the ability to earn some yield on staked ETH.\n\nRelated Reading | Security Concerns Raised For Ethereum Staking Nodes Ahead Of Shanghai Upgrade"

        "content": "In a recent Twitter thread, Shenyu, the founder of Cobo, raised concerns about the security of private keys for Ethereum staking nodes. With an upcoming upgrade in Shanghai, more than two years of ETH staking can withdraw cash. However, Shenyu warns that the private keys of some staking nodes may have already been leaked.\n\nThis news comes after thousands of addresses eligible for arbitrum airdrops had their private keys leaked. Shenyu recommends that institutions that provide centralized staking should review their private key storage methods, check the status of authorized personnel, monitor server logs, and formulate emergency plans.\n\nInstitutions offering centralized staking services should heed this warning and implement necessary measures to safeguard their users\u2019 funds. As staking gains more traction, the associated security risks also escalate, making it imperative to establish robust security protocols to protect users\u2019 assets.\n\nAs the upgrade in Shanghai approaches, users and institutions should be vigilant and take all necessary precautions to prevent potential security breaches. Shenyu\u2019s warning serves as a timely reminder of the importance of robust security measures for staking services.\n\nSharp Drop in Ethereum Options Implied Volatility (IV)\n\nIn another related update, the Ethereum market has experienced a sharp drop in options implied volatility (IV), despite the upcoming Shanghai upgrade. IV has fallen by as much as 8% in the past two days, which is a significant drop. This decline in IV is mainly attributed to the drop in market liquidity due to the Easter holidays.\n\nWhile it is not unusual for market liquidity to drop during holidays, it is unexpected for the monthly IV to fall to the same level as Bitcoin. This drop in IV is an indication that traders are not as concerned about Ethereum price movements as they have been in recent weeks.\n\nAccording to the analytics platform, GreeksLive, the fall in IV is primarily driven by the reduced demand for options rather than an increase in supply. The reduced demand for options can be attributed to the lower trading volume in the Ethereum market, as investors take a break during the holiday period.\n\nThe decline in IV indicates that traders are less concerned about potential price movements in the Ethereum market in the short term. However, this could change after the Shanghai upgrade, which is expected to significantly change the Ethereum network.\n\nEthereum traders and investors should monitor the market closely ahead of the upgrade. Although the drop in IV is not alarming at the moment, market sentiment can change rapidly, emphasizing the need to be updated on any potential market-moving events.\n\nRelated Reading | Weekly Market Watch: Ethereum Bullish Surge Boosts Altcoins\u2019 Performance"

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH will Rally to $3000 on Shanghai Upgrade | Bitcoinist.com - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Ethereum has given a lukewarm performance this year, despite the market racing to reclaim its lost value. But it looks like ETH is back in the game, climbing 20% on the monthly chart. The coin broke past $1900 briefly on Wednesday and sits at $1,876.62 now.\n\nThe rally will gain momentum in the coming days, with the Shanghai upgrade around the corner. A steep ascent to $2250 can\u2019t be ruled out, given the relevance of the milestone. And if the market continues in recovery mode and the network development goes as planned, ETH is on the path to $3000 by the third quarter of 2023.\n\nHere is a closer Ethereum price prediction and how you can make the most of the upcoming ETH rally.\n\nEthereum Shanghai Upgrade is Scheduled for 12 April\n\nEthereum Shanghai Upgrade, or Shapella Upgrade to be more precise, will activate on the Ethereum network at epoch 194048, scheduled for 22:27:35 UTC on Apr. 12, 2023.\n\nThe milestone is much-awaited, as it marks the completion of Ethereum\u2019s transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) network. More importantly, it follows The Merge and enables validators to withdraw their stake from the Beacon Chain back to the execution layer. In addition, it will bring new functionality to both the execution and consensus layers.\n\nShapella Upgrade combines changes to the execution layer (Shanghai), consensus layer (Capella) and the Engine API. The smart contracts and protocol rules depend on Shanghai, whereas Capella ensures that all network validators follow these rules. Validators who have had to stake their ETH to add blocks to Ethereum for its transition to a PoS consensus mechanism can now unstake them. That essentially means that ETH which have long been locked up are entering the market again.\n\nEthereum three-month price history, 7 April 2023, source: CoinMarketCap\n\nWhile increased supply should be a cause of concern usually, that is not the case here. The flexibility of deposits and withdrawals will instill more confidence in holders to stake. The Shapella Upgrade will urge more ETH holders to stake and participate in the consensus mechanism. It goes without saying that the development milestone reaffirms faith in the blockchain and its ecosystem, fuelling demand for the coin as an investment, as we have seen in the last few days.\n\nWhile Ethereum has not caught up with Bitcoin in terms of price performance so far this year, that won\u2019t be the case this quarter, with increased ETH liquidity.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: Can ETH Touch $3000 this Quarter?\n\nETH\u2019s quick jump from $1379 in March to $1900 in April reveals the market\u2019s excitement about the upcoming milestone and what to expect. The altcoin is reversing the losses made in 2022, while reclaiming its status as the blue-chip crypto by driving solid demand and growth.\n\nAs the blockchain approaches the Shanghai Upgrade, it can climb to $2250, which is only ~$350 up from where it is now. The relevance of the milestone justifies the short and steep hike. But the real question is whether ETH can retain the value and continue the journey upward.\n\nIf the coin continues to strengthen the buying momentum, it has the potential to cross $3000 by the end of the quarter. The fact that ETH accumulation by addresses with a 1,000-10,000 ETH balance has increased in recent weeks substantiates the price prediction. Their ETH holdings have increased by 0.5% in March alone.\n\nETH supply distribution among investors with 1,000 ETH or above, source: Santiment\n\nWhen it comes to 1 million-10 million ETH (brown) and the 10 million \u2013 100 million ETH balance groups, the numbers come to 0.4% and 0.5%. Here is another optimistic stat \u2013 the net Ether deposited at the official Ethereum 2.0 address has crossed 18M after soaring 3.5% in March.\n\nEthereum: ETH 2.0 Total Value Staked [ETH], source: Glassnode\n\nThat said, Ethereum can plunge to $1550 if there are glitches in the upgrade or the broader market lets down. A post-Shapella dip is well expected too, although it will be short-lived.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction 2023\n\nEthereum has a lot to look forward to in 2023 as it continues to improve the network speed, security, transaction costs, and user experience.\n\nOne of the key milestones includes Proto-danksharding, which will reduce transaction costs. Currently, Rollup data is stored on Ethereum permanently. It is expensive and accounts for more than 90% of the transaction cost users pay on rollups. The plan is to move the data into a new temporary \u2018blob\u2019 storage. They are cheaper as they can be deleted if no longer needed. Blob transactions will be added to Ethereum in an upgrade known as \u201cProto-Danksharding\u201d, which will be shipped in late 2023, according to the project\u2019s official roadmap.\n\nThat can kindle a strong Ethereum bull run. Even if the coin doesn\u2019t ascent to its all-time high of $4,878.26, it can set a bottom at $4,000 for 2024.\n\nIs Ethereum a good investment?\n\nEthereum is one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy now. It is an asset backed by an established project which continues to grow, expand, and improve. As the blockchain sector grows, so will Ethereum. If you\u2019re looking for a blue-chip crypto with a low risk-reward ratio, Ethereum makes an excellent choice. As the world\u2019s biggest altcoin, Ethereum has a massive market cap of $224B, despite the huge drop in value last year.\n\nThat leaves ETH with little room for growth. The highest it can climb this year is 2X. So, it is a good idea to diversify your portfolio with emerging assets that can go 5X to 10X. We have listed below three underrated cryptocurrencies, based on their utilities, market relevance, and credibility.\n\n1. Love Hate Inu \u2013 Meme Coin Ready to Explode\n\nMeme coins have a history of kindling some of the biggest crypto rallies. They can turn you into a millionaire or wipe out your wallet overnight. Their strength lies in the solidity of the community. But the lack of utility, common among meme coins, has proven to be detrimental to their sustainability.\n\nSo meme coins remain a risky investment.\n\nLove Hate Inu aims to change the narrative. It is one of the most talked-about cryptocurrencies this year, and for the right reason. The vote-to-earn crypto, now in the presale phase, has managed to penetrate a broad market.\n\nAs the name gives it away, a vote-to-earn crypto lets you vote on a wide range of topics from politics to pop culture and sports and earn rewards in return. Rooted in the fast-growing online survey market, Love Hate Inu introduces a transparent voting platform integrated with crypto incentivization.\n\nAccording to the Business Research Company, the global online survey software market has exploded from $2.79 billion in 2022 to $3.2 billion in 2023 at a CAGR of 14.6%. The market will grow to $5.69 billion by 2027 at a CAGR of 15.5%.\n\nGiven that businesses are increasingly using surveys as a means to understand customer behavior, interests, and spending patterns, Love Hate Inu is stepping into a fertile market. Blockchain-powered smart contracts will mitigate the element of fraud and manipulation, which are common in traditional markets.\n\nLove Hate Inu features a robust staking mechanism that makes the voting process both verifiable and anonymous. The authenticity of the poll, results, or reward distribution can be verified on the blockchain, which is out for anyone to see. While the team will create the polls in the initial phases, Love Hate Inu is building a community-first vote-to-earn ecosystem. So eventually, the community will create the polls.\n\n#LoveHateInu Voters, Creators and Followers!\ud83d\ude4f The time has finally come, we have reached 3M!!!\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89 Get ready for the phenomenal CEO reveal!\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc40 As always we thank you for all the support you have given us!\u2764\ufe0f Join us today!\ud83d\udd25https://t.co/Pu2Bo8WOUy#Trump #AndrewTate pic.twitter.com/t6J7r6gGvH \u2014 Love Hate Inu (@LoveHateInu) April 6, 2023\n\nIt is also important to note that 90% of the LHINU supply will be sold in the ongoing public presale to ensure that the community holds the majority of the tokens. This decision will come to the advantage of the project in the coming months, as the future of a crypto meme coin largely lies in the hands of the community.\n\nThat said, Love Hate Inu is not a meme coin built solely on community power. It has an ambitious roadmap:\n\nThe Love Hate Inu (LHINU) presale has crossed the $3M milestone within days of going live. The meteoric progress of the presale strengthens the possibility of a meme coin rally upon its token launch. It\u2019s not too late to buy LHINU.\n\nYou can still get it for presale discounts. The earlier you get in, the higher the discounts.\n\nPresale started March 7, 2023 Purchase Methods ETH, USDT, Transak Chain Ethereum Min Investment N/A Max Investment N/A\n\nBUY LOVE HATE INU\n\n2. DeeLance \u2013 The Best Utility Token of 2023\n\nDeeLance is a Web 3.0 freelancing and recruitment platform. It brings transparency and decentralization to the freelancing market, which is riddled with scams and manipulation. DeeLance aims to radically innovate the industry by providing decentralized, secure tools and ownership rights to users in a digital economy.\n\nA report finds that more than 65% of employed people want to work full-time as remote employees. The global gig economy is expected to cross $450 billion in 2023 and the freelancing industry to surpass $12 billion by 2028.\n\nYou will need no browser plugins, third-party apps, credit card details, or wallets-linking to access the platform, which is designed to be fast, efficient, and easy. It taps into the true potential of blockchain technology, by knocking out predatory intermediaries from the equation.\n\nAnother key highlight of the platform is the control over data. It offers an excellent blockchain alternative to traditional freelancing platforms that sell user data to marketing and advertising companies. The automated dispute system of the platform stores all buyer and seller reputations on the public blockchain. Secure escrow accounts implement trustlessness into the ecosystem, ensuring that freelancers receive payment for the services they provide.\n\nDeeLance allows you to convert the work submitted on the platform into NFTs. The feature ensures that the employer has full rights to the work they\u2019re paying for, which in turn mitigates copyright violations.

        "content": "The ETH price fell more than 10% in the last 48 hours, as recession looms over the crypto market. This has caused several experts to predict a massive crash. As whales position themselves for a sale, insider sources are saying that these massive funds will mostly find their new homes among the newcomers on the market, namely Love Hate Inu (LHINU), DeeLance (DLANCE), Metropoly (METRO), Ecoterra (ECOTERRA), and RobotEra (TARO). These represent a new generation of cryptocurrency, each specializing in its niche and providing users with incredible utility on their respective platforms. But before we dig deeper into their merits let's examine more closely Ethereum price prediction and ETH future."

        "content": "As Ethereum\u2018s highly anticipated Shapella upgrade approaches, data suggests that the majority of network users do not intend to immediately utilize the changes brought about by the protocol update.\n\nFigures from analytics firm IntoTheBlock reveal that a mere 0.6% of Ethereum validators have plans to withdraw their stakes following the hard fork. According to a tweet from the market intelligence provider on Tuesday, only 3,614 out of 562,717 Ethereum validators had opted to withdraw their stake as of April 10.\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum\u2019s Shapella upgrade\n\nThe Shapella upgrade is set to take place at block 6209536, which is expected to occur at 10:27:35 PM UTC on April 12. This update serves as a follow-up to the well-known Merge update in September 2022, which transitioned Ethereum\u2019s consensus mechanism from proof of work (PoW) to proof of stake (PoS). The PoW model relies on energy consumption to secure the blockchain, while the PoS model uses cryptocurrency, making it a more energy-efficient alternative.\n\nShapella is a fusion of the \u201cShanghai\u201d and \u201cCopella\u201d upgrades, which will facilitate ETH staking withdrawals on both Ethereum\u2019s execution and consensus layers, respectively. This marks the first occasion that users can withdraw their stake since the launch of Ethereum\u2019s beacon chain in December 2020.\n\nAn examination of Ethereum\u2019s staking contract indicates that over 18.14 million ETH, valued at more than $34.7 billion, is currently staked on the network. This accounts for approximately 15% of all ETH in circulation.\n\nThere has been speculation that allowing the withdrawal of such vast amounts of staked ETH could potentially trigger a market sell-off by investors who may have already cashed out under different circumstances. Last month, cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase expressed the expectation of receiving a high volume of withdrawal requests once the update is implemented, which could take \u201cweeks to months\u201d to fully process.\n\nIt is worth noting that Ethereum\u2019s price experienced a decline immediately after the Merge update in September, despite an initial surge in anticipation of the upgrade. The limited number of validators planning to withdraw their stake immediately after the Shapella upgrade might help mitigate any short-term market impact. However, the situation warrants close monitoring as the upgrade is rolled out and users begin to interact with the new protocol changes."

        "content": "Another highly anticipated Ethereum Shapella Upgrade will go live around 6:30 ET or 22:30 UTC. Ethereum (ETH) expectations are high, with the upgrade just around the corner.\n\nWith Shapella,\n\nEthereum plans to upgrade the execution layer of the blockchain called Shanghai, the consensus layer called Capella\n\nHence Shanghai + Capella = Shapella, and Engine API\n\nThe upgrade would allow access to nearly 15% of the total ETH.\n\nEthereum Shapella Upgrade Going Live\n\nNearly $33.7 Billion worth of ETH has been staked since the last hard fork Merge, and the investors have been waiting for returns and yields ever since. All these can now be un-staked once the Shapella Upgrade goes live, but not everything will be available all at once.\n\nIn a week from the upgrade, around 1.1 Million ETH worth approx $2 Billion would be available for grasp.\n\nThe rest will be made available from May 2023 in a distributed and sequential manner, thereby reducing the withdrawal pressure on the network. They also incorporate certain security measures to ensure malicious actors cannot exploit the increased traffic and that investors are safe while un-staking their rewards.\n\nAccording to a recent study, only 29% of staked ETH are profitable concerning USD, meaning that most of the un-staking, if it happens, would be at a loss.\n\nKeeping this in mind, it can be said that there might not be as much withdrawal influx as expected. Moreover, the facility of staking, un-staking, and re-staking could bring added liquidity to the network, plus the added validators would fasten the transaction speed.\n\nEarlier tests for the Ethereum Shapella Upgrade were not encouraging, as the tests revealed longer transaction time, and most of the computers could not adjust to the new upgrade. However, Ethereum developers are working hard toward seamless transfer of the upgrade. The fear of price fluctuation concerning withdrawal influx and selling pressure has also been dealt with and is not supposed to harm that much.\n\nWhat May Ethereum Bring After Shapella?\n\nThe Ethereum ecosystem is working hard on providing the best for the users and investors, its creator Vitalik Buterin released a road map of Ethereum development in November 2022, briefly explaining their road map to becoming the number one blockchain.\n\nAfter the Upgrade, there will be EIP-4844, involving proto-danksharding and blobs. The sharding concept aims to increase the Ethereum network\u2019s scalability by facilitating more efficient data storage possibilities. The idea was derived from Computer Science and split the blockchain into smaller pieces called shards, creating multiple mini-blockchains.\n\nDanksharding is similar to sharding, with a major difference. Instead of using shards to increase the number of transactions, it increases the space for groups of data known as blobs. This facility allows more data to be processed, thus lowering the transaction cost on layer 2 blockchains.\n\nEIP-4844, proto-danksharding, is supposed to be on the Ethereum mainnet during Q3 2023. For its proper deployment, Ethereum developers have already released KZG Ceremony, a coordinated public ritual providing the foundation for proto-danksharding. KZG Ceremony may allegedly go live in a week.\n\nThis EIP-4844 will be known as Verge and introduce Verkle trees for increasing scalability, allowing developers to store large amounts of data; the users could then show a single piece or a short proof for data verification and have a root of that tree. Verkle trees are expected to make data proofs more efficient.\n\nNext in the upgradation cycle would be Purge, which would eliminate historical data from the Ethereum network, thus removing the congestion and allowing increased transaction speeds. Buterin predicted that Ethereum could process around 100,000 transactions per second (TPS) after this phase, which is way higher than the current 29 TPS."
