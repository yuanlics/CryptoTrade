        "title": "Ethereum retail investors\u2019 sentiment looks bullish, but will it help ETH? - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Investors sentiment toward Ethereum improved of late.\n\nKey metrics such as the MVRV ratio and long/short difference suggest that there may be some selling pressure on Ethereum in the coming days.\n\nEthereum faced a lot of volatility over the past year, especially after the merge. However, according to Santiment\u2019s recent data, the tides may soon turn in Ethereum\u2019s favor as investor sentiment appears to be highly bullish at the moment.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nThe public sentiment\n\nAccording to the data provided by Santiment, traders were interested in Ethereum over other cryptocurrencies such as BNB, BTC, and ADA.\n\nWell, interestingly enough, the sentiment for Ethereum remained positive despite the declining activity on the social front. According to data provided by LunarCrush, the number of social mentions and engagements for Ethereum decreased materially over the last month.\n\nTo be precise, social mentions for Ethereum decreased by 33.7% and the number of engagements fell by 12.8%.\n\nNow, the behavior of the retail and big-pocket investors was in alignment with the bullish demand. Based on the information provided by glassnode, the number of addresses holding more than 10 Ethereum, at the time of writing, reached an all-time high of 352,360 addresses.\n\nIn fact, the number of non-zero addresses on the Ethereum network grew considerably over the last few months. During press time, this metric was at 92.36 million.\n\nAlong with the investors, the validators also supported the network. Based on data provided by Staking Rewards, the number of validators on Ethereum grew by 2.3% over the last 30 days. At press time, there were 496,462 validators.\n\nOne of the reasons for the growing number of validators on the network can be increased revenue. Over the past week, the revenue generated by these validators increased by 14.24%. And at press time, the overall revenue generated by the validators was $959.18M.\n\nThe \u201cTrade\u201d off\n\nThat said, the derivative market of Ethereum had a lot of things going against it.\n\nAccording to data provided by coinglass, the number of short positions being taken against Ethereum increased substantially over the last few days. At the time of writing, 51.53% of all positions taken against ETH were short.\n\nMeanwhile, the MVRV ratio for Ethereum increased over the last last two weeks, according to information provided by Santiment. This suggested that most Ethereum holders would profit if they decided to sell.\n\nA lot of these Ethereum holders who were profitable were short-term holders. This was indicated by the negative long/short difference for Ethereum.\n\nAre your ETH holdings flashing green? Check the profit calculator\n\nSource: Santiment"

According to their tweet, an order has been placed of 26,000 Ethereum put options. The strike price for it was set at $400, the options will expire June 30 this year.\n\n\n\nThe strike price of a put option implies that when the option expires, a trader can sell the underlying asset at this price level even if it goes lower.\n\nRecently, there has been a large order of 26,000 ETH put options with a strike price of $400 and an expiration date of Jun 30. Some traders believe this is the tail management behavior of crypto whales. According to @Blofin_Official pic.twitter.com/VmYC44939h \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) January 7, 2023\n\nThus, some whales are likely to bet on the second largest cryptocurrency to drop to the $400 level, which was last seen in late 2020. However, Wu added that this could also be tail management behavior as whales are buying large amounts of put options to protect their positions.\n\nA user in the comment thread assumed that the whales might be expecting the ETH price to plummet that much once the Ethereum locked in the ETH 2.0 deposit contract is allowed for withdrawals after the Shanghai upgrade.

        "content": "New Release Overview\n\nGrowing momentum of enterprise blockchain use cases drives the need for interoperability between the blockchain platform and other systems, including other blockchain ledgers. To better support our customers' and partners' requirements, 22.4.2 release of Oracle Blockchain Platform and its low-code Blockchain App Builder provides a number of new capabilities to arm developers building sophisticated blockchain solutions. Main features in this release include:\n\nOAuth 2.0 support for REST proxy event callbacks to enable callback delivery authenticated by the subscribing organization's Identity Providers. This extends the current security model based on mutual TLS (certificate exchange) with an OAuth 2.0 security token option for integrating members in consortium networks that need to have event callbacks delivered to their OAuth token-secured enterprise systems.\n\nMore popular web3 API support for OBP users running Solidity smart contracts using an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) on OBP nodes. As more users started taking advantage of these capabilities, this release has certified Fab3 provider for web3 JSON RPC API, making it easier to work with Solidity smart contracts using standard web3 interfaces.\n\nEthereum interoperability enabling developers to combine OBP native smart contract transactions with Ethereum/EVM smart contract transactions in a single atomic operation. This feature extends REST proxy orchestration with Ethereum client to enable invoking Ethereum/EVM-based smart contracts as part of the 2PC-based atomic transaction support released previously. Atomic commits ensure both sides are committed on the leger, or, if either side fails, none are committed.\n\nExtending tokenization SDKs and generated chaincodes in Blockchain App Builder to support the new ERC-1155 specification that allows fungible and non-fungible tokens to be defined in a single template and run in a single chaincode. This multi-token capability, including batch transfers, simplifies more advanced tokenization solutions.\n\nExtending the TTF-based tokenization SDK to support exchange across different fungible tokens on OBP, which enables more complex financial use cases for banks handling multiple currencies or rewards systems with different brands loyalty points that can be exchanged.\n\nThis release is in production deployments at all supported OCI regions today, and can be used by provisioning new OBP instances or upgrading existing ones to the latest release. For detailed documentation on these features see the latest What\u2019s New for Oracle Blockchain Platform.\n\nOAuth2 secure token support\n\nOBP has always supported OAuth2 for inbound REST API requests, but the callbacks triggered by event subscriptions were secured by mutual TLS, which depended on X.509 certificates that a subscribing system had to issue to OBP, and OBP had to include in the callback process. While a very secure approach, issuing and renewing X.509 certificates requires some effort and not all participating parties are able to run PKI systems necessary for this purpose. To make it easier for diverse participants to join the blockchain consortia and use event notifications/callbacks to integrate with their back-office systems, we looked at providing additional security options that are simpler and more broadly accessible. OAuth2 tokens are widely used when connecting systems across company boundaries and their tokens can be automatically issued or refreshed through many Identity Management (IdM) solutions.\n\nRequest/Response flow for event callbakcs using OBP REST Proxy OAuth 2.0 token support\n\nTo use OAuth2 tokens for event subscription callbacks, you have to specify the relevant client ID, client secret, and scope parameters for the target system\u2019s OAuth server when registering an event subscription using an \u201coauth\u201d parameter structure:\n\n\"oauth\": { \"clientID\": \"my-client-id\", \"clientSecret\": \"my-client-secret\", \"tokenUrl\": \"https://identity.example.com/oauth2/v1/token\", \"authInHeader\": true, \"scopes\": [\"urn:opc:idm:__myscopes__\"] }\n\nWeb3 API support\n\nWeb3 API refers to the APIs used by the open source web3.js library, which is a collection of modules that allow you to interact with a local or remote Ethereum node or one emulated by an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). OBP has long supported an EVM option, enabling Solidity developers to easily deploy and run their smart contracts on OBP in a private Ethereum model. In the past, these interactions between the client dApps and Solidity smart contracts were possible through a Remix Ethereum IDE or OBP REST proxy API. However, with growing popularity of web3, more developers want to be able to take advantage of this de-facto standard to interact with smart contracts on multiple networks, including OBP.\n\nIn order to support that, this release supports a Fab3 module built as a gateway between web3.js library and Hyperledger Fabric. It exposes web3 JSON-RPC APIs to external clients and internally maps these requests through the Hyperledger Fabric client SDK to gRPC calls to EVMCC chaincode on OBP nodes, enabling interaction with Solidity smart contracts deployed in EVMCC runtime. This enables standard web3-based clients, such as crypto wallets and other dApps to work with Solidity/EVM contracts on OBP.\n\nWeb3 JSON-RPC API enablement using Fab3 provider with OBP EVM support\n\nEthereum Interoperability with Atomic Transactions\n\nThe worlds of public and permissioned blockchains are growing closer together. More customer and partner solutions embrace both types of distributed ledgers to meet complex requirements, where the performance and confidentiality of permissioned blockchain is as important as broader reach and liquidity of the public blockchains. Oracle blockchain vision fully embraces this interoperability and this release enables it through the orchestration capabilities of OBP REST proxy.\n\nIn the last release we provided an atomicTransaction feature that enabled applications to invoke multiple OBP smart contracts on the same channel or across different channels as a single atomic operation based on 2-Phase Commit (2PC) protocol. It ensured that all the transactions would commit together, or, if any failed, all would be rolled back. While this was a significant innovation within Hyperledger Fabric world, we didn\u2019t stop there. With this release developers can extend the list of smart contracts in atomicTransaction API with a single Ethereum (or EVM-based) smart contract, and still achieve the same atomic result \u2013 all succeed or all get rolled back.\n\nYou might ask how this is possible, since Ethereum, unlike OBP, doesn\u2019t support 2PC protocol for orchestrating atomic transactions. The answer lies in LRC (Last Resource Commit) optimization of 2PC. It essentially enables one non-2PC resource to be included in the 2PC-based global transaction. After the \u201cprepare\u201d phase of the OBP transactions, REST proxy uses a built-in Geth client to execute an Ethereum smart contract transaction and wait for its commit (based on finality rules parameters provided in the API). If it commits, the related OBP transactions then go through their own \u201ccommit\u201d phase. If it fails, then the \u201cprepared\u201d OBP transactions are rolled back. Thus we extend the atomicTransaction API with an \u201clrc\u201d segment that specifies an Ethereum contract to invoke and a set of parameters related to Ethereum invocation, including the finality parameters on how many blocks or how long to wait for the commit on Ethereum side.\n\nEthereum interoperability with OBP orchestrated by OBP REST Proxy\n\nThe following example shows the API details with transactions array for OBP chaincode invocations and lrc section for Ethereum contract invocation. The lrc section includes an ethReq section for signed or unsigned transaction request, and a finalityParams section, which determines how long to wait for transaction finality.\n\n{ \"transactions\": [ {\"chaincode\":\"bt1\",\"args\":[\"invoke\", \"a\", \"b\", \"7\"],\"timeout\":0, \"channel\":\"ch1\"}, {\"chaincode\":\"bt2\",\"args\":[\"invoke\", \"a\", \"b\", \"5\"],\"timeout\":0, \"channel\":\"ch2\"} ], \"lrc\": { \"ethReq\": { \"url\": \"http://<IP address of Ethereum server>:<port>\", \"chainId\": 1337, \"unSignedReq\": { \"privateKey\": \"de1fab4e05b476f81d11901a69e58a3000859395eb6bdb222fcb583b8d599b00\", \"ethValue\": \"1000000000000000000\", \"gasLimit\": 21000, \"toAddress\": \"0x7336d04f97fdccd0a93462947474c8879a5c6597\" }, \"finalityParams\": { \"checkFinality\": true, \"blocksToWait\": 2, \"secondsToWait\": 30 } } }, \"isolationLevel\": \"serializable\", \"prepareTimeout\": 10000, \"sync\": true }\n\nThe unSignedReq section above can also be replaced with a signedReq:\n\nThe result of the Ethereum transaction can be seen in this Etherscan view from Goerli Testnet.\n\nEtherscan view of an Ethereum testnet transaction initiated by OBP as part of a global atomic transaction.\n\nEthereum interoperability with atomic transactions support enables a number of scenarios to support numerous interoperability use cases:\n\nAtomic asset exchange Pre-fund OBP fungible tokens using ETH or ERC-20 tokens Use ETH or ERC-20 tokens to pay for NFTs minted and traded on Oracle Blockchain Prep and mint NFT on Oracle Blockchain, allow NFT buyer to transfer to Ethereum or another Solidity/EVM-based network for secondary market liquidity\n\nUse OBP tokens to track public chain token balances across multiple ledgers or marketplaces\n\nOBP transaction processing using confidential business data generates an event that triggers an Ethereum smart contract, e.g., to process payment or other complex business processes\n\nOBP transaction based on confidential on-ledger data has its hash published on Ethereum as public proof without disclosing any confidential transaction details\n\nERC-1155 Support\n\nBeyond the initial ERC-721 spec for NFTs, a number of new specs have been proposed that extend NFTs in a variety of ways to handle more complex use cases, greater regulatability, etc. One of the more popular extensions in ERC-1155, which combines fungible and non-fungible tokens in a single contract, supports batch transactions across multiple tokens, and provides more dynamic NFT properties. As a leading low-code blockchain development tool our Blockchain App Builder now allows you to specify ERC-1155 tokens by using \u201cstandard: erc1155+\u201d in a token template and defining multiple assets, that can include fungible and non-fungible tokens as well as non-token assets. A sample template using \"erc1155+\" standard is included with the latest version of the Blockchain App Builder.\n\nAs a multi-token digital asset specification, ERC-1155 combines the best of ERC-20 (fungible) and ERC-721 (non-fungible) assets in a single contract, and allows you to convert fungible tokens to NFTs (e.g., pay for an NFT with certain number of loyalty points or coins). With a single ERC-1155 chaincode, a user account can create and hold multiple fungible and NFT token assets, unlike ERC-721 which has a single NFT linked to an account. ERC-1155 also provides for batch transfers via a single smart contract method and provides greater security by allowing safe transfer functions to verify transaction validity and reverse the transaction if it\u2019s not valid. Batch transfers make it not only easier and faster to transfer multiple assets, but open the door to more complex NFT instruments. And the ability to convert between NFTs and fungible tokens in a single operation is going to optimize a number of NFT- related transactions and enable new tokenization use cases.\n\nEvolving tokenization specs\n\nWhat about that \u201c+\u201d in \u201cerc1155+\u201d standard? Just like with ERC-721 we have extended ERC-1155 to include burn method, account management features (creating, associating, suspending, and resuming custodial accounts on-chain), and role-based security to control who can mint and burn these tokens. Look for a more detailed post on ERC-1155 features soon.\n\nToken exchange for TTF-based fungible tokens\n\nSome of the more popular use cases for fungible tokens are in financial sector, where tokens represent digital currency, or in rewards programs where they represent loyalty points for different brands. In both of these areas, exchange between currencies or exchange of loyalty points between brands is an important requirement. There are a few approaches to exchanging tokens, and we selected one of the fastest growing mechanisms known as exchange pools (a.k.a. liquidity pools.) Exchange pools are modeled on an equivalent of a liquidity pool concept in the financial system or cryptocurrency \u2013 these are just accounts maintained by a trusted party that contain multiple currencies. They can be funded by any other parties called Liquidity Providers who transfer funds to an exchange pool, usually in exchange for fees collected from exchange pool users. However, instead of having to rely on external liquidity pools, we enable users to create and fund them directly on OBP ledger as part of our tokenization engine and enable liquidity providers to join OBP as members to transfer funds into OBP exchange pools.\n\nTo use token exchange method you need to first invoke the methods to set up the exchange pool facility and set the conversion rate. Then liquidity providers from multiple token systems can transfer tokens into it, which funds the exchange pool accounts. Once ready, the exchange itself is done with a single method call:\n\nTokenConversion(from_token_id string, to_token_id string, to_org_id string, to_user_id string, token_quantity float64)\n\nFor example: TokenConversion(\u201cTokX\u201d, \u201dTokY\u201d, \u201cAccount2\u201d, \u201cAccount2_user\u201d, 10)\n\nWhen invoked via this API the tokenization SDK then initiates an exchange transaction from Account 1 (the invoker) for 10 units of TokX to be delivered to Account2 as TokY. Under the covers, this involves transferring 10 TokX to the exchange pool account, where it\u2019s credited and a corresponding amount of TokY (based on the exchange rate set through the pool API) is debited from the exchange pool and is transferred to the target account.\n\nExchange pool mechanism in Oracle blockchain tokenization engine\n\nFor example, let\u2019s say we have one token named USD and another one EUR, and an exchange pool defined for USD and EUR funded with 100 units of USD and 70 units of EUR, and a conversion rate set at 0.95 EUR to 1 USD. We can invoke a transfer method from Account 1 for 10 USD for delivery to Account 2 in EUR. This would debit Account 1 10 USD tokens, credit these to the exchange pool USD account, debit exchange pool EUR account 10.52 EUR tokens (10/0.95), and credit this amount to Account 2 in EUR. As the result, the total amounts of USD and EUR in the system remain as they were before the transaction, and we have achieved an exchange by crediting and debiting the required amount within the exchange pool accounts. This mechanism is similar to market makers used in foreign exchanges with systemic banks often providing liquidity pool services. With our token exchange, you can implement a multi-currency CBDC system or any financial instruments that need to operate in a multi-currency world.\n\nSummary\n\nThe complexity of blockchain use cases is on the rise, and with it comes a strong need for interoperability \u2013 with other enterprise systems and across multiple blockchain technologies. Making this not only functional, but easy-to-use and easy-to-secure is a challenge facing many blockchain platforms. The latest Oracle Blockchain Platform release addresses these challenges head on in the following ways:\n\nOAuth2 token support makes enterprise integration of event callbacks easier to secure within the member's enterprise IdM ecosystem and more broadly appealing.\n\nBeing able to execute multiple transactions across different blockchain channels in an atomic manner is crucial to many use cases. No blockchain implementations other than Oracle Blockchain Platform supports such use cases without the need to change existing chaincodes and/or to introduce complex, and vulnerable bridging solutions.\n\nWith Fab3 provider for web3 JSON-RPC APIs we\u2019ve made it easier to integrate common crypto wallets and dApps with Solidity/EVM contracts on OBP. You can use this to run a private Solidity/Ethereum solution on the managed OBP service in OCI and integrate with standard wallets and other dApps.\n\nAs NFTs move beyond digital art and collectibles, more advanced capabilities are needed to model different forms of assets, combining both fungible and non-fungible capabilities. With ERC-1155 we are enabling developers to take full advantage of the latest approaches to making NFTs more useful and easier to adapt to real-world use cases.\n\nAnd with fungible token exchange, we are enabling digital currency or rewards programs to easily operate in a multi-currency or multi-brand world leveraging OBP-supported exchange pools mechanism.\n\nAll this and many other innovative capabilities show the power of Oracle blockchain to support your tomorrow today."

        "content": "The Shanghai upgrade of the Ethereum network, set to launch in March, will allow users to withdraw their ether (ETH) from the network.\n\nA public test network for the Shanghai upgrade will be released by the end of February.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade has generated excitement among some due to the potential for competition between Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs) after the upgrade.\n\nThe LDO token, associated with the Lido DAO, has recently seen strong performance with a 71% increase in value over the past week.\n\nShanghai Upgrade\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade of the Ethereum network will focus on allowing users to withdraw their ether (ETH) from the network. This upgrade, set to launch in March, will enable users to access coins that have been staked on the network as part of the transition to proof-of-stake consensus, which occurred in September.\n\nIn order to meet the March deadline, the developers plan to release a public test network for the Shanghai upgrade by the end of February. During the recent core developers call, it was decided not to consider adding the Ethereum Virtual Machine Object Format (EOF) to the upgrade due to concerns that it may delay the rollout. The priority for the Shanghai upgrade is to ensure the smooth implementation of the withdrawals feature.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade of the Ethereum network, scheduled for March 2023, has generated excitement among some as they anticipate competition between LSD (Liquid Staking Derivatives).\n\nThere are a few anticipated potential outcomes following the upgrade.\n\nPotential Sell Pressure: A possibility is that there could be increased sell pressure from large investors or those looking to sell their assets.\n\nStakers Will Not UnStake: Another possibility is that stakers may continue as per usual, with no change in their behavior.\n\nStakers Will move their unstaked ETH in LSDs: Another anticipated possibility is that investors may move their newly unstaked Ethereum to Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs) in order to benefit from higher returns and decentralized finance functionality. This could potentially result in new innovations and developments in the space.\n\nWhat is Liquid Staking?\n\nLiquid staking, also known as \u201csoft staking,\u201d is a way to earn rewards by locking up funds while still retaining access to them. This is in contrast to traditional staking on the Beacon Chain, which involves a larger investment of 32 ETH (around $40,000) and does not allow for funds to be withdrawn until the staking period is over. With liquid staking, any amount can be staked and the funds can be withdrawn at any time.\n\nOnce staked ETH becomes available for withdrawal, the revenue of liquid staking providers is expected to increase. Liquid staking derivatives allow for participation in decentralized finance without sacrificing staking yields. Examples of this include Lido, which offers stETH staking and LDO tokens that earn yields, though it does take a 10% cut of the staking rewards. Rocket Pool is another well-known provider that emphasizes decentralization and offers competitive returns. Other notable providers in this space include Stakewise and Frax Finance, both of which have seen rapid growth. Stader Labs is also planning to launch an Ethereum liquid staking derivative in the first quarter of the year, and it is possible that other companies may follow suit.\n\nThe LDO token, which is associated with the Lido DAO, has experienced strong performance recently, with a 71% increase in value over the past week according to CoinGecko."

        "content": "More than 2.8 million Web3 domain names were created using the blockchain-based naming protocol known as ENS (Ethereum Name Service) by the end of 2022.\n\nAccording to this dashboard created on the analytics platform, Dune Analytics, more than 630,000 unique wallets created 2.82 million domain names, with 459,000 of those classified as \u2018primary names.\u2019\n\nThe 2.82 million figure represents over 80% of all registrations since the service started in 2017.\n\nPrimary names are ENS addresses that resolve to a user\u2019s crypto wallet and can be used as a proxy to search for information on blockchain explorers, such as Etherscan.\n\nWe can also see that September 2022 saw the most ENS registrations at more than 430,000 unique domains, while December 2022 recorded the lowest at just 52,000 domains.

ENS converts human-readable Ethereum addresses like john.eth into the machine-readable alphanumeric codes you know from wallets like Metamask.\n\nENS\n\nThe goal of Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is to make the Ethereum-based web easier to access and comprehend for humans \u2013 similar to how the Internet\u2019s Domain Name Service (DNS) makes the internet more accessible by providing .com names for websites in place of numeric internet-protocol addresses.\n\nLike DNS, ENS also uses a system of dot-separated hierarchical names called domains with domain owners fully controlling their sub-domains. The service provides users with an easily readable name such as \u2018abc.eth\u2019 instead of a complex, long-form alphanumeric address for their crypto wallets.\n\nAs such, users get to link these names also to their wallets and they can then use them for transactions across the blockchain including the purchasing of NFTs and participating in DeFi. The names can also be purchased as non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\n_____________________________________\n\nFollow us on Twitter for the latest posts and updates\n\nJoin and interact with our Telegram community\n\n_____________________________________\n\n_____________________________________"

        "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe crypto market started off the week slowly due to the holiday season but picked up a pace later in the week. Bitcoin began trading at the US$16,584 level. It has been trading in a narrow range between $16,256 and $17,061 in recent days, indicating a lack of strong movement from either bulls or bears.On Thursday, BTC started consolidating above the $16,800 level as market volatility remained high following the release of the Federal Open Market Committee's minutes. The bank expects a more aggressive rise in inflation to be at 3.5% this year, which is higher than expected. Bitcoin declined by nearly 75% since its all-time high of US$69,000 in November 2021. In the past 24 hours, BTC has traded above the US$16,900 level. Resistance level for BTC is at $17,000. However, a clear move above the US$17,000 level might create a sense of confidence among the bulls to move further in value in the coming week.On the other hand, Ethereum also consolidated marginally with momentum on Thursday. However, despite a small drop, sentiment remains somewhat bullish as ETH continues to trade above the US$1,250 level. Other major cryptocurrencies also spend much of this week in a similar trend to BTC and ETH.In an interesting turn of events, the UK will soon enforce a tax exemption for foreign investors purchasing crypto through local investment managers or brokers.

        "title": "Enabling MEV as a user choice with Allnodes - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "The rapid rise of cryptocurrencies in recent years has led to a billion-dollar industry with top companies and trading platforms integrating trading strategies toward getting maximum returns on their investment.\n\nThe complex nature of trading strategies has brought about new terminologies and concepts, and MEV is regarded as one of the new novel concepts in the crypto industry.\n\nWhat is MEV?\n\nMEV, or maximum extractable value, is the extra monetary value users can get from a block production in addition to staking rewards or gas fees. When transactions in the block are included, excluded, or rearranged in favor of more profitable ones, MEV is generated.\n\nBecause transaction placement and speed are critical in trading, MEV employs various strategies that mimic front running on Wall Street, such as sandwich attacks and back running. These strategies are most commonly found on blockchains such as Ethereum, where smart contracts play an important role in transaction processing.\n\nTypical settlement mechanisms on the blockchain allow orders to be organized in batches and exposed before settling, allowing any agent to propose a series of trades. If these arbitrageurs use the standard transaction channel for their transactions, they risk being exploited.\n\nFor example, Ethereum\u2019s original architecture called for all pending transactions to be kept in the mempool, where the public could view them before being submitted to a peer-to-peer validator network for processing. Knowledgeable users could evaluate the pending transactions and execute their deal ahead by submitting the same trades with themselves listed as beneficiaries and a higher fee.\n\nWhat are the negative impacts of MEV?\n\nMEV front running and sandwich attacks inflate asset values and increase network congestion and gas fees. Prioritizing trades over other transactions increases the amount of gas required for the transaction and slows down the network. Sandwich attacks are also harmful to the network because they increase slippage and cause problems with transaction execution.\n\nWhat is MEV Relayer?\n\nAn MEV relay is a trusted mediator between block producers and block builders, which helps solve some of the inherent problems of MEV. Essentially, it\u2019s a separate piece of open-source software run by validators that queries and outsources block-building to a network of builders.\n\nThis open-source middleware gives access to a competitive block-building market. The consensus layer client of a validator proposes the most profitable block received from the MEV relayer to the Ethereum network for attestation and block inclusion.\n\nRelayers increase block rewards while also preventing arbitrage and bad actors from extracting and manipulating transactions, separating the role of proposers from block builders and having a net positive effect for end-users transacting on chain.\n\nWhy should I use an MEV Relayer?\n\nThe primary reason anyone participating in staking or running a validator should run an MEV relayer is to increase their yield. MEV Boost can increase your rewards 3-4x over vanilla blocks.\n\nIt is equally important to mention that public MEV relayers have been developed to support the sustainable and democratized distribution of block reward, reducing the negative impacts of MEV mentioned above. Relayers can also censor blocks, this topic is currently under much discussion within the various blockchain communities.\n\nWho are the main MEV services?\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that many MEV relayers are not mutually exclusive, bundles can and are often sent through multiple routers.\n\nFlashbots: Flashbots is a research and development organization founded to mitigate the negative externalities posed to stateful blockchains, beginning with Ethereum.\n\nBlocknative: Blocknative provides solutions for real-time blockchain transaction management, optimization, and maximizing block rewards for public blockchain networks.\n\nBloxRoute: The bloXroute MEV service allows traders to submit MEV bundles and participate in merged bundles with other traders with three services: Max Profit, Ethical and Regulated.\n\nEden Network: Eden is a priority transaction network that protects traders from frontrunning, aligns block producer incentives, and redistributes miner extractable value.\n\nManifold Finance: Manifold Finance functions as an intermediary between Ethereum users and validators. It consolidates all Ethereum transactions in the best possible way to create a block that delivers the highest return on investment for all stakeholders.\n\nHow can you use MEV?\n\nIf you are technical enough to run your own Ethereum validator and meet the minimum requirements, you can install and run the relayers above. However, most people are staking Ethereum with a staking service such as Allnodes, which offers 1 click staking and allows you to maintain control over your keys.\n\nWhen choosing a staking service, it\u2019s important to see if the increase in MEV-boosted block rewards is being sent to you. Services like Allnodes do not take a cut of MEV-related rewards, so 100% of the yield is directed back to the end user (staker).\n\nThe other important decision is which MEV relayer to choose. Some services will not give you a choice, whereas Allnodes provides the user with an option directly in the UI on which MEV they want to use.\n\n\u201cWe run over 15k Ethereum nodes, so we decided the best option is to allow our users to choose what MEV relayer they want to deploy directly in the UI with a simple click. It\u2019s a no-brainer to support the sustainable and democratized distribution of block production while also getting more rewards for staking\u201d\n\n-Robert Ellison \u2013 Head of Growth at Allnodes\n\nWe recommend visiting a site like https://www.rated.network/relays to decide which MEV relayer you want to use.\n\nAllnodes give users a choice of MEV\n\nAllnodes is a non-custodial platform that allows you to host nodes, stake, and monitor blockchain addresses in a few clicks. Their primary goal as Ethereum validators is to maximize rewards for their customers safely and effectively while at the same time securing the network. As such, they are committed to best practices for MEV, with all rewards returning to the end user.\n\nAs an Ethereum validator on Allnodes, your revenue from staking will increase substantially with MEV. Furthermore, the additional revenue distribution is automatic and won\u2019t require technical know-how on your part. You can start hosting your own Eth node here if you have the required minimum of 32 Eth or if you have the minimum of 16 Eth and would like to use Rocketpool.\n\nDisclaimer: This is a paid post and should not be treated as news/advice."

Despite the token\u2019s steep daily decline, its price has increased by more than 2,000% over the last seven days. As a new meme coin, the SHIB killer is on course to surpass Dogecoin\u2019s (DOGE) and Shiba Inu\u2019s return records, and many members of its community think its bullish momentum is just beginning.\n\nBonk\u2019s Unique Design, The Oomph Factor?\n\nDespite being a relatively new meme coin, the BONK token has a very distinctive design, one of which is its deflationary nature. Of the 56 trillion coins in circulation, the BONK token has burned more than 500 billion tokens thus far.\n\nThe new Solana mobile phone Saga is probably going to be used to burn the meme coin\u2019s tokens as well, according to the design of the coin\u2019s burning mechanism. When a user on Twitter mentioned that he could think about using BONK tokens to purchase the phone if some of the revenue will be burned off, Solana Mobile suggested it.\n\nTherefore, in addition to using BONK to pay for the Saga phone, it\u2019s also possible that the business will burn some of the new meme coin tokens it makes from sales.\n\nA new meme coin from Solana is being compared to Shiba Inu by many (SHIB). Additionally, BONK has burn features, just like SHIB. However, compared to SHIB\u2019s 549 trillion in circulating supply, $BONK has a significantly smaller 99.185 trillion."

        "title": "Is Ether ($ETH) a Better Long-Term Bet Than Bitcoin ($BTC)? - CryptoGlobe",
        "content": "Although both $BTC and $ETH are currently down roughly 75% from their all-time highs (which were reached in November 2021), quite a few recent tweets and articles about these two cryptocurrencies suggest that the general perception in the crypto community is that the latter is probably a better long-term bet.\n\nIt is difficult to definitively say whether Ether (ETH) is a better long-term bet than Bitcoin (BTC). Both cryptocurrencies have their own unique characteristics and have performed well in the past, and it is ultimately up to individual investors to decide which one aligns more with their investment goals and risk tolerance.\n\nOne argument in favor of Ether as a long-term investment is its potential for wider adoption. While Bitcoin is primarily used as a store of value and a means of exchange, Ether has the added use case of powering smart contracts on the Ethereum platform. This makes Ether an attractive investment for those who believe in the potential of decentralized applications (dApps) and the wider adoption of blockchain technology.\n\nAnother argument in favor of Ether is its strong developer community and support. Ethereum has one of the largest and most active developer communities in the cryptocurrency space, which has contributed to the platform\u2019s ongoing evolution and growth. This strong community support can provide a level of stability and security for Ether investors.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that Bitcoin also has a strong developer community and has proven to be a resilient and secure cryptocurrency over the years. Bitcoin has the advantage of being the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, which gives it a level of brand recognition and mainstream visibility that Ether does not yet have. Additionally, Bitcoin has a limited supply of 21 million coins, which gives it a level of scarcity that can make it a more attractive store of value for investors.\n\nOn Thursday (5 January 2023), Mike McGlone, a Senior Macro Strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence (Bloomberg\u2019s research arm on the Bloomberg Terminal\u201d), shared his outlook for Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nIn the January 2023 edition of Bloomberg Intelligence\u2019s \u201cCrypto Outlook\u201d report, McGlone (and the two contributing analysts he worked with on this research) said:\n\n\u201cEthereum\u2019s upward performance vs. Bitcoin has been unshaken by 2022 deflation in most risk assets and may be gaining underpinnings. At a ratio of about 0.07, the Ethereum/Bitcoin cross rate is the same as in May 2021, when the Nasdaq 100 Stock index was about 20% higher.\n\n\u201cOur graphic shows the enduring trend of the No. 2 crypto outperforming No, 1, which appeared coincident with the rise of risk assets. The 2022 drop of about 30% in the index is part of a receding tide, including about a 70% decline in Ethereum. Migration into the mainstream is our takeaway, and once the dust settles from some reversion in risk assets amid inflation pressure, Ethereum appears more likely to resume what it\u2019s been doing \u2014 outperforming.\u201c\n\nThe popular pseudonymous host of crypto market analysis show \u201cCoin Bureau\u201d says that if the Shanghai upgrade goes well, \u201c2023 could be a really big year for Ethereum and for ETH.\u201d\n\nAccording to a report by The Block, at Ethereum Core Devs Meeting #151, which was held on 8 December 2022, a provisional timeline for the completion of the Shanghai upgrade, also known as Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4895, was set. This upgrade will enable users to withdraw their staked funds from the Ethereum blockchain, a feature that is currently not available. According to Cointelegraph, \u201cdevelopers will aim for May or June 2023 to launch the Ethereum Improvement Protocol (EIP) 4844 upgrade that will introduce proto-danksharding to the network.\u201d\n\nLast month, Coin Bureau released a video update (titled \u201cQ&A: ETH Predictions, BTC & Crypto Market in 2023!\u201d) and according to a report by The Daily Hodl, the host of the show had this to say about the potential impact of the upcoming Shanghai network upgrade and the overall outlook for Ethereum in 2023:\n\n\u201cWhen they see that that ETH can in fact be unstaked and easily sold, then it might incentivize them to actually stake themselves. So I really think it could go either way. Now, I wouldn\u2019t at all be surprised if it was slightly bearish in the short term if we do see some selling. But I think the future for ETH is so, so bright, and I think Shanghai, assuming it goes off without a hitch as the merge did, then I think 2023 could be a really big year for Ethereum and for ETH...\n\n\u201cPrice prediction, I don\u2019t know\u2026 I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see a five-figure ETH in 2023, but I think that\u2019s entirely possible. We could, of course see, a flippening, but I\u2019m not sure. I\u2019m expecting very much kind of sideways price action for ETH over the course of next year.\u201c\n\nOn 19 August 2022, Real Vision Founder and CEO Raoul Pal took to Twitter to say that although he does not expect the Ether price to reach \u201cnew lows\u201d (i.e. go below the June 18 low of $902), there could be a \u201cgut-check quick drop\u201d; however, he also pointed out that for him \u201cnew lows\u201d means that he will buy even more $ETH since he finds Ether\u2019s \u201c2-year risk/reward\u201d quite attractive.\n\nEssentially, Pal believes that at worst, $ETH could fall to the $800-$900 range, but the upside is much bigger since \u2014 as he has said in the past \u2014 he expects the $ETH price to reach $20,000 in the next couple of years.\n\nAh, the old cheeky pre-merge crypto shakeout I see\u2026 I don't expect new lows but most likely a gut-check quick drop, but let's see.\n\n\n\nNew lows = keep adding (for me) as 2-year risk/reward gets really, really attractive\n\n\n\n50% downside vs possible 10x upside = 20:1 R/R#ETH #BTC \u2014 Raoul Pal (@RaoulGMI) August 19, 2022\n\nOne popular crypto analyst who agrees with Pal\u2019s view that Ethereum will outperform Bitcoin in the next few years is Ben Armstrong, who told his over 880K Twitter followers that he expects $ETH to have a higher market cap than $BTC by 2025:\n\n2017: Ethereum outperformed Bitcoin\n\n2021: Ethereum outperformed Bitcoin\n\n2025: ThIs TiMe It WiLl Be DiFfErEnT\n\n\n\nYea it will be different. Because $ETH will have a higher market cap than $BTC in 2025 \u2014 Ben Armstrong (@Bitboy_Crypto) August 19, 2022\n\nOf course, there are those who believe that Bitcoin might in fact be the best store-of-value asset and that as this view becomes more widely held, the price for one Bitcoin in the next 10 years could easily reach $1 million (something which ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood believes) and maybe even go as high as $23 million (as Blockware Solutions seems to be believe).\n\nRegardless of which of these two cryptocurrencies has more price increase potential in the long term, one thing that seems undeniable is that Bitcoin has much higher regulatory clarity in the U.S. than Ether since both former SEC Chair Jay Clayton and current SEC Chair Gary Gensler have on several occasions have confirmed that they consider Bitcoin to be a commodity rather than a security and therefore outside their purview. Sadly, the same cannot be said about Ether.\n\nApart from what William Hinman, a former Director of the SEC\u2019s Division of Corporation Finance, said during a speech in June 2018, the SEC\u2019s position is that it has never in any official form stated that Ethereum is a commodity or a security, i.e. it is possible (especially if Ripple Labs loses the on-going lawsuit started against it by the SEC in December 2020) that any day in the future the SEC could decide to declare that Ether is a security, which could have a huge negative impact on its price since crypto exchanges in the U.S. would then have to delist it.\n\nSo, although we can\u2019t be certain which of these two cryptocurrencies is a better long-term bet as far profit potential is concerned, at this stage, with the lack of regulatory clarity that we currently have in the U.S., the safer long-term bet seems to be Bitcoin.\n\nIt is important for investors to carefully consider their individual goals and risk tolerance before making a decision. It may be helpful for investors to diversify their portfolio by including both Ether and Bitcoin, as well as other cryptocurrencies and traditional assets. It is also important for investors to be aware of the inherent risks of investing in cryptocurrencies and to carefully research and understand the assets they are considering before making any investments.\n\nImage Credit\n\nFeatured Image via Pixabay"

        "title": "Cryptocurrencies to watch for the week of January 9, 2023 - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "As the first week of 2023 ends, most cryptocurrencies have traded in the green zone after massive sell-offs over the past year. Notably, some assets aim to build on the fuel that has inspired a mini-rally as a foundation for sustained gains.\n\nIn particular, several digital currencies are already standing out, aided by the specific narrative they drive alongside increasing use cases. Therefore, below are the top five cryptocurrencies to watch for the week of January 9.\n\nBitcoin (BTC)\n\nThe flagship cryptocurrency is leading the market in gains after receiving a boost from positive employment data in the United States. Although Bitcoin (BTC) is trading in the shadow of the previous highs, the crypto has sustained solid gains across 2023. At the same time, as the new week starts, Bitcoin\u2019s price remains of focus, especially with more macroeconomic data expected to come out. In this line, the upcoming Consumer Price Index (CPI) and inflation data will likely influence the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy and consequently risk assets like Bitcoin.\n\nNotably, as reported by Finbold, crypto trading expert and analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe stated that inflation data is likely to be good and might spell good fortunes for the asset. Overall, the analyst pointed out that Bitcoin has higher odds of breaking out in the coming week after testing key resistance levels while targeting $17,000.\n\nBy the time of publishing, Bitcoin was trading at $16,943 with daily gains of about 0.1%. On the weekly chart, BTC has rallied over 2%.\n\nBitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nBased on the recent price movement, Bitcoin is attempting to put behind the sideway trading pattern and break above $17,000. However, it is worth noting that moving into 2023, Bitcoin is still facing a cloud of uncertainty, considering the threat of an extended sell-off from incidents such as the FTX crypto exchange collapse and the Fed\u2019s next policy. However, Bitcoin will look forward to building on milestones achieved in 2022 despite the bear market.\n\nFrom a technical analysis perspective, Bitcoin offers mixed signals on the daily gauges. A summary aligns with \u2018neutral\u2019 at 8, while moving averages are for \u2018buy\u2019 at 8. Elsewhere, oscillators recommend the \u2018sell\u2019 sentiment at 3.\n\nBitcoin technical analysis. Source: TradingView\n\nSolana (SOL)\n\nThe decentralized finance (DeFi) token appears to defy recent concerns about its future due to close ties with the now-collapsed FTX crypto exchange and its founder Sam Bankman-Fried. Indeed, the concerns resulted in SOL dropping to as low as $8. However, part of the current resurgence resulted in Solana witnessing an over $1.5 billion capital inflow within a week as of January 6.\n\nAlthough SOL has historically rallied in line with the general market, the latest price movement is heavily linked to the hype around the Bonk (BONK) meme cryptocurrency that seeks to emulate Shiba Inu (SHIB). Notably, after BONK was airdropped to Solana non-fungible token (NFT) communities and creators, SOL recorded a surge in value and trading volume.\n\nTherefore, moving into the new week, SOL remains an asset to watch, and the sustainability of the BONK hype. This is vital considering that SOL has no other possible specific bullish triggers for a rally while the effects of FTX collapse are lingering; the network is also facing scrutiny over the constant outages that characterized the platform in 2022.\n\nBy press time, SOL, or the \u2018Ethereum (ETH) killer,\u2019 was trading at $13.85 with gains of almost about 5% in the last 24 hours. On the weekly chart, SOL has gained by over 35%.\n\nSolana seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nAmid the short-term gains by SOL, the machine learning algorithm at PricePredictions indicates that SOL is likely to be in a consolidation phase at the current price by the end of the month. The forecast suggests that SOL will trade at $13.75 on January 31, 2023.\n\nElsewhere, Solana\u2019s one-day technical analysis summary indicates the \u2018buy\u2019 sentiment at 10, while moving averages are also for buying at 8.\n\nSolana technical analysis. Source: TradingView\n\nLido DAO (LDO)\n\nLido DAO, the liquid staking solution for Ethereum, has spiked in value and market cap, to the surprise of most investors. Although the native token of Lido Finance has also moved in accordance with the general market, the latest rally can be linked to the upcoming Ethereum Shanghai upgrade that saw developers set a date before March.\n\nNotably, the upgrade is expected to release staked Ethereum after the Merge update. In this line, Lido Finance accounts for almost 25% of staked Ethereum, making it one of the largest liquid staking platforms for Ethereum. Therefore, with the possibility of more people withdrawing their staked Ethereum after the upgrade, the Lido platform will likely benefit as potential investors use its platform to stake.\n\nConsequently, moving into the week of January 9, investors need to monitor the asset to see if it will sustain the gains. At the moment, the token is facing the possibility of experiencing selling pressure, with the likelihood of investors taking profits remaining high.\n\nBy press time, Lido DAO was trading at $1.61 with daily gains of almost 8%. The weekly chart shows that LDO was up over 60%.\n\nLido DAO seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nBased on TradingView\u2019s technical analysis, LDO is facing bullish sentiments. A summary of the daily gauges is for a \u2018strong buy\u2019 at 16, similar to moving averages at 14. Oscillators are \u2018neutral\u2019 at 8.\n\nLido DAO technical analysis. Source: TradingView.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC)\n\nEthereum Classic\u2019s (ETC) latest rally has seen the Ethereum fork reclaim $20, a position considered a fundamental support level for the asset. Although the trigger for the rally remains vague, ETC has witnessed increased network activity that might influence the price movement.\n\nNotably, the network\u2019s hash rate has spiked recently, translating into a possible surge in miner profitability. It\u2019s worth mentioning that following the Ethereum Merge upgrade, ETC has stood out to benefit, considering ETH miners need minimal upgrades to start mining on the network.\n\nFurthermore, ETC\u2019s price could be benefiting from a short-squeeze approach from its community. For instance, data from the crypto analysis platform Santiment noted that ETC had witnessed increased trading volume alongside being shorted significantly by traders. Therefore, with no formidable trigger, focusing on ETC price will be essential, especially if traders start taking profits.\n\nBy press time, ETC was trading at $20.02 with weekly gains of over 27%.\n\nEthereum Classic seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nFurthermore, ETC technical analysis offers mixed sentiment with a summary aligning with \u2018neutral\u2019 at 9. Moving averages are for \u2018buy\u2019 at 9.\n\nEthereum Classic technical analysis. Source: TradingView\n\nCardano (ADA)\n\nAcross 2022, Cardano (ADA) attained several milestones, with the network recording sustained development activity that is considered a key catalyst for a possible price rally. Consequently, in the first week of 2023, ADA\u2019s price has gained double digits. It is worth noting that Cardano\u2019s value has mainly followed the general market sentiment in its price trajectory.\n\nInterestingly, ADA has rallied despite the Cardano network being embroiled in an NFT controversy. In particular, founder Charles Hoskison was at the center of attention after initially declining to buy an NFT that he had used for his profile picture on Twitter.\n\nAlthough the rally trigger cannot be instantly identified, ADA\u2019s gains can partly be linked to the Cardano DeFi ecosystem expansion. In this line, ADA\u2019s total locked value has recently witnessed minor gains.\n\nAt the same time, investors\u2019 interest in ADA might be increasingly triggered by sustained whale activity in the token. In the meantime, Cardano continues to rank among cryptocurrencies with the highest development activity on GitHub. Overall, ADA is the center of attention moving into the next week, as the focus will be on the sustainability of the gains.\n\nBy press time, ADA was trading at $0.29 with daily gains of almost 5%. On the weekly chart, Cardano is up 17%.\n\nCardano seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nThe latest gains have thrust ADA technical analysis into the bullish zone. A summary of the daily gauges on TradingView is for \u2018buy\u2019 at 12, similar to moving averages at 9.\n\nCardano technical analysis. Source: TradingView\n\nIn general, the week of January 9 is huge for the crypto space considering the implication of the upcoming inflation data and how the Federal Reserve will respond. At the same time, the focus will be on how the market reacts to any regulatory outlook considering the Fed recently warned banks against engaging with crypto.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "Don\u2019t invest unless prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, you shouldn\u2019t expect to be protected if something goes wrong.\n\nJoin Our Telegram channel to stay up to date on breaking news coverage\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) story traces back to 2015 when Vitalik Buterin and a team of developers developed the Ethereum network. However, Ethereum was founded in 2013, and developments started in 2014. During this time, 1 ETH was auctioned for $0.31 as part of the developers\u2019 crowdfunding campaign. In the past week, Ethereum price registered good bids above the $1,165 level against the U.S. Dollar, forming a base and slowly moving higher above the $1,180 level.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum price is trading at $1,263, after losing 0.12% in the last 24 hours. The second largest crypto recorded a 24-hour trading volume of $2.57 billion and a live market cap of $154.6 billion, placing it at #2 on CoinMarketCap.\n\nEthereum Investors Hoping For Things To Turn Positive After Last Year\n\nThe year 2022 was a difficult period in the crypto industry, to say the least, as the whole market lost almost 64% in value. Things were somewhat different for Ethereum as the smart contract crypto as it lost 68% in the year, making investors wonder whether things will turn around in 2023.\n\nThe ecosystem saw a huge upgrade, dubbed The Merge, when Ethereum transitioned from the energy-intensive Proof-of-Work mechanism, which naysayers hate about the king crypto Bitcoin, to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism. Ethereum supporters were eager for the second-largest crypto to complete the event as it would result in a much more sustainable and energy-efficient blockchain network.\n\nThe Merge event enabled Ethereum to implement a new feature christened sharding, which splits up the whole Ethereum network load into several distinct portions with their smart contracts. As per information on the official Ethereum website, the network will integrate the sharding upscale sometime within 2023.\n\nWith Ethereum upgrading to a PoS system, together with the sharding possibility, the network has paved the way for the ETH token to position itself for another more expansive adoption. This comes as investors hope the two updates will lead to reduced fees and a rise in network throughput. Should the two positive outcomes prevail, it would have eliminated two of the most prominent criticisms of Ethereum, slow and expensive.\n\nNevertheless, based on data from bitinfocharts.com, Ethereum can only facilitate a speed of 13 transactions per second today, which is far less than what is required to deliver greater adoption. In fairness, there are plenty of unchecked boxes in the Ethereum ecosystem as it is an entirely new technology and unexpected speed bumps may happen.\n\nAdditionally, there is much uncertainty regarding new regulations that may occur following the negative activities that have taken place in the industry throughout 2022. Still, ETH proponents now have tangible advancements that they can point to for confidence with the Ethereum network setting itself up to attain its long-term potential.\n\nWill Ethereum Price Return To $1,400?\n\nEthereum price is currently trading at $1,263 as the bulls target the $1,400 range high. The price is currently relying on the support offered by the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) after it was flipped from resistance on Wednesday, January 4.\n\nCurrently, the bulls are facing immediate resistance at the $1,295 level, which is embraced by the 100-day SMA. If bulls can increase their buying pressure past this hurdle, they can face the next resistance at the $1,350 level. In highly ambitious cases, ETH bulls could push the price to tag the $1,400 psychological level, embraced by the 200-day SMA.\n\nThe relative strength index (RSI) at 50 is advancing toward the positive zone, which shows that the price may increase.\n\nETH/USD Daily Chart\n\nOn the downside, if the Ethereum price drops further and records a daily candlestick close below the 50-day SMA support, then Ethereum price could drop further to retest the support level at$1,180 and if selling pressure increases, then the price could descend lower to the revisit the range low at $1,165.\n\nOther Projects To Consider In the Second Week of 2023\n\nThe cryptocurrency market witnessed a lot of activities in the past year, but as the year approached its end, many new became cryptos charged up and ready to bring exceptional value to traders and investors alike. Among the projects are Dash 2 Trade and Calvaria, which pass as two of the best projects to invest in the second week of 2023.\n\nDash 2 Trade Hits $13.6 Million As Presale Sells Out \u2013 6 Days Left To Buy Before CEX Listing\n\nThe Dash 2 Trade presale is now over after the project raised $13.6 million. This means that there are only a few days left for interested investors to buy the project\u2019s D2T tokens before the CEX listings.\n\n?IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT!? \u2714\ufe0fThe claim functionality will go live at the same time as the Uniswap launch \u2013 in order to prevent anyone from creating a pool beforehand. ?\ufe0fWednesday, 11th of January Stay tuned! ? pic.twitter.com/qHSYMpiNaL \u2014 Dash 2 Trade (@dash2_trade) January 6, 2023\n\nThe project is very popular, as evidenced by the number of waves it made during the presale. From inception, Dash 2 Trade had the objective to raise $13.4 million. However, the raised amount as of press time is $13.6 and still going strong.\n\nAnyone who still wants to buy into this amazing project should know that they still have time to acquire their D2T tokens before the first listing on a centralized exchange on January 11. This means a maximum of six days are remaining.\n\nVisit Das 2 Trade here\n\nCalvaria Presale Raises $2.63 Million as Just 15% of RIA Tokens Remain\n\nCalvaria: Duels of Eternity is a battle card game where users or gamers have access to powerful mystical characters.
