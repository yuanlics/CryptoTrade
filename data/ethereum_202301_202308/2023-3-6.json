        "title": "Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade: What you need to know - Kraken Blog",
        "content": "The Shanghai upgrade is a set of changes to the Ethereum protocol that will allow users to unstake, or withdraw, their staked ether (ETH).\n\nBefore the Shanghai upgrade, any ETH dedicated to staking remained locked within the Ethereum blockchain. The Shanghai upgrade will include a change to the Ethereum protocol that allows this staked ETH to be unlocked for the first time.\n\nShanghai is the first major change to the Ethereum blockchain after its transition from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.\n\nThis transition process, known as The Merge, laid the technical foundation for future scalability improvements on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nHave more questions about Ethereum\u2019s transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake? Check out our beginner\u2019s guide to The Ethereum Merge.\n\nWhat will the Shanghai upgrade include?\n\nThere are currently four Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) included in the Shanghai upgrade:\n\nEIP-3651 Warm COINBASE\n\nEIP-3855 PUSH0 instruction\n\nEIP-3860 Limit and meter initcode\n\nEIP-4895 Beacon Chain withdrawals\n\nThe most notable of the changes is EIP-4895.\n\nThis EIP allows users who staked their ETH in order to maintain Ethereum\u2019s new proof-of-stake \u201cBeacon Chain\u201d to withdraw or \u201cunstake\u201d their funds for the first time.\n\nOn December 8, 2022, the Ethereum core team held an All Core Developers (ACD) meeting. The Ethereum team agreed to target March 2023 as the release date for Shanghai\u2019s mainnet launch. However, this is a tentative date based on the assumption that the Zhejiang, Sepolia, and Goerli testnets are successful.\n\nShanghai + Capella = Shapella\n\nA second hard fork will also be taking place alongside Shanghai, called Capella. This is why you might see \u201cShanghai/Capella\u201d or \u201cShapella\u201d mentioned simultaneously in the run-up to the network upgrade.\n\nNow that Ethereum has a proof-of-stake execution chain and a consensus chain (Beacon Chain), new changes can require hard-forking both layers.\n\nIn this instance, Shanghai references the upcoming execution chain hard fork, while Capella references the consensus chain hard fork.\n\nHow the Shanghai upgrade impacts Kraken clients\n\nKraken has no control over the success of the Shanghai testnet or when the Shanghai upgrade may take place. For U.S. clients impacted by the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s recent decision regarding Kraken\u2019s on-chain staking program, Kraken will return all staked ETH to their spot wallets after the Shanghai upgrade takes place.\n\nFollowing the hard fork, Kraken clients who staked their ETH will be able to withdraw their assets for the first time. Because there may be a high demand in a concentrated period of time from ETH stakers looking to access their coins, unstaking could take a few hours. Kraken also has no direct control over ETH unstaking time frames, as the unstaking feature operates according to the withdrawal conditions set by the Ethereum development team.\n\nUseful official links\n\nThese materials are for general information purposes only and are not investment advice or a recommendation or solicitation to buy, sell, stake, or hold any digital asset or to engage in any specific trading strategy.

        "title": "Ethereum price action and derivatives data confirm bears are currently in control - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The price of Ether (ETH) declined 6% between March 2 and 3, followed by tight-range trading near $1,560. Still, analyzing a wider time frame provides no clear trend, as its chart can point to a descending channel or a slightly longer seven-week bullish pattern.\n\nEther (ETH) price index in USD, 1-day. Source: TradingView\n\nEther\u2019s recent lack of volatility can be partially explained by the upcoming Shanghai hard fork, an implementation aimed at allowing ETH staking withdrawals. Those participants were each required to lock 32 ETH on the Beacon Chain to support the network consensus protocol.\n\nAfter a series of delays, typical for changes in the production environment, the Shanghai Capella upgrade \u2014 also known as Shapella \u2014 is expected for early April, according to Ethereum core developer and project coordinator Tim Beiko. The Goerli testnet upgrade on March 14 will be the final rehearsal for the Shanghai hard fork before it is rolled out on the mainnet.\n\nRecession risks increase, favoring ETH bears\n\nOn the macroeconomic front, United States Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testified before the Senate Banking Committee on March 7. Powell stated that interest rates will likely rise higher than anticipated after \u201cthe latest economic data have come in stronger than expected.\u201d\n\nEvidence points to the Fed lagging behind the inflation curve, boosting the odds of harder-than-expected interest rate increases and asset sales by the monetary authority. For instance, an inflation \u201csurprise\u201d index from Citigroup rose in February for the first time in more than 12 months.\n\nFor risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, a more substantial move by the Fed typically implies a bearish scenario, as investors seek shelter in fixed income and the U.S. dollar. This shift becomes more pronounced in a recessionary environment, which many speculate is either coming or already here.\n\nThe regulatory environment is adding additional pressure for cryptocurrency firms, especially after U.S. Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the White House has noted that the crypto-friendly bank Silvergate had \u201cexperienced significant issues\u201d in recent months.\n\nLet\u2019s look at Ether derivatives data to understand if the $1,560 level is likely to become a support or resistance.\n\nETH derivatives show reduced demand for longs\n\nThe annualized three-month futures premium should trade between 5% and 10% in healthy markets to cover costs and associated risks. However, when the contract trades at a discount (known as \u201cbackwardation\u201d) versus traditional spot markets, it shows a lack of confidence from traders and is deemed a bearish indicator.\n\nEther 3-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe chart above shows that derivatives traders became slightly uncomfortable as the Ether futures premium (on average) moved to 3.1% on March 7, down from 4.9% one week prior. More importantly, the indicator became more distant from the 5% neutral-to-bullish mark.\n\nStill, the declining demand for leverage longs (bulls) does not necessarily translate to an expectation of adverse price action. Consequently, traders should analyze Ether\u2019s options markets to understand how whales and market makers are pricing the odds of future price movements.\n\nThe 25% delta skew is a telling sign th market makers and arbitrage desks are overcharging for upside or downside protection.\n\nIn bear markets, options investors give higher odds for a price dump, causing the skew indicator to rise above 10%. On the other hand, bullish markets tend to drive the skew metric below -10%, meaning the bearish put options are in less demand.\n\nEther 30-day options 25% delta skew: Source: Laevitas\n\nThe delta skew moved above the bearish 10% threshold on March 4, signaling stress from professional traders. A brief improvement happened on March 7, although the metric continues to flirt with bearish expectations as options traders place higher costs on protective put options.\n\nInvestors basing their decisions on fundamentals will likely look to the first couple of weeks following the Shanghai upgrade to measure the potential impact of the ETH unlock. Ultimately, options and futures markets signal that pro traders are less inclined to add long positions, giving higher odds for $1,560 becoming a resistance level in the coming weeks.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "ERC-4337: What Ethereum's Latest Upgrade Means for NFTs - nft now",
        "content": "For most of us, NFTs have been our entr\u00e9e into Web3. However, the process of buying, storing, and securing those NFTs is still relatively complicated for the average person. Moreover, the wallet creation experience \u2014 the necessary precursor to any Web3 activity, NFT or otherwise \u2014 is a major inhibitor to mass adoption.\n\nThat\u2019s where ERC-4337 comes in.\n\nThis new Ethereum upgrade has the potential to make blockchain technology more accessible to non-crypto natives and provide benefits like lost key recovery, no seed phrases, gasless transactions, and more.\n\nLet\u2019s explore what ERC-4337 is, why it\u2019s important, and what it might mean for the future of NFTs.\n\nWhat is ERC-4337?\n\nERC-4337, short for \u201cEthereum Request for Comment 4337,\u201d is an Ethereum upgrade that enables account abstraction. In simple terms, account abstraction allows Ethereum wallets to act as smart contracts.\n\nThat means each crypto wallet can have customized authorization logic to meet the needs of individual users or applications. This upgrade was proposed by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and others in September 2021 and announced at ETHDenver on March 1, 2023.\n\nUntil now, wallet creation and use have been cumbersome, confusing, and intimidating for many people entering Web3. The process of securing seed phrases, sending those first finger-trembling transactions, and the lack of user-friendly security features are all significant barriers to entry for new users. ERC-4337 makes wallet creation and use much easier and, therefore, more accessible.\n\nFor NFTs, this is particularly important. NFTs have helped get regular people, traditional brands, and older IPs into the space. However, if wallet creation remains user-unfriendly, it will continue to discourage people from buying their first NFTs.\n\nWhat does ERC-4337 do?\n\nERC-4337 solves four key problems in current wallet structures:\n\n1. Recovers lost private keys\n\nLosing the private keys to your wallet is one of the biggest risks and fears in the crypto space.\n\nThe only thing worse than buying an NFT that goes to zero is holding a valuable NFT that you lose. It\u2019s a scary reality in Web3. ERC-4337 enables a \u201csocial recovery system\u201d where designated users can restore access to your wallet if you lose your private keys.\n\n2. Secure wallets without seed phrases\n\nERC-4337 also allows for secure wallets without seed phrases, which can be difficult for some users to remember and keep safe.\n\nWith this upgrade, users can use 2FA (two-factor authentication) and biometrics to protect their wallets, making them much more secure and user-friendly. However, some people are in Web3 specifically to protect themselves from the type of institutional intrusion that security measures like biometrics represent. Moreover, seed phrases provide an additional layer of security that those users and others may not want to give up.\n\nNonetheless, this feature can still make it easier and more accessible for the many NFT-curious users who would gladly set up 2FA or biometric account access.\n\n3. Automated trading\n\nOne of the most challenging parts of collecting and trading NFTs is how hands-on you have to be. Tracking metrics, timing mints, analyzing floor prices \u2014 they all require a near-constant effort.\n\nHowever, ERC-4337 allows for automated trading, including a monthly spend limit, AI trading, and adjusting yield farming positions. These features can make trading NFTs much easier and more accessible for users of all levels.\n\n4. Gasless transactions\n\nFinally, ERC-4337 enables gasless transactions. With this feature, NFT collections and their DAOs can sponsor gas fees for users to make their transactions cheaper. Similarly, this feature allows the bundling of transactions, making them quicker and more efficient.\n\nThis feature also enables paying transaction fees with an application\u2019s tokens, which can also significantly reduce transaction costs. Entire blockchains, such as Avalanche and its subnets, have been set up to enable this as a primary feature.\n\nWhat might this change in the future?\n\nOverall, ERC-4337 offers many features that traditional banks typically offer their customers, all without the need to trust a financial institution.\n\nAs a result, ERC-4337 could lead to a significant boost in the adoption of NFTs. By making it easier to buy, store, secure, and recover NFTs, this upgrade could be a game-changer for the market.\n\nHowever, the features aren\u2019t enough to lead to mass adoption in and of themselves.\n\nThe key to achieving the potential of ERC-4337 lies in how we communicate about it. Even the term \u201caccount abstraction\u201d and other technical jargon won\u2019t be helpful for those who aren\u2019t already familiar with the space. Indeed, we may even need to do away with the word \u201cwallet\u201d and instead opt for language that more closely mimics web2: account creation, login, password recovery, and the like.\n\nNobody outside our Web3 world knows what those seven alphanumeric characters in ERC-4337 mean. And they won\u2019t have to, as long as everything else is easy for them."

Start for free\n\nOriginating a loan using Centrifuge necessitates creating a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), an independent legal entity, according to the project\u2019s documentation. And those looking to invest in the financing opportunities must go through a KYC and Anti-Money Laundering process.\n\nTo raise money, Centrifuge also did a traditional equity round 2017, said Ament. That was a time when the dominant funding mechanism in crypto was an initial coin offerings (ICO), a simple process whereby investorssent a major crypto asset like ETH to a project in exchange for its tokens.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s website states that some ICOs may constitute securities offerings.\n\nOther projects involved with regulatory compliance at ETHDenver included Yug Network, kycDAO, both of which are working to bring off-chain credentials like KYC, on-chain. Others like Opolis, are focusing on enabling crypto\u2019s swath of freelancers to remain or become tax compliant.\n\nAment said the team didn\u2019t think it could fight the regulation battle around ICOs. Despite the traditional raise, Centrifuge is deep into the decentralization process and is giving control of its platform over to token holders, Ament added.\n\nDavid Liebowitz, who hosts a podcast called Flywheel DeFi, thinks that stablecoins are the most important area to watch in terms of regulation in the digital asset space.\n\n\u201cStablecoins are really the first and last line of defense when it comes to regulation of all of crypto,\u201d he told The Defiant at ETHDenver. Liebowitz gave a talk on stablecoin regulation at the event and cited guidance issued by the state of New York, and also legislation drafted by the former senator Pat Toomey, as guiding lights for U.S. dollar-pegged assets.\n\nLexproof\u2019s Cosme, too, said that he thought that the stablecoin space had a higher chance of seeing new legislation drafted into law, rather than the digital asset industry as a whole.\n\nCosme isn\u2019t optimistic that the United States\u2019 legislative branch will pass new laws for the digital asset industry in the near term. \u201cCongress can pass legislation to make registration easy, in a way that makes sense for crypto companies and their business models and for their value proposition,\u201d Cosme said, but he added that, given the legislative body\u2019s current constituents, it is unlikely to push forward any laws of the sort.\n\nBoth Liebowitz and Cosme acknowledged the SEC\u2019s aggressive stance taken in regards to the crypto space \u2014 Cosme said that the general outlook among lawyers is that the federal agency isn\u2019t going to let up anytime soon.\n\nLiebowitz echoed a similar sentiment. \u201cThe SEC isn\u2019t playing around,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re really taking the mandate of protecting investors to the widest possible conclusion.\u201d\n\nIf ETHDenver is an accurate barometer, the crypto space as a whole is adapting to a more adversarial regulatory environemnt \u2014 and some are even looking to build products for it."

The network saw an outflow of $10.15 million during the same period.\n\nThe network\u2019s significant inflow occurred on Mar. 5 when it recorded an inflow of $16.57 million in one day.\n\nDeFillama data showed that USD Coin (USDC) accounts for 67% of all stablecoins on Arbitrum with $968.63 million. Other dominant stablecoins on the network include Tether\u2019s USDT and DAI, with a cumulative balance of $394.81 million.\n\nThe increased stablecoin inflow also coincided with a period when transaction activity on Arbitrum increased. The L2 network saw its transaction volume reach a new all-time high of 690,000 in Feb. Besides that, the increased network activity saw its transaction volume surpass Ethereum for the first time.\n\nMeanwhile, Arbitrum is the second most popular network for decentralized exchanges (DEX). For context, its total volume in the last 24 hours was $207.29 million, ahead of rivals like Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, and Optimism. However, it is miles below Ethereum, which is $1.03 billion.\n\nAccording to L2Beat, the total value of assets (TVL) locked on Arbitrum is $3.37 billion, rising 0.17% in the last seven days.\n\nOptimism stablecoin inflow rises 5% in seven days.\n\nSince the beginning of March, Optimism\u2019s (OP) stablecoin inflow increased 4.89% to $669.11 million, according to DeFillama data.\n\nOptimism\u2019s significant inflow occurred on Mar. 3 when it recorded around $6.3 million.\n\nThe increased inflow is in contrast to February when it recorded an outflow of nearly $120 million.\n\nUSDC is also the dominant stablecoin on Optimism. The Circle-issued stablecoin accounts for roughly 55% of the stablecoins on the network, with $364.56 million. The other stablecoins in the top three include Synthetix protocol\u2019s sUSD and USDT, with a combined value of $145.77 million.\n\nOptimism\u2019s TVL stands at $1.89 billion, according to L2 beats data.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nWith the new function activated, every owner of a noncustodial Ethereum (ETH) wallet can dramatically increase its functionality and make his/her experience with Ethereum (ETH) and EVM-compatible blockchains secure.\n\nEIP 4337 goes live on Ethereum (ETH): Highlights\n\nYesterday, on March 1, 2023, Ethereum (ETH) developers announced that the Account Abstraction mechanism included in Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP 4337) was stress tested, audited and deployed to mainnet.\n\nBeing in discussions since 2016, Account Abstraction is among the most ambitious changes of Ethereum's (ETH) design;\n\nEIP 4337 is co-developed by the Ethereum Foundation and a number of heavy-hitting Web3 teams: Stackup, Biconomy, Alchemy; OpenZeppelin performed its security audit;\n\nIt blurs the line between Externally Owned Accounts (wallets) and Contract Accounts (smart contracts) and introduces a new instrument in Ethereum: Smart Accounts;\n\nThis update is of paramount importance for the security, operability and massive adoption of the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain;\n\nBesides Ethereum (ETH), this update goes live on all EVM-compatible blockchains: Polygon Network (MATIC), BNB Chain (BSC), Ethereum's L2 networks and so on.\n\nWith EIP 4337 activated, Ethereum (ETH) users can turn their noncustodial wallets into full-stack decentralized banks. This protects new users from losing access to their ETH wallets due to seed phrase issues.\n\nWhat is EIP?\n\nEthereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) are descriptions for standards on the Ethereum (ETH) network: core protocol specifications, client APIs and contract standards. Major network upgrades are associated with the mainnet implementation of this or that EIP.\n\nEthereum (ETH) enthusiasts submit their proposals for discussion and review; the full cycle of approval takes eight phases. Some sophisticated EIPs caused heated debates and were discussed for years.\n\nEIP 20 (introduction of ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum), EIP 721 (non-fungible token standard), and EIP 1559 (dynamic transactional fee model with periodic token burn events) are among the most crucial EIPs since Ethereum's (ETH) inception.\n\nWhat are EOAs and CAs on Ethereum?\n\nEthereum, a first-ever blockchain network with smart contracts support (programmable blockchain), has two types of accounts in its design. Simply put, not unlike traditional banking and payment apps, an Ethereum (ETH) account is where cryptocurrency is stored.\n\nExternally Owned Accounts (or EOAs) can store cryptocurrency but are not able to send transactions themselves. Users need to authorize the transactions with private keys. Crypto wallets like MetaMask are textbook examples of EOAs.\n\nBy contrast, Contract Accounts are software programs that can perform financial operations. They are controlled by code, not private keys. Smart contracts \u2014 basic elements of DeFi and NFT protocols \u2014 are \"Contract Accounts\" (CAs) by design.\n\nWhat is EIP 4337 or Account Abstraction (AA)?\n\nEIP 4337 is an upgrade of the Ethereum (ETH) network's design; it is implemented as an additional layer on the top of the Ethereum (ETH) mainnet, so it did not need a hard fork to go live. With Account Abstraction, Ethereum (ETH) users can easily turn their wallet into a smart contract and supercharge them with extra functionality.\n\nA \"smart account\" is a new type of wallet that becomes available with EIP 4337. First and foremost, average users will be able to turn their accounts into multi-signature storage. This will eliminate the need for account owners to be responsible for private keys.\n\nImage by Stackup\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation highlights that EIP 4337 will allow the use of the results of off-chain computations on-chain, which is truly game changing for making Ethereum (ETH) feature-rich:\n\nERC-4337 attempts to do the same thing that EIP-2938 does, but through extra-protocol means. Users are expected to send off-chain messages called user operations, which get collected and packaged in bulk into a single transaction by either the block proposer or a builder producing bundles for block proposers. The proposer or builder is responsible for filtering the operations to ensure that they only accept operations that pay fees. There is a separate mempool for user operations, and nodes connected to this mempool do ERC-4337-specific validations to ensure that a user operation is guaranteed to pay fees before forwarding it.\n\nSince the first days of EIP 4337 operations \u2014 as revealed by John Rising, Stackup co-founder and vocal upgrade proponent \u2014 the new functionality has a solid infrastructure background and is available on all major EVM-compatible blockchains.\n\nHow EIP 4337 will change Ethereum (ETH) forever\n\nEIP 4337 has already made it into the top ranking of the most important and ambitious EIPs in Ethereum's (ETH) history. With EIP 4337 activated, the Ethereum (ETH) experience for a new generation of users and developers will be different.\n\nEIP 4337 for security\n\nWhen it comes to private key management, EIP 4337 makes it possible for various users to authorize transactions from one account. As such, Ethereum (ETH) holders can integrate their wallet with a smartphone to streamline key management and add an extra recovery instrument for their coins.\n\nEIP 4337 for usability\n\nWhen it comes to smart contracts, EIP 4337 paves the way for 100% \"gas-less\" contracts: now developers can hard-code the opportunity to utilize this or that wallet as a source for gas payments. Previously, such a design needed all transactions to be authorized with private keys.\n\nEIP 4337 for massive adoption\n\nAll enthusiasts, proponents and developers of EIP 4337 are certain that it will make the user experience of Ethereum (ETH) more newbie friendly. The Ethereum (ETH) toolkit becomes more feature-rich than ever before. Now it enables more sophisticated and eccentric designs that would have been impossible without \"smart accounts.\"\n\nWrapping up: What's next for Account Abstraction in EVM?\n\nAs such, EIP 4337 activation is a major milestone for Ethereum (ETH) in 2023. While it now appears overshadowed by the hotly-anticipated Shanghai upgrade (and its economic promises), Account Abstraction is as important for Ethereum's (ETH) tooling as EIP 721 and EIP 1155."

        "content": "Raoul Pal, CEO of Real Vision, has presented a new framework for understanding the cryptocurrency ecosystem, and saying he thinks the ethereum economy is the fastest-growing economy on earth.\n\nRaoul Pal, the CEO of Real Vision, has presented a new framework for understanding the cryptocurrency ecosystem. He suggests that bitcoin and ethereum should be viewed as economies, rather than just assets, each having unique characteristics.\n\nPal compares the Bitcoin economy to the Catholic church or the gold bug community, which fiercely protects the integrity of its protocol and is resistant to innovation. The Ethereum economy is compared to the U.S. economy, with a central bank that follows the rules of responsible monetary policy to ensure value is upheld.\n\nPal also notes that ETH has a deflationary supply, which makes it attractive to investors seeking yield. Pal argues that the Ethereum economy presents opportunities for capital gains through private sector lending, NFTs, and the emerging layer of dApps, DAOs, social tokens, and layer 2s.\n\nHe sees the Ethereum economy as the fastest-growing economy on earth, offering many opportunities for investors. However, Pal emphasizes the significance of investing time to find the best options, dollar cost averaging, and diversifying to avoid potential losses.\n\nRegarding other major crypto projects, Pal compares XRP to the U.K., an old economy that lacks innovation and grows slowly.\n\nSolana is compared to South Korea just after the Asian crisis when its currency and equity market came crashing down. It presented an unmatched opportunity that outperformed both the USD and SPX for six years.\n\nHowever, solana failed to continue the outperformance and did not stand the test of time.\n\nPal concludes that the crypto ecosystem presents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for those willing to put in the work to navigate and understand it. Pal also comments on other emerging cryptocurrencies, including Sui, Aptos, Meta, Instagram, and Polygon, and sees ETH as the easiest way to invest with the least risk.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "title": "ETH Risks Falling to $1500 if Bearish Sentiment Intensifies (Ethereum Price Analysis) - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price action has been very choppy in recent weeks after facing rejection from a significant resistance. However, there are multiple levels that could provide support and hold the price in the event of a deeper pullback.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy: Edris\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nOn the daily chart, the price was rejected from the $1800 level and the higher boundary of the large symmetrical triangle pattern earlier in February. It has since broken below the 50-day moving average, located around the $1600 mark.\n\nCurrently, the price is consolidating below the broken MA and is yet to show an impulsive move after the bearish breakout. If the cryptocurrency fails to reclaim the broken 50-day moving average, the 200-day moving average, trending around the $1400 level, could be the next support, followed closely by the $1300 static zone.\n\nOn the other hand, a break back above the 50-day moving average would likely lead to an eventual breakout above the symmetrical triangle and a bullish rally in the short term.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nLooking at the 4-hour timeframe, it is evident that the price has been oscillating in a very tight range following an impulsive rejection from the $1650 resistance level a few days ago. $1500 seems likely to be tested in the short term, and if it fails to hold the market, the price could plunge toward the next support area, which is located around the $1350 mark.\n\nThe RSI indicator is also moving sideways, but it is still showing values below 50%, which points to the bearish momentum and further boosts the probability of a bearish continuation in the coming days.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nEthereum Taker Buy Sell Ratio (SMA 100)\n\nAs Ethereum\u2019s price has been consolidating below significant resistance levels in the past few weeks, it would be useful to evaluate the futures market sentiment to gather further insights into what the market would do next.\n\nThe Taker Buy Sell Ratio is one of the most useful metrics to achieve this, as it measures whether the bulls or the bears are currently executing their trades more aggressively. Values above one indicate dominant buying pressure, while values below 1 are associated with negative sentiment.\n\nThis metric has been trending down for the last few weeks, indicating that the buying pressure is fading in the futures market, and the recent consolidating price action also validates this interpretation.\n\nYet, the metric is currently approaching the 1 threshold, and a drop below would mean that the bears are in control once more, which could lead to a price decline in the coming weeks if this trend continues."

        "content": "Happy Monday, everyone. The annual pilgrimage known as EthDenver wrapped up this weekend, and after two days of diving into the festivities, I came away heartened by the optimism and the sheer vitality of the scene. Sure, there was cringe aplenty, and I\u2019ll never quite get used to grown men dressed as unicorns, but the raucous event felt as big as a Broncos game and was a reminder that\u2014even after its annus horribilis\u2014crypto is very much thriving.\n\nWhile the event was dedicated to all things Ethereum, it also featured dozens of booths and people plugging rival blockchains, including the Near Protocol, which launched a \u201cproduct-first operating system\u201d designed for browsing Web3 products like exchanges and NFTs. All of this reminded me of a question that\u2019s long nagged at me: Why are there so many blockchains in the first place?\n\nFor years, would-be contenders like Solana and Polkadot have branded themselves as \u201cEthereum killers,\u201d even as others launch yet more blockchains, including Sui and Aptos, which are being pushed by teams once tied to Facebook\u2019s aborted crypto ambitions. The backers of these projects will tell you they offer new innovations and that they are cheaper and faster than Ethereum. But I\u2019m not so sure.\n\nI can\u2019t shake the feeling that the primary goal of these newer projects is not so much to share a better blockchain with the world, but for the founders to get filthy rich by dumping millions more tokens into a crypto ecosystem already awash with them. This is not necessarily a bad thing. After all, the founders of Ethereum made out like bandits, and every startup in the traditional tech world reserves blocks of shares for its board and early employees.\n\nThe difference between traditional startups and new blockchains, however, is that the latter never go away\u2014even if it\u2019s clear they will never catch on. In Silicon Valley, most startups fail after a year or two and, at best, someone acquires them for parts. Failed blockchains, by contrast, take on a Walking Dead\u2013like afterlife as bag-holders pump their tokens for years on social media in hopes of finding new suckers even after it\u2019s clear the chain is a zombie.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that the blockchain world needs to be limited to the twin titans of Bitcoin and Ethereum. But it would be nice if the crypto world took note of the critical mass at EthDenver, and started putting more wood behind fewer arrows.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nEco, a startup backed by a16z and others, told customers its touted 2.5% to 5% yields came from lending to Goldman and Fidelity\u2014but in reality, it was putting funds in DeFi.

        "title": "Arbitrum co-founders see opportunity for continued layer-2 growth through DeFi, gaming - TechCrunch",
        "content": "As we segue into March, the Ethereum layer-2 space is continuing to see strong demand: One of its largest scaling solutions, Arbitrum, is seeing renewed exponential growth through subsectors in the ecosystem.\n\nWhile base blockchains (layer ones, or L1s in crypto-speak) remain the bedrock of the web3 landscape, technology built on top (layer two chains, or L2s) are exploding. Arbitrum recently surpassed the Ethereum chain that it is built on in terms of total transactions processed.\n\nArbitrum is an L2 Ethereum-focused scaling solution that aims to act like Ethereum but with transactions that cost way less and processing that\u2019s way faster. It makes up about 54% of the market share on Ethereum and has about $3.38 billion total value locked, according to L2Beat data. The TVL, which is tracked through the amount of tokens locked in all escrow contracts for an L2, is near its highest point since May 2022, the data shows.\n\nL2 scaling solutions like Arbitrum, Optimism, Immutable X, StarkWare and others are built on top of layer-1 blockchains like Ethereum. But L2s function in a faster, cheaper way and reduce the load on L1s by bundling up transactions and only recording final results on the main blockchain. That way it doesn\u2019t clog up the network.\n\nGrowing DeFi and other use cases\n\nDecentralized finance continues to dominate most demand for L2s, but there may be other areas that could gain stronger traction, such as gaming. \u201cIn the short term, DeFi is showing the most traction,\u201d said Harry Kalodner, CTO and co-founder of Offchain Labs, a developer of Arbitrum. But DeFi may not be the path to onboard \u201chundreds of millions of users,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThe path to mass adoption is where the user doesn\u2019t know they\u2019re using a blockchain and can just get the benefits of using it,\u201d Kalodner said. \u201cIt seems like gaming and social applications could [drive] that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis growth feels very real because we\u2019re seeing it across all metrics with new addresses, number of transactions and TVL: Across the board we\u2019re seeing an increase,\u201d Kalodner said.\n\nIf transaction volume is \u201cway up\u201d and everything else were deflated, that wouldn\u2019t make sense, but all the core metrics are higher, said Offchain Labs co-founder and CEO Steven Goldfeder.\n\nThe broadly positive movement in metrics may imply that the L2 boom is not predicated on a fad, or single-point distortion in the incentive structure of Ethereum-focused transactions; at times in crypto\u2019s history, changes to business models, the introduction of new chains, and at times even hacks have led to swings in different activity levels. The L2 market can simply claim growth as the reason for its changing numbers \u2014 growth that, by our understanding, appears predicated on regular use instead of near-term arbitrage.\n\nOn Feb. 21, Arbtirum passed Ethereum in total daily transactions at 12.77 transactions per second compared to Ethereum\u2019s 12.55 TPS but has since fallen back into second place, according to L2Beat data. But the average total L2 TPS across all scaling solutions has been higher than Ethereum\u2019s for the past few months, meaning that the user base is depending more and more on L2 solutions to handle transactions than the core Ethereum L1 chain?\n\nThink of it like uploading a PDF file: Uploading every word in a document would take up a lot more space and time than bundling it into one document and shipping it out. Now apply that to transactions on the blockchain.\n\nGrowing the pie\n\nGoing forward, the focus for 2023 is \u201cgrowing the pie,\u201d Kalodner said. \u201cThat\u2019s the path to even more growth.\u201d\n\nWhile its DeFi ecosystem will be \u201cgrowing itself\u201d in the short term, the team also plans to make an active effort to expand scaling solutions further for gaming and NFTs so nontechnical and nonfinancial users could also expand on the platform, Kalodner said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t pick favorites; we work with everybody and we want as broad of an ecosystem as possible,\u201d Kaldoner said. \u201cBut we\u2019re much more focused on gaming and NFTs for active outreach.\u201d\n\nArbitrum is also \u201cvery much going after the crypto-native adoption as well as institutional adoption including financial institutions, social platforms,\u201d Goldfeder said. \u201cFundamentally we have dominant market share in DeFi today and our focus is pretty general, but definitely DeFi and gaming are our strongest spots right now.\u201d\n\nBut in order to grow the pie, so to speak, Arbitrum has to make its platform more inclusive to developers and users, Goldfeder said. \u201cOur thesis is we have to bend our technology to developers instead of making them bend to us \u2026 the way to get [a] billion users is through the next million developers. We have to expand the pod.\u201d"

        "content": "The price of Ethereum\u2019s native token, Ether (ETH), has recovered 78% since June 2022. But this doesn\u2019t guarantee further upside, particularly with declining trading volumes suggesting that the risk of a major correction is high.\n\nEther volume profile drops 90% since March 2020\n\nA \u201cvolume profile\u201d indicator displays trading activity across prices, with the blue indicating buying volume and the yellow indicating sell volume.\n\nIllustration of a volume profile bar. Source: TradingView\n\nIn March 2020, when the market bottomed, Ether\u2019s volume profile on a weekly chart showed about 160 million ETH trades across the $85\u2013$270 price range. At the time, the selling volume was greater than the buying volume by around 4 million ETH.\n\nBut Ether buying volume regained momentum after ETH price rallied above $270 in July 2020.\n\nNotably, between July 2020 and November 2020, the Ether volume profile displayed about 64.25 million ETH trades across the $270\u2013$450 range, with buying volume exceeding selling volume by almost 1 million ETH.\n\nETH/USD weekly price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe price-volume trend remained largely synchronous with one another until November 2021, when ETH/USD reached its record high at around $4,950.\n\nIn other words, most traders purchased Ether as its price climbed, illustrating their confidence in the longevity of the bullish reversal that followed the March 2020 crash.\n\nHowever, that confidence is missing in the 2023 Ether market rebound.\n\n2022 ETH price bottom differs from two years ago\n\nAt first, the Ether volume profile at the beginning of it price recovery in June 2022 from $900 shows 12.50 million ETH trades, down more than 90% from March 2020.\n\nBut despite a 75% price recovery, fewer traders have been participating in Ether\u2019s potential bottom this time around when compared with the beginning of the 2020 bull market.\n\nWhat\u2019s further concerning is the rising sell-volumes during the current ETH price rebound.\n\nFor instance, the red horizontal line in the daily chart below, dubbed the \u201cpoint of control,\u201d or POC \u2014 which represents the area with the most open trading positions \u2014 shows a net 8.21 million ETH volume of around $1,550, with sellers exceeding buyers by 170,000 ETH trades.\n\nETH/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nIn other words, ETH\u2019s ongoing price recovery might not have the legs it did in March 2020, especially when coupled with the overall volume profile decline over the past two years.\n\nMost Ether investors are still in profit\n\nMore downside cues for Ether come from one of Ethereum\u2019s widely monitored on-chain metrics that tracks the percentage of ETH\u2019s circulating supply in profit.\n\nRelated: Ethereum eyes 25% correction in March, but ETH price bulls have a silver lining\n\nAs of March 6, about 65% of ETH was bought at a lower price. In other words, investors\u2019 probability of securing profits remains high in the event of a significant price drop.\n\nEther circulating supply in profit. Source: Glassnode\n\nTherefore, Ether price could see the real bottom if the supply in profit falls below 30% (green zone), which would reflect previous market cycles and the March 2020 bottom, as shown in the chart above.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The whale address, which had accumulated 10,266 ETH in 2017 through mining activities, recently transferred the entire amount, worth around $16 million, out of the wallet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe transfer also included the movement of 1,322 ETH, worth around $2 million, to cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex, which suggests that the whale may be planning to liquidate some of their holdings. The timing of the transfer is significant, as it coincides with Ethereum's recent price dip, which has seen it fall to a local support level.\n\nAn address that has been dormant for more than 5 years transferred 10,266 $ETH ($16M) out.\n\n\n\nThe 10,266 $ETH was obtained through mining in 2017.\n\n\n\nAmong them, 1,322 $ETH ($2M) was transferred to #Poloniex.https://t.co/hsXiBh5iS2 pic.twitter.com/7L1nkx6Fe6 \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) March 6, 2023\n\nThe whale's sudden move is not an isolated incident, as other dormant whales have recently woken up and begun to move large amounts of Ethereum. These moves have been seen as a sign of profit-taking activities, as these whales may be looking to cash in on their holdings before a potential market downturn.\n\nThe activity of dormant whales on the Ethereum network is an important factor to consider, as it can significantly affect the supply and demand dynamics of the cryptocurrency. However, it is important to note that whales are not necessarily bad actors, and their activity is often a natural part of the market cycle.\n\nAs Ethereum continues to move downward, we might see more profit-taking activities. The overall impact of the profit-taking from a relatively small whale will most likely not appear on the market even in the case of market selling without proper distribution. However, Ethereum is not in the best position right now, which is why even a slightest spike in selling activity might lead to downward movement."

        "title": "Polygon (MATIC) and Ethereum (ETH) are Listed for Leverage Trading on Covo Finance - PR Newswire",
        "content": "NEW YORK, March 7, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Covo Finance is a decentralized trading platform that allows users to trade popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Polygon (MATIC), and others directly from their cryptocurrency wallets. It allows users to trade perpetual futures with up to 50x leverage, similar to how it's done on centralized exchanges. However, unlike centralized exchanges, users keep custody of their assets using a cryptocurrency wallet.\n\nPolygon, formerly Matic Network, is a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum that aims to improve scalability and usability for decentralized applications. Thanks to its low fees and fast transaction times, Polygon (MATIC) has quickly gained popularity among developers and traders alike. Ethereum (ETH), on the other hand, is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and is widely used for smart contracts and decentralized applications.\n\nWith the addition of these two cryptocurrencies to Covo Finance's platform, traders can now access even more profit opportunities. Leveraged trading allows traders to amplify their gains (or losses) by borrowing funds to increase their exposure to an asset. For example, a trader with $1,000 in their account could trade up to $50,000 worth of the cryptocurrency using 50x leverage.\n\nEasily Trade Top Crypto with Leverage with Covo Finance\n\nTo start trading crypto with leverage, users must connect their cryptocurrency wallet to the Covo Finance platform and deposit funds. Users can then select the asset they want to trade and choose their desired leverage level. The platform supports a variety of cryptocurrencies, including Polygon (MATIC), Ethereum (ETH), USDC, BTC, and others.\n\nEarn Up to 70% APR on MATIC and ETH by Depositing to COVOLP Pools\n\nCOVOLP is a token representing a share of the liquidity pool on Covo Finance, from which traders can borrow for their leverage trading. By staking COVOLP, stakers can earn 70% of the trading fees generated by the platforms and additional rewards in COVO tokens.\n\nTo mint COVOLP, users must first provide liquidity by depositing MATIC, ETH, or USDC to receive COVOLP tokens in return based on their pool share.\n\nNext, COVOLP holders must approve and stake their COVOLP tokens in the dashboard. The APR for staking COVOLP depends on several factors, such as the fees earned by the platform and COVO tokens inflation. According to Defillama , the current APR for staking COVOLP is around 67%.\n\nStep-by-Step Guide for Crypto Margin Trading with Covo Finance\n\nCovo Finance also includes various features to help traders stay informed and make informed decisions. The platform includes:\n\nReal-time market data.\n\nCharting tools.\n\nVarious technical indicators help traders analyze market trends and make informed trades.\n\nOpening a position at Covo Finance is straightforward. Traders need to click \"Long\" or \"Short,\" depending on which side they want to open a leverage position. A long position earns a profit if the token's price goes up and makes a loss if the token's price goes down. A short position earns a profit if the token's price goes down and makes a loss if the token's price goes up.\n\nAfter selecting their preferred position, users must key in the amount they want to pay and the leverage they want to use. For instance, 0.1 ETH worth $352.33 is used to buy a 5x ETH (Ethereum) long position of $1752.89. The \"Entry Price\" is $3541.17, and the Liquidation Price is $2903.76.\n\nThe trading fee to open a position is 0.1% of the position size, and there is a 0.1% fee when closing the position. There are no price impacts or slippage for opening or closing trades as Covo Finance uses decentralized oracles for asset prices which is the aggregate price of Major Exchanges.\n\nManaging positions on Covo Finance is also straightforward. After opening a trade, users can view it under their Positions list. They can also click \"Edit\" to deposit or withdraw collateral, which allows them to manage their leverage and liquidation price. When a user opens a position or deposits collateral, a snapshot of the USD price of their collateral is taken. So, for example, if a user's collateral is 0.1 ETH, and the price of ETH is $3523.30 at the time, then their collateral is $352.33 and will not change even if the price of ETH changes.\n\nA user's profit and loss will be proportional to their position size. If, for instance, $352.33 is used to buy $1752.89 worth of ETH, and the price of ETH increases by 10%, the position would have a profit of $175.29. If the price of ETH decreases by 10%, the position will lose $175.29.\n\nIf a short position is opened instead, and the price of ETH decreases by 10%, the position would profit $175.29. However, if the price of ETH increases by 10%, the position would lose $175.29.\n\nCovo Finance's platform is designed to make leveraged trading more accessible and user-friendly. The platform is decentralized, and trades are executed on a peer-to-peer basis. Decentralization reduces the risk of hacking or theft, as funds are not held in a central location.\n\nAdding Polygon (MATIC) and Ethereum (ETH) to Covo Finance's platform is a significant development for the decentralized trading ecosystem. It gives traders even more opportunities to profit from the growing cryptocurrency market while offering a user-friendly and secure platform for leveraged trading. However, traders should be aware of the risks associated with leveraged trading and use caution when executing trades.\n\nMedia Contact:\n\nCompany: Covo Finance\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nWebsite: https://covo.finance\n\nLogo: https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2017634/Covo_Finance_Logo.jpg\n\nSOURCE Covo Finance"

        "content": "Atlas Upgrade Slated for Early April Will Halve Minimum Staking Requirement\n\nBy: Aleksandar Gilbert \u2022 Loading...\n\nDeFi News\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation encourages users to run a node and, in turn, \u201cbecome Ethereum.\u201d In the next month, it could become much easier to do that.\n\nRocket Pool, a liquid staking protocol that\u2019s one of the 20 largest projects in decentralized finance, will release its long-awaited \u201cAtlas\u201d upgrade no later than early April, founder and Chief Technology Officer David Rugendyke said in a recent blog post.\n\nAtlas will allow Rocket Pool node operators to run their own Ethereum validators \u2014 \u201cminipools\u201d in protocol parlance \u2014 with only 8 Ether, or about $12,500 at Monday\u2019s prices. That will halve the current requirement of 16 ETH, which is itself half the amount required for people who run their own validators without Rocket Pool software.\n\nNode operators and validators are the distributed group of users who run a combination of hardware and software that confirms and orders transactions on Ethereum. The number and geographic distribution of node operators and validators is considered a rough proxy for the decentralization and censorship resistance of the Ethereum network.\n\nNode operation requires only consumer-grade hardware and an internet connection; validator operation, on the other hand, is capital-intensive and requires the deposit, or \u201cstaking,\u201d of ETH in increments of 32.\n\nLong-term, Rocket Pool aims to halve its minipool requirement again, to 4 ETH. But that will require a change to Ethereum itself, CEO Darren Langers previously told The Defiant.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re kind of lowering that barrier of entry so that we can open up to more potential node operators,\u201d Langers said last year in an interview at Ethereum\u2019s marquee Devcon conference. Doing so would boost a protocol that had seen its number of node operators double in less than a year, he added.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s with 16 ETH. Can you imagine eight, or four?\u201d\n\nLowering the barrier of entry for running a minipool will \u201cinstantly\u201d boost the protocol\u2019s capacity threefold, according to Rugendyke, as well as the yield minipool operators can earn.\n\nAll Eyes On Shanghai\n\nAuditors have finished reviewing Atlas\u2019 code, according to Rugendyke. The upgrade is now slated to go live at the end of March or early April, just before an Ethereum upgrade that will allow for the withdrawal of staked ETH.\n\nDeFi Alpha Premium Content DeFi Daily | Weekdays\n\nDeFi Alpha Letter | Weekly\n\nDefiant Podcast Transcript | Weekly\n\nInbox Dump | Saturday\n\nWeekly Recap | Sunday Looking for Alpha?

        "content": "ETH\u2019s short-term recovery could depend on the USD and interest rates trend.\n\nTechnical indicators suggest short-term consolidation.\n\nThe first few days of March have failed to give Ethereum [ETH] holders a much-desired breather. Despite the reality of despair, any hope for respite could depend on one condition, according to Chris Burniske.\n\nThe ex-crypto investment head at ARKInvest opined that ETH, alongside Bitcoin [BTC], would only recover if the dollar and interest rates drop.\n\nFor much of February the dollar and rates went higher, while crypto hung in there. If the former two start to drift lower, $BTC could push through $25K, and if $ETHBTC pushes alongside that we could get another round of fireworks. \u2014 Chris Burniske (@cburniske) March 5, 2023\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nStriving for stronghold\n\nRecall that the first two months of the year brought glaring greens to the market, with the top two cryptocurrencies earning gains for their holders.\n\nIn addition, the Fed rates increase in February had initially triggered reds in the market. But ETH, led by BTC ensured that the drawdown only lasted a few hours. So, does the ETH technical outlook appear encouraging yet?\n\nWell, the ETH/USD daily chart showed that the asset volatility was exiting its long-standing contraction status at press time.\n\nMeanwhile, the lower part of the Bollinger Bands (BB) which measures an asset\u2019s volatile condition was at par with the ETH price. Since the bands did not squeeze, this status indicates that ETH was oversold and had fewer chances of a significant breakout.\n\nHowever, the Directional Movement Index (DMI) suggested that the altcoin might not be ready for a rally, and the condition mentioned above could be instrumental.\n\nThis was because the -DMI (red) positioned higher than the +DMI (green) at 20.71 to 18.60. Moreso, the chart above revealed that the Average Directional Index (ADX) had no strong support for either a breath or bullish move.\n\nThe ADX (yellow) at 25, indicated a strong directional movement while a value below it shows a weak one. At the time of writing, the ADX was 14.90.\n\nPortfolios hang in the balance\n\nApart from the downside projection of the technical indicators, the liquidations over the past few days have faded signs of a bullish crossover. But some ETH holders are optimistic that the Shanghai upgrade could offer a slide ways from the bears.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nThere have, however, been shifts in the final mainnet event after it was initially slated for March. But Ethereum developers seemed to have made progress with the Sepolia Testnet success, and Georli in view. So, how has the ETH decline to $1,561 affected its holders?\n\nAccording to Santiment, the 30-day Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio was -3.171%. The metric shows the ratio between the current price and the average price acquired in relation to market profitability.\n\nHence, the MVRV ratio drawdown implied that most of those who acquired ETH a few weeks back remained underwater."

        "content": "Image: Shutterstock\n\nThe expected release of the Shanghai hard fork by Ethereum developers has been postponed by around two weeks. The upgrade was initially planned to be launched in late March, but now it is expected to be rolled out in the first two weeks of April. The delay was disclosed during an Ethereum developer meeting on March 2. In the meeting, the main developers agreed that the Shanghai hard fork would take place approximately two weeks after the Goerli testnet release, which is scheduled for March 14. The Goerli testnet is going to be the last trial run before the Shanghai upgrade is implemented on the mainnet.According to Tim Beiko, a coordinator and core developer of the Ethereum project, they typically give users at least two weeks' notice after making an announcement before implementing an upgrade on the main network. Assuming everything goes well with the Goerli testnet release on March 14, and they agree to proceed with the mainnet upgrade on March 16, the earliest possible time for the Shanghai hard fork to take place would be during the first week of April.On March 2, Beiko mentioned in a series of tweets that they did not decide on a specific date for the mainnet release yet. However, they are likely to determine a date during the upcoming developers' meeting on March 16, given that the Goerli testnet runs smoothly.The Shanghai Capella, which is also known as Shapella, will be the final opportunity for Ethereum clients and staking providers to make sure that the Shanghai hard fork can be carried out without any issues when it is eventually released on the main network. This mainnet upgrade has been highly anticipated, and it will allow the slow withdrawal of ETH that has been staked on Beacon Chain.To ensure the stability and safety of the Ethereum network, withdrawals of ETH will be adjusted dynamically based on the number of validators who are exiting at any given time. Validators are required to complete a two-step process, which includes joining an exit queue and undergoing a withdrawal period. Consequently, the withdrawal of ETH will occur gradually over time.Presently, there are about 17.1 million ETH staked on the Beacon Chain, which represents slightly over 14 percent of the total Ethereum supply and is valued at approximately $28 billion, given the current asset prices."

        "content": "As digital assets continue to grow in popularity worldwide, many investors are looking for ways to stay ahead of the game. If Cryptocurrencies can continue to build on their already strong foundation, there\u2019s no telling how much their prices could go up. For that reason, it\u2019s essential to stay well informed and learn all about the predictions of these two cryptocurrencies for the year that has just commenced.\n\nFor those who are looking to get in on the action early, there are a few things to do. The first is to learn about the predictions of these two currencies and then read about what steps to take to start investing in Crypto. You can do that by checking out this article with predictions for Ethereum and Bitcoin prices in 2023 and a guide on how to invest in them.\n\nOur predictions for Bitcoin\n\nCryptocurrencies have doubtlessly been on the rise for years now. Bitcoin, in particular, has seen tremendous growth, with its value increasing tenfold since 2017. This trend is expected to continue in the coming years, and many experts have made bitcoin price predictions 2023 that are staggering.\n\nSome believe that bitcoin could reach as high as $1 million per coin by the end of 2023, while others believe it will settle around $100,000. Those who get in early stand to make the most profit, so it\u2019s important to do your research and make an informed decision about whether or not to invest.\n\nOur predictions for Ethereum\n\nThe year 2023 might see Ethereum prices reach new highs. ETH could be worth $10,000 by the end of this year. While this may seem like a stretch, it\u2019s important to remember that the price of Bitcoin reached nearly $20,000 very fast.\n\nThe growth of the DeFi sector, increasing institutional adoption, and the launch of ETH 2.0 could all contribute to pushing Ethereum prices higher in 2023, which is why the Ethereum price prediction is high.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to get involved and want to invest in Ethereum, there are a few actions you can take. Naturally, you should first make sure you carry out your research before investing in it. After that, look into buying ETH on a reputable exchange like Coinbase or Kraken. And for your final step, consider storing your ETH in a secure wallet like Ledger or Trezor. By keeping an eye on Ethereum price predictions for 2023, you could make more informed decisions for investing in ETH.\n\nSteps to take for your first Crypto investment\n\nAs you could have concluded by now, Bitcoin and Ethereum are two of the most popular cryptocurrencies, and their prices have certainly caught plenty of attention. If you\u2019re thinking about investing in crypto, here are some factors to consider.\n\nThe basics\n\nIt\u2019s important to understand how cryptocurrency works. Cryptocurrency is a digital currency that uses cryptography to secure its transactions. Bitcoin, for example, is based on a decentralized network of computers that keep track of all bitcoin transactions. Ethereum is similar but also allows users to create contracts and programs within the Ethereum network.\n\nResearch\n\nYou need to decide which currency you want to invest in. There are numerous different cryptocurrencies available, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Make sure to research each one to find the one that suits your needs best.\n\nAccount setting\n\nYou need to open an account with a reputable exchange where you can buy and sell cryptocurrency. Coinbase is a popular option for those looking to invest in Bitcoin or Ethereum. Once you\u2019ve set up your account, you\u2019ll be able to buy and sell currency pairs like BTC/USD or ETH/USD.\n\nCaution\n\nLast but not least, it\u2019s vital to remember that cryptocurrency prices are highly volatile. This means that they can fluctuate rapidly in value, so it\u2019s important to monitor the market closely before making any trades. You should also have a clear exit strategy planned out before buying or selling any Crypto.\n\nThere are plenty of expectations in the crypto market in store for 2023 and the future of Ethereum and Bitcoin looks very bright. However, you will need to carry out your research and be cautious, while continually reading news about the price changes of Cryptocurrencies you want to invest in.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "NFT fans will be able to purchase the digital collectibles with their own Amazon account via debit or credit cards. Photo: Joseph Prezioso/AFP (JOSEPH PREZIOSO via Getty Images)\n\nAmazon is set to launch its own NFT marketplace next month, with the option of having digital collectibles linked to physical goods delivered to customers\u2019 doorsteps, according reports.\n\nThe details so far state that the marketplace will have 15 NFT collections available on launch for US-based customers, before expanding worldwide.\n\nNFT aficionados will be able to purchase the digital collectibles with their own Amazon (AMZN) account via debit or credit cards.\n\nThis will allow those who do not have access to a crypto wallet, such as Metamask, the ability to buy NFTs without having to purchase cryptocurrencies like ethereum (ETH-USD).\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAccording to reports the Amazon NFT marketplace could be called either 'Amazon NFT Marketplace' or 'Amazon Digital Marketplace'.\n\nWeb3 media outlet The Big Whale reported a date of April 24 for the launch.\n\nNFTs linked to physical goods delivered to doorsteps\n\nAfter the initiative is launched, Amazon shoppers will be able to purchase fashion-oriented NFTs that are linked to physical clothing, such as jeans, trainers and sweatshirts, according to a report.\n\nThese NFTs will be delivered to customer NFT accounts whilst the physical piece of clothing is being delivered to customer doorsteps.\n\nOne clothing company that has been at the forefront of linking NFTs with their physical produce is Nike.\n\nNike (NKE) acquired the virtual assets company RTFKT in 2021, which was integrated into the new \"Nike Virtual Studio\" to unleash a series of Nike-branded NFTs.\n\nAn example of this is Nike's Dunk Genesis CryptoKicks NFT range that is linked to the apparel retailer's 'real-world' Dunk sneakers.\n\nAmazon NFT initiative has been in development for months\n\nJeff Bezos' tech and online retail multinational has been taking progressive steps towards incorporating more Web3 features into its platforms.\n\nBack in January, crypto news outlet Blockworks reported that the world's largest retailer was launching a digital assets enterprise involving NFTs.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to the January report, four sources told Blockwork's that an Amazon NFT initiative is expected to be made available to consumers worldwide in the spring.\n\nIn the same month Amazon Web Services (AWS) partnered with web3 firm Ava Labs in a bid to accelerate the adoption of blockchain technology.\n\nWe\u2019re joining forces with @Amazon to help enterprises and governments build compliant blockchain solutions. #AWS makes it easier to launch and manage #Avalanche nodes, giving the network more strength and flexibility for developers.https://t.co/vgabB5c6Ya \u2014 Ava Labs \ud83d\udd3a (@avalabsofficial) January 11, 2023\n\nNFT market slump and the FTX collapse\n\nThe launch of digital collectible services on Amazon was delayed following the collapse of Bahamian cryptocurrency exchange FTX in November 2022.\n\nAfter the collapse of FTX the entire crypto ecosystem took a critical hit to its reputation, and the interest from web2 firms and retails in launching NFT marketplaces almost evaporated.\n\nHowever, the interest in NFTs amongst consumers has been slowly picking up pace again. The market for digital collectibles has shown signs of recovery since the beginning of 2023, according to data from DappRadar.\n\nA recent report from DappRadar showed healthier figures for the NFT market as a whole. In January NFT trading volume stood at $946m, up 38% from December 2022.\n\nCompanies such as Gucci, Nike and McDonald\u2019s (MCD) are developing digital collectibles as a promotional strategy to increase interest in their offerings.\n\nGucci is now running its own NFT-based metaverse event in The Sandbox. The Italian fashion label has created the first significant virtual environment on the metaverse platform that incorporates the brand's NFTs, called 'Gucci Vault Land'.\n\nWhat are NFTs?\n\nNFT stands for 'non-fungible token', and can usually be purchased on NFT marketplaces such as OpenSea.\n\nThey are unique digital assets that exist on a blockchain, which is a decentralised digital ledger that records transactions.\n\nThink of NFTs as digital collectibles or artwork that are unique and can't be replicated. They can be anything from a digital image or video to a tweet or a music album, or even a digital piece of clothing that can be used within a virtual world.\n\nWhen someone purchases an NFT, they own a digital certificate of ownership that verifies that they own the original, one-of-a-kind version of the asset.\n\nThis certificate is stored on the blockchain and can't be replicated or altered.\n\nNFTs have become popular in recent years as a way for creators and artists to sell and monetise their digital creations.\n\nThey also provide collectors with a way to own and invest in unique digital assets.\n\nAmazon has been contacted by Yahoo Finance UK, but have yet to reply with comment.\n\nWatch: Ukraine purchasing military equipment with crypto | The Crypto Mile"

        "title": "Ethereum Founder Buterin Dumps These Meme Coins, What You Need to Know - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin caused a stir in the crypto community today, but not with a tweet, but with the sale of several unknown meme coins. Both on-chain data provider Lookonchain and blockchain security company PeckShield have reported the transactions.\n\nLookonchain revealed via Twitter on March 7 that Vitalik Buterin is selling off \u201chis free shitcoins.\u201d So far, the Ethereum co-founder has sold 50 billion MOPS for 1.25 ETH (about $2,000), 10 billion CULT for 58 ETH (about $91,000) and 500 trillion SHIK for 380 ETH (about $600,000).\n\nSecurity firm PeckShield Alert reported via Twitter that CULT (Cult DAO) has fallen 13.7% since the dump by Buterin. SHIK (SHIKOKU) has been hit even harder, falling -95.8%. The SHIK address tagged with Vitalik Buterin has netted around 164 ETH (around $260,000) and transferred 214 ETH (around $337,000) to EthDev.\n\nAccording to Etherscan, the address belongs to the Ethereum Foundation and currently has an Ethereum balance of 336,271.54 ETH, worth about $528.18 million.\n\nRemarkably, Buterin has not sold all of his CULT tokens. As crypto Twitter noted, the Ethereum co-founder still owns 10 billion CULT. \u201cDidn\u2019t sell all his CULT tho. Guess he\u2019s holding 10bn as a moon-bag,\u201d one user said.\n\nCrypto Twitter Reacts To Sales From Ethereum Co-Founder\n\nThe crypto community on Twitter has been mostly disappointed by the action of Ethereum mastermind Buterin. The backdrop is that altcoins were largely illiquid cryptocurrencies, and thus the dump had a massive impact on low-value projects and the investors who own them.\n\nOthers are upset with projects sending Vitalik free tokens. Meanwhile, Buterin\u2019s motivations for selling the altcoins are unknown.\n\nOne user stated that this seems like a strange move, as Buterin is well aware that his sales will have a massive impact on prices. One theory is that his accountant warned him that these tokens would count as income on his tax return, which is why he sold the tokens to cover the costs.\n\nAnother theory is that Buterin is fully aware of the impact, as evidenced by the fact that he has done this several times before with other free altcoins. On the Lex Fridman podcast, Buterin explained once that he could put the money to better use elsewhere. In these cases, he has donated the funds, as was the case with Shiba Inu (SHIB), for example.\n\nButerin Reveals His Favorite DEX?\n\nMeanwhile, another user has pointed out that Buterin may have once again revealed his favorite DEX with the transfers. \u201cEveryone is talking about how Vitalik Buterin dumped CULT and SHIB but no one is mentioning that he did it on CoW Swap,\u201d he said, adding:\n\nReady for some real alpha? COW token is at only 7 million market cap, and this is the preferred DEX of Vitalik Buterin.\n\nAt press time, the Ethereum price resembled that of Bitcoin \u2013 moving sideways in a narrow range after dropping sharply on Thursday.\n\nFeatured image from Forbes, Chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "New Date For Ethereum (ETH) Shapella Upgrade, Orbeon Protocol - CoinGape",
        "content": "It has been a busy week in the world of cryptocurrencies, with news on the Ethereum (ETH) Shapella upgrade, Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) entering the ninth stage of the presale with a new price for tokens of $0.0835 and Bitcoin (BTC) showing continued volatility in the market. Let\u2019s take a moment to look at each of these events in turn.\n\n>>BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE<<\n\nBitcoin (BTC)\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is a digital currency that operates on a decentralized, peer-to-peer network without the need for intermediaries like banks or governments. Since its inception in 2009, Bitcoin (BTC) has become one of the most talked-about and controversial financial innovations of the past decade.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) continues to move higher year-on-year, but the Bitcoin (BTC) market remains volatile due to a variety of factors. Investors should be aware that large price swings are possible at any time and exercise caution when investing in Bitcoin (BTC).\n\n2021 saw Bitcoin (BTC) reach all-time highs of above $68,000, but since then, Bitcoin (BTC) has plummeted to recent lows just above $22,000. The good news for Bitcoin (BTC) holders is that the currency seems to be finding its footing above $23,000 and making a push higher.\n\n>>BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE<<\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second most widely used cryptocurrency in the world, is preparing to launch its highly anticipated Shapella upgrade. This upgrade is anticipated to significantly enhance the performance of Ethereum (ETH), providing users with an improved experience.\n\nShapella is the term used to describe a dual Ethereum (ETH) upgrade consisting of two distinct updates, namely \u201cShanghai\u201d and \u201cCapella.\u201d These updates are designed to enhance the performance of the Ethereum (ETH) network by improving both the consensus layer of the Beacon Chain and the execution layer\u2019s ability to facilitate Ethereum (ETH) withdrawals.\n\nWhen the Ethereum (ETH) Shapella upgrade goes live, Ethereum (ETH) validators will be able to withdraw their staked rewards for validating transactions on the new proof-of-stake network. This is encouraging news for Ethereum (ETH) holders, and it is just another step towards a more efficient, secure and reliable Ethereum (ETH) network.\n\n>>BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE<<\n\nOrbeon Protocol (ORBN)\n\nOrbeon Protocol (ORBN) takes a decentralized approach to crowdfunding by leveraging the power of blockchain technology to create a more transparent and secure fundraising process. This use of blockchain technology allows Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) to replace traditional shares with equity-backed NFTs that can be broken into smaller pieces.\n\nOrbeon Protocol (ORBN) opens up the world of fundraising to any investor, regardless of their financial background. In fact, just $1 USD can buy you an NFT on Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) \u2013 allowing anyone to become exposed to unicorn startups around the world.\n\nSmart contracts are another essential part of Orbeon Protocol (ORBN). They provide a secure and automated layer of trust between investors and entrepreneurs, allowing for an easier and more efficient process. Solid Proof, a third-party auditing company, audits all Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) smart contracts to ensure the trustworthiness of transactions.\n\nBut what role does the ORBN token play within this process? The ORBN token is the native currency of Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) and acts as a utility token, allowing individuals to access various elements of the network.\n\nWith this being one of the final Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) presale stages, sidelined investors don\u2019t have long to grab ORBN tokens for cheaper prices, especially with a 50% discount bonus for tokens currently. The release of ORBN onto exchanges later this year will likely cause the tokens to surge in price, estimated to be a 6000% increase in returns with a price of $0.24, so those who purchase now can be in for a treat.\n\nFind Out More About The Orbeon Protocol Presale\n\nWebsite: https://orbeonprotocol.com/\n\nPresale: https://presale.orbeonprotocol.com/register"

        "title": "What Is a Sovereign Rollup? Rollkit Pitches Second Layer for Bitcoin - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Just a few months after the very first NFT was inscribed into Bitcoin, developers are trying to imbue the age-old blockchain with another new-age technology: rollups.\n\nAt least that\u2019s what Rollkit\u2014a self-described \u201cmodular framework for rollups\u201d\u2014claimed over Twitter on Sunday, revealing a research integration that would allow \u201csovereign rollups\u201d on Bitcoin.\n\nAccording to Rollkit, its new rollup solution lets users produce rollups by retrieving and storing data on the Bitcoin blockchain. It was inspired by Ordinals, the Bitcoin NFT protocol which showed developers that\u2014using Taproot\u2014users could post arbitrary data to the blockchain.\n\nHow did we do it? \ud83d\udca1 Ordinals showed us it was possible to publish arbitrary data to Bitcoin. We saw this and decided to follow a similar process. At its core, all that was needed was two functions: one to submit rollup blocks, and another to retrieve them. pic.twitter.com/u6etICUAtg \u2014 Rollkit (@RollkitDev) March 5, 2023\n\nIn the traditional sense, rollups are batches of transactions that are \u201crolled up\u201d off chain into one transaction, and then posted to Ethereum as a single on-chain transaction. This helps free up blockspace and lower transaction costs on the network, while still inheriting the settlement assurances of the base chain.\n\nA sovereign rollup is one that does not need a smart contract or use a settlement layer for validation\u2014scalable and secure and with the \"sovereignty\" of a layer 1.\n\nHowever, some proponents of Ethereum, a network known to use layer-2 \u201crollups\u201d as a transaction scaling solution, have taken issue with Rollkit\u2019s use of the term.\n\nRyan Berckmans, a Web3 and Ethereum investor, said on Twitter that the sovereign rollup \u201cis actually an alt L1 that stores its block data on Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nAccording to Alexei Zamyatin, founder of the Bitcoin DeFi protocol Interlay, sovereign rollups as proposed by Rollkit inherit \u201cnothing\u201d of Bitcoin\u2019s security.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cData availability\u2014okay, but honestly, that's been used since 2012,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe entire post describes 'I write some data to Bitcoin' with fancy buzzwords.\u201d\n\nRollkit is still bullish on the possibilities.\n\n\u201cThis new integration expands the possibilities for rollups, and also has the potential to help bootstrap a healthy blockspace fee market on Bitcoin, enabling a more sustainable security budget,\u201d the company writes.\n\nSome are likening sovereign rollups to Stacks, a high functionality layer 1 protocol that settles its blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain for security purposes. Stacks co-founder Muneeb Ali said on Twitter that this is an apt comparison, but noted some key differences.\n\nOn one hand, it takes 150 Stacks blocks before a transaction reaches\u201dBitcoin finality\u201d on Stacks, but only 1 with sovereign rollups. On the other, Stacks blocks publish their data to Bitcoin in an efficient manner by merely hashing the data on-chain, whereas sovereign rollups publishes the full data.\n\n\u201cThe technically challenging part for both the Stacks layer and sovereign rollups is moving BTC in and out of the layer, said Ali. \u201cThe decentralized BTC peg is the most important part.\u201d"

        "content": "Digital asset investment firms poured $2.7 billion into decentralized finance projects in 2022, up 190% from 2021, while investments into centralized finance projects went the other way \u2014 falling 73% to $4.3 billion over the same timeframe.\n\nThe staggering rise in DeFi funding was despite overall crypto funding figures falling from $31.92 billion in 2021 to $18.25 billion in 2022 as the market shifted from bull to bear.\n\nAccording to a March 1 report from CoinGecko, citing data from DefiLlama, the figures \u201cpotentially points to DeFi as the new high growth area for the crypto industry.\u201d The report says that the decrease in funding toward CeFi could point to the sector \u201creaching a degree of saturation.\u201d\n\nFunding amount by sector in the cryptocurrency market between 2018-2022. Source: CoinGecko\n\nThe near three-fold increase in DeFi investment is also a staggering 65-fold increase from 2020, at the start of the last bull run.\n\nAccording to CoinGecko, the largest DeFi funding in 2022 came from Luna Foundation Guard\u2019s (LFG) $1 billion sale of LUNA tokens in February 2022, which came about three months before the catastrophic collapse of Terra Luna Classic (LUNC) and TerraClassicUSD (USTC) in May.\n\nEthereum-native decentralized exchange (DEX) Uniswap and Ethereum staking protocol Lido Finance raised $164 million and $94 million, respectively.\n\nMeanwhile, FTX and FTX US were the largest recipients of CeFi funding, having raised $800 million in January \u2014 accounting for 18.6% of CeFi funding in 2022 alone. The crypto exchanges, however, collapsed only 10 months later and filed for bankruptcy.\n\nOther areas of investments included blockchain infrastructure and blockchain technology companies, which raised $2.8 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively, a trend that has remained strong over the last five years, said CoinGecko.\n\nHenrik Andersson, the chief investment officer of Australia-based asset fund manager Apollo Crypto, says his firm is looking at four specific sectors within crypto as of late:\n\nThe first is \u201cNFTfi,\u201d which he said results from the combination of DeFi and NFTs.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nLast year was one of the most chaotic for the broader crypto industry.\n\nAfter FTX\u2019s collapse, thousands of employees were laid off, and many firms, especially those in the mining sector, shut shop entirely.\n\nAfter layoffs and bankruptcies, cryptocurrencies were also hit hard. The industry's market cap plummeted from roughly $2.23 trillion at the start of 2022 to just $832 million at the start of 2023, starting in earnest from June onwards and intensifying following the implosion of FTX, according to data from CoinGecko.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStill, software industry insiders claim there's never been more demand for blockchain developers.\n\nDemand for blockchain programming skills increased by 552% in 2022, as per a report by DevSkiller, compiling over 200,000 skills assessments. Tech firms can use these assessments as part of their hiring process to vet a developer\u2019s proficiency.\n\nWith asset prices down and crypto firms tightening their belts, why the jump in developer demand?\n\nBlockchain beyond tokens\n\nDevSkiller CTO Tomasz Nurkiewicz told Decrypt that much of this demand likely stems from non-crypto companies looking to scoop up developers with industry experience.\n\nHe said that firms could be \u201ctaking advantage of blockchain for different reasons, not necessarily just for cryptocurrencies, but for storage or for having a decentralized proof of something within their own companies.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe idea of decentralized storage and databases has already attracted some serious shows of faith. In September, Microsoft\u2019s venture capital fund M12 invested $20 million into Space and Time, a startup that aims to build a decentralized data warehouse with SQL-like database capabilities.\n\nThe firm says its cryptographic protocol, dubbed \u201cproof-of-SQL,\u201d will allow blockchain applications to perform analytics faster.\n\nFinance firms looking to build their own blockchains could be another key driver of demand for developers, according to BlockApps president and CEO Kieren James-Lubin. This may be due to some private financial markets which are, in his words, \u201cilliquid and weird.\u201d\n\nSeveral of the mainstays of traditional finance, including Blackrock, have made bold statements supporting tokenization, essentially bringing stocks, bonds, and other traditional financial assets onto a blockchain network.\n\nMoves like this could mean hiring more developers with blockchain experience.\n\nMathew McDermott, Goldman\u2019s Head of Digital Assets, echoed this sentiment in an interview with CNBC, saying that one of his key focuses for 2023 was on tokenization and \u201cdigitalizing the lifecycle.\u201d\n\nPeer-to-peer gaming has been another growth area in the past few years, and firms in this niche will likely keep hiring blockchain devs, according to Nurkiewicz.\n\nHe said, \u201cthe field is still gaining popularity despite the issues with crypto markets and crypto exchanges.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA report by DappRadar and the Blockchain Game Alliance (BGA) found that Web3 Gaming and metaverse projects raised $7.6 billion in 2022, a 59% rise since the year before.\n\nThat same year, blockchain gaming accounted for almost 50% of the on-chain activity.\n\nMore than just speculation\n\nMore broadly, James-Lubin from BlockApps said job opportunities will gradually move away from \u201cspeculative\u201d use cases.\n\n\u201cFrom a credit perspective, we\u2019re seeing a flight from really speculative use cases,\u201d explained James-Lubin. \u201cOne of the effects of the current market sentiment and of high-interest rates is that interest in more speculative returns farther in the future just collapses.\u201d\n\nHe said that investors are also much more cautious following the November meltdown of FTX and will generally want to invest in real-world use cases, as opposed to crypto-native opportunities.\n\n\u201cIt's a good or bad thing, depending on your perspective,\u201d said James-Lubin. \u201cAll of tech suddenly now has to think about profitability in a way that hasn't been the case in the last almost decade or so.\u201d\n\nDue to trends like this, future demand for blockchain developers won\u2019t necessarily correlate neatly with crypto prices.\n\n\u201cCrypto companies will hopefully learn to do sensible financial planning, in which the asset prices are less directly affecting their ability to employ people, such as keeping some of their funds in fiat currency,\u201d explained James-Lubin.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStill, Nurkiewicz had reservations that some investors might not understand the difference between \u201cthe technology and the market,\u201d and be put off blockchain projects anyway.\n\n\u201cWe might see some kind of psychological moves here, which are not entirely justifiable by the underlying tech,\u201d Nurkiewicz explained.\n\nWhat's a dev to learn?\n\nAccording to both Nurkiewicz and James-Lubin, they are seeing a large increase in demand for people with experience using the programming languages Solidity and Aetherium, as well as people who have experience using supporting tools within the Ethereum development environment such as Hard Hat.\n\nThough both execs told Decrypt that it\u2019s a great time to be starting out as a blockchain developer, Nurkiewicz thinks that aspiring developers should try to get a strong traditional computer science background alongside any blockchain skills.\n\nThis could include demonstrating practical knowledge of key aspects of blockchain infrastructure. This could be having examples of smart contracts that they can display on their GitHub page, or understanding how Merkle trees work.\n\nIn terms of pay developers can expect, DevSkiller reports that the average salary for blockchain-focused devs worldwide was around $79,983. This figure ballooned to $177,500 for those based in the U.S., making it one of the best-compensated specialties among developers.\n\nThough demand for blockchain skills exploded in 2022, the overall demand for these skills pales in significance to the old guard of programming languages such as JavaScript, Java, SQL, and Python.\n\nAccording to the 2022 Stack Overflow Survey, Solidity was only in use by 1.45% of developers, compared to over 65% using JavaScript or 55% using HTML.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAdditionally, blockchain development is still niche. Out of all the areas surveyed, only 2.5% of those surveyed described themselves as pure-play blockchain developers.\n\nBeing a \u201cblockchain developer\u201d isn\u2019t nearly as synonymous with being an employee at a crypto firm as in 2017. Opportunities are also cropping up in lucrative fields like traditional finance and gaming.\n\nAs a result, blockchain development could be a great career path regardless of market sentiment, says James-Lubin.\n\nBut even if crypto-related jobs dislocate from the price of Bitcoin, he said it\u2019s foolish for young people to base their entire careers on what's \u201chot right now.\u201d\n\nInstead, the CEO said people should focus on their true interest as trends, be it blockchain, AI, or delivery apps, come and go."

        "content": "A former Tornado Cash developer claims to be building a new crypto mixing service that aims to solve a \u201ccritical flaw\u201d of the sanctioned crypto mixer \u2014 which he hopes will convince United States regulators to reconsider its position on privacy mixers.\n\nThe code of a new Ethereum-based mixer, \u201cPrivacy Pools,\u201d was launched on GitHub on March 5 by its creator, Ameen Soleimani.\n\nIn a 22-part Twitter thread, Soleimani explained that the \u201ccritical flaw\u201d with Tornado Cash is that users cannot prove that they\u2019re not associated with North Korea\u2019s Lazarus Group or any criminal enterprise for that matter.\n\n1/ We fixed @tornadocash\n\n\n\nv0 of https://t.co/Nt4b2Tgx1D is live on @optimismFND\n\n\n\ntest out the demo, but please note:\n\n- this is experimental code\n\n- it has not been audited\n\n- the trusted setup is untrusted\n\n\n\nread the full story anon https://t.co/9nAU3RrgpN \u2014 ameen.eth (@ameensol) March 4, 2023\n\nWith Privacy Pools, however, Soleimani says that depositors and withdrawers can opt out of an anonymity set that contains an address associated with stolen or laundered funds.\n\nThis feature of Privacy Pools is executed with zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, meaning that the privacy of the user is preserved:\n\n\u201cNow, users have the option to help regulators isolate illicit funds, without revealing their entire transaction history [...] With privacy pools, just because someone deposits into the same smart contract as you, it doesn't mean they can also force you into sharing an anonymity set with them. It's your choice.\u201d\n\nSoleimani provided a demonstration of how Privacy Pools is used:\n\n13/ Our demo is live - https://t.co/Nt4b2Tgx1D\n\n\n\nNow, users have the option to help regulators isolate illicit funds, without revealing their entire transaction history.\n\n\n\nLet's watch a brief video of it in action: pic.twitter.com/An9lWx6jfr \u2014 ameen.eth (@ameensol) March 4, 2023\n\nThe developer hopes the solution will empower \u201cthe community to defend against hackers abusing the anonymity sets of honest users without requiring blanket regulation or sacrificing on crypto ideals.\u201d\n\nWhile Privacy Pools is already live on Optimism, Soleimani noted that the first version of the privacy protocol is still in its \u201cexperimental\u201d stage because the code isn\u2019t complete and has not been audited, but he is \u201cpretty close to having this ready.\u201d\n\nTo see the protocol progress further, Soleimani wants on-chain forensics platforms like Chainlaysis and TRM Labs to conduct tracebacks on deposits so that users of the privacy tool don\u2019t have to manually create their own subset exclusion lists.\n\nIn making the case for on-chain privacy protocols, Soleimani cited what he described as an \u201cexcellent\u201d report by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis in Missouri that examined the trade-offs between on-chain privacy and regulation:\n\n\u201cTheir report proposes to achieve effective regulation by having Tornado Cash users provide receipts to an intermediary, thus revealing their entire transaction history to the intermediary, but still being able to have privacy with respect to other public blockchain users.\u201d\n\nThe developer hopes this can help \u201cstart a conversation\u201d with U.S. regulators on how on-chain privacy can be preserved whilst restricting criminal activity through the use of ZK proofs.\n\nRelated: On-chain privacy is key to the wider mass adoption of crypto\n\nSoleimani\u2019s attempt to create a crypto-friendly on-chain privacy solution comes after the U.S. Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) sanctioned ETH and USDC addresses linked to Tornado Cash on Aug. 8 in response to several alleged thefts by North Korea\u2019s Lazarus Group, who were claimed to have routinely used the privacy mixer to preserve its anonymity.\n\nPhotograph of a #FreeAlex protest.

        "content": "Tezos has a different way to upgrade its blockchain. The software automatically updates the chain. Holders of the XTZ token can vote on changes, and once agreed upon, the chain updates itself. This should avoid a fork \u2013 in other words, two chains with two different currencies.\n\n\n\nMany crypto users like to transfer assets from one protocol to another, which is called bridging. Tezos has a couple of bridges that have proven popular for users. Let\u2019s dig in.\n\nAllbridge\n\nAllbridge can bridge digital assets between 18 chains. This includes, of course, Tezos. But also, for example, Avalanche, BNB, Ethereum, Fantom, Near, Polygon, and Solana. So, as you may have noticed, it connects EVM and non-EVM chains. This will include various L2 chains and NFTs as well in the future. Here\u2019s a list of the chains and tokens it supports.\n\nFor Tezos, Allbridge uses Quipuswap, a DEX on Tezos. The easiest asset to transfer is the Allbridge ABR token. On Quipuswap, you can swap this token. It\u2019s the native token to Allbridge, but it\u2019s wrapped on Tezos. Allbridge has an easy-to-understand guide on how to use the bridge. Madfish is the company behind Quipuswap. They made this bridging option possible. For example, they also offer the Temple wallet and other open-source DeFi products.\n\nAs with all bridges, you can now move digital assets around. It saves you having to go through a CEX. Using a CEX can result in extra costs and time.\n\nFrom Polygon, you can bridge USDC. From the BNB chain, it\u2019s BUSD. For all the other blockchains, it\u2019s ABR. However, more tokens are in the pipeline. For instance, BTC, AVAX, SOL, ETH, and NEAR. With Allbridge, you gain access to the Tezos DeFi ecosystem. The picture below shows the Allbridge UI.\n\nSource: Allbridge\n\nPlenty Bridge\n\nPlenty Bridge bridges Ethereum, Polygon, and Ethereum-based tokens to Tezos. Be aware, though, this bridge is still in Beta. This is a rebranded version of the WRAP bridge. Here\u2019s an article we wrote about this bridge. However, now you can bridge tokens in around five minutes. For example:\n\nUSDC\n\nDAI\n\nUSDT\n\nwBTC\n\nwETH\n\nLink\n\nMATIC\n\nAvalanche and BSC bridges are in the pipeline for Plenty Bridge. This bridge is part of the Plenty DEX on Tezos. Here you can swap, pool, farm, and, of course, bridge.\n\nBy using the bridge, you receive bridge tokens. These represent ERC20 tokens on Tezos with a peg to their original token. This is the brainchild of Tezsure, the company behind Plenty.\n\nWhen using the Plenty Bridge, you need to connect to a Tezos and an Ethereum-compatible wallet. On the Tezos side, there are various wallets available. They suit browsers, desktop, or mobile options. On the Ethereum side, it\u2019s any EVM-compatible wallet, like MetaMask or Rabby.\n\nTo make sure that the wrapped ERC20 tokens peg to their original token, Plenty uses a \u201cSigners Quorum.\u201d There are currently seven well-trusted Tezos community members. The members of the Signers Quorum share all bridging fees between them.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe looked into bridging assets between Tezos and other blockchains. Currently, there are two bridges available. Allbridge connects EVM and non-EVM chains. On the other hand, there\u2019s the Plenty Bridge, a rebranding of the WRAP bridge.

        "title": "Top 2 Bridges for Cardano (ADA) - DeFi - Altcoin Buzz",
        "content": "Bridging ADA Cardano\u2019s native token isn\u2019t a hard task. The easiest way to bridge to Cardano would be using a platform that supports Cardano (ADA) and a wide range of other blockchains. What makes bridging ADA fascinating is that Cardano is one of the world\u2019s leading blockchains for enterprise-grade applications.\n\nSo, bridging ADA grants the user access to the benefits offered from Cardano\u2019s scalability, advanced security, and governance features. Furthermore, you\u2019ll also have access to DeFi services and protocols that are only available on Cardano.\n\nWhen we talk about bridging, we mean transferring assets from one protocol to another. Some crypto assets function on one chain based on their design. But, crypto bridges pave the way to move liquidity across chains when needed. Thanks to bridges, platforms like Cardano and Ethereum, which do not see eye to eye, can share assets. Making the most of each market sector requires bridging assets from one chain to another.\n\nWhat Is ADA?\n\nAs mentioned above, ADA is Cardano\u2019s in-house token, and it is located on the Cardano Settlement Layer. ADA has a maximum supply of 45 billion tokens, and these tokens will be minted and distributed over time.\n\nLike other well-known cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), ADA can be kept in cryptocurrency wallets and exchanged for fiat money like the U.S. dollar. Third-party wallet services can store and transfer ADA in addition to native wallet options like Daedalus and Yoroi.\n\nADA and Cardano have an active development and investor community behind them. Interestingly, enthusiasts have gradually begun taking ADA as payment as the cryptocurrency keeps growing in value.\n\nNow, let\u2019s look at some bridges for ADA.\n\nMicrochain\n\nMicrochain provides a more secure cross-chain bridge that is based on Cardano. It provides fully centralized and decentralized cross-chain services, enabling multi-chain and multi-layer functionality. Presently, Microchain offers seamless cross-chain interaction between Milkomeda, Cardano, Ethereum, and Bitcoin. It, however, plans to extend its reach in the coming months.\n\nYou can use Microchain to easily bridge your ADA.\n\nMicrochain which is built on Cardano is out to empower multi-chain & multi-layer with complete centralized and decentralized cross-chain services. Microchain is also bringing mainstream crypto assets into Cardano,which would add tons of value into the Cardano ecosystem. \u2014 Veraaa \u272a (@verah_tee) June 15, 2022\n\nMilkomeda\n\nMilkomeda aims to provide non-EVM blockchains access to EVM features and currently supports the Cardano network. The Milkomeda protocol provides Cardano access to the power of the Ethereum Virtual Machine. It connects the Cardano blockchain with Ethereum, giving you access to the best features of both blockchains, much like a portal between two galaxies. Milkomeda is an EVM-compatible side chain bridged to Ethereum. So users have access to existing smart contracts and DeFi services on Ethereum.\n\n9/n This month we're proud to say that we've successfully unwrapped tokens using only @FlintWallet , allowing users to bridge their Milkomeda assets back to Cardano! We are actively working on Milkomeda DApp Support to make it possible to use EVM Dapps directly from Flint. \u2014 dcSpark (@dcspark_io) March 6, 2023\n\nWe have previously covered how to move tokens between Cardano and Milomeda.\n\nWhere Do You Buy Cardano?\n\nYou can buy ADA on a cryptocurrency exchange like Coinbase or Binance to convert fiat into cryptocurrency. Before selecting an exchange, it is best to be familiar with the costs and accepted payment options.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve decided on the exchange to use and how much ADA you want to buy, the next step is to choose a saving mechanism, such as hot or cold wallets, to keep your cryptocurrency holdings.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f For more cryptocurrency news, check out the Altcoin Buzz YouTube channel.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f Check out our most up-to-date research, NFT and Metaverse buy, and how to protect your portfolio in this market by checking out our Altcoin Buzz Access group, which for a limited time, is FREE.

        "title": "Balancing Established and New Cryptos: Ethereum, Cardano, and The Incredible Potential of SignUp Token - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA), two of the major cryptocurrencies, have been around for a long time and have survived market ups and downs. Yet newer cryptocurrencies, like SignUp Token, provide excellent investment potential. In this article, we\u2019ll look at Ethereum, Cardano, and the brand-new SignUp Token. We\u2019ll have a look at their historical performance, and why it might be a smart idea to mix existing cryptocurrencies with emerging ones in your portfolio.\n\nEthereum \u2013 The Smart Contract Leader\n\nBy market capitalisation, Ethereum (ETH) is the second-largest cryptocurrency behind Bitcoin. By utilising smart contracts, its blockchain technology enables the creation of decentralised apps. Smart contracts are self-executing computer programmes that automatically uphold an agreement\u2019s terms and conditions. Due to this technology, decentralised finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and many more new, creative uses for cryptocurrencies are now possible.\n\nWith price collapses and bear markets, Ethereum has had its fair share of market turbulence. It has, nevertheless, always recovered, demonstrating its tenacity and solid foundation. Investors love this resilience due to Ethereum\u2019s utility and are why this cryptocurrency is so popular. Ethereum has become a significant participant in the cryptocurrency market as a result of the expansion of decentralised apps and the rising use of DeFi platforms. Its core technology has cleared the way for developers to create and release dApps.\n\nCardano \u2013 A Promising Investment\n\nBeing introduced in 2017, Cardano (ADA) is a cryptocurrency that is still relatively fresh. Since then, it has grown to be among the top 10 cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalisation. Cardano employs blockchain technology to power decentralised apps in a similar way to Ethereum.\n\nCardano\u2019s strategy, however, varies from Ethereum\u2019s in several respects. Cardano is created with an emphasis on scalability, sustainability, and interoperability and is constructed utilising a more rigorous scientific methodology. The technology behind Cardano is intended to be more energy-efficient and to support a larger variety of applications, including identity verification, DeFi, and smart contracts.\n\nCardano has demonstrated potential growth and resiliency despite being a new cryptocurrency, particularly during the bear markets. It has succeeded in drawing a burgeoning community of fans and creators, making it a popular long-term investment.\n\nSignUp Token \u2013 Sign Up to Profit BIG\n\nSignUp Token is a brand-new cryptocurrency with a unique concept. Unlike typical tokens that are distributed through an ICO or a presale, the SignUp Token is not a token in and of itself. People sign up using their email address, which is then thoroughly verified to prevent automated signups.\n\nBefore 1 million emails have been registered using SignUp Token, no presale will be offered for the token. The token address and launch time will be included in an email sent to users, giving them the option to purchase the tokens in advance at no extra cost. This serves as the incentive to sign up.\n\nSignUp is a fun project that aims to build a community that can create generational wealth together! Make sure to get involved to become a part of this!\n\nA Portfolio Perfectly Balanced, As All Things Should Be\n\nTo balance risk and reward, investing in both established and emerging cryptocurrencies might be a wise move. Existing cryptocurrencies with a track record of stability and development, like Ethereum and Cardano, make for a relatively secure investment choice.\n\nOn the other hand, thanks to their novel ideas and early-stage investments, emerging cryptocurrencies like SignUp Token have the potential for enormous returns. Diversifying your portfolio is essential for reducing risk and maximising possible profits.\n\nThe cryptocurrency industry is continually changing, with fresh, cutting-edge ideas and new coins appearing daily. From their inception, Ethereum and Cardano have demonstrated their tenacity and solid foundations.\n\nA unique investment opportunity is offered by emerging cryptocurrencies like SignUp Token, giving early adopters the chance to make enormous gains. Combining known and emerging cryptocurrencies can be a profitable investment strategy, but to reduce risk, investors should always do extensive research and diversify their holdings.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Making good market performance has become more challenging for cryptocurrencies than ever. Hence, TRON (TRX) and Solana (SOL) have faced many roadblocks in their run. On the other hand, the demand for TMS Network (TMSN) presale has skyrocketed. TMS Network (TMSN) has posted a growth rate of 700% during its presale\u2019s first stage.\n\nTRON (TRX) Processes Most Transactions Per Second\n\nA recent tweet by the TRON community claimed that the TPS (transactions per second) of TRON (TRX) is more than that of Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Ripple. As per the tweet, the TPS of TRON (TRX) is 88.20, while it is just 11.96 for Ethereum and 3.43 for Bitcoin. This has also caused a spike in the number of transactions on the TRON (TRX) network. Analysts believe that if the activities continue to increase, the number of activated addresses on the TRON (TRX) network can surpass 2 million. Meanwhile, TRON\u2019s (TRX) value has declined by 5% in the last seven days. However, the price of TRON (TRX) has increased by 3.44% on the monthly chart. Currently, TRON (TRX) trades at $0.0667, which is 78% below its all-time high of $0.30.\n\nNetwork Outage Dents Solana\u2019s (SOL) Image\n\nAfter suffering a network outage for the 10th time, Solana (SOL) has announced upgrading its software update processes. Recently, Solana (SOL) suffered a massive downtime that affected all transactions on the network. Solana (SOL) also faced severe criticism for this outage. Some experts called the Solana (SOL) network unstable and questioned its maintainability. Responding to all these concerns, Solana (SOL) has assured that it would improve its network to avoid any further downtime. After the network outage, Solana (SOL) witnessed a fall in its price. The market value of Solana (SOL) has fallen by 12% in the last seven days. Consequently, the trading price of Solana (SOL) has come down to $21.10, which is 92% below its peak of $260.06.\n\nTMS Network (TMSN) Records Gigantic Growth Of 700%\n\nTMS Network (TMSN) is a comprehensive trading platform that has successfully raised over $500k during the first stage of its presale. TMS Network (TMSN) facilitates the trading of various digital assets using cryptos as payment. TMS Network (TMSN) allows the trading of digital assets without opening an account. People can simply connect their wallets to start trading. TMS Network (TMSN) has set up a protocol for instant withdrawals or deposits of digital assets with a single user interface. The network authorizes the trading of any asset class, including stocks, cryptocurrencies, futures, forex, and more. This unique trait maintains sufficient liquidity on TMS Network (TMSN), helping traders complete their transactions quickly.\n\nTMS Network (TMSN) is known for offering transparency and security in all trade-related activities. The platform has put smart contracts in place to oversee all trading activities, and all proceedings on the network are automatically recorded on a public ledger. The network assists traders in investing in a broad range of digital assets at a lower cost. The essential feature of TMS Network (TMSN) is its scalability. It can easily handle a surge in the number of transactions without compromising its speed.\n\nTMS Network (TMSN) has initiated a first-of-its-kind revenue-sharing model. The network charges a small fee on every transaction on the platform, and distributes the revenue among TMSN holders. TMS Network (TMSN) also empowers users to do research before making an investment. The presale round of TMS Network (TMSN), which started at $0.003, has jumped to $0.029, following an increase of more than 700%.\n\nPresale: https://presale.tmsnetwork.io\n\nWhitepaper: https://tmsnetwork.io/whitepaper.pdf\n\nWebsite: https://tmsnetwork.io\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/tmsnetworkio\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/njA95e7au6\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/tmsnetworkio\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Ethereum can help enterprises in achieving transparency - Premium Times",
        "content": "Business chain relationships in the finance and tech industry are genuinely global in reach and complexity. Supply chains are often dangerously opaque, with a lack of transparency leading to adverse environmental and societal effects. Therefore, enterprises actively seek decentralized solutions for tracking goods across value chains to achieve transparent supply chain management. Anyone can trade Ethereum on a trusted platform like ethereum code\n\nEthereum is a public blockchain that has high levels of scalability and privacy. Furthermore, because it can transfer value without relying on a trusted entity, Ethereum will provide an efficient solution for achieving transparency in business chains through Smart Contracts.\n\nSmart contracts- The key to businesses:\n\nThe Smart Contract can act as a digital platform between counterparties to collaborate and develop supply chain relationships across borders autonomously through intelligent contracts utilizing Ethereum technology. Consumers, companies, and financial institutions have all sought to connect around the globe to increase efficiencies. The rise of the internet has enabled this global connectivity; however, this connectivity isn\u2019t based on trust alone. Therefore, enterprises need to maintain trust through transparent communication of their products and services.\n\nIt is where Ethereum comes into play; it provides a foundation for transparent communication between counterparties and third-party auditing services. The results from these audits can then be used as information by enterprises or consumers in furthering trade and developing business chains. As a result, Ethereum has a wide range of applications ranging from financial services to supply chains; the list goes on.\n\nThese DAOs can manage and automate numerous types of workflows and businesses. The price for Ethereum has risen dramatically over the past year, which is incredibly encouraging for its continued growth. This rise also shows that enterprises increasingly recognize its potential as a business-driven protocol in many different industries, not just as an investment asset or an efficient alternative to Bitcoin.\n\nEthereum can help enterprises in the following way:\n\n1. Ethereum can help track products:\n\nManaging a supply chain (whether it\u2019s products or services) can be extremely hard, time-consuming, and costly. The challenging logistics of the supply chain make it difficult to track the products as they move from one location to another. Most importantly, a lack of transparency can lead to the illegal trade in products and services banned in many countries. Ethereum\u2019s business use cases can include many industries, such as food supplies, pharmaceuticals, equipment, etc.\n\n2. Ethereum can help enterprises in achieving transparency:\n\nEnterprises increasingly seek decentralized solutions for tracking goods across value chains to achieve transparent business chain management. The use cases of Ethereum technology may include tracking products across different locations and countries to ensure that compliance standards are maintained.\n\nMany supply chain-related activities require trust collaboration, such as the exchange of information or the review process of a product to get it authorized for legal use. For example, the drug is checked for authenticity and compliance with FDA regulations in the pharmaceutical supply chain. Furthermore, healthcare centers must comply with local regulatory requirements of their geographical area if we consider healthcare industries. In addition, the product should be safe and capable enough to serve its intended purpose effectively. Ethereum can help in these cases by providing a trusted and transparent platform for healthcare information and its products.\n\n3. Multi-Signature and Corruptible Contract Security Mechanism:\n\nEthereum is a public blockchain that works in a decentralized manner. There are no central authorities managing transactions, and each user holds the private keys of their accounts. The multi-Signature feature involves three parties: buyer, seller, and escrow agent.\n\nThe protocol is designed so that it involves an escrow agent, ensuring that any transaction between two parties remains clear and transparent to both parties. So, if there\u2019s any dispute between two or more parties involved in the transaction, then they can take it up with the escrow agent who can act as an arbitrator. Ethereum\u2019s triple transactions feature will reduce the chances of fraud and increase the trust among parties.\n\nEthereum is a perfect technology for the business chain industry. However, smart contracts in the value chain industry will only work if they can achieve transparency, speed, and cost-efficiency. People can use Ethereum to achieve those goals in several aspects of the value chain, such as logistics financing and contract terms verification through intelligent contracts. Once these intelligent contracts have been developed, they can be used extensively by enterprises online and offline. However, the financial industry can be tricky, with many overlapping regulations and standards across countries.\n\nTamper-resistant documentation:\n\nEnterprises can use the trustless properties of blockchain to reduce the chances of fraud. For example, if all parties access the same information in real-time, they can verify each transaction. In addition, Ethereum enables intelligent contracts to be shared across different parties without any chance of tampering or manipulation. For example, supply chain transactions likely include just a few parties and no intermediaries.\n\nEthereum will help ensure that all parties have real-time access to the same information. So, if there\u2019s any dispute between two or more parties involved in the transaction, then they can take it up with the escrow agent who can act as an arbitrator.\n\nProviding value to customers:\n\nCustomers want their products delivered fast, efficiently, and accurately. They want to avoid entering into a contract with one value chain member only to find numerous intermediaries involved during the delivery process.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\nWhatsApp\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n"

        "content": "For some time now, the value trend of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) has been very similar.\n\nFocus on the value trend of Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nSince November last year, the two trends have been proceeding almost in unison.\n\nAnalysis of Bitcoin (BTC)\n\nThe market value trend of Bitcoin (BTC) in recent days is rather flat and monotonous.\n\nIn fact, it has been doing nothing but lateralizing within a very compressed range between $22,200 and $22,500 now since Friday 3 March, with only a few brief excursions just above or just below.\n\nIt is as if after the sudden drop from $23,400 to $22,400 last Friday the price has stabilized.\n\nIn fact, that drop was only the latest in a series that began on 21 February, after failing for the fourth time to break the $25,000 mark.\n\nSomething similar had already happened in early February to Bitcoin, after it failed its fourth attempt to break above $24,000 on Thursday 2 March.\n\nThen between late January and early February it tried four times to move steadily above $24,000 without succeeding, at which point it began to fall, stopping eight days later around $21,600.\n\nThereafter, it later lateralized around that figure for four days, only to suddenly break down that wall and head straight for $25,000 on 15 February.\n\nAt that point, it seems to have begun a phase similar to the one that just ended, but at levels $1,000 higher.\n\nIn fact, it tried four times to break above $25,000, only to start falling on 21 February.\n\nThe descent lasted ten days, instead of the eight days of the previous medium-short-term cycle, and it has now been sideways in the very narrow range of $22,200 to $22,500 for four days.\n\nShould it manage to return above $24,000 within a couple of days, or even break through the $25,000 wall, the medium-short-term cycle would have replicated itself in almost the same way.\n\nIt is worth noting that $25,000 seems a much more difficult resistance to break through than $24,000.\n\nAnalysis of Ethereum (ETH)\n\nThe trend in the market value of Ethereum (ETH) has been very similar, although at different levels.\n\nIt was again on Friday 3 March that the price of ETH fell to $1,560, and since then it has continued to lateralize within a very compressed range between $1,560 and $1,580.\n\nThis trend seems identical to that of Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nPreviously, while Bitcoin tried unsuccessfully four times to move steadily above $25,000, Ethereum tried unsuccessfully to move above $1,700, although for three days, from 17 to 19 February included, it seemed to have succeeded.\n\nThe decline began on 21 February, at the same time as Bitcoin\u2019s.\n\nIn contrast, between late January and early February, when Bitcoin was trying four times to exceed $24,000, Ethereum\u2019s price had remained almost consistently above $1,600.\n\nFrom this difference it seems to emerge that at this stage Ethereum\u2019s price trend is influenced by Bitcoin\u2019s, and not vice versa.\n\nIt is worth noting that another difference concerns percentage movements.\n\nFor example, after the four failed attempts to get back above $24,000, BTC then lost 11% in eight days, while ETH lost 13% in five days.\n\nAnd after the failure of the fourth attempt to get above $25,000, BTC lost 11% again, while ETH lost 9%, this time both in ten days.\n\nThe comparison between Bitcoin and Ethereum: value trend, regulation and market\n\nThus what seems to be dragging the trend of Ethereum\u2019s market value during this period is the trend of Bitcoin\u2019s market value, with small differences that make it clear how the two trends actually move independently, but with the latter heavily influencing the former.\n\nExtending the comparison to the whole of 2023 shows that Bitcoin since late 2022 has gained 34%, while ETH has gained 30%. And extending it to November 2021, when all-time highs were touched, BTC loses 67% while ETH 68%.\n\nThus, there are more differences in this early 2023 in favor of Bitcoin than there have been since the highs were touched.\n\nSpecifically, in the past 30 days, Bitcoin\u2019s price has lost 3.5% while Ethereum\u2019s has lost 5%.\n\nIt is possible that this difference is affected by the words of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler recently, whereby he suggests that only Bitcoin is a commodity, while Ethereum, like other cryptocurrencies, should actually be considered securities."

Watch this price prediction in the 1-hour timeframe\n\nThe Ethereum price is right now still trading within the Flag Pattern, indicating that the pattern build-up is still far from over. But once completed, we expect to see the Altcoin sell-off aggressively to the downside.\n\nThe key level we are keeping an eye on to confirm the start of this bearish sell-off is the $1,553 key support in the 1-hour timeframe.\n\nWe need to see the ETH price break through this key support for our bearish bias on Ethereum to be confirmed. However, what we have seen instead is that the ETH price has tested this key support over and over again and failed to break through it.\n\nWhat Now For Ethereum?\n\nWell for now, we are still bearish on the Altcoin price and believe that there is still a very high probability for us to see a massive sell-off in the coming days.\n\nHowever, the key level we are watching right now is the $1,553 key support in the 1-hour timeframe. We need to see this key support give way for this Ethereum bearish bais to be confirmed.\n\nUntill the ETH bears can breakthrough this key support level, we will stand aside and continue to wait for that bearish confirmation.\n\nClaim up to $30,030 in Bonus 100x Leverage Start Trading\n\nHow to Trade Bitcoin (BTC)?\n\nTo understand the basics of Bitcoin trading, you can read our How To Trade Bitcoin Guide.

        "content": "Scroll, a Layer 2 Ethereum network utilizing zk-rollups technology, has announced that it raised $50 million in its most recent funding round. Participants included Polychain Capital, Sequoia China, Bain Capital Crypto, Moore Capital Management, Variant Fund, Newman Capital, IOSG Ventures, and Qiming Venture Partners. According to a source with direct knowledge of the matter, this brings Scroll\u2019s total valuation to an estimated $1.8 billion. The company has raised $83 million in funding, following two earlier rounds that had not yet disclosed their respective valuations.\n\nHow Scroll uses zk-rollup technology to increase Ethereum scalability\n\nFounded in 2021, Scroll aims to bring Ethereum to a billion users. As a Layer 2 network, it works by processing transactions off-chain and then porting them back to Ethereum, thus increasing transaction speed and reducing costs. Scroll looks to revolutionize how people interact with blockchain technology through this innovative approach.\n\nScroll\u2019s zk-rollup technology enables scalability on its network. Recently, Scroll launched its zero-knowledge Ethereum virtual machine (zkEVM) on the Goerli testnet, marking a move out of the pre-alpha testing phase. According to co-founder Sandy Peng in an interview, traction on the pre-alpha testnet was strong, with one million unique addresses and 16 million transactions. The mainnet launch is estimated to be within the next three to four months.\n\nScroll is one of several Ethereum scaling networks that use zk-rollups, such as Polygon, StarkWare, and Matter Labs. According to Peng, Scroll\u2019s competitive edge lies in its three core values: community-driven, security first, and decentralization at every level. With the recently acquired capital, Scroll aims to continue developing its product, launch its mainnet and grow its ecosystem. Additionally, Scroll intends to expand its current team of 60 to nearly 100 soon."

        "content": "The Balvi Filantropic Fund, spearheaded by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, donated $15 million USDC to the University of California San Diego to research airborne pathogens. This marks one of the largest donations ever made to an American university and is also the biggest donation ever towards open-source research on aerosols. This generous contribution will undoubtedly further knowledge and understanding of the subject.\n\nVitalik Buterin and Balvi have allowed UC San Diego to advance their research into airborne diseases in a changing climate by establishing their new Meta-Institute for Airborne Disease in a Changing Climate, The Airborne Institute.\n\nThis generous donation will enable atmospheric chemist and professor at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at UC San Diego, Kimberly Prather, to explore the production, survival, and transport of airborne microbes in a changing climate around the world. \u201cWe are immensely grateful for this incredible gift from Vitalik Buterin and Balvi,\u201d said Prather.\n\nSo excited for this new adventure!! Our goal is to connect our understanding of the science of airborne disease transmission with education and measures to improve indoor air that will better protect everyone. (1/2) https://t.co/gLawokQKiQ \u2014 Kimberly Prather, Ph.D. (@kprather88) March 7, 2023\n\nThe Balvi Filantropic Fund, established in partnership with the Shiba Inu community and CryptoRelief \u2013 India\u2019s emergency relief fund \u2013 in May 2022, will lead a research unit into COVID-19 under the direction of Professor Prather Rommie Amaro, Director of the National Biomedical Computation Resource at UC San Diego. This research unit hopes to significantly contribute to tackling the global pandemic.\n\nSecond update from Balvi! \ud83e\uddf5\n\n\n\nLots more anti-covid projects funded, thanks to funds from @Shibtoken @CryptoRelief_!\n\n\n\nPrevious update here:https://t.co/V4bZfZ2rOi \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) September 8, 2022\n\nSince its launch, the Balvi fund has donated over $15 million to more than ten coronavirus-related research projects. The largest grant of $5.3 million was made to The University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia, to develop a tool to detect virus outbreaks quickly.\n\nAdditionally, the fund led a $15 million donation to the Long Covid Research Initiative, which is researching a long-term condition caused by the COVID-19 virus. The crypto community has been at the forefront of donations to numerous global causes, including $50 million for victims of Russia\u2019s attacks in Ukraine during Q1 2022 and, more recently, aid for those affected by earthquakes in Turkey and Syria."
