        "content": "Crypto may be in a slump right now, but there's a silver lining.\n\nOne of the best ways to make a lot of money in the stock market is to buy during the low points, then simply wait for your investments to recover. By investing in the right places, you could see lucrative returns during the next upswing.\n\nEthereum (ETH 0.13%) is currently down around 68% from its peak in late 2021, which could make right now a fantastic opportunity to buy the dip. But could it make you a millionaire this year? Here's what you need to know.\n\nWill Ethereum recover in 2023?\n\nThe short answer: Nobody knows for certain. Crypto is still a speculative investment, so there are no guarantees that this industry will even exist years or decades from now.\n\nThat said, Ethereum remains one of the strongest players in the field. It's the second most popular crypto behind Bitcoin, and with a market cap of around $202 billion, Ethereum makes up a significant portion of the $1 trillion crypto sector as a whole.\n\nEthereum also has a few distinct advantages that could help it succeed over time:\n\nSmart contracts: A smart contract is a self-executing contract that's built on a blockchain, and they have the potential to revolutionize a variety of industries -- particularly when it comes to decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nA smart contract is a self-executing contract that's built on a blockchain, and they have the potential to revolutionize a variety of industries -- particularly when it comes to decentralized finance (DeFi).

While NFTs aren't as popular as they were in recent years, they still have niche followings. The metaverse: Ethereum is also one of the most popular blockchains for metaverse projects.

Major applications like and -- which are leading the way in expanding the metaverse -- are built on Ethereum's blockchain. Other cryptocurrencies: Finally, Ethereum also hosts other cryptocurrencies on its network, including big names like Shiba Inu and Polygon. If the next breakout star is hosted on its blockchain, Ethereum will benefit from it.\n\nIn other words, Ethereum is well-diversified within the crypto world. If any areas of crypto thrive -- whether it's NFTs, DeFi, the metaverse, or some other cryptocurrency -- Ethereum may be poised for serious growth.\n\nHow much can you earn with Ethereum?\n\nAs with any cryptocurrency, there's no way to know precisely how Ethereum will perform throughout 2023. Its price could continue to fall throughout the year, or it could rebound significantly.\n\nIt's wise, then, to keep a long-term outlook when investing in crypto. The short term could be rough, especially if we haven't seen the worst of this downturn yet. But Ethereum has faced worse in the past. And if history shows us anything, it's that riding out the storm can be incredibly profitable.\n\nFor example, back in 2018, Ethereum's price fell by a staggering 94% throughout the year. But if you invested at its lowest point, you would have earned returns of roughly 657% over the following two years alone. Within three years, nearly 4,500%.\n\nEthereum Price data by YCharts\n\nIn other words, if you had invested $1,000 in Ethereum at the end of 2018, you'd have nearly $46,000 by the end of 2021.\n\nOf course, 2020 and 2021 were exceptional years for crypto, and there are no guarantees we'll ever see short-term growth like that again. But with all of Ethereum's potential, many experts have high hopes for its long-term returns.\n\nThere are risks to consider, too, such as the speculative nature of the crypto market and Ethereum's constant struggle with slow transaction times and high gas fees. Before you buy, make sure you're willing to take on a high-risk investment, and consider whether the potential rewards outweigh those risks.\n\nDespite its drawbacks, though, Ethereum still has plenty of long-term potential. While it may not make you a millionaire in the coming months, by staying invested for the long haul, it could potentially be a lucrative investment."

        "title": "Explained: How Ethereum\u2019s token burns are making it a deflationary cryptocurrency - CNBCTV18",
        "content": "Multiple crypto projects in the market oscillate between being inflationary and deflationary in nature. Ethereum, the biggest altcoin in the market has recently gained the status of being a deflationary cryptocurrency, thanks to its recent burning rate.\n\nBut before we delve deeper into the subject, let us give you a quick understanding of when an asset becomes deflationary.\n\nWhy do cryptos become deflationary?\n\nThe terms inflationary and deflationary stem from an asset's supply and demand. It is important to note that the majority of crypto assets can be inflationary in nature. This directly relates to the supply of circulating tokens in the market. The more tokens are out there in circulation, the higher the chances of the crypto being affected by inflation.\n\nSeveral crypto assets come with a limited supply, such as Bitcoin (21 million) or BNB (200,000,000) while many other projects come with an infinite supply of coins. Some examples of the latter are Solana, Dogecoin, and Ethereum.\n\nHowever, a crypto asset can be deflationary despite having a limited or unlimited supply. In the case of coins with an infinite supply, there needs to be a burning mechanism in which a certain number of tokens are \u2018burnt\u2019 (destroyed) or they are moved away from circulation in a separate wallet that cannot be accessed. Therefore, the tokens which are burnt are rendered useless.\n\nHowever, burning is an essential component since it creates a balance between supply and demand, which in turn helps determine the prices of these tokens. If demand exceeds supply, the prices will likely go up and vice versa.\n\nBitcoin, Shiba Inu, or BNB are some good examples of deflationary tokens. Now Ethereum too is hailed as a deflationary crypto asset. So, what caused this transition?\n\nHow did Ethereum transition to a deflationary crypto asset?\n\nThe reason Ethereum is now considered a deflationary cryptocurrency is that the number of ETH tokens that are entering into circulation is less than the number of tokens that are being burnt on a regular basis.\n\nEthereum launched the EIP-1559 protocol back in August 2021, where EIP stands for Ethereum Investment Protocol. The protocol entails that with every transaction conducted on the Ethereum blockchain, a fraction of the transaction fee or gas fees will be burnt.\n\nEver since the launch of the EIP-1559, almost 2.8 million ETH worth $4.6 billion (at present prices) has been burnt so far and removed from circulation in the process. Currently, an estimated ETH burn rate is 1.62 ETH per minute, as per reports. This has rendered Ethereum to be more deflationary than even Bitcoin.\n\nEthereum\u2019s transition to becoming a deflationary asset cannot be credited only to its burning rate. The previous year, Ethereum switched from being a Proof-of-Work (PoW) network to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) network. This was a massive game changer for Ethereum and was popularly termed the Ethereum Merge.\n\nPoS is a more efficient mechanism that allows users to stake their ETH in return for yields. This transition from PoW to PoS has attracted numerous investors. As per Etherscan, more than $24 billion worth of ETH is deposited on the Beacon Deposit Contract, which is a smart contract at the core of the new transition.\n\nIt has been witnessed that the NFT (Non-Fungible Tokens) and DeFi (Decentralized Finance) activities conducted on the Ethereum blockchain have resulted in the maximum burning of ETH over the previous week alone (almost 8,000 ETH).\n\nIn Conclusion: Is this good news for the ETH community?\n\nExperts indicate that the massive burning rate of Ethereum has positively affected the coin's economy. After a disastrous previous year, ETH prices this year have gone up significantly.\n\nExperts believe that if Ethereum can continue its burning rate and maintain a lower circulation supply than the number of tokens burnt, ETH prices will likely continue to go up, which can be great news for long-term investors. At the time of writing, ETH was trading hands at $1,633.22, gaining 0.40 percent over the previous day.\n\nAlso Read: Top 5 crypto presales to watch out for this month"

        "content": "As the proposed date for the Ethereum Shanghai update draws closer, developers have created a testing environment called a \u201cshadow fork,\u201d according to a Jan. 23 tweet thread by Go-Ethereum developer Marius Van Der Wijden. The new testnet appears to have been created in order to test the conditions needed for Ether (ETH) staking withdrawals, which are currently disabled but are intended to become enabled in the update.\n\nWithdrawal-Mainnet-Shadow-Fork-1 is finalizing\n\n\n\nIt started out with a few issues because the config wasn't correctly applied on geth (we disallow overriding the mainnet config). The config is applied correctly and all nodes are in agreement. We will start some evil nodes,. \u2014 MariusVanDerWijden (@vdWijden) January 23, 2023\n\nThe name of the testnet is \u201cWithdrawal-Mainnet-Shadow-Fork-1.\u201d According to Web3 node provider Alchemy, a \u201cshadow fork\u201d is a fork of the mainnet that is intended to be used only for testing purposes.\n\nVan Der Wijden stated that he and another developer named \u201cPotuz\u201d will create malicious nodes that will send bad blocks and messages to other nodes on the testnet and try to convince them to join a false version of the network. For now, the network is running smoothly, but Van Der Wijden has stated that he wants to \u201csee if Potuz and I can break it.\u201d This is apparently being done to see if the upgrade can prevent malicious attacks or if further changes need to be made before it is implemented on mainnet.\n\nRelated: Metamask provides liquid staking solutions from Lido and Rocket Pool\n\nThe launch of this testnet comes after devs have expressed an increasing urgency to make Ether staking withdrawals a reality. On Jan. 6, they held a meeting during which they agreed to exclude the proposed EVM Object Format (EOF) from the Shanghai upgrade. EOF was intended to make Ethereum easier to upgrade in the future. But because of its complexity, the devs decided to leave it out of Shanghai for fear that it would delay withdrawal implementation.\n\nOver 14.5 million ETH (over $23 billion worth, at time of writing) has been deposited into the Ethereum staking contract and cannot currently be withdrawn, according to a December report by Nansen. In November, Ethereum devs came under harsh criticism for allegedly moving the goalpost in regards to enabling withdrawals.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade is currently scheduled to be implemented sometime in March."

According to a report by blockchain analysis provider Token Terminal, the amount of assets locked in these networks is also rising.\n\nData from Token Terminal shows that Polygon has seen a surge in daily users since Oct 2022. As of October, daily users stood at 313,400 a figure that has nearly doubled to over 600,000 daily users. The increased transaction has led to nearly $55,000 in daily network fees for Polygon.\n\nAccording to the data, Arbitrum One has grown by 40% and now has 41,695 daily users making daily fees over $40,000. Arbitrum also dominates the market share in terms of total value locked (TVL) on its network. TVL on Arbitrum is at $2.5 billion, accounting for 52% of the total assets locked on Ethereum\u2019s layer 2 platforms.\n\nOptimism has recorded gains of over 180% in daily network fees, which is a significantly higher increase than Polygon. The last three months have also seen daily users on Optimism spike by 190%. TVL on Optimism currently stands at $1.46 billion with a market share of 30%.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolygon\u2019s developers are working round the clock\n\nAmong layer 2 networks, Polygon is tipped to have a more robust development in 2023. The network\u2019s recent hard fork, which will reduce gas fees and improve its overall performance, can be described as an early sign of future developments.\n\nMultiple projects are also set to migrate to Polygon from rival networks, including Solana\u2019s yOOTs. Polygon has partnered with Xternity to migrate Synergy Land, a web3 game, from Solana. Last week Mastercard announced a partnership with Polygon as it launched its web3 musician accelerator program aimed at helping artists build their brands leveraging on web3.\n\nPolygon climbed back into the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization after it was pushed out briefly by Solana this week."

        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has proposed a \"stealth address system\" to improve transactional privacy on the Ethereum blockchain. In a research blog, Buterin wrote that privacy is \"one of the largest remaining challenges in the Ethereum ecosystem.\"\n\nThe stealth address system is based on a mechanism that would allow any Ethereum wallet to generate cryptographically obfuscated public addresses called \"stealth addresses'' in order to receive funds in a private manner and access them using a special code called a \"spending key.\"\n\nButerin described that stealth addresses give the same privacy properties as someone generating a fresh address for each transaction. These proposed stealth addresses are a way to increase privacy on Ethereum by creating unique, anonymous addresses for each transaction.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nEach time someone makes a transaction, they can generate a new stealth address so that it is difficult for anyone to track the transactions or determine who is sending and receiving assets. This means that each user's transactional history can remain private. Buterin also suggested using ZK-SNARKs, shorthand for zero-knowledge proofs, to boost the privacy of the system and make it difficult to link the stealth addresses.\n\nOn Ethereum, transactions are public by default, which can pose a privacy concern. There are ways to attain transactional privacy on the network, such as using cryptocurrency mixers like Tornado Cash. However, such methods can raise regulatory issues. This was seen with Tornado Cash, which was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) for potentially illicit activities."

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin\u2019s first tryst with the Bitcoin community dates back to 2011. He began participating in \u2018Bitcointalk,\u2019 a forum created by Satoshi Nakamoto. It was then that he co-founded and started writing articles for Bitcoin magazine. He began traveling to speak with BTC developers around the world in a bid to construct a new, potentially superior iteration of the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nIn late 2013, Buterin described the idea of yet another digital currency in a white paper and sent it to a few of his friends. The vision was to develop a blockchain with a built-in programming language and platform for decentralized applications, an \u201candroid of the cryptocurrency world\u201d of sorts.\n\nSubsequently, Ethereum was officially announced on Bitcointalk on January 23rd, 2014. It has been exactly nine years since then. The blockchain\u2019s story, from the whitepaper to the DAO attack, to the hard fork, scalability issues, and more recent Merge, has been anything but ordinary.\n\n\u201cWelcome to the New Beginning\u201d\n\nButerin revealed that the primary core devs along with him were Gavin Wood, Charles Hoskinson, and Jeffrey Wilcke, while Anthony Di Iorio, Mihai Alisie, Joseph Lubin, and Stephan Tual were named as primary non-development members. Buterin\u2019s commentary, titled \u201cWelcome to the New Beginning, noted,\n\n\u201cEthereum is a modular, stateful, Turing-complete contract scripting system married to a blockchain and developed with a philosophy of simplicity, universal accessibility, and generalization. Our goal is to provide a platform for decentralized applications \u2013 an android of the cryptocurrency world, where all efforts can share a common set of APIs, trustless interactions, and no compromises.\u201d\n\nWhile explaining his brainchild, Buterin then called for the community to join the new ecosystem as volunteers, developers, investors, and evangelists. The focus was to enable a \u201cfundamentally different paradigm for the internet and the relationships it provides.\u201d\n\nChallenging the Idea of \u2018Bitcoin Dominance Maximalism\u2019\n\nThe same year, Buterin challenged the Bitcoin Dominance Maximalism, a school of thought that is still very much relevant in the crypto ecosystem. His treatise essentially separated people who simply want to improve Bitcoin from those who can be called \u201cBitcoin domination maximalists,\u201d often categorized as aggressive, hostile, and toxic.\n\nThis was the first time he questioned the ideology. Since then, Ethereum itself has become the most consistent and high-profile target of criticism by the proud \u201cBitcoin Maximalist.\u201d Despite the differences in culture and workings, Ethereum has still managed to retain its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, almost a decade after its existence, even as most prominent altcoins faded away."

        "content": "The price of Ethereum (ETH) has been making new highs despite the fact that bulls are taking a moment to recover their breath following an incredible run. This gradual movement appears to be laying the stage for a slight pullback, but depending on the price of Bitcoin (BTC) and how it behaves, things might very well alter dramatically.\n\nEther Shows Confidence\n\nAccording to the most recent data obtained, the total value of all cryptocurrencies has increased by 0.31%, reaching $1.05 trillion. And, at the time of writing, the overall trading activity has also witnessed an increase of 6.96% to $53.53 billion. The price of Ethereum, on the other hand, recently breached the macro downward trendline. The consensus among market watchers is that a significant amount of buying confidence might be generated for a new uptrend in Ethereum (ETH) prices if the altcoin king is successful in overcoming the lower high of $1,700.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHowever, in the world of cryptocurrencies, fundamental analysis also plays a vital role apart from the technical aspects. With the total ETH staked on the Beacon Chain reaching over 16 million ahead of the Shanghai upgrade; which is almost 13.4% of the total circulating supply, Ethereum price may set off another run-up. A move along these lines will not change the bearish divergence, but it will enable market makers to collect the buy-stop liquidity that is currently lying above $1,679 and catch the early bears in their trap. And while this chase for liquidity is going on, the price of Ethereum might reach as high as $2,000.\n\nRead More: Check Out The Top 10 DeFi Lending Platforms Of 2023\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Surge\n\nAdditionally, as pointed out by macro and Bitcoin expert tedtalksmacro, the USD stablecoin has significantly increased in the past 24 hours. Recording almost a $320 million growth in supply, it acts as a potential indicator of higher buying demand by retailers and whales in the crypto market.\n\nUSD stablecoin uptick in the past ~24hrs Approximately $320M increase in supply, steady lads. pic.twitter.com/YVbMLIi2vy \u2014 tedtalksmacro (@tedtalksmacro) January 23, 2023\n\nOn the other hand, the price threshold of $2,000 isn\u2019t the only thing holding Ethereum back from continuing its ascent. A bullish perspective for the short term, even if it is running on fumes, is warranted if the price of Ethereum does decide to go higher. If Bitcoin bulls can make a strong return, this perspective will shift significantly. In such a scenario, there is a chance that ETH will keep climbing higher and possibly breach the coveted $3,000 mark. As things stand, the price of Ethereum (ETH) is currently being traded at $1,634. This represents a decrease of 0.44% in the past 24 hours, in contrast to its 5.24% jump during the last seven days, as per CoinGape\u2019s crypto market tracker.\n\nAlso Read: DOGE Fan Elon Musk Announces New Feature For Twitter"

        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has shared a possible solution to what he describes as the \u201clargest remaining challenge\u201d for Ethereum \u2014 privacy.\n\nIn a blog post on Jan. 20, Buterin acknowledged the need to come up with a privacy solution because by default, all information that goes onto a \u201cpublic blockchain\u201d is public too.\n\nHe then arrived at the concept of \u201cstealth addresses\u201d \u2014 which he said can potentially anonymize peer-to-peer transactions, nonfungible token (NFT) transfers, and Ethereum Name Service (ENS) registrations, protecting users.\n\nAn incomplete guide to stealth addresses:https://t.co/21Q18BrD30 \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 20, 2023\n\nIn the blog post, Buterin explained how on-chain transactions can be carried out between two parties with anonymity.\n\nFirstly, a user looking to receive assets will generate and keep a \u201cspending key\u201d that is then used to generate a stealth meta-address.\n\nThis address \u2014 which can be registered on ENS \u2014 is then passed onto the sender who can perform a cryptographic computation on the meta-address to generate a stealth address, which belongs to the receiver.\n\nThe sender can then transfer assets to the receiver\u2019s stealth address in addition to publishing a temporary key to confirm that the stealth address belongs to the receiver.\n\nThe effect of this is that a new stealth address is generated for each new transaction.\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s stick figure diagram of how a stealth address system may work. Source: Vitalik\u2019s website\n\nButerin noted that a \u201cDiffie-Hellman key exchange\u201d in addition to a \u201ckey blinding mechanism\u201d would need to be implemented to ensure that the link between the stealth address and the user\u2019s meta-address can' be seen publicly.\n\nThe Ethereum co-founder added that ZK-SNARKs \u2014 a cryptographic-proof technology with built-in privacy features \u2014 could transfer funds to pay transaction fees.\n\nHowever Buterin emphasized that this may lead to problems of its own \u2014 at least for the short term \u2014 stating \u201cthis costs a lot of gas, an extra hundreds of thousands of gas just for a single transfer.\u201d\n\nRelated: Crypto privacy is in greater jeopardy than ever before \u2014 here's why\n\nStealth addresses have long been touted as a solution to address on-chain privacy issues, which have been worked on since as early as 2014. However very few solutions have been brought to market thus far.\n\nIt also isn\u2019t the first time Buterin has discussed the concept of stealth addresses in Ethereum.\n\nIn August, he dubbed stealth addresses as a \u201clow-tech approach\u201d for anonymously transferring ownership of ERC-721 tokens \u2014 otherwise known as NFTs.\n\nThe Ethereum co-founder explained that the stealth address concept proposed offers privacy differently to that of the now U.S. Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC)-sanctioned Tornado Cash:\n\n\u201dTornado Cash can hide transfers of mainstream fungible assets such as ETH or major ERC20s [...] but it\u2019s very weak at adding privacy to transfers of obscure ERC20s, and it cannot add privacy to NFT transfers at all.\u201d\n\nButerin offered some advice to Web3 projects that are developing a solution:\n\n\u201cBasic stealth addresses can be implemented fairly quickly today, and could be a significant boost to practical user privacy on Ethereum.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey do require some work on the wallet side to support them. That said, it is my view that wallets should start moving toward a more natively multi-address model [...] for other privacy-related reasons as well,\" he added.\n\nButerin suggested that stealth addresses may introduce \u201clonger-term usability concerns,\u201d such as social recovery issues. However, he is confident the problems can be properly addressed in time:\n\n\u201cIn the longer term, these problems can be solved, but the stealth address ecosystem of the long term is looking like one that would really heavily depend on zero-knowledge proofs,\u201d he explained."

        "content": "Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin has put forward a general approach to stealth addresses, as seen on his personal blog on Jan. 20.\n\nStealth addresses, as described by Buterin, circumvent the fact that public blockchains like Ethereum reveal a significant amount of transaction data.\n\nStealth addresses essentially conceal the recipient of certain transactions. Stealth addresses also reproduce the benefits of a standard privacy practice that some crypto users adhere to: creating a new address for every transaction received from a new sender.\n\nButerin noted that, despite their privacy benefits, stealth addresses do not provide any way to pay transaction fees. To resolve this, he suggested two approaches. The first approach involves ZK-SNARKS and would be expensive; the second approach involves specialized transaction aggregators and seems to be his preferred solution.\n\nButerin further noted that stealth addresses make it more difficult to create social recovery wallets \u2014 that is, wallets that can be recovered by third parties if the main holder loses their private key. Though Buterin proposed certain solutions, he said that developers could \u201cbite the bullet\u201d and recognize that recovering a wallet is costly and expensive.\n\nButerin also distinguished stealth addresses from Tornado Cash. He said that although Tornado Cash can obscure transactions involving ETH and major ERC-20 tokens, it is not useful in obscuring transactions involving NFTs and minor ERC-20 tokens. He added that Tornado Cash is most practical for self-directed coin mixing.\n\nButerin has discussed stealth addresses in the past. In March 2020, he suggested a stealth address scheme compatible with the Ethereum Name Service (ENS). In August 2022, he suggested a stealth address scheme compatible with ERC-721 NFTs.\n\nButerin did not say when or if Ethereum will add stealth addresses. However, he said that stealth addresses \u201ccan be implemented fairly quickly today\u201d and would provide significant privacy benefits to users. He added that wallets should introduce native privacy features, such as automatic address generation, in the absence of stealth addresses.\n\nAt least one existing Ethereum Improvement Proposal, EIP-5564, puts forward a standardized way to create stealth addresses on Ethereum. However, the status of that proposal suggests that it is likely to change in the future.\n\nVarious blockchains, including Zcash and Monero, already use stealth addresses. Lesser-known projects such as Verge also include the feature.\n\nMentioned in this article"

Cosmos, on the other hand, recorded 117 average daily developers.\n\nMeanwhile, Solana and Internet Computer (ICP) saw the most significant increase in active devs in 2022. Since the previous year, the two blockchain networks surged by 1,320% and 1,050%, respectively.\n\nThe report also stated that Solana looks promising despite being the most impacted in the FTX-induced drawdown.\n\nThe average number of daily active developers on the blockchain noted a decline of 31.4% over the past 30 days and continued to attract an average of 69 daily active developers."

        "content": "BR\u00d8K, the Norwegian government project to track unlisted stock ownership, moved into the sandbox phase earlier this month. What\u2019s a little different compared to other solutions is it plans to use a public blockchain. Specifically, it is using Arbitrum, a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum with lower transaction costs.\n\nMany countries around the world have corporate registries where you can look up information on companies of any size, including unlisted ones. These often have some stockholder data, but it\u2019s usually up to a year old. For up-to-date details, one needs to contact the company. Norway\u2019s corporate registry, which keeps records on 380,000 companies, is no different.\n\nHence the concept of creating a blockchain system to track the change of ownership of any private stock and get a current view of the \u2018cap table\u2019 \u2013 who owns stock, how much they own and when they bought it.\n\nAnother benefit of using a blockchain is immutability. Because companies only share snapshots of stock ownership irregularly, there\u2019s scope to manipulate the cap table, although it\u2019s not a particularly common fraud. In fact, the most likely victim is the government if there are share transfer taxes and there\u2019s a desire to shift the timing. Unsurprisingly the tax agency is a participant in the ecosystem.\n\nThere are benefits to the company as well. The most obvious one is they only have to log stock transactions rather than manage the cap table. It makes it easier to sell stock with less due diligence on the cap table itself. That\u2019s because the buyer and seller have to agree to blockchain transactions, providing some level of third party validity. Additionally, stock can be used as security for a loan, and the charge over the stock will also be logged on the blockchain.\n\nThe solution provides a good foundation for the coming wave of tokenization as stocks are stored using the ERC1400 Ethereum security token standard.\n\nThe project has been in the works for some time with the developer Blockchangers posting code for a solution three years ago, which has moved on since then. Now it is making the software development kit (SDK) available.\n\nBR\u00d8K combines blockchain, an open database and custom software. The solution is GDPR compliant, so personal information is not stored directly on the blockchain. However, it uses the Ceramic protocol for the personal information, an open distributed database that allows for data to be deleted and corrected, as required by GDPR.\n\nThis might be one of the first times a government is using blockchain for cap tables, but it\u2019s far from being the first cap table solution. One of the first for private securities was Swiss firm daura, a joint venture between BDO, BEKB, SIX, Swisscom and Sygnum. Another Swiss example is Aequitec. In the U.S., Figure Technologies has developed a cap table solution using its Provenance public blockchain."

This may suggest that the observed surge in ETH whale transactions pertaining to the CRV token may reflect buying pressure.\n\nAre whales shielding CRV from the bears?\n\nCRV\u2019s price action has continued to extend its upside despite being deeply overbought. It managed a 7.40% upside in the last 24 hours at press time, reflecting strong demand. This allowed it to extend its rally above the 200-day moving average.\n\nCRV traded at a 120% premium from its lowest price level at the end of December 2022. This makes it one of the top gainers among the major cryptocurrencies. However, CRV\u2019s deeply overbought nature may encourage some selling pressure.\n\nBoth the MVRV ratio and the mean coin age are currently in the upper monthly range. This means CRV holders are deep in profit.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the CRV Profit Calculator\n\nThis outcome is contrary to the expectations of a pullback. A potential reason for this is that investors, especially whales, are more focused on long-term gains.\n\nIf the recent rally is the start of the next bull run, then the upside seen so far might just be the start of more recovery ahead. This might explain why whales are currently not in a rush to secure short-term profits.\n\nNote that all this is speculative based on what we have seen so far. There are still some risks that may trigger a retracement and perhaps an erosion of the latest gains. Nevertheless, whales continue to demonstrate confidence in the market, and this may continue to favor the upside."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum wallets that were active back in the ICO era on Ethereum suddenly started moving large sums to related wallets. On-chain specialists assume that funds are moving to staking contracts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInitially, funds on the ICO wallet started moving back in October. The wallet that has been dormant for six years moved almost 50,000 ETH to staking, worth approximately $80 million.\n\nWe noticed that an ETH ICO participant who has been dormant for 6 years started to stake 48,992 $ETH ($80M) in October this year.\n\n\n\nThe ICO participant received 120K $ETH at Genesis via 3 addresses.\n\n\n\nAnd transferred 32,015 $ETH($53M) to a new address 5 hrs ago. (stake again? ) pic.twitter.com/huO4PVBpUB \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) January 22, 2023\n\nLater on, the wallet received 120,000 ETH at Genesis with three addresses, making it one of the biggest entities on the whole network that are not related to cryptocurrency exchange. However, shortly after, the whale decided to move $53 million worth of funds received from Genesis to a new address \u2014 5 hours ago.\n\nWhy do dormant addresses matter?\n\nWhile it may seem like the movement of funds on whales' addresses is not important, the general tendencies we can highlight from their actions is what really matters. A large number of noteworthy Ethereum addresses has been actively moving funds to staking addresses, which is a signal in and of itself.\n\nEthereum's staking contract temporarily locks the funds of investors until the staking period is over, practically removing a significant amount of ETH out of market circulation. In addition to burning operations, a large percentage of the staked Ethereum supply may act as a bullish factor for Ethereum, considering the fact that some percentage of the supply does not hit the market.\n\nAs whales like one we discovered move funds to staking, we should expect far less selling pressure on the market in the foreseeable future. Unfortunately, Ethereum staking is a double-edged sword: when funds get unlocked, investors should brace themselves for a rapid spike in ETH sales and abnormally high volatility."

        "content": "The FBI announced Monday it has concluded that North Korean hacker organization Lazarus Group was behind the $100 million hack of Harmony Protocol last June.\n\nOver $60 million of ETH stolen during the heist was laundered on January 13, six months after the fact. That allowed the law enforcement agency to confidently identify the Lazarus Group and APT38\u2014another North Korean cyber group\u2014as the architects of the crime.\n\nThe hackers used RAILGUN, a privacy protocol, in an attempt to obscure their transactions. Even so, a portion of the funds were then frozen and recovered by exchanges when the hackers attempted to swap them for Bitcoin. Unrecovered funds were subsequently sent to 11 Ethereum addresses.\n\nThe FBI and its investigative partners will \"continue to identify and disrupt North Korea\u2019s theft and laundering of virtual currency, which is used to support North Korea\u2019s ballistic missile and Weapons of Mass Destruction programs,\" according to the announcement.\n\nUS Treasury Connects North Korean Hackers to $622M Axie Infinity Exploit\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of June\u2019s Harmony hack, blockchain analysts tied the exploit to Lazarus Group using a combination of on-chain sleuthing and comparisons to previous hacks committed by the group. While the American government has been previously vocal about the threat posed by Lazarus Group, however, it did not formally accuse the entity of responsibility for the Harmony hack until today.\n\nThe hack targeted a cross-chain bridge connecting Harmony, a layer-1 blockchain, to Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Binance Chain. The strategy echoes previous attacks linked to Lazarus Group, including a massive $622 million hack last April of Ronin Network, an Ethereum sidechain used by play-to-earn crypto game Axie Infinity.\n\nSince 2017, North Korean hacker groups including Lazarus Group and APT38 have stolen an estimated $1.2 billion worth of cryptocurrency, according to an Associated Press report.\n\n\"The FBI will continue to expose and combat the DPRK\u2019s use of illicit activities\u2014including cybercrime and virtual currency theft\u2014to generate revenue for the regime,\" the announcement read.\n\nStory continues\n\nBiggest Crypto Exploits and Hacks of 2022\n\nNorth Korea-affiliated cyber groups have also reportedly expanded their activities beyond hacks. In late December, a report argued that the Lazarus Group is also pretending to be venture capitalists, potential employers, and banks.\n\n\"Intrusions begin with a large number of spearphishing messages sent to employees of cryptocurrency companies\u2014often working in system administration or software development/IT operations (DevOps)\u2014on a variety of communication platforms,\" according to a federal cybersecurity alert issued last April. \"The messages often mimic a recruitment effort and offer high-paying jobs to entice the recipients to download malware-laced cryptocurrency applications.\"\n\nIn response to these crypto-focused attacks, the American government has targeted coin-mixing services: tools that allow users to obfuscate the otherwise public trails of cryptocurrency transactions. In August, the Treasury Department banned Ethereum coin mixer Tornado Cash and numerous wallet addresses associated with the service, citing its use by Lazarus Group to launder funds from previous hacks as justification for the action.\n\nThe move was widely decried in the crypto community as an illegal overreach that unnecessarily threatened user privacy. An ongoing lawsuit helmed by crypto policy nonprofit Coin Center is challenging the ban."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe jokes wrote themselves.\n\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. Department of Justice declared ominously that it would hold a live press conference at noon to announce an \"International Cryptocurrency Enforcement Action.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCrypto Twitter panicked, and so did crypto prices. Bitcoin and Ethereum each fell nearly 5% in just a few minutes, amounting to a flash crash. Which big player was caught in the DOJ's crosshairs? Binance was a popular bet, and CZ didn't help matters by tweeting just \"4,\" which he announced on January 2 is his new signal for incoming \"FUD, fake news, attacks, etc.\"\n\nThen the press conference happened. It wasn't Binance. It wasn't Celsius, or Voyager, or Blockfi, or any other bankrupt crypto lender that screwed over its customers. It was a Hong Kong-based, Russian-owned crypto exchange called Bitzlato.\n\nBitz-what? Bitzlatte? I've been writing about crypto since 2011, and never heard of it.\n\nBitzlato has like 1,400 followers and hasn't tweeted in almost a year pic.twitter.com/VMNqVMSo5x \u2014 Jacquelyn Melinek (@jacqmelinek) January 18, 2023\n\nBitzlato, the DOJ said, processed more than $700 million in illicit funds, including millions in proceeds from ransomware.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOkay. But as of January 18, Bitzlato customer wallets had... $11,000 in them, according to a Coinbase operations director. At Bitzlato's peak, customer wallets held $6 million\u2014a trifle. And yet DOJ Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco touted the enforcement action as \"a significant blow to the cryptocrime ecosystem.\" She said Bitzlato, \"fueled a high-tech axis of cryptocrime.\"\n\nThe crypto market quickly rebounded.\n\nI could embed a bunch more of the best memes on this, but let's move on to the Why, and the What This Means.\n\nThe DOJ is attempting to flex.\n\nPeople in crypto laughed at it, but those outside crypto probably didn't. The U.S. government wants to make crystal clear\u2014especially after the massively scrutinized collapse of FTX\u2014that it is aware of CRYPTO CRIME (!) and is taking decisive action.\n\nThe DOJ has reportedly been investigating Binance since 2018, and according to Reuters is split over whether to bring charges. It's been rumored that the DOJ is also investigating Digital Currency Group, owner of crypto lender Genesis, which filed for bankruptcy this week.\n\nAnd the DOJ isn't alone: the SEC charged both Genesis and Gemini at once last week for violating securities laws.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, in an interview on our gm podcast last month, was reluctant to say outright that the FTX meltdown will lead directly to more crypto regulation. But it's clear that at the very least it has already led to more posturing. And Peirce did say she hopes it won't lead her peers to overreact with hasty restrictions.\n\n\u201cI think we should all be on the lookout for regulatory frameworks that are developed in the context of enforcement action, because it\u2019s a very tempting thing for regulators to do that,\u201d Peirce said. \u201cAnd it just cuts everybody else out of the process.\u201d\n\nI frequently say that people in crypto have an irrational fear of the very word \"regulation.\" They presume regulating crypto means shutting it down entirely, when regulation could simply mean\u2014in an ideal scenario for all\u2014creating new safeguards for retail investors.\n\nThat said, what Sam Bankman-Fried hath wrought is a new climate in which regulators and politicians are feeling more pressured than ever before to show they're serious about ridding crypto of the bad actors. And that could lead to overreach. We already saw it last year with Tornado Cash.\n\nThe next big hyped enforcement action may not be against some small-time player."

        "content": "Privacy tools have always been heralded as a key to financial freedom in the crypto industry. In the Ethereum ecosystem, discussions surrounding the subject matter have revolved mostly around privacy-preserving transfers of ETH and mainstream ERC20 tokens.\n\nIn a bid to improve the state of privacy on the network, its co-founder Vitalik Buterin has proposed a stealth address system.\n\n\u201cLast Remaining Challenge for Ethereum\u201d\n\nThe concept of Stealth addresses using elliptic curve cryptography was first introduced in the context of Bitcoin by BTC core developer Peter Todd in 2014 to obscure transaction details. In the latest blog post, Buterin acknowledged that privacy is \u201cone of the largest remaining challenges in the Ethereum ecosystem\u201d while highlighting the need for a privacy solution because \u201canything that goes onto a public blockchain is public.\u201d\n\nStealth addresses, on the other hand, can help in this regard. Buterin noted that such a mechanism in place will enable the Ethereum wallet to generate stealth addresses to receive funds privately and access them using a special code called a \u201cspending key.\u201d\n\nThe proposed stealth addresses can be generated by either party, but they can only be controlled by one of them. The user receiving the assets generates the stealth address and keeps secret a spending key, which will then be used to generate a stealth meta-address that can be passed on to the sender.\n\nThis allows the sender to perform a computation on this meta-address to initiate a stealth address belonging to the receiver. The sender can then send any assets they want to send to this address, while the receiver will have full control. Along with the transfer, the sender publishes some extra cryptographic data on-chain confirming that the stealth address belongs to the receiver.\n\nButerin asserted that stealth addresses give the same privacy properties as a user generating a fresh address for each transaction.\n\nStealth Address Vs. Tornado Cash\n\nSeveral methods have been employed in recent years to obfuscate transactional details. This includes Tornado Cash which was recently sanctioned by the OFAC. Buterin, for one, said the proposed concept of stealth address provides a different kind of privacy to that of the popular Ethereum-based coin mixer. He explained,\n\n\u201cTornado Cash can hide transfers of mainstream fungible assets such as ETH or major ERC20s (though it\u2019s most easily useful for privately sending to yourself), but it\u2019s very weak at adding privacy to transfers of obscure ERC20s, and it cannot add privacy to NFT transfers at all.\u201d"

        "content": "The Ethereum blockchain, which is touted as the most commercialised distributed ledger network in the world, is up for more updates that will calibrate it for better uses in the future. Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, has stated that \u2018privacy' is the \u2018last remaining challenge' for the blockchain, which will be finetuned in the coming days. Buterin has named \u2018stealth addresses' as a potential solution that could safeguard all the information that is saved on the public blockchain.\n\nEthereum is a public blockchain that processes transactions of billions of dollars. Anybody can view transaction histories of the Ethereum blockchain on Etherscan, which is a block explorer and analytics platform.\n\n\u201cBy default, anything that goes onto a public blockchain is public. Using the entire suite of Ethereum applications involves making a significant portion of your life public for anyone to see and analyse,\u201d Buterin wrote in a blog post while highlighting that \u2018stealth addresses' could increase the privacy quotient on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nWhat Are Stealth Addresses\n\nThese addresses, which are registered on Ethereum Name Services (ENS), can add anonymity to the peer-to-peer transactions of digital assets.\n\nUsing stealth addresses would maintain transactional records on Ethereum while also keeping the privacy between the transacting parties intact on the public blockchain.\n\n\u201cSuppose that Alice wants to send Bob an asset. When Bob receives the asset, he does not want the entire world to know that it was he who got it. Hiding the fact that a transfer happened is impossible. A stealth address is an address that can be generated by either Alice or Bob, but which can only be controlled by Bob. Alice can then send any assets she wants to send to this address, and Bob will have full control over them,\u201d Buterin explained in a blog post.\n\nAn incomplete guide to stealth addresses:https://t.co/21Q18BrD30 \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 20, 2023\n\nAs for now, it remains unclear when Ethereum developers would open the stealth address feature on a mass level for the blockchain. Buterin has, however warned that executing stealth addresses could spike up the gas fees for each transfer.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain successfully completed the transition from its energy-intensive PoW mining model to the energy-efficient PoS model last year. The name of the revamped and green Ethereum is the \u2018Merge'.\n\nIn March 2023, Ethereum will be implementing the Shanghai update to its network, which would allow people who staked Ether tokens to validate the blockchain withdraw their tokens. It is estimated that $22.38 billion (roughly Rs. 1,82,520 crore) worth of Ether tokens are currently staked on the blockchain.\n\nAffiliate links may be automatically generated - see our ethics statement for details."

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin Reveals Ethereum\u2019s Largest Remaining Challenge\n\nVitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, has shared a possible solution to what he calls the \u201clargest remaining challenge\u201d for Ethereum \u2014 privacy.\n\nButerin acknowledged the need for a privacy solution in a blog post on January 20 because all information that goes onto a \u201cpublic blockchain\u201d is public by default.\n\nHe then came up with the idea of \u201cstealth addresses,\u201d which he claims to have the potential to anonymize peer-to-peer transactions, nonfungible token (NFT) transfers, and Ethereum Name Service (ENS) registrations, thereby protecting users.\n\nButerin explained in his blog post how two parties can conduct anonymous on-chain transactions.\n\nTo begin, a user seeking assets will generate and keep a \u201cspending key,\u201d which will then be used to generate a stealth meta-address.\n\nThis address is then passed on to the sender, who can perform a cryptographic computation on the meta-address to generate a stealth address that belongs to the receiver.\n\nThe sender can then transfer assets to the receiver\u2019s stealth address while also publishing a temporary key to confirm that the receiver owns the stealth address.\n\nAs a result, for each new transaction, a new stealth address is generated.\n\nButerin stated that a \u201cDiffie-Hellman key exchange\u201d as well as a \u201ckey blinding mechanism\u201d would be required to ensure that the link between the stealth address and the user\u2019s meta-address is not visible to the public.\n\nThe Ethereum co-founder also mentioned that ZK-SNARKs, a cryptographic-proof technology with built-in privacy features, could be used to pay transaction fees.\n\nButerin cautioned that this could cause problems of its own, at least in the short term, stating that \u201cthis costs a lot of gas, an extra hundreds of thousands of gas just for a single transfer.\u201d\n\nStealth addresses have been addressed since 2014 as a solution to on-chain privacy issues. However, very few solutions have reached the market thus far.\n\nHe described stealth addresses as a \u201clow-tech approach\u201d for anonymously transferring ownership of ERC-721 tokens, also known as NFTs, in August.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"
