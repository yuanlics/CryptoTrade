        "title": "We Asked ChatGPT If Ethereum\u2019s Price Can Flip Bitcoin in the Next 5 Years, Here\u2019s the Answer - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "A topic as old as time, if time was a few years old \u2013 will Ethereum flip Bitcoin in terms of total market cap? Will ETH overtake BTC?\n\nThis has been the \u201cto be or not to be\u201d in the cryptocurrency industry, and it pins communities against each other like no other. It\u2019s true that BTC has been the predominant market leader ever since it has been created, but a few years ago, who would have thought that another cryptocurrency would have a market cap worth over 40% of Bitcoin\u2019s? Well, that\u2019s the case for Ethereum today.\n\nSo, we decided to do what any sane person in 2023 would do \u2013 ask an AI language model what it (?) thinks. ChatGPT is all the rage in 2023, so who better to ask?\n\nCan Ethereum Flip Bitcoin?\n\nFirst things first, we prompted ChatGPT with this exact question: \u201cDo you think Ethereum\u2019s price can flip Bitcoin\u2019s price in the next 5 years?\u201d\n\nThe AI came back to us, explaining that this is an outcome that\u2019s \u201cuncertain and depends on various factors.\u201d\n\nThese include:\n\nAdoption Rates\n\nAccording to ChatGPT, Ethereum\u2019s robust ecosystem and use cases, such as DeFi, NFTs, and whatnot, could help it flip Bitcoin.\n\nEthereum\u2019s broader use cases, such as DeFi (Decentralized Finance), NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), and smart contracts, could potentially drive wider adoption and thus increase its value relative to Bitcoin.\n\nHere\u2019s where it got kind of interesting. You see, ChatGPT\u2019s most recent knowledge cut-off on this topic was in September 2021. This means that it was before Ethereum transitioned to Proof-of-Stake.\n\nThat said, the second factor, according to the AI, is:\n\nNetwork Upgrades\n\nChatGPT argues that \u201cthe successful completion of Ethereum\u2019s planned upgrades, such as Ethereum 2.0, could significantly affect its price. This upgrade plans to improve the scalability, security, and sustainability of Ethereum, which could increase its attractiveness to investors and users.\u201d\n\nWell, Ethereum\u2019s transition to proof-of-stake, otherwise known as \u201cThe Merge,\u201d is already a fact in our timeline, and so far, it hasn\u2019t really helped it get there.\n\nWhat Else Could Help ETH Flip BTC?\n\nThe flippening can also take place under a few more conditions, according to ChatGPT. Regulation, for once, is among the factors.\n\nChanges in cryptocurrency regulation could impact prices. More restrictive regulations could lower prices, while more accommodating ones could raise them.\n\nWhile it does sound like an answer from Captain Obvious, it is true. Favorable regulation could push ETH\u2019s price, but so far, the US government has taken a predatory approach, calling many of the projects built on Ethereum securities.\n\nGoing forward, the AI believes that market sentiment is also important. If enough investors believe Ethereum to be the better form of investment, it would inevitably lead to the flippening.\n\nLast but not least, the broader economic factors, including inflation, economic growth, and overall changes in the financial sector, could also have an impact.\n\nIn conclusion, ChatGPT took a more cautious position and didn\u2019t provide a straightforward yes or no answer. This was somewhat expected, but it what arguments would an AI use to structure a response to a question of this kind.\n\nOf course, none of the above should be construed as financial advice. The content is solely for educational and entertaining purposes, and we do hope you had fun with it."

        "title": "Ethereum Devs Issue Final Report on Finality SNAFU - Blockworks",
        "content": "One week ago, the Ethereum network encountered a finality glitch that caused significant angst within the project\u2019s developer community.\n\nThe problem stemmed from two consensus clients, including one of the leading clients, Prysm, spending too much computing resources on processing \u201cmostly worthless\u201d block attestations \u2014 a part of the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.\n\nIn a report issued by the team behind Prysm, the failure to finalize \u2014 while largely unnoticed by users \u2014 was worse the second time around on Friday. In one epoch, client participation fell to 30.7%, which the Prysm team says was \u201cthe lowest participation of any epoch in [Ethereum] Mainnet ever.\u201d\n\nThe Prysm client is run on 37.6% of Ethereum validating nodes, according to clientdiversity.org. It is developed by Prysmatic Labs, which was acquired by Offchain Labs \u2014 the developers of Arbitrum \u2014 in October 2022.\n\nAn Ethereum epoch is roughly 6.4 minutes and comprises 32 \u201cslots\u201d \u2014 read blocks in the blockchain \u2014 of 12 seconds each. The network failed to finalize on Friday for nine epochs (nearly an hour). This was long enough to trigger the first-ever \u201cinactivity leak\u201d mode, which penalizes validators that have stopped contributing to consensus.\n\nBut the damage was inconsequential: about $0.27 per validator.\n\n\u201cIn total, we estimate that 28 ETH of penalties were applied and validators missed 55 ETH or more of potential revenue,\u201d the Prysm team said. \u201cThis is less than 0.00015 ETH per validator.\u201d\n\nWhat went wrong\n\nPrysm\u2019s client began to struggle to handle incoming attestations with target checkpoints two epochs behind the then-current one. These valid attestations required clients to recalculate previous states of Ethereum\u2019s Beacon chain and caused Prysm clients to exhaust their resources, resulting in a failure to meet validator clients\u2019 requests promptly.\n\nIronically, contributing to the client\u2019s woes was the huge success of Ethereum staking post-Shapella, when withdrawals of staked ether became possible for the first time.\n\nA sharp increase in new validators requesting to join the Beacon chain since the start of May has pushed ETH staked net of withdrawals up by about 1.3 million, to a total 20.5 million \u2014 a value in dollar terms of more than $37 billion, on-chain data shows.\n\nThat has lengthened the queue to join the network by nearly 60,000 validators, meaning a new validator requesting to join today will not be active until some time in late June.\n\nBeacon chain clients were stressed by all these incoming ether staking deposits, the Offchain Labs report explained.\n\n\u201cWhen the beacon state was smaller, Prysm would be able to handle these attestations and recover appropriately. However, with the large spike in deposits and the growing validator registry size, Prysm was unable to recover this time,\u201d the team said.\n\nBug squashed\n\nThe Prysm client now ignores attestations for old blocks, which the report says are generally of no value to the network. Minority client Teku implemented a similar fix last weekend.\n\nThe current majority consensus client, Lighthouse, already was programmed to drop the problematic attestations and suffered no loss of liveness. The mere existence of client diversity has been largely credited with allowing the network to recover on its own without any manual intervention.\n\nAside from the technical stress on the software and hardware, the incident also took a toll on some members of the Ethereum community.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nEthereum\u2019s \u201ccommunity health consultant,\u201d known as Superphiz, for one, declared he was taking some time off from Twitter, to \u201cregain some physical fitness routines and mental clarity.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "VanEck\u2019s bullish scenario for Ether predicts a 27-fold price surge by 2030.\n\nThe asset manager says it expects Ethereum to remain the dominant blockchain settlement network.\n\nEther, the transactional cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, could be worth $300 by the year 2030. Or it could soar as high as $51,000.\n\nThis is according to a prediction by investment management firm VanEck \u2014 the company sees $11,800 as a \u201cbase case\u201d Ether price in a report released this month.\n\nBased on VanEck\u2019s predictions, Ether could be up 27-fold or be down 83% from its current $1,800 price in the next seven years.\n\nVanEck's prediction sees Ether trading between $300 and $51,000 by 2030 (Source: VanEck Research)\n\nFor the more bullish prediction: \u201cWe base these estimates on the thesis that Ethereum becomes the dominant open-source global settlement network, that hosts substantial portions of the commercial activity of business sectors with the highest potential to gain from moving their business functions to public blockchains.\u201d\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nVanEck doesn\u2019t outline its bear case, where the price could plunge to as low as $343. But in a volatile asset class, where blowups have littered the crypto industry over the past year, it\u2019s wise to hedge one\u2019s bets.\n\nVanEck\u2019s bull case for Ethereum\n\nVanEck sees Ethereum prevailing over other alternative layer 1 blockchain networks, even as more competitors with venture capital backing continue to enter the fray. VanEck noted that the firm has positions in Ether.\n\nEthereum\u2019s dominance of the smart contract blockchain space could have significant financial benefits for the project, according to VanEck\u2019s report. The investment manager predicts that Ethereum\u2019s annual revenue will hit $51 billion by 2030, a 20-fold increase from its current level.\n\n\u2018People are relying more and more on the Ethereum chain\u2019\n\nVanEck pinned this prediction to its expectation that Ether will become more than a transactional currency.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\n\u201cETH, while not a complete store of value like Bitcoin due to Ethereum\u2019s demonstrated mutability of code and an evolving social consensus focused on utility, will nevertheless become a store-of-value asset for state actors looking to maximise human capital (versus Bitcoin, which maximises for stranded energy),\u201d the report said.\n\nNOW READ: Why Ethereum is so dominant \u2014 and why it\u2019s not going anywhere\n\nEthereum\u2019s adoption is also expected to continue to grow, especially with the level of developer activity on the network, said Danny Chong, co-founder of yield management protocol Tranchess.\n\n\u201cPeople are relying more and more on the Ethereum chain, and confidence in it has continuously increased,\u201d Chong told DL News. \u201cI expect more institutions to become involved in staking. At the same time, the ecosystem has already grown exponentially, with many new types of protocols coming in to bolster the demand.\u201d\n\nThe dominant layer 1\n\nSeveral \u201cEthereum killers\u201d have been launched by different project teams. These networks often claimed to be superior to Ethereum by offering faster transaction speeds at cheaper costs.\n\nBut these cheaper-to-use alternative layer 1 chains have been unable to knock Ethereum off its perch. Ethereum continues to dominate all other layer 1 networks in terms of economic activity.\n\nIt currently controls a larger share of the decentralised finance market, accounting for more than half of the total value locked into DeFi protocols, DefiLlama data shows.\n\nSome of Ethereum\u2019s competitors have been affected by scandals. The Terra ecosystem collapsed in May 2022 and FTX, a major backer of the Solana blockchain, collapsed in November. The likes of Fantom, Harmony, and Waves have also not fared any better."

        "title": "Parity Technologies Suggests Hard Fork to Release Locked Ether - CCN.com",
        "content": "Parity Technologies, having suffered a multi-signature wallet bug that froze hundreds of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of Ether, noted ongoing issues with Ethereum in a recent blog suggesting a course of action to rescue the funds.\n\nFrom its very beginning, users of Ethereum have had to deal with a command line interface with little tolerance for errors, sending thousands of Ether to 0x0, the blog noted. Any transaction with an improperly formed \u201cto\u201d address was read as a delivery to 0x0.\n\nA few months later, a bug was found in a JavaScript utilities library that the Ethereum Foundation wrote and was used by numerous parties to generate wallets. This mishap affected one in 128 accounts produced by some teams and rendered useless. Thousands of additional Ethers got stuck.\n\nThe DAO hack and the subsequent fork delivered problems with transactions that replayed across both Ethereum and the Ethereum Classic network. These issues were not widely recognized to anticipate that Ethereum Classic would more than survive \u2013 it would thrive, but leading to several issues. Such as Ether deposits to contracts that were never deployed to the Ethereum network to begin with.\n\nEther Frozen\n\nAn incident recently occurred with the Parity multi-signature wallet in which the contract holding the code governing the wallets\u2019 behavior was deleted. Anyone with Ether tokens in Parity multi-signature wallets was unable to withdraw them.\n\nAll of the funds are not recoverable without a change to blockchain\u2019s state, consensus rules modification or opcode upgrades, the blog noted. One can assume this was not the intention of the developers and users who deployed the contracts or sent the transactions.\n\nThere have been other issues. It has been too easy to have a typo in an address and end up sending Ether to the wrong address. Unfortunately, such errors can never be proven to be non-recoverable like the addresses where the Ethers sit and are valid and usable.\n\nNumerous Factors Involved\n\nNo one should think that unlocking the stuck funds will amount to anything but a rescue operation, which only would be possible with a hard fork. The protocol in some cases was at fault. Client usability issues and issues with codebase maintained by both private parties and the Foundation code, the unanticipated appearance of a competitor network and simple user error have added to the present state of affairs.\n\nEthereum remains solid and continues to evolve, the blog stated.\n\nYet many millions of dollars have been lost to numerous groups on account of these and other issues. Much of it cannot be recovered on account of not being able to prove its status as lost or because of a lack of clarity in the sender\u2019s intention.\n\nSolutions Are Possible\n\nMuch of it can be recovered.\n\nA hard fork is contentious. It marks a change to how we had expected the network to act. The question is whether these changes to the network\u2019s expected behavior could bring negative effects when some users based their off- and on-chain behavior assuming behavior would not change. There are parallels to the earlier debate over changing the rate of issuance and its impact on miner behavior and incentives.\n\nThe problem of having such diverse roots should be expected and many solutions have been put forth ranging from partial coverage with strict rules on certain cases to solutions focusing on edge cases without strict definitions.\n\nVitalik put forth a discussion in EIP 156 which enables private key holders impacted by certain issues to withdraw their Ether. Cases covered by this proposal include contracts created without code, losses generated by the JavaScript library bug and losses on account of replay attacks.\n\nThis marks a partial coverage with a strict rules solution. Such cases have a clear owner who can be identified with fairly inexpensive computation on the chain. This proposal, therefore, gives no explicit favor to any particular account, application or user. Such an approach fails to cover the funds locked in the Parity multi-signature wallets since the contract itself has code, and it would not permit recovery of tokens besides Ether.\n\nAnother solution is to address specific Ether and tokens recovery, a solution addressing capturing as many edge cases as possible, but it is not tightly defined. The solution would need those that \u201chold the pen\u201d to define its scope. It is the most direct solution and would not alter the semantic behavior of the EVM but could address all cases raised previously.\n\nAlso read: Parity ponders hard fork fix for 160 million in frozen Ether\n\nChange The Protocol\n\nA third solution that Parity suggested is to change the protocol that would permit the resurgence of suicided contracts and deployment of contracts for all users going forward. This would revive the Parity multi-sig and other problems in which contract addresses hold funds but have not had code deployed to them. Such a solution would also safeguard future similar incidents.\n\nAnother partial coverage with a strict approach, this represents enough change in behavior of the EVM that it could amount to a functional change to the platform since it will no longer make transaction ordering the key factor in a contract address. Parity prefers this solution since it adds functionality for users through the details being debated.\n\nAccomplishing proper governance around protocol upgrades and hard forks on Ethereum has been ongoing. Consensus has been achieved on technical upgrades while non-enhancement hard forks have failed. The next discussion will be a critical test for how contention can transform into consensus.\n\nParity hopes the community will support rescuing the funds to help as many users as possible.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock."

        "title": "With ETH Remaining Dominant, Does ETC Have a Future? - Securities.io",
        "content": "Currently, the crypto industry is grappling with regulatory issues, with the US cracking down on crypto and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) not wanting to clarify its stance on crypto regulations while the UK is pushing for crypto to be classified as gambling.\n\nWhile addressing these local issues, a more expansive situation unfolds. On a macroeconomic scale, the US government is anticipated to run out of cash on June 1. Paradoxically, this looming reality is predicted to bolster risk assets. In tandem with this broad economic context, the cryptocurrency market is experiencing a resurgence. The market capitalization has increased by 1.2%, pushing the total value up to $1.18 trillion, indicating a positive response to these macroeconomic events.\n\nWhile Bitcoin is trading just above $27,000, the second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum, is exchanging hands at $1,826. According to cryptocurrency data provider Kaiko, the correlation between Bitcoin and Ethereum prices has reached its lowest point since 2021, standing at 77%, which can potentially enhance trading activity within BTC and ETH pairs going forward.\n\nAmong altcoins, ETC is also in the green in USD but is in the red against BTC and ETH. Let's take a look at Ethereum Classic and if it has a future!\n\nClick here to learn how to buy Ethereum Classic (ETC) in just four steps.\n\nThe Distinction Between Ethereum & Ethereum Classic\n\nEthereum is a layer 1 blockchain that pioneered smart contracts, the self-executing programs that automatically carry out certain functions when predetermined conditions are met.\n\nFirst proposed in 2013 by Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum was designed to expand the utility of cryptocurrencies by allowing developers to create their own special applications called \u201cdecentralized applications,\u201d or dApps.\n\nETH is the native token of the blockchain that is used for sending and receiving value globally without any third-party interference. The token powers the Ethereum ecosystem and is used to pay the gas fees, which refers to the amount of Ether that's needed to perform a certain function on the network, such as creating smart contracts, interacting with dApps, minting NFTs, and sending transactions.\n\nWhen it comes to Ethereum Classic (ETC), it was the result of the Ethereum network experiencing a hard fork in July 2016.\n\nThe original Ethereum blockchain was supposed to die out after the upgrade, but some users disagreed with the hard fork, arguing that immutability is one of the key points of blockchains and transactions shouldn't be reversed.\n\nThis split the chain into two and resulted in the creation of Ethereum Classic. When the separation first happened, those who held ETH at the time received the exact same amount of ETC tokens in their wallets for free.\n\nThe old chain, or Ethereum Classic, executed a number of upgrades to adopt a deflationary monetary policy with a hard cap of 210 million on the total number of ETC that will be created. This step was taken to make ETC more attractive than Ethereum and supposedly make it a better store of value as its tokens are scarcer. Ethereum, meanwhile, has no limit to how many Ether can enter circulation.\n\nThe key difference between the two has been their goals, specifically, Ethereum Classic's special focus on immutability and \u2018Code is Law'.\n\nHowever, much like Ethereum, Ethereum Classic is a decentralized computing system that can run a wide variety of applications. Additionally, ETC is its native currency, which is used to power smart contracts and transactions on its network.\n\nUsers pay gas fees in ETC which is rewarded to miners who solve \u201cproof of work\u201d puzzles. While ETC can be mined using widely-available graphics processors, you'd need ASIC miners and specialized devices designed for crypto mining to be profitable.\n\nClick here if you wish to learn more about this: ETH vs ETC \u2013 What You Should Know?\n\nWhat's the Price Doing? ETH & ETC Performance\n\nIn 2014, ETH was launched through an ICO, during which the project raised over $16 million by selling some 50 million ETH tokens at a price of $0.31 per coin.\n\nBetween the period of 2014 and March 2017, the token's price remained range bound between $0.70 and $21. But when the bullish momentum resurfaced in the second half of the year, ETH price spiked above $100 for the very first time. In June 2017, Ether went to hit $414 before correcting only for the bullish momentum to regain strength about five months later that not only sent ETH's price to $1,418 but elevated almost every crypto token to new highs.\n\nThree years later, ETH retested its previous all-time high (ATH) price only for Eth's price to more than triple to set a new ATH of $4,880. Currently, the $220 billion market cap ETH is down 62.57% from this peak but up 52.33% in 2023 so far.\n\nIn contrast, ETC's price surged to a peak of $42 during the 2017 bull run before crashing to a low of $3 during the crypto-wide bear market. Amidst the bull market of 2021, ETC's price soared to a new peak of $167 but has since lost almost 89% of its value. ETC is only up 17.76% YTD.\n\nWhile ETC has managed to rally some against USD, it is struggling against other cryptos. ETC is down 1.40% against ETH and 1.34% against BTC in the past year, while ETH is up in the green by 0.05% against BTC during the same period.\n\nAs of writing, the 27th largest crypto with a $2.6 billion market cap, ETC, is trading at $18.62 while managing about $69 million in 24-hour trading volume compared to the $6.6 bln volume recorded by Ethereum during this period.\n\nWhile up 1.8% in the past 24 hours, the ETC price is down by over 15% in the past month and more than 12% in the past year. For ETC to continue seeing bulls, the price must stay above the $15 support. For now, ETC's price seems to be consolidating between $18 and $25 and could break on either side.\n\nThe token, however, has resistance near the 200-day EMA, reflecting the downward trend. More importantly, the volume of the cryptocurrency is decreasing, and fewer participants are active.\n\nClick here to learn all about investing in Ethereum (ETH).\n\nETH Continues to Improve, While ETC is Stagnant\n\nEthereum constantly goes through upgrades to make it more efficient. Ethereum 2.0, also known as \u201cSerenity,\u201d is a major upgrade that aims to make it faster and more scalable by migrating the network from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms.\n\nIn Dec. 2020, by launching Beacon Chain, Ethereum completed Phase 0 of ETH 2.0, which introduced staking to the network. The network users lock up their coins to become validators instead of using expensive, energy-intensive mining equipment.\n\nEach staker needs to lock up 32 ETH, or they can join a staking pool to combine their Ether with others to participate in creating new blocks on the Ethereum PoS blockchain.\n\nBeacon Chain was launched separately from the Ethereum blockchain, that's also responsible for transaction verification, staking rewards, and managing new Ethereum blockchains called \u201cshard chains.\u201d\n\nOn Sept. 15, 2022, Ethereum executed The Merge, marking the completion of its transition to the PoS system. Then in April 2023, with the Shapella upgrade, the network finally allowed for the unlocking of staked Ether.\n\nNext in line for Ethereum development is sharding, which creates multiple mini-blockchains. After this, further tweaks will be made to enhance the network's security.\n\nRecently, Ethereum reached a new milestone by locking away more than 20.5 million ETH, worth $37.4 billion, amidst the recent withdrawals. In addition to 18.28% of ETH supply being locked, a portion of gas fees is also being burned daily, which together makes ETH a deflationary asset.\n\nWith Ethereum's increasing popularity and adoption, the demand for ETH will likely rise while its supply continues to decline. This can potentially drive up ETH's price.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum Classic has no such plans to migrate to the PoS system and intends to keep traditional mining on its own blockchain. However, Ethereum Classic hasn't stopped its attempts to grow its network and join the latest trends of DeFi and NFT.\n\nSeveral projects have built on Ethereum Classic, namely Wrapped ETC, TurbineSwap, ghostNFT, Shiba Classic, ETCPlanets, SHP, Billionaire Boys Classic, ClassicHeroes, MVRSWood \u2013 Become Metaverse Degen Royalty, Matrixport, SoyFinance, Fusion, Nova USD Stablecoin, MonkeyDoo, ClassicDAO, ETCswap, Multichain, CoinRabbit, The Man Who Sold The World Metaverse, Canonical Wrapped Ether, Classic Rewards, Nft List, Lazy, ETC Bit Pixel, MoonLama, HENS, Token Factory, SwapCat, ETCZunks, and ETC HODL Contract.\n\nHowever, ETC's development and usage activity is nowhere near Ethereum, the most used blockchain and home to billions of dollars in assets.\n\nAccording to DeFi Llama, Ethereum Classic has less than $240k in total value locked (TVL), down from $1 million in August 2022, with HebeSwap accounting for over 94% of it. But ETC's TVL is immensely dwarfed by Ethreum's impressive $27.22 billion TVL, reflecting just how far behind the network is in the DeFi race.\n\nWhat Does the Future Hold?\n\nEthereum is a clear winner as Ethereum Classic has struggled to compete with Ethereum in every facet, be it market capitalization, developers, and network security since its creation.\n\nOn top of it all, throughout its history, Ethereum Classic has been subject to numerous \u201c51% attacks,\u201d also known as a double-spend attack. In such an attack, malicious actors control a majority of the mining power and, as a result, can spend coins they didn't actually own.\n\nWhile Ethereum Classic doesn't really have a thriving community, Barry Silbert, the CEO of Digital Currency Group, who was an early driving force behind ETC following the initial split, announced its plans to buy $50 million in shares of Grayscale's Ethereum Classic Trust (ETCG) in 2021. Currently, there are $218.6 million in assets under management (AUM) in the trust.\n\nDespite this, the future of Ethereum Classic (ETC) is uncertain due to the continued dominance of Ethereum (ETH). While ETC has a small community and offers a similar blockchain technology, it faces challenges in terms of market adoption and developer support.\n\nWith its larger network effects, extensive ecosystem, and ongoing development, ETH remains the preferred choice for most projects and investors. ETC's future depends on its ability to differentiate itself and attract users and developers, but it may struggle to compete effectively against ETH's established position in the market, as seen over the past many years.\n\nClick here to learn how to buy Ethereum (ETH) in just four steps."

        "content": "Is 2023 a good time to buy Ethereum, and how do investors feel about it?\n\nCynthia Madison, at Content Creator\n\nCynthia Madison, at Content Creator\n\n18.05.2023 12:00 pm #Financial\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation after Bitcoin, accounts for almost 20% of the $1.1 trillion global crypto market, making it one of the safest long-term bets if you are looking to diversify your portfolio with digital currency. While last year was defined by market turbulence and 2023 is no short of political developments, economic events, and other unforeseen occurrences, jumping off the plane and panic selling or making irreversible changes to an investment portfolio is not the go-to method to prevent losses among seasoned investors. Historically, markets do eventually bounce back after downturns, meaning that those who overreacted and sold their assets can't benefit from market rebounds.\n\nBefore discovering where Ethereum is going in 2023 and what events are going to bring positive media exposure, it's worth mentioning last year's highlights. Many cryptocurrency owners were caught off-guard several times in 2022, more precisely when FTX filed for bankruptcy and Luna Crash collapsed and rushed to sell their assets to recover some of the money invested. 2023, however, started on a positive note with cryptocurrencies prices surging, and following a period of downturns and dips, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies are finally witnessing a bullish momentum. Prices might recover slowly but hopefully surely, which is why it would make more sense now than three months ago to buy Ethereum .\n\nDespite the turbulence experienced last year in the cryptocurrency market, Ethereum remains one of the safest long-term bets for investors willing to weather the ups and downs of this volatile world. Let's discover the most important aspects impacting Ethereum this year so you can make informed decisions if you want to buy the dip.\n\nPhoto source: https://unsplash.com/photos/L2QB-rG5NM0\n\nIs it a good time to invest in Ethereum?\n\nAfter a bad year for the cryptocurrency market, 2023 started more positively. Ethereum prices have reached new highs in recent weeks, and coin issuance is once again deflationary, with 66,000 ETH reducing supply. This is due to the switch from Proof-of-Stake to Proof-of-Work in September 2022, when the long-awaited Merge upgrade is finally released. Owing to the new consensus mechanism, a fraction of Ethereum is being burned, turning it into a deflationary asset once again, after fluctuating between deflationary and inflationary over the years. This is good news for crypto enthusiasts looking for scarce virtual assets.\n\nA \"deflationary\" currency is one that sees its supply decrease over time, contrasting \"inflationary\" currencies, where the supply grows. Notably, deflationary currencies appeal to cryptocurrency enthusiasts, as they believe the scarcity will increase the value of their assets. Some cryptocurrencies' supply decreases over time, meaning their value grows if demand stays constant. Binance Coin (BNB), for instance, burns tokens quarterly to limit the supply and ensure a maximum of 200.000 coins. However, owing to burning events, the current BNB supply is lower.\n\nWhy are investors optimistic about Ethereum?\n\nSeveral things impact a cryptocurrency's price and must be considered when looking to add digital coins to your investment portfolio. Among the most important are the news and media exposure surrounding it. Whether now is a good time to buy the dip is debatable and depends on the investor. What's for sure is that Ethereum has gained quite a lot of good media exposure owing to the past upgrades that followed the highly anticipated merger of the Ethereum Mainnet and the Beacon Chain PoS system. Nevertheless, the impact of the Merge was not necessarily reflected in the cryptocurrency's value, but in a better global perception of the network, as it reduced energy consumption by more than 99.99%, according to Ethereum.org.\n\nThe Shanghai Upgrade, the next major event for Ethereum, will take place around April 12 and finally enable users to withdraw their staked ETH. Significant improvements like these may benefit the token's value thanks to improved scalability and efficiency for the network. Investors believe that the Ethereum price, which has recently risen, will skyrocket following this long-awaited upgrade.\n\nHow to approach Ethereum investments in the next period?\n\nThere are several types of investors, including those seeking to take advantage of market crashes to make investments at bargain prices, like billionaire Warren Buffet. On the other hand, sceptics are pessimistic about the revival of an asset when its value is low, so they choose to stay away from it.\n\nWhile it's true that Ethereum has yet to reach its all-time high of November 2021, this isn't a reflection of the future. This token, just like its counterparts, went through challenging situations. Even though nothing can guarantee that they ended just because 2023 started on a positive note, buying at a discount can be a smart move for those believing in the potential of digital currency.\n\nWhether Ethereum will experience similar returns again is uncertain. But since its price is two and a half times lower than its 2021 peak, investing in it at a bargain price is worth considering. Even if it doesn't see momentous returns, approaching its all-time high again could bring significant yield.\n\nFinal take\n\nDespite the turbulence experienced last year in the cryptocurrency market and the whole financial system, Ethereum remains one of the safest long-term bets for investors looking to diversify their investment portfolio with cryptocurrency. Those willing to weather the ups and downs of this volatile world may reap the benefits of patience in the bear market. However, nothing and no one can guarantee financial returns, especially in such volatile markets. Plus, investing in cryptocurrency requires thorough research on cryptocurrency options and a deep understanding of your long-term goals and risk tolerance. To establish the latter, consider your behavioural tendencies and what you would do when seeing your asset's value drop.\n\nEthereum has been having a good year so far, but only time can tell where it will be in the future. Ensure you are informed when you start investing in cryptocurrency, use common sense, and only spend money you can afford to lose."

        "content": "Visa is experimenting with ERC-4337, or Account Abstraction, which offers an alternative solution to dealing with transaction fees.\n\nPayments giant Visa has been exploring new ways to process payments on the blockchain with respect to Account Abstraction.\n\nBlockchain data shows that Visa deployed two sets of Paymaster smart contracts on Ethereum\u2019s Goerli testnet. The firm detailed these experiments in a report published earlier this week, outlining the potential use cases of the contracts.\n\nThese experiments were based on the starter code released by the Ethereum Foundation and the core team of developers working on ERC-4337. The Account Abstraction proposal incorporates a new transaction flow, which makes the ERC-4337 wallets programmable to initiate transactions without the need for them to be authenticated with private keys.\n\nPart of the proposal is a new type of contract called paymaster, which can sponsor gas fees on behalf of a user.\n\nIn Visa\u2019s first experiment, the Paymaster contract tested the potential to facilitate ERC-20 tokens to pay for gas fees.\n\n\u201cWe are exploring whether a user can pay transaction fees with alternative tokens, such as a dollar stablecoin or, in the future, even a Central Bank Digital Currency,\u201d the team explained.\n\nThe second experiment involved a smart contract that covers the gas fee for user transactions. The sample implementation uses an allowlist, which means potential users need to be whitelisted to interact with the contract.\n\n\u201cA user who only has USDC and wants to pay a merchant for a product no longer needs to carry the native chain token. Instead, a paymaster can cover the gas fees (charge a small fee). The user would never need to buy/hold ETH,\u201d explained blockchain developer \u201c0xcygaar\u201d on Twitter.\n\n\u201cAccount abstraction will open up a whole new world of interactions with Ethereum (and other EVM chains), this is just the beginning,\u201d he added."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction 2025-2030: Fresh wave of panic as ETH falls below $1800 - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Disclaimer: The datasets shared in the following article have been compiled from a set of online resources and do not reflect AMBCrypto\u2019s own research on the subject.\n\nEthereum\u2019s [ETH] price remained in a bearish zone below the $1,840 mark throughout the last week. Ethereum started a fresh decline below the $1,800 level and showed a few bearish signs. The price went below the $1,780-price level as well.\n\nAt press time, ETH was trading barely above the $1,800-price level at $1804.\n\nIf there is a move above the $1,840 resistance level, the price might start a decent increase toward the $1,920 level. Any more gains above the $1,920 resistance zone could start a decent increase toward the $2,000 resistance.\n\nAccording to Beaconcha.in, around 1.97 million ETH, or roughly $3.6 billion, have been withdrawn by investors since the Shapella update. ETH balances on cryptocurrency exchanges haven\u2019t changed significantly, though, as of yet.\n\nLess Ether whales have historically increased the negative risk for the ETH price. Typically, whale activity serves as a leading market indicator. Consequently, an increase in prices and rich investor accumulation typically go hand in hand.\n\nThis is interesting, especially since after bottoming out in June 2022 at about $880, the price of ETH has more than doubled. This, despite several unfavourable developments such as the demise of FTX, a rise in interest rates, and stricter U.S. regulations.\n\nHere, it is important to note that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) calculates inflation or the rate of growth in product and service prices. As a result, traders and investors predict that the US Federal Reserve will opt to postpone or slow down its intentions to hike interest rates at its next meeting if the CPI report indicates a high level of inflation.\n\nRead Price Prediction for Ethereum (ETH) 2023-24\n\nSpeculations around Shanghai weren\u2019t without reason, however. Especially since ETH was once valued at over $3,700, just over a year ago.\n\nEven so, the short-term sell-off event that was expected to follow the update, one which will allow stakers to withdraw their vested tokens from Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake (PoS) smart contract, has not come to pass. At least, not yet.\n\nThe Ethereum community seems to be supportive of Coinbase\u2019s recently revealed layer-2 network, Base, which has been called a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d and a \u201chuge confidence vote\u201d for the blockchain network.\n\nBase, a layer-2 network driven by Optimism and secured on Ethereum, seeks to eventually develop into a network for creating decentralized applications (dApps) on the blockchain. According to Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, the layer-2 network is now in its testnet phase.\n\nThe move is \u201ca massive vote of confidence for Ethereum,\u201d according to Ryan Sean Adams, host of the Bankless Show. This could set a precedent for cryptocurrency businesses and financial institutions to use Ethereum as their preferred settlement layer.\n\nRecently, Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, donated $150,000 in ETH to Syrian and Turkish victims. Additionally, the native coin of the Ethereum blockchain, ETH, experienced a significant price drop after whales sold 350,000 ETH tokens.\n\nAccording to Diogo M\u00f3nica, co-founder and president of Anchorage Digital, a cryptocurrency bank with a market cap of over $3 billion, the Merge\u2019s success transformed Ethereum from \u201ca smart contract platform lagging behind\u201d into \u201csomething that was doing things properly.\u201d This is accurate: After the Merge, institutional interest in ETH staking rose, according to Matt Hougan, CIO at Bitwise Asset Management.\n\nAs ETH dominance has increased compared to other cryptocurrencies over the past few years, Ether\u2019s bullish setup vs Bitcoin is apparent. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum have consolidated over the week as the broader crypto market continues to enjoy a bullish spell.\n\nThe price of Ethereum has lately undergone a significant correction, yet the whales have been purchasing at every decline. The fifth-largest accumulation day in a year was recorded last week as ETH whale activity reached a new level. As the FTX problem developed over this month of November, Ethereum whales have been building up. According to a Santiment report,\n\n\u201cEthereum\u2019s large key addresses have been growing in number since the #FTX debacle in early November. Pictured are the key moments where shark & whale addresses have accumulated & dumped. The number of 100 to 100k $ETH addresses is at a 20-month high.\u201d\n\nIt almost reached the lows during the FTX collapse-driven meltdown of the cryptocurrency market, but it rapidly bounced back and was able to maintain above those levels as well. This strengthens the argument since Ethereum has typically outperformed Bitcoin.\n\nGiven everything, buying Ethereum must be a sound investment in the long term, right? Most experts have positive predictions for ETH. Furthermore, the bulk of long-term Ethereum price projections are upbeat.\n\nWhy are projections important?\n\nSince Ethereum has seen phenomenal growth in recent years, it is not surprising that investors are placing significant bets on this cryptocurrency. Ethereum gained traction after the price of Bitcoin dropped in 2020, following a protracted period of stagnation in 2018 and 2019.\n\nInterestingly, much of the altcoin market remained idle even after the halving. One of the few that picked up the momentum quickly is Ethereum. Ethereum had increased by 200% from its 2017 highs by the end of 2021.\n\nEthereum may experience such a spike thanks to several crucial factors. One of these is an upgrade to the Ethereum network, specifically a move to Ethereum 2.0. Another reason is the Ethereum tokenomics debate. With the switch to Ethereum 2.0, ether tokenomics will become even more deflationary. As a result, there won\u2019t be as many tokens on the market to meet increasing demand. The outcome might increase Ethereum\u2019s rising momentum in the future.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll take a quick look at the cryptocurrency market\u2019s recent performance, paying particular attention to market cap and volume. The most well-known analysts\u2019 and platforms\u2019 predictions will be summarized at the end, along with a look at the Fear & Greed Index to gauge market sentiment.\n\nEthereum\u2019s price, volume, and everything in between\n\nAt press time, ETH was trading at $1,804.84 with a market capitalization of over $217 billion. In the last 24 hours, ETH\u2019s value dipped by 1.3% on the charts.\n\nEven though it\u2019s difficult to forecast the price of a volatile cryptocurrency, most experts concur that ETH may once again cross the $4,000 barrier in 2023. And, according to a recent forecast by Bloomberg intelligence analyst Mike McGlone, the price of Ethereum will conclude the year between $4,000 and $4,500.\n\nAdditionally, according to a report by Kaiko last year, ETH\u2019s market share of trading volume will reach 50% parity with Bitcoin\u2019s for the first time in 2023.\n\nAccording to Kaiko, ETH outpaced Bitcoin in July last year as a result of significant inflows into the spot and derivative markets. Most exchanges have seen this surge, which can be an indication of returning investors. Additionally, a rise in average trade size is the exact reverse of what has been seen so far in 2022\u2019s downturn.\n\nIn fact, a majority of cryptocurrency influencers are bullish on Ethereum and anticipate it to reach incredible highs.\n\nWhile the broader Ethereum community was looking forward to the environment-friendly PoS update, a faction emerged in favor of a fork that will retain the energy-intensive PoW model.\n\nThe faction was mostly made up of miners who risk losing their investment in expensive mining equipment since the update would render their business model useless. Prominent Chinese miner Chandler Guo stated on Twitter that an ETHPoW is \u201ccoming soon\u201d.\n\nAt the time, Binance clarified that in the event of a fork which creates a new token, the ETH ticker will be reserved for the Ethereum PoS chain, adding that \u201cwithdrawals for the forked token will be supported\u201d. Stablecoin projects Tether and Circle both reiterated their exclusive support for the Ethereum PoS chain after the Merge.\n\nIn fact, PwC\u2019s Crypto-head Henri Arslanian claimed in an edition of First Mover that \u201cEthereum is the only show in town.\u201d However, investors will need to witness increased demand and functioning for Ether\u2019s price to keep climbing.\n\nAccording to investor and creator of the cryptocurrency research and media organization Token Metrics Ian Balina, \u201cI think Ethereum can go to $8,000.\u201d\n\nETH Whale Activity\n\nOn 27 March, blockchain analytics firm Santiment revealed that almost 90% of Ethereum\u2019s supply was stored in self-custody addresses. The last time the figure was so high was nearly eight years ago in 2015, shortly after the protocol\u2019s native token saw the light of day. This was happening as users are withdrawing their assets from Binance that is facing CFTC\u2019s investigation.\n\nThis essential all-time low ratio of ETH on exchanges (10.31%) indicated confidence from hodlers.\n\n?? #Ethereum is now being held in self custody and away from exchanges at the highest level since the week the token was introduced nearly 8 years ago. This essential all-time low ratio of $ETH on exchanges (10.31%) indicates confidence from #hodlers. https://t.co/VPwlCjzbAN pic.twitter.com/VB2r57xhQl \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) March 27, 2023\n\nData from blockchain analytics firm Santiment shows ETH supply held by the top addresses on crypto exchanges has been on the rise since early June. On the other hand, ETH supply held by the top non-exchange addresses i.e. ETH held in hardware wallets, digital wallets etc. has been declining since early June. But why June? Because it was around that time that a tentative timeline for the Merge was disclosed to the community.\n\nAlso, Santiment had tweeted that over the past 3 months, whales had beefed up their exchange holdings by 78%.\n\nSo what does this mean? It means that Ethereum whales are moving their ETH onto exchanges. Top ETH hodlers are taking their supply out of cold storage and moving it to exchanges, most likely to facilitate a quick transaction if needed.\n\nIn the run up to the merge, a number of exchanges like Coinbase and Binance announced that they will be suspending all ETH and ERC-20 token deposits and withdrawals, in order to ensure a seamless transition.\n\nIt is possible that the whales moved their holdings onto exchanges to either preemptively dump their holdings in anticipation of a price slump after the Merge. The other possibility is them waiting till well after the Merge to act on ETH\u2019s price action.\n\nLet\u2019s now look at what well-known platforms and analysts have to say about where they believe Ethereum will be in 2025 and 2030.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction 2025\n\nAccording to Changelly, the least expected price of ETH in 2025 is $5,174.38, while the maximum possible price is $6,102.62. The average expected trading cost is $5,358.79.\n\nDigitalCoinPrice is even more bullish in its assessment of ETH\u2019s future performance. It predicts that ETH will trade as low as $5,302.54 and as high as $6,506.43, with its average price being $5,833.66.\n\nHowever, you have to remember that the year is 2025, and a lot of these projections are based on Ethereum 2.0 launching and performing successfully. And by that, it means Ethereum has to solve its high-cost gas fees issues as well. Also, global regulatory and legislative frameworks have not yet consistently backed cryptocurrencies.\n\nHowever, even though newer and more environmentally friendly technologies have been developed, analysts frequently claim that Ethereum\u2019s \u201cfirst mover advantage\u201d has positioned it for long-term success, despite new competition. The price predictions seem conceivable because, in addition to its projected update, Ethereum is anticipated to be used more frequently than ever before in the development of DApps.\n\nHow many ETHs can you buy for $1?\n\nEthereum Price Prediction 2030\n\nChangelly also argued that the price of ETH in 2030 has been estimated by cryptocurrency specialists after years of price monitoring. It will be traded for a minimum of $29,991.01 and a maximum of $37,106.45. So, on average, you can anticipate that in 2030, the price of ETH will be roughly $30,874.69.\n\nDigitalCoinPrice is however not as bullish in its 2030 prediction for ETH. It predicts that the minimum and maximum prices of ETH in 2030 will be $17,549.25 and $18,841.55. On average, it will be traded at $18,459.53.\n\nLong-term Ethereum price estimates can be a useful tool for analyzing the market and learning how key platforms anticipate that future developments like the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade will affect pricing.\n\nCrypto-Rating, for instance, predicts that by 2030, Ethereum\u2019s value will likely exceed $100,000.\n\nBoth Pantera Capital CEO Dan Morehead and deVEre Group founder Nigel Green also predict that during the next ten years, the price of ETH will hit $100,000.\n\nSounds like too much? Well, the functional capabilities of the network, such as interoperability, security, and transaction speed, will radically change as a result of Ethereum 2.0. Should these and other related reforms be successfully implemented, opinion on ETH will change from being slightly favorable to strongly bullish. This will provide Ethereum the chance to entirely rewrite the rules of the cryptocurrency game.\n\nConclusion\n\nUsers will have quicker access to their money now that ETH staking withdrawal processing times on Binance have been slashed from 15 days to 5 days.\n\nThis will provide traders and investors with greater flexibility because they will be able to use their ETH for other things like paying bills or buying other cryptocurrencies.\n\nMore market liquidity could be attained as a result of this action. Due to the quick access to their cash, traders who often enter and exit positions may find this to be very advantageous.\n\nWhile some of these investors have invested in rival tokens in order to profit, others are doing it out of precaution in order to hedge their portfolios. This has been corroborated by the volatility witnessed in metrics like daily active users and price action of so-called Ethereum killers like Avalanche, Solana, Cardano etc. in the run up to the merge event which is less than a month away.\n\nThe majority of investors anticipated that Ethereum would bottom out at $3500 early this year, but the currency moved lower to show them incorrect. In fact, ETH briefly fell below the terrifying $1000 threshold.\n\nHowever, the coin has always rebounded when it appeared that it was poised to strike the target once more, restoring confidence in its future. This includes the incident in November 2022 when an FTX hacker allegedly dumped over 30,000 ETH. Hope is offered by the token\u2019s persistence in the wake of the FTX bankruptcy and the protracted crypto cold.\n\nThere is broad hope that the first smart contract blockchain will survive this period of trials, despite Ethereum\u2019s rivalries and other factors contributing to its continuous instability.\n\nAs far as the Merge is concerned, it is being hailed as a major success story by the Ethereum community. Buterin cited a research study by an Ethereum researcher, Justin Drake, that suggests that the \u201cmerge will reduce worldwide electricity consumption by 0.2%.\u201d\n\n\"The merge will reduce worldwide electricity consumption by 0.2%\" \u2013 @drakefjustin \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) September 15, 2022\n\nIt also reduces the time to mine one block of ETH from 13 seconds to 12 seconds. The Merge marks 55% completion of Ethereum\u2019s journey toward greater scalability and sustainability.\n\nThe likelihood that Ether will experience a price surge of 50% in the future is increased by its superior interim fundamentals to those of Bitcoin. To begin with, Ether\u2019s annual supply rate plummeted in October 2022, in part because of a fee-burning mechanism known as EIP-1559 that takes a certain amount of ETH out of perpetual circulation anytime an on-chain transaction takes place.\n\nConcerns about censorship on the Ethereum ecosystem have also emerged post the Merge. Around half of the Ethereum blocks are Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)-compliant as MEV-Boost got implemented. As Ethereum has upgraded to a PoS consensus, MEV-Boost has been enabled to a more representative distribution of block proposers, rather than a small group of miners under PoW. This development raises a concern about censorship under the force of OFAC.\n\nIt is interesting to note that while many eagerly waited for Ethereum\u2019s Merge and beefed up their holdings in anticipation of a price surge, there was a group of investors who weren\u2019t confident in the Merge\u2019s successful rollout. These investors were betting on a glitch in the rollout process, hoping that the update runs into trouble. While some of these investors have started investing in rival tokens in order to profit, others are doing it out of precaution in order to hedge their portfolios. This was corroborated by the volatility witnessed in metrics like daily active users and price action of so-called Ethereum killers like Avalanche, Solana, Cardano etc. in the run up to the Merge.\n\nThe majority of Ethereum price forecasts indicate that ETH can anticipate tremendous growth over the ensuing years.\n\nAs per Santiment, Ethereum\u2019s active addresses have sunk to 4-month lows with weak hands continuing to drop post-Merge and disinterest at a high as prices have stagnated.\n\nWhat about the flippening then? Is it possible that the altcoin might pass Bitcoin on the charts in the future? Well, that is possible. In fact, according to BlockchainCenter, ETH has already surpassed BTC on a few key metrics.\n\nConsider Transaction Counts and Total Transaction Fees, for instance. On both counts, ETH is ahead of BTC.\n\nOn the contrary, the traditional definition of a \u2018flippening\u2019 relates to the market cap of cryptos flipping.\n\nHowever, remember that a lot can change over these years, especially in a highly volatile market like cryptocurrency. Leading analysts\u2019 projections may vary, but even the most conservative ones might cause respectable profits for anyone choosing to invest in Ethereum. As far as the F&G Index is concerned, ETH showed a \u2018neutral\u2019 market sentiment for the moment."

The analyst asked for anonymity citing company media policy.\n\nConsolidation of DeFi\n\nAlthough the total value locked in Ethereum DeFi protocols grew more than sevenfold in 2021 to more than $110 billion, its share of the crypto market plummeted, from more than 90% to 55%.

These so-called \u201crollups,\u201d or layer 2 blockchains, such as Arbitrum and Optimism, let users access Ethereum\u2019s security and decentralisation at a fraction of the price.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s a huge liquidity problem, because everyone\u2019s money is still locked up in Ethereum\u2019 \u2014 Tze Donn Ng, Tioga Capital\n\nLayer 2 blockchains built on top of Ethereum now handle more transactions than Ethereum itself.\n\nThere has been a \u201cconsolidation of DeFi onto Ethereum, where there\u2019s the most liquidity,\u201d according to Sebastien Guillemot co-founder and director at Paima Studios.\n\nWhen accounting for its rollups, Ethereum\u2019s share of TVL has grown since April 2022, to more than two-thirds of the DeFi market.\n\nMove over\n\nVenture funds last year poured hundreds of millions into a pair of blockchains built using Move, a programming language developed by Meta\u2019s Facebook during its attempt to create its own cryptocurrency. As many before them had, Aptos and Sui promised faster transactions at lower cost, luring funding from venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz, among others.\n\n\u201cAptos and Sui got a lot of fanfare a while ago when they announced all the funding rounds,\u201d Tze Donn Ng, an investment associate at Tioga Capital, told DL News.\n\nNOW READ: Sui launch throws market makers\u2019 cut into spotlight: \u2018No one really knows what the terms of the deal are\u2019\n\nThe reason is multifaceted.\n\nFirst, there\u2019s less innovation than meets the eye.\n\nDuring the bull market, tokens for newly launched protocols would surge in value the moment they began trading, Guillemot said.\n\nIn an attempt to ride this wave, developers launched clones of popular Ethereum applications on new blockchains, Guillemot said.\n\n\u201cBut now that we\u2019re in a bear market and that\u2019s not really an option, there\u2019s not so much appetite for this, which has caused everyone to consolidate on platforms that do have active users,\u201d he said.\n\nThe result? Fewer applications on new blockchains, and fewer reasons to go to those blockchains.\n\n\u201cThese new blockchains don\u2019t have anything fundamentally interesting for users at the moment,\u201d Tom Dunleavy, a former analyst at Messari, told DL News.\n\nThe \u2018liquidity problem\u2019\n\nThere\u2019s another, deeper issue facing alternative smart contract blockchains. Network effects mean that, as Ethereum grows in popularity, it becomes an even more attractive place for new users. More users means more assets, which means deeper liquidity and an easier experience trading.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a huge liquidity problem, because everyone\u2019s money is still locked up in Ethereum,\u201d Ng said.\n\nCreating a bridge between Ethereum and competing blockchains in order to allow Ethereum users to move their assets elsewhere likely won\u2019t help the matter \u2014 not after a year in which bridges became prime targets for hackers.\n\nNOW READ: DeFi hackers stole $3.2bn last year amid 35% surge in \u2018bridge\u2019 exploits\n\nSaid Ng: \u201cNo one likes to bridge assets.

        "title": "This Ethereum Proposal Wants to Bring Revenue Back to Developers - Blockworks",
        "content": "An Ethereum Improvement Proposal, dubbed EIP-6969, is looking to implement Contract-Secured Revenue (CSR) on Ethereum L2s.\n\nCSR refers to a series of smart contracts that enable developers to earn revenue whenever others interact with the code they have deployed on-chain.\n\nKevin Owocki, one of the co-authors of EIP-6969, told Blockworks that his firsthand experience as a builder in the Web3 space made him aware of the difficulties involved in monetizing the products he had actively helped create.\n\n\u201cThere are really not that many opportunities to monetize in a way that\u2019s sustainable and not very speculative,\u201d Owocki said.\n\nAfter learning about CSRs from the Canto Layer 1 network, a permissionless general-purpose blockchain, Owocki saw an opportunity to reward developers for their efforts sustainably and wanted to bring this idea into the EVM ecosystem.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nBringing activity to L2s and revenue to developers\n\nOn Ethereum Layer 2 solutions today, every transaction that calls a contract on the network sends a portion of the gas consumed to the sequencer as a fee.\n\nEIP-6969 modifies this slightly by sending a portion of those gas fees to the developer of that smart contract as well.\n\n\u201cWhen you deploy a contract onto the Ethereum network, the address you deployed that contract with would be attached to the contract,\u201d Owocki said. \u201cHowever much execution time EVM spends inside of your smart contract, that\u2019ll be mapped proportionally and a percentage of the fee revenue will return to that address.\u201d\n\nOwocki notes that this new approach offers an opportunity to bridge the gap between Layer 2 solutions in need of more developers, and developers who are seeking avenues for generating revenue.\n\nThe modular architecture of smart contracts on Ethereum\n\nAs Ethereum smart contracts are designed with composability in mind, Owocki believes that EIP-6969 could set up a strong foundation for the evolving open-source infrastructure that can expand the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n\u201cWe have all these open-source lego bricks that exist in the Ethereum ecosystem, I as a hacker could walk into a hackathon and build something in a weekend that would have taken a bank 15 years ago $100 million to build because I can get so much software off the shelf,\u201d he said. \u201cSo with EIP-6969, we really wanted to respect that modular architecture of the EVM.\u201d\n\nThis means that revenue will not just be given to a smart contract at the top execution level, but as you go down the stack, each contractor that has contributed to modifying the code will be given a portion of the revenue.\n\n\u201cWhat this does is it incentivizes the creation of infrastructure, because people who might not have a business model right now are all of a sudden going to get more and more revenue as more people use their deployed version of [the smart contract],\u201d he said.\n\nEvery time an infrastructure is used, the gas fee trickles down to everyone who had participated in building the infrastructure, creating a reward loop that incentivizes more people to maintain open-source infrastructure.\n\nTimelines and execution\n\nCSR currently exists in the Canto ecosystem, Owocki notes. In the EVM ecosystem, the next step will be to wait for the EIP to be accepted by the community so that the development team can create a canonical spec for how it would operate in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nOnce that is complete, Owocki said that the next step would be to work with L2s to implement it into their ecosystems. This is expected to happen within the next six months.\n\n\u201cThe reason why we can move faster on this is because we\u2019re deploying it to layer twos,\u201d he notes. \u201cThis is not a specification that is meant for the Ethereum mainnet. Ethereum mainnet needs to be credibly neutral, and it needs to be capture resistant. I think it\u2019s very important to prototype this on layer twos where the stakes are lower.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Global payments giant Visa has deployed experimental smart contracts on Ethereum\u2019s Goerli testnet to pilot gasless transactions through account abstraction.\n\nThe two sets of smart contracts, dubbed Paymaster, will simplify user interaction with the Ethereum network by performing complex tasks and managing transaction costs on behalf of other accounts.\n\nVisa Tests Paymaster for Frictionless Transactions\n\nAccount abstraction is a proposal to increase flexibility in the management and behavior of Ethereum accounts by separating the control of an account from its associated private key, allowing it to be controlled by a smart contract. The mechanism is enabled by ERC-4337, a new Ethereum standard launched in March.\n\nVisa seeks to leverage the ERC-4337 standard to implement an intermediary currency conversion service. The first version of the Paymaster contract explores whether users can pay transaction fees with alternative tokens like dollar-pegged stablecoins or central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).\n\nThe contract can collect any ERC-20 token from users and convert them into ether (ETH) based on the current exchange rate to pay for gas fees on the users\u2019 behalf, thus removing the need to acquire ETH only for transaction fees.\n\n\u201cThis sample contract contains the governing logic for both the Paymaster and its custom ERC-20 token. To this contract, we introduced an allowlist and a function to update the token-to-ETH conversion rate. This allowed us to better simulate real-life conditions where the exchange rate between ETH and a token is dynamic,\u201d Visa said in a report.\n\nEnabling Gasless Transactions\n\nThe payments giant believes the Paymaster concept can incentivize adoption by allowing users to only fund the gas cost at the time of the transaction without any pre-funding requirements to optimize their cash-flow management.\n\nThe second Paymaster contract seeks to eliminate the need for users to cover gas fees by themselves, just like in web2 peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions, by using a solution proffered by account abstraction, which allows third parties, such as fintech wallet providers, to handle the costs.\n\nIn this case, the third parties can act as Paymasters, completely sponsoring transaction fees for users. The experiments are based on the starter code provided by the Ethereum Foundation and ERC-4337 core team.\n\nWe tested two core user operations: 1) paying with ERC-20 tokens using ERC-4337 Paymaster; 2) Sponsoring transaction fees for users (aka gasless txs) with ERC-4337 Paymaster \u2014 Catherine Gu (@catgu_) May 17, 2023"

The whale's most recent transaction was recorded about six hours prior, and it's the same transaction in which the 4,032 ETH stake was made.\n\nWhether this activity is indicative of a larger trend among Ethereum ICO participants, or an isolated event, only time will tell."

Their actions just happen to also be at the expense of everybody else. In the traditional finance world, this activity would likely be a clear-cut case of illegal behavior, but legalities are not as well-defined in decentralized finance. Not yet, anyway.\n\nOn a recent Bell Curve podcast, host Mike Ippolito spoke to Blockworks about the tweeted observations of a recent MEV exploit from steward and product lead at Flashbots, Robert Miller. This particular bot, going by the dubious moniker, jaredfromsubway.eth, has been highly successful with a technique referred to as a \u201csandwich attack.\u201d\n\nA sandwich attack consists of two rapid swaps surrounding a victim\u2019s trade. It begins with an innocent trader sending their order to the public mempool, at which point the bot \u2014 always searching \u2014 spots its opportunity.\n\nThe attack begins with a frontrun, followed up by an attack on the backend of the selected trade, hence the term \u201csandwich.\u201d In an example posted by Miller, the bot exploits pepe (PEPE) trades with ether (ETH).\n\nThe frontrun, Miller explains, sells the attacker\u2019s pepe for ether. This causes the price of ether to climb immediately before the targeted trade is initiated. The victim then swaps their pepe for ether, receiving less than they should expect due to the price hike caused by the bot.\n\nFollowing this, the bot promptly sells ether back for the memecoin, which is now cheaper because of the victim\u2019s sell order.\n\nIn this particular example of a brief moment of exploitation, the bot gains 0.04 ETH and 300 memecoins, unbeknownst to the hapless victim. It might not sound like much, but it\u2019s happening constantly, netting the bot millions of dollars over the past few weeks.\n\nExtremely good at sniping\n\nIppolito says this particular bot is highly effective because it \u201ctakes a very different approach.\u201d It starts with a large supply of a token \u2014 in this case, pepe \u2014 so \u201cthere\u2019s just much less competition.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe reason why more bots don\u2019t do that is just because warehousing becomes very difficult,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t really want to hold a whole bunch of your assets in something that\u2019s as volatile as something like pepe, because any profits that you get from the sandwiching could be offset by declines from the memecoin basically failing.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I guess jaredfromsubway is extremely good at sniping.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the bot is especially effective at \u201csniping,\u201d suspiciously snapping up a large supply of pepe within ten minutes of it being deployed. This lucrative acquisition allowed it to have the required inventory for its MEV strategy.\n\nOne way to avoid becoming a victim of attacks of this nature is to change a wallet\u2019s RPC (remote procedure call) to Flashbots\u2019 Protect RPC solution. The tool diverts transaction orders from the public to a protected mempool. From there, it privately transmits transactions, rendering them invisible to bots, thus eliminating the possibility of such attacks.\n\nOn a positive note, co-founder of Framework Ventures, Vance Spencer, suggests the recent ramp-up in MEV activity is a good sign for the market, noting that \u201cMEV is turning back on.\u201d\n\nMichael Anderson of Framework Ventures agrees, noting that the level of engagement on pepe indicates \u201cgreen shoots\u201d out of the bear market and the possibility of finally \u201cmoving past it.\u201d\n\nFor good or bad, \u201cMEV is gonna be a benefactor for all of that.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Well, the past week had some exciting developments to offer, at least in certain segments of the market. The broader capitalization barely increased by around $5 billion, currently standing shy of $1.2 trillion. This came on the back of a relatively flat performance of major cryptocurrencies, but some altcoins managed to surprise. Let\u2019s dive in.\n\nIt\u2019s been a back-and-forth with Bitcoin this week. The cryptocurrency was trading at around $26,500 this time last week and managed to increase to around $27,500 a few days later. It plunged back below $27K, only to test $27,500 again on Thursday. The bears weren\u2019t having it, though, and made another decisive swing down, putting BTC\u2019s price where it\u2019s currently trading at around $26,800, booking a slight increase of 1.3%.\n\nEthereum is also trading for a 2% increase on the weekly, followed by Cardano (ADA), MATIC, DOT, and TRX \u2013 all of which managed to book similar gains.\n\nBut that\u2019s where things get more exciting.\n\nRipple\u2019s XRP increased by around 8% in the past seven days, positioning it as the clear leader within the top 10 cryptocurrencies by means of total market cap. The reasons are probably two-fold. The judge presiding over the case against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ruled against the agency\u2019s motion to seal a certain record of former director Bill Hinman. Investors perceived this as bullish for XRP as it might have a positive impact on the outcome of the case. Ripple also entered a deal to acquire Metaco \u2013 a Swiss-based crypto custodian, for $250 million.\n\nAlicia Bakery CMO - A really good agency Did you like this market update?\n\nThis is all you need not to miss any price action in the raging crypto markets.

The memecoin that\u2019s taken center stage in the cryptocurrency industry is up some 17% in the past week, leading the memecoin sector by a considerable margin. There\u2019s no telling why PEPE is up but as with anything meme-related, it could be any number of reasons. It\u2019s very interesting to see if it will maintain its position, though.\n\nIn any case, it remains very interesting to see how the market will shape in the following days and if XRP will continue on its positive trajectory.\n\nMarket Data\n\nMarket Cap: $1,169B | 24H Vol: $34B | BTC Dominance: 44.4%\n\nBTC: $26,829 (+1.3%) | ETH: $1,810 (+2%) | BNB: $309 (+1.1%)\n\nWe Asked ChatGPT Which 5 Cryptos Will Survive in 10 Years: The Answer Might Surprise You.

After studying Account Abstraction to enable secure automatic recurring payments for self-custodial wallets, Visa explores how gas fees can be redesigned using Account Abstraction on Ethereum.\n\nVisa Explores Account Abstraction On Ethereum For Crypto Payments\n\nAccording to a recently published article \u201cRethinking Digital Transactions with Account Abstraction,\u201d Visa is studying Ethereum account abstraction and proposal ERC-4337 for digital payments.\n\nadvertisement\n\nVisa has deployed two sets of Paymaster contracts on the Ethereum Goerli testnet, showing how to redesign gas fees on the blockchain to improve user convenience. ERC-4337 makes it possible for an owner to directly own smart contract accounts. In fact, Account Abstraction and Ethereum Virtual Machine compatibility offer more advantages for end users.\n\nGuy Sheffield, head of crypto at Visa, took to Twitter to share the deployment of the first paymaster smart contract on the Ethereum testnet.\n\nBlockchain expert Cygaar noted that the Visa team created a paymaster contract that first gets the ETH exchange rate to the ERC20 token (L110) and then transfers that amount of ERC20 tokens to itself (L112). In the next experiment, a paymaster contract was set up to completely cover gas fees for user transactions.\n\nAlso Read: Do Kwon and Terraform Labs Withdraw Millions A Year After Terra-LUNA Crisis\n\nEthereum Creator Vitalik Buterin On Account Abstraction\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin claimed gas fees Account Abstraction is \u201csomething we\u2019ve always wanted\u201d and that it has \u201cfor a long time been a dream of the Ethereum developer community.\u201d\n\nVitalik Buterin recommends crypto investors using social recovery wallets and multi-signature wallets to achieve self-custody of crypto funds.\n\nWith the ERC-4337 account abstraction and upcoming smart contracts wallets like Soul Wallet, wallet security will improve. Vitalik Buterin proposes to use social recovery for hot wallets that store a small portion of a person or organization\u2019s funds, and multisigs for cold wallets that store a person or organization\u2019s savings.\n\nAlso Read: Binance Brings Back Zero-Fee Trading For Bitcoin, SHIB, PEPE, Other Crypto"

Data from The Block revealed a 113% increment in the count of daily active addresses on the chain.\n\nAssessed on a month-over-month (MoM) basis, Solana recorded a total of 7.72 million active addresses in April. Interestingly, with about two weeks left to go in May, the chain has already seen 7 million active addresses.\n\nAdditionally, data from The Block showed that new address count on the chain has grown significantly since the end of April.\n\nNew users flock in\n\nIn May, Solana witnessed the creation of 4.19 million new addresses, surpassing the count of 3.76 million new addresses that joined the network in April.\n\nThis surge in new address creation on the L1 network highlights the growing adoption of the platform amid high transaction fees on the Ethereum and Bitcoin networks.\n\nHowever, while Solana\u2019s network activity has experienced growth since the end of April, data from Artemis revealed a decline in other ecosystem metrics.\n\nFor example, according to the on-chain data, the network\u2019s total value locked (TVL) was on a downtrend since 19 April. At $269.78 million at press time, it has since fallen by 8%.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s SOL\u2019s market cap in BTC terms\n\nLikewise, the decentralized exchanges (DEXes) housed within the L1 network suffered a drop in transaction volume since the month started. Per data from Artemis, DEX volume on Solana has plummeted by 66% since the beginning of May.\n\nRegarding the chain\u2019s native coin SOL, trading at $20.73 at press time, its value declined by double digits (17%) in the last month."

        "content": "Moves from Grayscale Investments and Bitwise Asset Management to pause planned ether futures ETFs came after the SEC asked them to do so, according to two sources directly familiar with the matter.\n\nIndustry participants told Blockworks that concerns around current ether futures liquidity levels, as well as a lack of clarity on whether ether is considered a security or a commodity, are possible rationales.\n\nGrayscale, one of the crypto industry\u2019s largest and most prominent asset managers, moved last week to register a planned ether (ETH) futures product with the SEC. The firm \u2014 known for its $17.2 billion Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) \u2014 reversed course this week.\n\nRead more: Grayscale, Bitwise Pumping Brakes on ETH Futures Plans\n\nGrayscale\u2019s pullback appears to have started a trend amongst its competitors, per a Blockworks\u2019 review of SEC filings and the two sources familiar with the matter.\n\nThat trend: SEC representatives have told involved parties that the US regulator is still not yet ready to approve such products. The SEC oversees ETFs domiciled in the ETF, while the CFTC regulates crypto future trading products.\n\nDirexion follows Grayscale, Bitwise\u2019s lead\n\nFund manager Direxion became the latest to request rescinding its proposal to launch an Ether Strategy ETF, according to an SEC filing on Thursday. Direxion has nearly 80 ETFs trading in the US with combined assets under management of roughly $26.4 billion, according to ETF.com.\n\nThe two sources told Blockworks this week that the SEC has recently asked a number of top would-be issuers to pull their public filings for ether futures ETFs \u2014 requesting for firms to discuss the proposals confidentially with the regulator.\n\nBoth sources were granted anonymity to discuss sensitive business dealings. The SEC did not return a request for comment.\n\nThe Direxion filing came a day after Bitwise submitted a request to withdraw the application for its Ethereum Strategy ETF to the SEC. This would have invested primarily in cash-settled, front-month ETH futures contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).\n\nAn amended filing by Grayscale, dated Wednesday, indicated the crypto-focused asset manager was moving forward with ETF launch plans that did not include its previously filed-for Ethereum Futures ETF.\n\nSpokespeople for Grayscale and Bitwise declined to comment. Direxion did not return a request for comment.\n\nValkyrie Investments and Roundhill Investments also filed for ether futures ETFs last week. A Valkyrie representative declined to comment on its plans, while Roundhill Investments could not immediately be reached.\n\nSEC not ready?\n\nThe SEC approved bitcoin futures ETFs in 2021. But Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at fund group VanEck, told Blockworks the CME ether futures market is not yet liquid enough to support an ETF.\n\nVanEck has previously filed for a bitcoin ETF. It also filed for an ether futures ETF in 2021 before withdrawing the application just days later. ProShares did the same, though the fund group launched the first bitcoin futures ETF a couple months later.\n\n\u201cBecause of the SEC\u2019s previous haphazard approach to a bitcoin ETF, we\u2019ve already spent considerable time and resources filing and re-filing applications in hopes the timing would align to allow us first to market with a physical bitcoin ETF,\u201d Sigel said. \u201cHowever since the case against ETH futures ETF is quite clear from a liquidity perspective, we figured in this case, why bother?\u201d\n\nThe average daily volume for CME ether futures last month clocked in at 5,580 contracts, according to CME Group data.\n\nThat substantially trailed the average daily volume of 9,713 contracts for bitcoin futures over that same period. Open interest for ether futures and bitcoin futures during the month: 3,578 and contracts and 13,412 contracts, respectively.\n\nSigel added that ETH futures liquidity levels would likely have to more than double before the regulator would approve an ether futures fund.\n\nBeyond ether liquidity\n\nLiquidity might not be the only issue the SEC has with the ether futures ETF proposals.\n\nBryan Armour, director of passive strategies research at Morningstar, said he believes any read of the SEC\u2019s disinterest in approving an ether futures ETF is \u201cconjecture\u201d at this point.\n\n\u201cBitcoin has advantages over ether in terms of its integration into the financial system as a payment method \u2026 and its deeper liquidity,\u201d he told Blockworks in an email on Thursday. \u201cBut the main point of contention for the SEC may be its uncertain classification of ether as a commodity or security.\u201d\n\nWhile the CFTC considers ether to be a commodity, SEC Chair Gensler has said he believes most crypto assets, excluding bitcoin, are securities.\n\nEther\u2019s qualification as a commodity came into question after Ethereum moved from a proof-of-work model to proof of stake last year, Armour said.\n\n\u201cStaking could change the outcome of the Howey Test, which the SEC uses to determine what qualifies as an investment contract,\u201d he said. \u201cMy expectation is that the SEC needs more time to get comfortable with its classification before approving Ethereum-related ETFs.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Asking one of the most advanced A.I systems for its analysis on the future price of Ethereum (ETH), ChatGPT predicted a value of $3,500 by the end of 2023. However, the true question is if HedgeUp (HDUP) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) will hit $1 as that would mean a much larger ROI for investors.\n\nThe Bold Ethereum (ETH) Prediction \u2013 Is It Reliable?\n\nCan we trust that ChatGPT\u2019s prediction of Ethereum (ETH) at $3,500 by 2023 is reliable? The question remains difficult to answer as the cryptocurrency market is unpredictable and subject to many external factors.\n\nThe success of Ethereum (ETH) is dependent on its network\u2019s ability to progress, its adoption rate, and the demand by investors. It is also important to consider if Ethereum (ETH) can stay ahead of its competitors. Ethereum (ETH) is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap so its future success is certainly worth considering.\n\nEthereum (ETH) reaching $3,500 is possible as the ATH has been above that and if a bull run is expected Ethereum (ETH) could reach that price. Ethereum (ETH) recently upgraded and there is a growing demand for the Ethereum network, so the prediction of ChatGPT could be accurate and reliable.\n\nIt is also worth noting that Ethereum (ETH) has already seen an impressive increase in its price over the past few months and could continue to trend upward as more investors buy into cryptocurrencies.\n\nHedgeUp (HDUP) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) \u2013 An Analysis By Humans\n\nAlthough it\u2019s interesting to use ChatGPT for price predictions, a more accurate analysis of HedgeUp (HDUP) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) must be done by humans. That\u2019s because HedgeUp (HDUP) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are unique cryptos that are new to the market and are still in their early stages.\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) \u2013 Meme-Based Momentum?\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) was created in 2020 and has been gaining a lot of attention recently due to its meme-based marketing campaign and its large community. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently trading at $0.000008743. So, Shiba Inu (SHIB) reaching $1 is unlikely. Shiba Inu (SHIB) does not have the fundamentals for sustainable growth. The only way Shiba Inu (SHIB) reaches $1 is if investors get lucky and it skyrockets for no obvious reason.\n\nHedgeUp (HDUP) \u2013 An Emerging Hero For Investors\n\nAs a more sound investment opportunity, HedgeUp (HDUP) has the potential to reach $1. This is because the platform is built on blockchain technology and uses NFTs. HedgeUp (HDUP) is also backed by physical alternative assets, like fine art, commodities, and collectibles. These investments are more likely to give consistent returns in the long run.\n\nSo, as early investors of HedgeUp (HDUP), as more people enter the platform, the price could rise dramatically and reach the $1 mark. The 30% presale bonus gives a headstart to early investors, so there could be a lot of growth potential.\n\nFind out more about the HedgeUp (HDUP) presale here:\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "The Quantum Threat To Cryptocurrency: How QRL's Quantum-Safe Blockchain Technology Could Be Poised To ... - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "CHEYENNE, WY / ACCESSWIRE / May 19, 2023 / Cryptographic protocols that secure networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum are - for the time being - impervious to even the most advanced computers. However, imagine a near-future scenario where computers have advanced to such a level that current cryptographic standards become insufficient.\n\nThe Quantum Resistance Corporation, Friday, May 19, 2023, Press release picture\n\nThis potential danger arises from quantum computers, a cutting-edge technology that has the potential to compromise many of the encryption protocols used in cryptocurrencies today. Although quantum computers are in their infancy and not yet powerful enough to do so, experts predict that, if current trends continue, they could threaten blockchain networks by 2030.\n\nQuantum Resistant Ledger ( QRL ) aims to address this doomsday threat as the world's first post-quantum store of value and decentralized communication network to proactively tackle the threat of advanced quantum computing. The following article will deep dive into the nature of the quantum threat, and explain how QRL could be positioned to transform the industry by providing a post-quantum solution.\n\nThe Quantum Threat to Cryptocurrency\n\nBefore delving into how QRL offers a solution to the quantum threat to cryptocurrency , it is important to understand how quantum computers work and the current risks associated with popular blockchains such as Ethereum and Bitcoin.\n\nWhat Is Quantum Computing?\n\nQuantum computers are a type of supercomputer with far superior processing power than classical computers. They are able to carry out many computations while simultaneously considering several different configurations - this makes them exponentially faster than traditional computers.\n\nOver the past few years, quantum computing has shown significant progress in various fields, including AI, weather forecasting and medical research. However, in the wrong hands, quantum computing has the potential to pose a substantial risk to cybersecurity, and consequently, to cryptocurrencies as well.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor example, Google's 54-qubit Sycamore processor completed a computation in 200 seconds that would have taken the most powerful classical computer in the world 10,000 years . According to a report by IBM , in theory, cryptographic protocols can be solved within a few hours with quantum computers.\n\nTypes of Quantum Attacks\n\nBroadly speaking, traditional cryptocurrencies face two primary types of threats, which are:\n\nStorage Attacks: An attack that targets individual wallet addresses, trying to break their security and steal the cryptocurrency stored in them.\n\nTransit Attacks: An attack that focuses on taking control of all transactions happening in real-time on the network.\n\nVulnerabilities of Existing Cryptocurrencies\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum, the world's two largest cryptocurrencies, account for almost 60% of the industry's total market capitalization. Bitcoin as an asset functions like digital gold, providing a decentralized, immutable and secure store of value. Conversely, Ethereum is like a publicly shared computer network that enables developers to create applications on decentralized servers.\n\nWhen it comes to storage attacks, Ethereum is at a higher risk than Bitcoin. A recent Deloitte study revealed that about 65% of all Ether is vulnerable to quantum attacks, significantly more than the 25% of vulnerable Bitcoin.\n\nTransit attacks, though more severe, are also more challenging to execute. According to Mark Webber at the University of Sussex in the U.K., breaking this level of encryption would reportedly require a quantum computer with 1.9 billion qubits of power.\n\nThis number is staggering, especially when compared to IBM's most advanced quantum computer, which has only 127 qubits in comparison. Ethereum's creator, Vitalik Buterin, tweeted in 2019 that current speculations about quantum computing are as distant from real quantum computing as hydrogen bombs are from nuclear fusion. But rapid advancements in AI-assisted technology could be changing the outlook and accelerating the quantum timeline.\n\nQRL's Quantum-Safe Blockchain Technology\n\nTraditional cryptographic methods such as RSA and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) rely on computational complexity for security. However, this model is an ineffective long-term solution since quantum computers can solve these methods. QRL says it solves this vulnerability by creating cryptography based on problems that are believed to be resistant to quantum attacks, providing enhanced security in the quantum era.\n\nOne of the key components of QRL's cryptography is the eXtended Merkle Signature Scheme (XMSS). This is a unique mathematical function that is designed to allow for secure and efficient transaction authentication when taking into account the trends of quantum computers.\n\nIn addition to securing transactions, QRL leverages advanced techniques such as on-chain lattice key storage and layer-to-internode communication to secure communications on the blockchain.\n\nThe Road Ahead For QRL And The Cryptocurrency Industry?\n\nOverall, although the advent of quantum technology raises concerns, the ongoing development of cryptographic encryption has the potential to surpass the progress of quantum computing.\n\nAs quantum computing remains in its nascent stages, investors and centralized organizations have the opportunity to transition to quantum-resistant cryptography. The situation is much different for decentralized blockchain technology, which post-quantum security analysts insist has a fatal and fundamentally unfixable flaw . QRL doesn't have this problem, they maintain. In any case, QRL seems to be at the vanguard of the post-quantum security frontier and well-positioned to offer a safe way for transactions and communications in a post-quantum world.\n\nFeatured Photo by Sunil Ray on Unsplash\n\nContact:\n\nMike Zeiger\n\n4d5a@theqrc.com\n\nSOURCE: The Quantum Resistance Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\nView source version on accesswire.com:\n\nhttps://www.accesswire.com/756041/The-Quantum-Threat-To-Cryptocurrency-How-QRLs-Quantum-Safe-Blockchain-Technology-Could-Be-Poised-To-Revolutionize-The-Industry\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "Spotlight Wire\n\nSpotlight Wire\n\nThe crypto industry is constantly growing, redefining the very concept of financial assets. Decentralised Finance (DeFi) is coming into the spotlight, and with its accessibility, affordability, and convenience, it\u2019s no surprise to see why.Blockchain networks are the heart of cryptocurrency, and DeFi blockchains offer several altcoins the support they need. Meanwhile, the industry is also welcoming new DeFi cryptocurrencies like Big Eyes Coin (BIG) , which is wrapping up its iconic presale to launch very soon.Do Big Eyes have what it takes to take over the top DeFi blockchains like Ethereum and Avalanche? Read on to find out.Launched in 2014, the Ethereum network is the founder\u2019s solution to Bitcoin\u2019s inability to attach real-world assets to its blockchain and its need for a robust language to carry this process out. Ethereum has since grown to accommodate 1589 tokens, and its native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), is now the second largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalisation.Ethereum provides a highly versatile platform for building decentralised applications using the Solidity programming language and Ethereum Virtual Machine. Developers who create smart contracts on Ethereum benefit from a mature ecosystem of developer tools and best practices.The platform\u2019s maturity also reflects in the user experience, with user-friendly wallets such as MetaMask, Argent, and Rainbow, enabling easy interaction with the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts. The extensive user base of Ethereum motivates developers to deploy their applications on the network, solidifying Ethereum\u2019s position as the leading platform for DeFi and NFTs.Avalanche started in 2018 as a protocol to solve the issue of unreliable machine crashes. Later, it was developed by a research team. They made a start-up company that would meet the finance industry\u2019s needs. The company introduced its native token AVAX in 2020.The Avalanche network boasts several advantages. The maximum supply of AVAX coins is 720 million, but AVAX holders who vote to adjust the reward for adding a new block to the Avalanche blockchain determine the coin creation rate. Transaction fees vary depending on transaction type and network congestion, and all fees are burned to reduce the number of coins in circulation.AVAX fees are subject to change based on user voting. Transactions on the Avalanche blockchain are confirmed using a unique method requiring random network participant subsets to confirm transactions. Network participants can earn more AVAX rewards for processing transactions by maintaining high uptime and fast response times.For a while now, the brand new DeFi meme coin, Big Eyes (BIG), has created quite a stir with its presale . This was no ordinary feat, as BIG has managed to break the presale record of Ether itself. And launching on the 15th of June, BIG is preparing to take over Ethereum\u2019s network as an ERC-20 token.What makes the Big Eyes Coin goal plausible? It boasts an ecosystem free from buying, selling, and trading tax. The supply is limited to 200 billion tokens, but 75% will be available on launch and locked in a liquidity pool to provide stability and liquidity to the token. In other words, remember how Bitcoin\u2019s price skyrocketed when there was high demand but limited supply?But this isn\u2019t just about making a fortune. Big Eyes Coin has set aside 5% of its supply to create a charity wallet that supports ocean sanctuaries. A cat has got to eat. The good intentions come from a passionate community that powers this paw-dorable coin. This is evident from their ever-so-happening Twitter handle and the 26,000-member Telegram group But that\u2019s not all. Their roadmap includes projects that cater to the broader investor base. There is an NFT Space, the Sushi Crew, under development.As they wrap up their presale on the 3rd of June, Big Eyes Coin has one last trick up its sleeve. Until the end of the presale, the team is selling BIG tokens for its Stage 3 price, which is only $0.00017 per token. Go BIG, or go home with Big Eyes!Big Eyes Coin flaunts unmatched potential with its plethora of features and offerings. With a track record of collecting over $38.3 million in the presale stage, it is on its way to taking over the best DeFi blockchains. Try Big Eyes Coin to be a part of the next BIG thing in the crypto world."

        "title": "Best Cross-Chain Bridges in Crypto - DailyCoin",
        "content": "Cross-chain bridges are an essential instrument in your DeFi toolbox. As the cryptocurrency industry expands at a dizzying rate, being able to shift your funds across different blockchain networks securely helps you explore new ecosystems easily.\n\nDespite what the maxis tell you, no one chain will rule them all. There are hundreds of different networks in the Web3 world, each with its unique identity and decentralized applications.\n\nStaying fixated on just one chain, like Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH), will significantly limit your opportunities within the crypto market. The need for interoperability between networks has never been higher.\n\nWhat exactly are cross-chain bridges, and why should I use them? Are blockchain bridges safe?\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll explain why bridging between blockchain ecosystems is such a valuable skill and why cross-chain interoperability is so important for the growth of the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nWhat Is a Cross-Chain Bridge?\n\nA cross-chain bridge is a blockchain-based application that allows users to transfer digital assets and data from one network to another. For example, you can bridge ETH tokens from the Ethereum mainnet to the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), which has lower gas fees.\n\nIn the true spirit of DeFi (decentralized finance), crypto bridges are permissionless, meaning anyone with a crypto wallet can access them and transfer tokens without being intercepted by centralized authorities.\n\nMost bridges use a \u2018Lock and Release\u2019 function, similar to how wrapped crypto assets like wBTC work.\n\nImagine each blockchain is an island. When you initiate a token transfer, you deposit cryptocurrency onto the bridge from one side. The bridge application locks your deposit into its wide liquidity pool and releases an equal number of the same tokens to your wallet on the destination chain, or new island.\n\nWhile it may sound surprising, the same token can exist simultaneously on multiple networks. An easier way to think of it is to imagine apps in a mobile phone. Underneath the hood are slight differences between the Twitter app on Android and the Twitter app on iOS. However, the average end user isn\u2019t bothered by the technicalities.\n\nWhy Would I Want to Use a Cross-Chain Bridge?\n\nUsing various networks is a great way to learn about blockchain technology and its use cases. While the Ethereum network has far more dApps than other chains, every blockchain has its own thriving ecosystem, with exclusive applications, tokens, and NFTs.\n\nUser experience varies from chain to chain, with some networks being much more affordable than others. For example, the Ethereum blockchain is plagued with scalability issues. A token swap might cost upwards of $50 in transaction fees, while the same swap on Polygon would only cost you a few cents.\n\nBridging tokens to emerging chains is another excellent way to qualify for crypto airdrops. Sending a handful of ETH tokens and interacting with a handful of smart contracts on Arbitrum netted some users thousands of dollars worth of ARBI.\n\nBest Cross-Chain Bridges\n\nNow that you\u2019re clued up on why bridging over to exciting new blockchains is worthwhile pursuit, let\u2019s take a look at some of the best cross-chain bridges in crypto. While there are hundreds of directional bridges and cross-chain swaps, it\u2019s essential to know what to look for.\n\nThe top cross-chain crypto bridges should provide the following:\n\nA good variety of networks and tokens.\n\nSecure transfer of assets.\n\nAn easy-to-use interface.\n\nLet\u2019s see who made the list!\n\n1. Synapse\n\nThe Synapse Bridge is one of the most trusted cross-chain bridges in the crypto space. With a simplified UI that resembles a basic DEX (decentralized exchange) and over one million users, Synapse protocol is a popular choice for first-time bridges.\n\nThe platform offers a wide variety of ERC-20 token standards and EVM-compatible blockchain networks. What\u2019s great about Synapse is that it also supports several popular stablecoins, like USDT and USDC.\n\nSynapse also converts a small percentage of your transfer to the destination chain\u2019s native cryptocurrency. For example, when you bridge to the BSC, a smart contract in the dApp automatically provides you with a small amount of BNB to pay the first few gas fees as you explore the chain.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nUser-friendly design.\n\nMillions of users.\n\nFast transfer of assets.\n\nOffers staking.\n\nSupported networks: Ethereum, Arbitrum, Avalanche, BNB Chain, Optimism, Polygon, Aurora, Boba, Canto, Cronos, DFK Chain, DogeChain, Fantom, Harmony, Klaytn, Metis, Moonbeam, Moonriver.\n\n2. Portal (Wormhole)\n\nThe Portal bridge is the epitome of interoperability. While most other bridges are limited to transfers between EVM-compatible networks, Portal takes things one step further.\n\nWith Portal, crypto enthusiasts can bridge digital assets between alternative Layer-1 blockchains that don\u2019t use an EVM. These include popular PoS (Proof-of-Stake) chains like Aptos and NEAR. This gives experienced chain-hoppers greater flexibility than other cross-chain bridges and opens immense opportunities.\n\nIf that wasn\u2019t enough, Portal also supports NFT bridging. Like wrapped tokens, tokens can be locked and minted on other chains. A famous example of this was when HGE.SOL, a Solana NFT whale, fractionalized and bridged 50 cryptopunks to the Solana blockchain.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nSupports transfers between EVM and non-EVM networks.\n\nBridge ERC-721 tokens (NFTs).\n\nSupported networks: Acala, Algorand, Aptos, Arbitrum, Aurora, Avalanche, BNB Chain, Celo, Ethereum, Fantom, Injective, Karura, Klaytn, Moonbeam, NEAR, Oasis, Optimism, Polygon, SUI, Terra, XPLA.\n\n3. Multichain (formerly Anyswap)\n\nPreviously known as Anyswap, Multichain truly lives up to its old name. This cross-chain bridge offers the widest breadth of networks of any application in the crypto space.\n\nWithin Multichain\u2019s spread of 92 different blockchains are the classic chains we all know and love, with a multitude of other networks most people haven\u2019t even heard of.\n\nMultichain also supports NFT wrapping and bridging, as well as cross-chain swaps and staking services. If Multichain had one fault, its user experience is comparatively sluggish and unintuitive.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nThe crypto industry\u2019s range of integrated networks.\n\nNFT wrapping and bridging.\n\nPopular supported networks: Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, Arbitrum, Fantom, Optimism, Cardano, Solana, Aptos, NEAR, Moonbeam, Cronos, Telos, Fuse, Litecoin, Bitcoin.\n\n4. Polygon Bridge\n\nWhile the Polygon bridge has far fewer integrations than other members of this prestigious list, it brings its own X factor. Designed by Polygon Labs, the Polygon Bridge is explicitly built for products and services within its native ecosystem.\n\nIt enables users to bridge cryptocurrencies like ETH, MATIC, and popular stablecoins between the Ethereum mainnet and the Polygon sidechain. Most importantly, it is the first official application with a bi-directional bridge to the Polygon zkEVM chain.\n\nLike everything built by Polygon Labs, the Polygon Bridge has been designed with simplicity and mass adoption in mind and boasted a beginner-friendly interface.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nAccessible user interface.\n\nOfficial access to Polygon zkEVM.\n\nSupported networks: Ethereum, Polygon, Polygon zkEVM.\n\n5. Avalanche Bridge\n\nDesigned by AvaLabs and Core, the Avalanche Bridge serves various functions. Not only does it facilitate the transfer of assets between the Avalanche C-Chain and other networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum, but it\u2019s also used internally within the Avalanche ecosystem.\n\nWhat many users don\u2019t understand about Avalanche is that the network is comprised of three separate blockchains, X-Chain, P-Chain, and C-Chain. While most DeFi and NFT enthusiasts are only interested in the C-Chain, blockchain engineers often use the other two chains for development.\n\nAvalanche bridge developers expect to introduce further support for more ERC-20 tokens in the future.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nOfficial bridge of the Avalanche Ecosystem.\n\nConnects users to internal Avalanche chains.\n\nSupported Chains: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Avalanche C-Chain, and other internal chains.\n\nWhat Happened to Binance Bridge?\n\nUntil recently, the Binance Bridge was one of the industry\u2019s largest and most popular cross-chain bridges. It appears that the Binance Bridge is either currently unavailable or discontinued.\n\nThe most recent publication from Binance mentioning their bridge indicates that an updated V2 bridge was rolled out in March 2020. However, visiting the application encourages users to either transfer tokens internally through the Binance exchange or use an alternative platform.\n\nBinance recommends using AnySwap, which rebranded to Multichain in 2021.\n\nAre Crypto Bridges Safe?\n\nFor all the wonder and excitement that cross-chain bridges bring, there are some risks. Blockchain bridges are notoriously complicated at an architectural level, making them a common target for hacks and exploits. In fact, over $1.4 billion was stolen through crypto bridge hacks in 2022.\n\nBridge hacks are devastating, with some networks never truly recovering from a catastrophic attack. Since hackers drained the Harmony Horizon bridge and disappeared with over $100 million in crypto, the Harmony network has struggled to recapture its former glory.\n\nEven the most popular and reputable bridges are liable to make mistakes, and blockchain security audits always look good until a malicious hacker finds a chink in the code.\n\nTo keep yourself safe in the crypto space and protect your funds, you should always revoke any approvals confirmed in your wallet after using a bridge. This only takes a couple of seconds with sites like Revoke.cash, and might protect you from getting your entire crypto portfolio stolen in a bridge hack.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nBridging tokens is a great way to explore dApps and NFT collections on different blockchain networks. However, the Web 3 world is plagued with user experience issues, making this a daunting and intimidating task for first-timers.\n\nBeyond that, bridge hacks are the most common exploit in the crypto space, so please revoke token approvals after bridging to protect your wallet\u2019s integrity.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nThe cryptocurrency industry is growing at a startling pace. The variety of innovative dApps, products, and services in a cross-chain world is staggering and opens a world of opportunity to those willing to explore emerging ecosystems. Many Ethereum NFT maximalists refused to buy DeGods because they couldn\u2019t be bothered bridging to Solana. Today, they\u2019re some of the most valuable NFTs in the market.\n\nFAQs"

The proposal says that users are currently unable to \u201csupply more of those assets, borrow, repay, or withdraw.\u201c\n\nAlthough withdrawals are currently impossible, the team stated that funds are \u201cperfectly safe,\u201d as the bug can be fixed after a governance vote.\n\n.@AaveAave the latest upgrade of ReserveInterestRateStrategy in Aave V2 (Polygon) has caused a temporary halt of the protocol, impacting assets worth ~$110M!\n\nThe root cause is the new ReserveInterestRateStrategy is only compatible with Ethereum, not compatible with Polygon. https://t.co/kg5696QNPo pic.twitter.com/Ze3zSBS8Ck \u2014 BlockSec (@BlockSecTeam) May 19, 2023\n\nThe bug only affects Aave v2 on Polygon. Aave v3 \u2014 the most recent version \u2014 remains unaffected, as do v2 deployments to Ethereum or Avalanche.\n\nThe broken code arose because of a May 16 interest rate curve patch applied to all deployments of v2. The Polygon implementation of v2 uses a slightly different list of function definitions (called an \u201cinterface\u201d) for its rate strategy contracts when compared with the Ethereum and Avalanche implementations. But the interest rate curve changes did not take this difference into account, causing the bug to develop only in the Polygon deployment.\n\nThe new proposal asks Aave\u2019s governing body, Aave DAO, to approve code changes to only the Polygon version to fix the patch. Voting is scheduled to begin on May 20 and will continue until May 23, the proposal stated.\n\nRelated: Aave DAO votes for \u2018rescue plan\u2019 to save lost tokens\n\nAave is most well known for its flash loan feature that allows users to borrow crypto, make trades and pay back the loans within the same block without requiring collateral. It began on Ethereum but has expanded into other networks over the past few years. On April 17, Aave governance voted to deploy the protocol on zkSync Era, a layer-2 Ethereum scaling protocol that uses zero-knowledge proof technology. On May 8, Aave v3 deployed to the Metis network, which is also an Ethereum layer 2."

        "title": "Australian CBDC trials execute first FX transaction - Ledger Insights",
        "content": "Yesterday, blockchain startup CANVAS announced the successful execution of its central bank digital currency (CBDC) trial in Australia, using the eAUD to test foreign exchange (FX) transactions.\n\nTokenized FX settlements hold significant benefits, including round-the-clock trading and instant payments. The test is part of a series of pilots conducted by the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Digital Finance Cooperative Research Center (DFCRC).\n\nDetails of the FX transaction\n\nDuring the trial, the eAUD was exchanged for the USDC stablecoin between DigitalIX and TAF Capital on an Ethereum layer 2 solution. This allowed the transaction to be settled instantaneously without sacrificing privacy, scalability, and regulatory compliance.\n\nAccording to the team, another crucial aspect of their solution is that participants always maintain control and custody of their assets.\n\nKey benefits\n\nThe test also demonstrated the advantages of tokenized settlements compared to traditional FX trading and international remittance networks, including 24/7 trading and atomic (instant) payments. This removes the counterparty risk.\n\n\u201cThe eAUD, as a CBDC, holds the potential to address crucial challenges in both FX and International Remittance Markets such as improving transaction times, reducing fees, and providing more open access,\u201d said David Lavecky, CEO at CANVAS.\n\n\u201cWe believe that CBDCs, Digital Securities and Tokenized Assets will radically transform finance and markets over the next decade. Our use case demonstrates the benefits of using CBDCs in tokenized FX transactions and how our privacy focused Layer 2 blockchain provides improvements over traditional markets by eliminating market inefficiencies, errors, and settlement risks.\u201d\n\nAustralia\u2019s CBDC Pilots\n\nCANVAS\u2019 project is one of 15 selected use cases in the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s CBDC pilot. The list includes major names, such as Mastercard, which will explore the use of eAUD on a public blockchain, as well as others like Intuit, ANZ and Commonwealth Bank. It also involves a wide variety of applications, ranging from offline payments and CBDC custodial models to nature-based asset trading and livestock auctions.\n\nA Layer 2 Ethereum solution\n\nThe public Ethereum blockchain has benefits, such as decentralization and a large user base. However, transparency can be a disadvantage in payments and the core blockchain lacks scalability.\n\nHence, the CANVAS Connect blockchain used for the FX transaction is a Layer 2 ZK-Rolllup scalability solution based on Starkware\u2019s StarkEx, which is used by DeFi platforms such as dYdX and the Sorare fantasy sports platform.\n\nCANVAS was keen to emphasize that it is privacy enabled. All that\u2019s stored on the main Ethereum network is a transaction hash like a fingerprint. At the second layer, only the parties to the transaction can see the details by default. However, CANVAS confirmed permissioned access to the data for regulators and the government for AML purposes.\n\nUnsurprisingly the central bank is using a permissioned blockchain for its CBDC issuance. While StarkEx solutions can be permissioned, CANVAS Connect is an open network targeted at financial services and hence is designed to incorporate KYC and AML."

        "title": "Uniswap Explains How Account Abstraction Can Make Crypto Mainstream - DailyCoin",
        "content": "Uniswap Labs suggests Account Abstraction could propel crypto into the mainstream.\n\nThe EIP-4337 feature can change how users interact with Ethereum.\n\nThe shift will improve user experience, making it more flexible and adaptable.\n\nSince its inception, crypto has been struggling to gain mainstream adoption. However, this could soon change, thanks to a new feature on the Ethereum blockchain. Uniswap Labs recently highlighted Account Abstraction as a transformative feature that could mainstream crypto usage.\n\nOne significant barrier for users that want to use decentralized services has always been their relative complexity. On Thursday, May 18, Uniswap explained how Account Abstraction could enable a more seamless user experience on Ethereum.\n\nWhat Account Abstraction Really Does\n\nWhile Account Abstraction is a relatively new concept introduced in Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4337, it holds significant promise. Fundamentally, the idea makes it easier for people to interact with the network.\n\nWhenever users want to do anything on Ethereum, they have to send crypto from their wallets, sign a transaction and pay a gas fee. The process is complicated, especially for people unfamiliar with crypto.\n\n2/ Currently, users interact with Etheruem using EOAs (externally owned accounts\u2014AKA wallets).\n\n\n\nA crypto vet might be used to the EOA process of signing a new transaction and paying gas every time they connect to an app or do an action\u2014but for normies this process is cumbersome. \u2014 Uniswap Labs \ud83e\udd84 (@Uniswap) May 18, 2023\n\nThis could all change with Account Abstraction. Put simply, Account Abstraction enables smart contract wallets to perform complex operations, and determine how transactions process. Instead of users manually signing transactions and paying fees, smart wallets can do that automatically.\n\nThe use cases for this are many. For instance, it can allow someone else to pay the fee for a transaction. Moreover, one possibility includes helping users recover access to their wallets if they forget their seed phrase.\n\n4/ Some examples of what AA can allow for include:\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcb8 Sponsored transactions\n\n\ud83d\udd13 Seed phrase recovery\n\n\ud83e\udd1d Permissioned controls\n\n\n\nand much, much more. \u2014 Uniswap Labs \ud83e\udd84 (@Uniswap) May 18, 2023\n\nAccount Abstraction makes the process of using Ethereum more straightforward and user-friendly. Consequently, according to Uniswap, this will enable more people to start using crypto.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nWhile a promising idea, it is important to note that Ethereum Account Abstraction is still just in the proposal phase.\n\nWhile reducing the risk of errors, Account Abstraction means that users must trust developers that program these smart wallets. This exposes users to the risk of hacks and rug pulls.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nAccount Abstraction will fundamentally change how users interact with the Ethereum network and beyond. It also holds the promise of bringing crypto to mainstream usage.\n\nRead about the recent Uniswap Labs survey about DeFi adoption:\n\nUniswap Survey Uncovers DeFi Barriers, but Users Keen to Experiment\n\nRead about the recent shifts in the Bitcoin Network:\n\nBitcoin Network Usage Drops, But That May Not Be a Bad Thing"

        "content": "In the Cryptocurrency Market, the one standard rule is to invest what you can afford to lose. This explains why investors are often seen searching for projects that would give them a high return on their investment and not plunder them into ruins.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) has been one of the Cryptos that has seen an upsurge even in the face of the bearish spillover, while the same can not be said of Chainlink (LINK), as it hasn\u2019t performed well since the beginning of the year. However, the sensational crypto on the lips of investors now is Yachtify \u2013 a classic crypto bringing innovation to the crypto world.\n\nYachtify (YCHT): The New Crypto Revolution Introducing a New Dimension to Crypto Market Trading\n\nWith uncertainties surrounding LINK and ETC, investors are already calculating their moves and switching to Yachtify. Yatchtify, which is an investment platform for fractional yacht and boat purchases, aims to decentralize the ownership of private yachts by allowing every investor to own a yacht instead of being an exclusive reserve of the wealthy.\n\nHaving undergone KYC application and successfully audited by SolidProof, Yachtify is aiming to get as many individuals as possible into the yacht investment by allowing them to buy a fraction of the private yacht. Existing owners of a yacht can make a minimum of 25% of their investment for rent so that they can make passive income while still retaining the ownership of the yacht.\n\nTo make things easy, Yachtify has developed a token which is called YCHT that can be used to purchase NFTs that have underlying private yachts. At a presale value of $0.10 per token currently, this represents a viable alternative considering the uncertainties surrounding some cryptocurrencies. Savvy investors are already doing the needful and staking their claims by purchasing the YCHT token. The Yachtify project is going to shake the crypto space when it is launched. Thats why you need to stake your claim on the project now by purchasing the YCHT tokens before the price goes higher.\n\nJoin Presale: https://buy.yachtify.market\n\nWebsite: https://yachtify.market\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/yachtify\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/yachtify_market\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) Consolidates As Price Gains Strength\n\nIn the face of uncertainties and the bad performance of some established cryptocurrencies, Ethereum Classic (ETC) has defied the odds by establishing its superiority over others. In the last 24 hours, Ethereum Classic (ETC) has risen to $18.50, an increase of 1.50% \u2013 signifying Ethereum Classic\u2019s (ETC) readiness to continue to serve its admirers.\n\nHowever, despite this consolidation, the current price of Ethereum Classic (ETC) is still way far beyond its all-time high of $176.16 attained in May 2021. With Ethereum Classic (ETC) circulating supply of 140,831,391 and Ethereum Classic (ETC) market capitalization which is over $2 billion, it remains to be seen whether Ethereum Classic (ETC) will be able to sustain its momentum and appreciate further.\n\n>>>> BUY YACHTIFY TOKENS <<<\n\nInvestors Worry as Chainlink\u2019s (LINK) Recent Slip Continues\n\nInvestors are deeply concerned about the performance of Chainlink (LINK) recently after another week of price decline. The bearish moments have not been kind to Chainlink (LINK), with a 4.59% drop in the last 24 hours, giving the inclination that Chainlink (LINK) may experience bullish movement anytime soon.\n\nAfter showing some partial recovery in early April while selling for $8.72, Chainlink (LINK) price has plummeted to $6.57 as of press time. Investors are worried that Chainlink (LINK) may have to go on a massive momentum to get back on track.

        "title": "Ganache Blockchain: All you need to Know - Blockchain Council",
        "content": "Difference between Ganache and Truffle\n\nGanache and Truffle are two popular tools developers use to make their lives easier when developing smart contracts. While both tools have unique features, they also have limitations, making it essential to understand when to use them.\n\nGanache: A Personal Blockchain for Testing Smart Contracts\n\nGanache is a personal Blockchain that allows developers to create a private Ethereum network to test their smart contracts. It offers all the functionalities of the leading Ethereum network without the costs associated with deploying and testing arrangements on the main network. Ganache provides developers with advanced mining controls and a built-in block explorer, making testing and inspecting smart contracts during development easier.\n\nHowever, Ganache has its limitations. Since it is a private network, it does not accurately mimic the actions of miners on the primary grid. This can cause issues when developers need to test the behavior of smart contracts that depend on miner actions. Additionally, the gas limit on the leading network is a moving target that can change, making it important to be mindful of the potential for issues when using exact numbers in Ganache.\n\nTruffle: A Developer Environment for Building Smart Contracts\n\nTruffle is a development environment, testing framework, and asset pipeline for Blockchains. It provides developers with a project structure, files, and directories, making deployment and testing much more accessible. Truffle also allows developers to spin up a smart contract project at the click of a button, streamlining the development process.\n\nOne of the main advantages of TruffleTruffle is that it is not limited in terms of the features it provides, as it simply provides a framework for developers to sculpt their projects. However, TruffleTruffle offers different control over Ganache\u2019s Blockchain network, which can disadvantage developers who need a more customized testing environment.\n\nChoosing the Right Tool for Your Smart Contract Development\n\nUltimately, the choice between Ganache and Truffle depends on the needs of the developer and the requirements of the smart contract project. Developers who require a more customized testing environment with advanced mining controls may find that Ganache is the better option.

        "title": "Cardano Founder Charles Hoskinson Slams Ethereum Classic As \"A Fraudulent Project With No Vision\" - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Cardano (ADA) Founder, Charles Hoskinson, has taken to Twitter to claim that Ethereum Classic (ETC) is now a \u201cscam\u201d and has no \u201cpurpose other than to allow insiders to dump their holdings\u201d on unsuspecting investors. Hoskinson, who previously worked with ETC, stated that the project has \u201cno roadmap, innovation, team, or vision\u201d, and is only filled with \u201canger and toxicity\u201d.\n\nCardano Founder Backs Ethical Alternative To Scam Operation\n\nHoskinson\u2019s comments were made in response to a Twitter post by the Proof of Work (POW) Summit and have raised eyebrows in the cryptocurrency community. Many have questioned the timing of Hoskinson\u2019s comments, as ETC has recently seen a surge in price and popularity.\n\nETC is now a scam and it's only purpose is for insiders to dump on those they recruit with blind hope of some magical future that will never come. There is no roadmap, innovation, team, or vision. It's just anger and toxicity. The Twitter account was built up from years of effort\u2026 \u2014 Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) May 19, 2023\n\nAccording to Hoskinson, ETC was built up from years of effort and marketing at Input Output Global (IOG), a technology company pre-eminent in engineering and research in blockchain structures, and it was not ethical to inflict upon those followers a project that is now a scam.\n\nFurthermore, Hoskinson believes that Ergo, which he is currently involved with, should have been what ETC is. Ergo is a cryptocurrency focused on improving blockchain technology\u2019s limitations, such as scalability, interoperability, and security.\n\nThe Cardano founder also claims that Ergo continues to innovate and has a purpose, good ethical leadership, and funding for the future. He believes Ergo is a better choice for investors looking for a cryptocurrency with a clear vision and a roadmap for the future.\n\nHoskinson\u2019s comments have sparked a debate in the cryptocurrency community about the legitimacy of ETC and the responsibilities of developers and insiders in the industry. While some have criticized Hoskinson for his comments, others have praised him for speaking out against what he perceives as unethical practices.\n\nHoskinson Shares Tips for \u201cSafe\u201d Crypto Storage\n\nThe recent Ledger controversy has sparked a debate among cryptocurrency users about the importance of security in the hardware wallet space. In response to this controversy, Cardano Founder Charles Hoskinson has shared his thoughts on what users should look for when choosing a hardware wallet.\n\nWith respect to the Ledger controversy, I say the following: 1) always choose open source software whenever possible that has been audited by numerous sources on a regular basis 2) security comes from simplicity- Design the smallest possible footprint 3) non-updateable\u2026 \u2014 Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) May 19, 2023\n\nHoskinson emphasizes the importance of open-source software audited by numerous sources regularly. This ensures that the software is transparent and that potential vulnerabilities are quickly identified and addressed.\n\nAdditionally, he suggests that simplicity is key when it comes to security. Designing a hardware wallet with the smallest possible footprint reduces the attack surface and makes it more difficult for hackers to find vulnerabilities.\n\nFurthermore, Hoskinson notes that non-updateable firmware is important when a company makes specific promises about its security model. This ensures that attackers cannot exploit any vulnerabilities discovered after the release of the hardware wallet. He suggests that decentralizing the process of updates would greatly enhance security in the hardware wallet space.\n\nCardano founder also reminds users that people buy hardware wallets to maximize the personal security of their funds and not for daily use or an equivalent user experience to hot wallets. Hardware wallets are an extreme example of self-custody and are designed to ensure that the private keys stay in one place on hardware that is hard to tamper with.\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView.com"
