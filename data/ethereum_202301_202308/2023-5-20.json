        "title": "DogeMiyagi Emerges as Ethereum Price Dangles, While Bitcoin's Decline Intensifies with a 10% Fall in May 2023 - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "A leaked document distributed to Democratic House Financial Services Committee members has revealed the \u201ckey messages\u201d legislators were advised to keep to, which might result in practically all cryptocurrencies being classified as securities.\n\nAs governments and regulatory agencies impose more robust controls on cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, investors and enthusiasts are left worrying about the potential repercussions.\n\nOne fascinating issue arises: if the price of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) tumbles, will meme currencies become more popular? Will DogeMiyagi ($MIYAGI) become the meme market leader?\n\nFurthermore, would cryptocurrencies in presale garner greater interest because they are untouched by the current market trend?\n\nThe Great Crypto Cliffhanger: Bitcoin\u2019s Precarious Position and Ethereum\u2019s Fate in the Balance\n\nAs the crypto world holds its breath, Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price is perched precariously on a stable support level, making it a compelling opportunity for eager buyers to accumulate. After several failed attempts to break free and soar to new heights, BTC is back at the notorious $27,000 barrier, like a stubborn explorer refusing to surrender to the depths.\n\nOh, the drama! After seven days of relentless selling, Bitcoin\u2019s price has finally taken a break from the madness, settling down for a cosy consolidation around the familiar $27,000 support level. It\u2019s like the calm after a stormy affair, where BTC is catching its breath, unsure of its following path.\n\nWill it sweep Monday\u2019s low at $26,694, teasing us with a swift recovery and reclaiming its support level throne? Or will it succumb to the temptation of becoming a resistance barrier, shattering our bullish dreams and potentially triggering a merciless correction to $25,290 and $23,905 levels? The plot thickens.\n\nMeanwhile, our beloved Ethereum (ETH) has been busy cooking up some technical mischief. Picture this: a bearish divergence sells signal on the daily chart, unfolding its treacherous formation between January 14 and May 13, leaving unsuspecting investors in disbelief.\n\nStory continues\n\nLike a magician revealing their trickery, this wicked move sent ETH on a 17% freefall, leaving it gasping for air at the measly $1,735 mark. But fear not! Hope lies in the mystical realm of critical support floors, and ETH\u2019s saviour awaits at the sacred $1,705 level. If it can summon the strength to bounce back from this abyss, a glimmer of light might shine through, guiding it on a heroic journey towards the superb $2,028 destination.\n\nBut patience, dear investors, patience! Remember, the tale of Ethereum\u2019s fate is yet to be written, and it eagerly awaits Bitcoin\u2019s proclamation of direction. In this mesmerising world of cryptocurrencies, where fortunes rise and fall with the flicker of a digital heartbeat, one thing remains clear: the intricate dance of Bitcoin sets the stage for its companion, Ethereum.\n\nThe Rise of Meme Coins: Exploring the Allure and Potential of DogeMiyagi in the Crypto Market\n\nThe general public is drawn to meme coins because of the possibility of rapid returns and the entertaining and dynamic communities surrounding them. While meme currencies lack the technological complexity and use cases of Bitcoin and Ethereum, their popularity stems from their ease of usage, low cost, and viral growth potential. The current crackdown on mainstream cryptocurrencies may have created a void that meme coins might fill, luring buyers looking for new investment possibilities.\n\nThe presale of meme coins is another important factor in their success.\n\nDuring a market downturn, presale cryptocurrencies provide a unique opportunity for investors. These new currencies are introduced through presales or initial coin offers (ICOs), which allow investors to purchase tokens before they are available on the general market. Because market trends do not yet influence presale coins, they enable investors to enter the market at an early stage.\n\nOverall, coins, let us welcome its highness DogeMiyagi to the meme market podium!\n\nMIYAGI is one of the most recent meme currencies, and it has the potential to become the market leader.\n\nThrough thorough audits, DogeMiyagi proudly emphasises its dedication to identity verification and risk assessment. Its commitment to maintaining a safe environment has won the prestigious Know Your Coin (KYC) accreditation, indicating its commitment to fostering community trust.\n\nDogeMiyagi understands the importance of community involvement and aims to establish an environment that values and benefits all members. DogeMiyagi aspires to stand out in the ever-changing world of cryptocurrencies with its unique features, attention to security and compliance, and commitment to community trust.\n\nDogeMiyagi:\n\nWebsite: https://dogemiyagi.com\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_Dogemiyagi_\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/dogemiyagi"

        "content": "A bearish market structure has been pressuring cryptocurrencies\u2019 prices for the past six weeks, driving the total market capitalization to its lowest level in two months at $1.13 trillion. According to two derivatives metrics, crypto bulls will have a hard time to break the downtrend, even though analyzing a shorter timeframe provides a neutral view, with Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and BNB, on average, gaining 0.3% between May 12 and May 19.\n\nTotal crypto market cap in USD, 12-hour. Source: TradingView\n\nNotice that the descending wedge formation initiated in mid-April could last until July, indicating that an eventual break to the upside would require an extra effort from the bulls.\n\nFurthermore, there\u2019s the impending U.S. debt ceiling standoff, as the U.S. Treasury is quickly running out of cash.\n\nEven if the majority of investors believe that the Biden administration will be able to strike a deal before the effective default of its debt, no one can exclude the possibility of a government shutdown and subsequent default.\n\nGold or stablecoins as a safe haven?\n\nNot even gold, which used to be considered the world\u2019s safest asset class, has been immune to the recent correction, as the precious metal traded down from $2,050 on May 4 to the present $1,980 level.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin, gold and the debt ceiling \u2014 Does something have to give?\n\nCircle, the company behind the USDC stablecoin, has ditched $8.7 billion in Treasurys maturing in longer than 30 days for short-term bonds and collateralized loans at banking giants such as Goldman Sachs and Royal Bank of Canada.\n\nAccording to Markets Insider, a Circle representative stated that:\n\n\u201cThe inclusion of these highly liquid assets also provides additional protection for the USDC reserve in the unlikely event of a U.S. debt default.\u201d\n\nThe stablecoin DAI, managed by the decentralized organization MakerDAO, approved in March an increase to its portfolio holdings of the U.S. Treasurys to $1.25 billion to \u201ctake advantage of the current yield environment and generate further revenue.\u201d\n\nDerivatives markets show no signs of bearishness\n\nPerpetual contracts, also known as inverse swaps, have an embedded rate that is usually charged every eight hours.\n\nA positive funding rate indicates that longs (buyers) demand more leverage. Still, the opposite situation occurs when shorts (sellers) require additional leverage, causing the funding rate to turn negative.\n\nPerpetual futures accumulated 7-day funding rate on May 19. Source: Coinglass\n\nThe seven-day funding rate for BTC and ETH was neutral, indicating balanced demand from leveraged longs (buyers) and shorts (sellers) using perpetual futures contracts. Curiously, even Litecoin (LTC) displayed no excessive long demand after a 14.5% weekly rally.\n\nTo exclude externalities that might have solely impacted futures markets, traders can gauge the market\u2019s sentiment by measuring whether more activity is going through call (buy) options or put (sell) options.\n\nBTC options volume put-to-call ratio. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe expiration of options can add volatility to Bitcoin\u2019s price, which resulted in an $80-million advantage for bears in the latest May 19 expiry.\n\nA 0.70 put-to-call ratio indicates that put option open interest lags the more bullish calls and is, therefore, bullish. In contrast, a 1.40 indicator favors put options, which can be deemed bearish.\n\nThe put-to-call ratio for Bitcoin options volume has been below 1.0 for the past couple of weeks, indicating a higher preference for neutral-to-bullish call options. More importantly, even as Bitcoin briefly corrected down to $26,800 on May 12, there was no significant surge in demand for the protective put options.\n\nGlass half full, or investors prepping for the worst?\n\nThe options market shows whales and market makers unwilling to take protective puts even after Bitcoin crashed 8.3% between May 10 and May 12.\n\nHowever, given the balanced demand on futures markets, traders seem hesitant to place additional bets until there\u2019s more clarity on the U.S. debt standoff.\n\nLess than two weeks remain until June 1, when the U.S. Treasury Department has warned that the federal government could be unable to pay its debts.\n\nRelated: U.S. debt ceiling crisis: bullish or bearish for Bitcoin?\n\nIt is unclear whether the total market capitalization will be able to break from the descending wedge formation. From an optimistic perspective, professional traders are not using derivatives to bet on a catastrophic scenario.\n\nOn the other hand, there seems to be no rationale for the bulls to jump the gun and place bets on a speedy crypto market recovery, given the uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment. So, ultimately, bears are in a comfortable place according to derivatives metrics.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Ethereum has been struggling with the 100-day moving average, which stands at $1772, for an extended period. However, the price action at this crucial level has not yet clearly indicated any upcoming direction. A breakout, on the other hand, has the potential to trigger an immediate cascade.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nFollowing a short-term consolidation phase, the price experienced a decline toward the 100-day moving average of $1.7K. The recent PA of Ethereum has failed to deliver a definite direction, with the price consolidating and printing very small green and red candles. This has left the market in extreme uncertainty.\n\nNonetheless, the cryptocurrency faces two critical support levels: the 100-day moving average at $1772 and the substantial support region at $1.7K. Therefore, if $1.7K prevents a further decline, there is potential for a rally aiming for the resistance area at $2.1K.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nOn the 4-hour timeframe, the price has continued its bearish trend towards the support region at $1.7K. However, after reaching this level, it formed a slight bounce and entered a consolidation state characterized by very small candles.\n\nMeanwhile, a descending wedge pattern can be observed in the 4-hour timeframe, with the price currently consolidating within the narrow range. The wedge\u2019s lower trendline coincides with the significant support region at $1.7K, making it a powerful level.\n\nUltimately, a downward break of the support zone at $1.7K and the lower boundary of the descending wedge could trigger a cascade as long positions get liquidated and selling pressure soars. Conversely, if the price finds support, it could potentially aim for the mid-boundary of the channel and even the resistance region at $2.1K."

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum have struggled to surpass key price levels.\n\nPositive funding rates indicate bullish sentiment among investors.\n\nBitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] have recently encountered significant price resistance. BTC has faced difficulty surpassing the $30,000 mark, while ETH has consistently struggled to exceed $2,000. Surprisingly, holders exhibited stronger convictions than selling off and held onto their assets more firmly.\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum struggle to\u2026\n\nBitcoin breached the $30,000 price zone on the daily timeframe chart around 11 April, but struggled to sustain this level for an extended period. Subsequently, it dropped below $30,000. At press time, it was trading at approximately $26,900, reflecting a small gain.\n\nThe price range tool indicated that BTC has experienced a decline of over 10% since testing the $30,000 mark.\n\nFurthermore, taking a closer look at Ethereum on the daily timeframe showed that it reached the $2,000 milestone in April. Unfortunately, the upward momentum was short-lived, lasting less than six days.\n\nSince then, ETH has been unable to surpass and maintain that price range. As of this writing, it was trading at approximately $1,800, reflecting a minor gain of less than 1%.\n\nSelf-custody on the rise\n\nAs the prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to fluctuate, an increasing number of holders are opting to secure their assets. Recent data from Santiment revealed a decline in the supply of BTC and ETH on exchanges.\n\nThe chart indicated that the current percentage of BTC supply on exchanges was at its lowest since December 2017. Similarly, the percentage of ETH supply on exchanges was the lowest since 2015.\n\nAs of this writing, BTC\u2019s supply on exchanges was approximately 10%, while ETH\u2019s supply was around 5%. This decline in supply on exchanges could signal an anticipated price uptrend and future bull run for both cryptocurrencies.\n\nCurrent Netflow and Funding Rate\n\nAnalyzing the Netflow data of Ethereum on CryptoQuant showed that there has yet to be a substantial flow in recent days. However, there were more outflows than inflows during this period. The Netflow was negative at the time of writing, indicating an outflow of over 14,000 ETH.\n\nOn the other hand, Bitcoin has experienced a more notable flow in recent days, but similar to Ethereum, the dominant trend has been outflows per CryptoQuant. As of this writing, the Netflow for Bitcoin was negative, although there had been minor positive flows on previous days.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nInvestors have maintained a bullish sentiment even with the notable movement of ETH and BTC off exchanges. Data from Coinglass revealed that funding rates for BTC and ETH have consistently been positive across various exchanges.\n\nThis suggested that most investors were placing bets on a future price increase for both cryptocurrencies."

Discover SCENE\n\nThe prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum remained flat for the third week running as the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) showed no signs of conceding ground over its claim to being the industry\u2019s lead regulator.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) added a modest 0.3% to its value over the last seven days and currently trades at $27,110.29. Likewise, Ethereum (ETH) only grew 0.6% and currently changes hands at $1,825.\n\nThere were no substantial losses among any of the top thirty cryptocurrencies this week. Three projects posted notable rallies.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nXRP blew up 9.4% and entered the weekend at $0.46. The coin\u2019s progenitor, Ripple, scored a small courtroom victory against the SEC in the latter\u2019s ongoing lawsuit against the company for selling XRP as an unregistered security.\n\nOn Tuesday, Judge Analisa Torres blocked the SEC\u2019s motion to seal documents linked to a speech by former SEC director Bill Hinman explaining why Bitcoin and Ethereum should not be considered securities. Torres said the documents in question were \u201csubject to a strong presumption of public access.\u201d\n\nRipple\u2019s defense previously made Hinman\u2019s case for XRP, but the SEC countered that Hinman\u2019s speech represented Hinman\u2019s personal views before unsuccessfully requesting the motion to seal the documents.\n\nRipple made headlines again on Thursday with the news that it has launched its Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) platform. The platform is pitched to central banks and governments looking to create their own centrally-issued stablecoins, alongside financial institutions that will distribute them and the users\u2014both retail and corporate\u2014that will trade, hold and use them.\n\nAnother big mover was Litecoin (LTC) which this week blew up 13.2% and trades for $91.29 at the time of writing. The Litecoin network recently increased in popularity as a result of Ordinals Inscriptions, a craze that brings NFT-style assets to blockchains with unsophisticated smart contracts, like Bitcoin and Litecoin.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEthereum staking token Lido DAO (LDO) surged 13.7% this week, sustaining its momentum from last week.\n\nSEC \u201cready to help\u201d\n\nOn Monday, SEC chairman Gary Gensler pushed back against claims that the SEC\u2019s regulatory guidance to crypto companies was not clear. Speaking at a keynote session, Gensler insisted \u201cthe rules have already been published\u201d and added his agency \u201cstands ready to help them to come into compliance.\u201d\n\nThe SEC\u2019s position is widely perceived as disingenuous because the regulator is simultaneously bombarding the industry with lawsuits. Even one of the SEC\u2019s own Commissioners, Hester Pierce, has dissented a couple of times due to the lack of clarity, most recently over her agency\u2019s decision to shut down Kraken\u2019s staking platform and its proposal to amend the definition of \u201cexchange\u201d to bring crypto companies into its jurisdiction.\n\nAnother noteworthy event on Monday was the SEC\u2019s response to Coinbase\u2019s petition for a writ of mandamus, an order that would require the agency to clarify its rules on crypto regulations. The regulator\u2019s lawyers urged the court to dismiss Coinbase\u2019s request.\n\nAround the world\n\nIn the South Korean press on Monday, Samsung announced its partnership with the Bank of Korea (BOK) to jointly conduct research aimed at developing an ecosystem for a CBDC.\n\nBoth parties signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to deepen their research into offline CBDC payments, according to a Korea Herald report.\n\nSamsung previously participated in BOK\u2019s CBDC pilot project last year, developing offline CBDC technology to enable transfers and payments through near-field communication (NFC), even when the transaction\u2019s sender and recipient devices were not connected to the internet.\n\nOn Tuesday, European Union Finance Ministers adopted the bloc\u2019s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) bill with no objections. This marks the final step in the process of the legislation coming into force and now means that the EU has a comprehensive and uniform set of guidelines for regulating crypto throughout its 27 member states.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFinally on Wednesday, a cross-party committee of British MPs on Wednesday published a report recommending that the British government legislates crypto as gambling. The bizarre proposal envisions handing oversight to the Gambling Commission and includes possible taxes to support addiction and debt advice."

        "title": "The Weaknesses of Ethereum VS Modern Blockchains: Interview With Radix - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "If the slew of smart contract hacks that netted attackers over $3 billion in 2022 has taught us anything, it\u2019s that decentralized finance (DeFi) is still an immature industry.\n\nBesides exploits, DeFi still faces scaling issues related to the computational power needed to power complex transactions, and the throughput needed to support the worldwide financial system in the coming years.\n\nAs the current king of DeFi, the Ethereum network is worth assessing to identify the problems and limitations contributing to the industry\u2019s current roadblocks.\n\nAt Consensus 2023, CryptoPotato sat down with Piers Ridyard \u2013 CEO of RDX Works \u2013 to discuss ways in which Ethereum is not truly optimized for DeFi. He explained some of the better-suited technology underlying modern blockchains, including the newly popular smart contract platform Radix.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Clunky Programming Language\n\nAccording to Ridyard, DeFi in crypto is currently lacking in three major areas: user experience, developer experience, and scalability.\n\nThe first two issues largely stem from the less-than-ideal programming languages for developers to express their ideas for particular financial applications. One such language, he said, is Ethereum\u2019s Solidity.\n\n\u201cSolidity is like banging your head against a brick wall,\u201d he stated. \u201cIf you want to build assets that are highly secure and you want to build financial applications that are highly secure, it\u2019s basically impossible to make it secure in a way that is easy for developers to use.\u201d\n\nRidyard\u2019s company RDX Works is a core developer for Radix \u2013 a DeFi-focused blockchain whose native token, XRD, roared upwards by over 200% from early to mid-April.\n\nUnlike Ethereum and other chains, Radix uses a unique programming language called Scrypto, which is specifically focused on making financial applications easier to build and use.\n\n\n\nUnderneath Scrypto is the Radix engine which includes primitives that are part of the ledger itself, providing the essential building blocks for developers to build apps without having to start complex development from scratch.\n\n\u201cYou are not creating your own smart contract that then defines what it means to be a token, what it means to be a token transfer and tracking balances,\u201d said Ridyard. \u201cAll of that is done by the ledger itself.\u201d\n\nThe Radix engine also protects applications on the platform from \u201creentrancy attacks,\u201d a common DeFi loophole that lets a hacker continually withdraw from a smart contract until the victim goes bankrupt. Specifically, the engine prevents infinite callbacks that lead to recursive loops which let hackers drain a contract to zero.\n\nIn February, the DeFi protocol dforce lost $3.6 million to such a bug. \u201cA whole host of maybe half a billion dollars worth of hacks that have just been from reentrancy disappear just because of how we\u2019ve implemented the architecture,\u201d said Ridyard.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Consensus Mechanism\n\nEthereum\u2019s \u201cMerge\u201d upgrade in September \u2013 which changed its consensus mechanism from proof of work to proof of stake \u2013 was widely praised as the greatest technical feat in the history of crypto. However, in 2023, even proof of stake may be proving less advanced of a mechanism than what newer chains can offer \u2013 especially on the scalability front.\n\nFor example, Ethereum doesn\u2019t allow for the parallel execution of transactions that would enable massive throughput. All transactions must be ordered, even if they are unrelated to each other.\n\nBy contrast, Radix uses the \u201cCerberus\u201d consensus mechanism, which obviates the need for ordering. \u201cThey can start and end whenever they need to start and end, and you don\u2019t need to agree between them which one came first and which one came second,\u201d said Ridyard.\n\nRadix still comes baked in with a delegated proof of stake system that protects Cerberus. However, Ridyard doesn\u2019t consider either proof of work or proof of stake to be \u201cconsensus mechanisms,\u201d but rather \u201ccivil protection mechanisms.\u201d\n\n\u201cA consensus mechanism, is how do the nodes come to an agreement. The civil mechanism is about, how do you defend those nodes from being maliciously attacked in the process of coming to an agreement,\u201d he elaborated.\n\nRidyard said he admired proof of stake for its energy efficiency, but noted that proof of work chains \u2013 like Bitcoin \u2013 solve certain \u201cbootstrapping\u201d and \u201crandomization\u201d problems.\n\nDeFi and the SEC\n\nBesides technological limitations, DeFi and the blockchains underpinning it are currently under immense regulatory pressure from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The agency currently seeks to regulate DeFi exchanges under existing securities exchange laws.\n\nWhile Ridyard sees a possibility that regulators \u201ckill\u201d DeFi in America for a period, he doesn\u2019t envision the industry dying globally due to the overwhelming benefit it can provide certain economies. Ultimately, he believes \u201creading the tea leaves\u201d of how regulators will interpret certain enforcement rules is a bit of a distraction, and that DeFi will ultimately adapt to best conform to each country\u2019s political and economic will.\n\n\u201cWhat the regulators are trying to do is find the handles in which they can exercise enforcement against what the government and by and large, what the voting public could consider to be the things they want and they don\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is going to be some give and take.\u201d"

        "title": "Who invented NFTs?: A brief history of nonfungible tokens - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "A brief history of NFTs: From inception to global recognition What started with Bitcoin-based colored coins in 2012\u20132013 became a phenomenon in 2021 and is still thriving. The Ethereum blockchain had a pivotal role in popularizing NFTs. Though 2021 turned out to be the year of Nonfungible tokens (NFTs), it wasn\u2019t the year when the technology was invented. Kevin McCoy minted the first NFT, \u201cQuantum,\u201d on the Namecoin blockchain in 2014. Nonetheless, the inception of Bitcoin-based colored coins in 2012\u20132013 marked the beginning of the concept that led to the development of BRC-20 tokens. This idea stemmed from a paper authored by Meni Rosenfield in 2012, and it paved the way for the evolution of digital tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. The world, however, noticed NFTs in 2017. This was mainly due to the arrival of the Ethereum blockchain, which overcame the limitations in the blockchains prior to it when it came to hosting NFTs. Ethereum not only provided NFTs with a reliable solution for critical things such as token creation, storage, programming and trading but also lowered the entry barrier for launching NFT projects. A brief history of NFTs can be segregated into a timeline:\n\nThe evolution of NFTs: From colored coins to the emergence of Rare Pepes and Spells of Genesis As mentioned, the story took off with colored coins, which were created to represent and manage ownership of real-world assets on the blockchain. They were different from Bitcoin (BTC) because of the \u201cnonfungible\u201d element that provided them with a unique utility. Demonstrating a humongous leap in Bitcoin\u2019s capabilities, colored coins were composed of tiny fractions of a Bitcoin, which could be as minuscule as a satoshi. Use cases of colored coins, such as the representation of property, coupons, or usage as digital collectibles, subscriptions, shares and access tokens, helped people realize the potential of blockchains for issuing assets. Bitcoin, however, was never intended to be used as a database for tokens, which meant that colored coins just remained at the concept level. However, the development did set off a series of experiments that culminated in NFTs. The first of the NFTs was \u201cQuantum,\u201d as mentioned before, an octagon-shaped animation. The arrival of Ethereum provided NFTs with the platform they required to flourish. A major project of this period that enabled the development of digital assets was The Counterparty platform built on Bitcoin. A spectrum of \u201cRare Pepes\u201d NFTs was released on The Counterparty, initiating the use case of NFT as artwork. \u201cSpells of Genesis,\u201d created on Ethereum, was another big NFT project after The Counterparty.\n\nThe rise of NFTs in gaming and the metaverse: From CryptoPunks to Axie Infinity Ethereum introducing a set of token standards facilitated the steady movement of NFTs toward the blockchain. The token standard informs developers how to deploy new tokens. The success of the Rare Pepes was followed by Larva Labs, a software development company that launched CryptoPunks, its own generative series of NFTs, created by John Watkinson and Matt Hall. Inspired by London punk culture, the project has 10,000 unique pieces, with no two characters resembling each other. CryptoPunks became a huge success and was the foundation of many other NFT projects, including the Bored Ape Yacht Club, one of the biggest NFT collections. The next major launch was CryptoKitties, which came up during the ETHWaterloo hackathon, back in October 2017. The game enables players to buy, sell and create NFTs representing virtual cats with desirable traits on Ethereum. Post CryptoKitties, NFT gaming became increasingly popular. NFT gaming combined with metaverse projects to formulate a new momentum. A major project of this era was Ethereum-based Decentraland, a virtual world that allows players to explore games and build and collect assets. In October 2018, Axie Infinity, an NFT-based battle game, was released. It set the ball rolling for play-to-earn (P2E) games, which enabled gamers to earn in-game rewards while playing. It\u2019s a pioneering video game on the Ethereum blockchain involving Axies, creatures that are rare NFTs with unique attributes. Gamers fight battles using Axies and build more attributes into them.\n\nExpanding beyond Ethereum: Non-Ethereum blockchains and the NFT ecosystem Certain factors propelled NFTs to a sharp surge in 2021. Various blockchains set up new standards specifically for NFTs. NFTs in 2021 witnessed a spike in supply and demand. According to NFT data company NonFungible.com, NFT trading jumped around 21,000% to top $17 billion during the year. The usage of NFTs in the art market was a major factor behind the surge. The emergence of digital art provided artists with another venue to showcase their creativity and store their work, which could be verified as well. Thanks to these advantages, digital art gained traction and helped propel the NFT boon. This was the time when renowned auction houses such as Christie\u2019s and Sotheby\u2019s moved their auctions online. Moreover, these auctions included art that pushed the popularity of NFTs. It was at Christie\u2019s where Beeple\u2019s \u201cEverydays: the First 5000 Days\u201d NFT made a record-shattering sale of $69 million. A sale of that scale drew the attention of non-Ethereum blockchains and blockchain enthusiasts toward NFTs. Buoyed by the NFT mania, blockchains such as Cardano, Solana, Flow and Tezos started work on their own platforms for NFTs. In September 2021, smart contracts became functional on Cardano, which facilitated the development of NFT applications on the platform. A few new standards were set up by various blockchains to establish the authenticity of nonfungible assets. A key event of the year was Facebook rebranding itself as Meta and strolling into the metaverse space. NFTs were always an integral part of the metaverse, leading to the surge in demand for NFTs."

        "content": "EDCON 2023 is here, and time and time again, Ethereum has showcased its importance to the crypto industry and the DeFi ecosystem at large \u2013 to be more than a cryptocurrency. The ongoing EDCON 2023 in the beautiful city of Podgorica, Montenegro, is in high focus on the possibilities Ethereum has to offer to the general crypto market and beyond.\n\nAs one of the largest gatherings of the Ethereum and blockchain communities, the EDCON 2023 (Community Ethereum Development Conference) started on May 19 and ends on May 23, 2023.\n\nEDCON 2023 \u2013 what is happening?\n\nEDCON is a non-profit annual global Ethereum conference held in various countries. 2017\u2019s EDCON was held in Paris, 2018\u2019s in Toronto, 2019\u2019s in Sydney, Australia, 2020-2021\u2019s online, and 2022\u2019s at the Chase Center in San Francisco. EDCON is dedicated to servicing the Ethereum ecosystem by enhancing the global communication and interaction of Ethereum communities.\n\nSource; Ethereum \u2013 EDCON 2023\n\nEDCON 2023 features keynote addresses, technical seminars, and panel discussions on Blockchain Regulation, Layer 3, Decentralized Society, Decentralized Governance, and the Network State, amongst others.\n\nEDCON 2023 has assembled the brightest minds of the Ethereum community, including Vitalik Buterin (co-founder of Ethereum), Balaji Srinivasan (author of the Network State), Scott Moore (co-founder of Gitcoin), Primavera De Filippi (Blockchain researcher at CNRS and the Berkman Klein Center at Harvard University), Tim Beiko (Ethereum Foundation), Barry Whitehat (Ethereum Foundation), Cy Li (Director of De University of Ethereum), among others.\n\nIn addition, the conference will feature an Ethereum Quorum day, a Community Event day, and a Super Demo competition, affording ample opportunities for collaboration and discussion.\n\nENS Layer 2 and offchain data support\n\nEDCON 2023 has taken a keen interest in Layer 2 solutions and how they impact the overall financial market. And as information would have it, with the proliferation of layer 2 solutions for Ethereum that are starting to mature, it\u2019s important that ENS provides resolution services across the ecosystem and allow ENS users to take advantage of layer 2 solutions\u2019 efficiencies.\n\nThe ENS team and the wider ENS and L2 community have been developing a general-purpose \u201cLayer 2 bridge\u201d that enables cross-platform interoperability between ENS and other applications that require the ability to retrieve data from a variety of offchain sources (any data that resides outside of the Ethereum Mainnet, also known as layer 1/L1).\n\nThis includes both proprietary database and layer 2/L2 solutions (e.g., Optimism, Arbitrum, Starkware, ZKSync, etc.) developed in a trustless manner and produced standards.\n\nThis definition is broader than what most people would consider \u201cLayer 2\u201d; it also includes other methods of reducing onchain data storage, such as airdrops that use merkle trees of account balances and tokens that emit events but do not store account balances onchain.\n\nIn a world with a plethora of different, incompatible layer 2 solutions, the key problem for ENS and many other applications is how to retrieve data from one of these systems in a way that is trust-minimized \u2014 that is, it does not introduce any new trust assumptions \u2014 without the application having to act as a client of each layer 2 solution that could potentially store data of interest to it.\n\nThe EIP 3668 \u2013 allows for transparent offchain (including Layer 2/L2) data lookups and allows contract authors to implement whatever validation is required; in many cases, this can be provided without any additional trust assumptions beyond those required if data is stored onchain.\n\nThe ENSIP 10 \u2013 is a general method for resolving wildcards (for example, *.foo.eth) on L1. Issuing subdomains and resolving the parent name offchain allows dApps to create subdomains offchain while still making them available via L1.\n\nThe ENSIP 10 \u2013 is a general method for resolving wildcards (e.g., *.foo.eth) on L1. Issuing subdomains and resolving the parent name offchain enables dApps to create subdomains offchain while still making them available via L1.\n\nBenefits of ENS L2 Offchain\n\nENS is a decentralized naming system built on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to associate human-readable names with Ethereum addresses and other decentralized resources.\n\nENS L2 Off-Chain support enables developers to interact with ENS records and perform various operations without directly accessing the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nBy leveraging Layer 2 solutions, developers can significantly reduce transaction costs, enhance the user experience by improving transaction speed, and alleviate network congestion on the Ethereum mainnet. ENS L2 Offchain also offers compatibility with existing ENS functionality, allowing seamless integration with DApps built on Layer 2."

        "content": "Ray Youssef, the former founder of Paxful, thinks Ethereum, the world\u2019s largest smart contracting platform, is a \u201cdrain and drag\u201d on Bitcoin.\n\nEthereum Slowing Down Bitcoin?\n\nIn his post on May 21, it is evident that the former CEO is critical of Ethereum and thinks it is a hindrance and obstacle to Bitcoin\u2019s progress.\n\nBreaking down his view, Youssef appears to suggest that Ethereum\u2019s impact has been largely negative, delaying advancements in crypto.\n\nEthereum is simply a drain and drag on #bitcoin\n\nWe should be grateful that it slowed things down as we needed time to figure things out and get the pieces in play. We have been steady now it is time to blaze. #civkit will be what Eth should have been and I am Vitalik on roids. pic.twitter.com/CdbfB0UpaP \u2014 Ray Youssef (@raycivkit) May 20, 2023\n\nHowever, he expressed gratitude for the recent slowdown following last year\u2019s crypto winter. In his assessment, the dump in asset prices from late 2021 slowed down activity allowing the crypto industry to strategize, adapt, and prepare for a new phase of innovation.\n\nYoussef\u2019s tweet implied that Ethereum\u2019s role has been to impede Bitcoin\u2019s growth rather than foster its development. By referring Ethereum as a \u201cdrain and drag\u201d on Bitcoin, he insinuates that Ethereum has not lived up to its potential, hindering Bitcoin\u2019s progress.\n\nEven so, Youssef appears to state that the time spent grappling with Ethereum\u2019s limitations has allowed the industry to evaluate its shortcomings and establish a solid foundation. He emphasized the importance of the recent lull, saying the industry \u201cneeded time to figure things out and get the pieces in play\u201d before pushing forward.\n\nFulfilling What Ethereum Failed To Achieve\n\n\n\nWhile the former CEO thrashed Ethereum, he revealed that he is working on a project, CivKit, that will realize what Ethereum failed to achieve.\n\nHe also compares himself with the co-founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, saying his participation in the CivKit project is like \u201cVitalik on roids.\u201d\n\nThis comment gives the impression that his project would bring about major improvement in crypto, adding features that could be superior to what Ethereum has accomplished up to this point.\n\nWhen he was the CEO of Paxful, a crypto peer-to-peer trading platform, the portal delisted Ethereum after the network shifted to a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm.\n\nPaxful cited centralization concerns since the network now depended on validators who stake their coins for a chance to validate transactions and add them to a block.\n\nThe platform also cited the number of scams orchestrated on the Ethereum network. As a means of protecting its users from scams, the platform said they were delisting ETH.\n\nYoussef has been a vocal supporter of Bitcoin. On May 18, he said Operation Choke Point in the United States, for instance, will crash Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market. Still, the former CEO remains buoyant saying that without the coin, the country \u201chas no future\u201d.\n\n-Feature Image From Canva, Chart From TradingView"

        "title": "Game Boy to be Soon Turned Into Ethereum and Bitcoin Wallet - The Coin Republic",
        "content": "90\u2019s feeling is the most caved feeling in the 2000s decade and how can somebody forget the Nintendo Game Boy? Keyp, a small crypto startup is trying to revamp and optimize the Nintendo Game Boy consoles to offline crypto wallets. The group of developers is trying hard to convert the gaming console to crypto hardware wallets called the Game Wallet.\n\nWhat\u2019s with the new Game Boy?\n\nThe developers have made sure that the Game wallet is not just another gimmick but a real thing. It is a brand new cartridge of the Game Boy that will be using gamification to generate users\u2019 seed phrases via interactions with non-playable characters and random quests.\n\nOnce it has been developed the wallet will be able to store all cryptocurrencies that use BIP-3 seed phrases. That will allow the wallets to store coins such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. The software aims to be open source and will allow implementations from anybody.\n\nKeyp\u2019s Vision with Game Boy\n\nJoseph Schiarizzi, founder of Keyp, while talking to a media house about the wallet, said that the experience will be \u201dPokemon-like\u201d.\n\nThe founder extends his views by saying that Keyp wants to make Web3 accessible and safe for everyone using tools such as social logins and extra security layers for wallets. The Game wallet is just a fun extension of that aim, said Joseph.\n\nThe nine-person team of Keyp has been developing the wallet since January. The team has recognized the need for offline storage after the recent controversy surrounding Ledger\u2019s new \u201crecovery\u201d has come up. The Game Wallet is marketing itself as offline storage with no firmware updates ever.\n\nSascha Mombartz, co-founder of Keyp mentioned on a Game Wallet product page that with the drama around the Ledger wallet update they\u2019ve realized the need for offline storage that the users can trust.\n\nMombartz added that it started as a fun idea but it seems like a really important product now. Mombartz said that it is not easy to trust a new security device with a supply chain since people don\u2019t have any idea who has tampered with it but to know where your Game Boy has been on the shelf for the last 20 years is easy.\n\nJoseph told a media house that there is no official release date for Game Wallet but they\u2019re planning to open pre-orders and for a summer rollout given there are no hurdles.\n\nThis is not the first instance where crypto enthusiasts have tried to change the Game Boy to a crypto device. The gaming console was turned into a Bitcoin mining machine a few years ago by a pseudonymous IT security researcher. A very slow one though."

        "title": "Ethereum Client Nimbus Releases Pruning Update Following Vitalik Buterin's Roadmap Revision - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "Ethereum consensus layer client Nimbus has announced the release of the v23.5.1 update, mainly focusing on improving compatibility and introducing support for incremental pruning in response to the recent changes made to the Ethereum Roadmap by co-founder Vitalik Buterin. This medium-urgency update targets validators, clients, and node operators, aiming to enhance the overall performance of the ETH network.\n\nPruning is a process that involves erasing older data to optimize disk space utilization. By implementing incremental pruning, Ethereum clients can efficiently manage their storage needs while still maintaining the necessary historical data required for network operations. Although the \u2013history: prune option is not enabled by default in the current release, Nimbus encourages users to test it in non-production environments, as it will be enabled by default in the subsequent update.\n\nThe release of this update follows recent finality issues experienced by the Ethereum network, which were attributed to the lack of comprehensive pruning measures. These issues prompted ETH clients to swiftly release critical updates to mitigate resource usage challenges faced by Beacon Chain nodes during turbulent times.\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s Pruning Addition to the Ethereum Roadmap\n\nIn 2022, Ethereum co-founder and developer Vitalik Buterin introduced the concept of pruning to the Ethereum Roadmap. Buterin emphasized the importance of pruning for scalability, decentralization, and the ease of running nodes on the Ethereum network. By implementing pruning, nodes no longer need to store vast amounts of historical data, thereby promoting network sustainability.\n\nPruning also allows clients to remove unnecessary code that processes historical blocks, further optimizing performance. With the upcoming updates, ETH client releases will enable pruning functions by default, reinforcing the network\u2019s commitment to improving scalability and resource management.\n\nNimbus, a validator client for ETH, has also implemented an additional feature that actually prevents under-specified beacon node URLs without a port number or protocol scheme from being accepted. This enhancement aims to ensure the security and stability of the Ethereum network by enforcing stricter validation criteria.\n\nOther Improvements and Market Overview\n\nIn addition to incremental pruning and improved compatibility, the v23.5.1 update for Nimbus brings several enhancements. These include the introduction of withdrawal addresses as the default for fee recipient addresses and support for the upcoming Capella hard fork in the Gnosis network. These improvements demonstrate the ongoing efforts to enhance the functionality and user experience of Ethereum clients.\n\nIn terms of market performance, the price of ETH currently hovers around $1814, displaying a sideways trend over the past 24 hours. The trading range for the same period reflects a 24-hour low of $1,812 and a high of $1,829. Weekly price movement has also remained stagnant due to market uncertainty, reflecting the cautious sentiment among investors.\n\nAs Ethereum continues to evolve in line with the ETH Roadmap, client updates such as the one released by Nimbus contribute to the network\u2019s overall performance, scalability, and decentralization. The inclusion of pruning measures and other improvements ensures a more sustainable and efficient Ethereum ecosystem for users and developers alike.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe release of the v23.5.1 update by Ethereum client Nimbus marks an important milestone in the ongoing development and improvement of the Ethereum network. With the addition of incremental pruning and enhanced compatibility, Nimbus aims to address the challenges faced by the network, particularly in terms of scalability and resource management."
