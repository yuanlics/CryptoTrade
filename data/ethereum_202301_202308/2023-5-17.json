As Ethereum improves, and as the crypto industry girds for a war of attrition against rising interest rates and regulators emboldened by scandals, users and investors are choosing a faster, cheaper Ethereum over a multi-blockchain future.\n\n\u201cI question why you would be building an L1 at all, when it\u2019s going to be so hard to bridge customers from the Ethereum ecosystem,\u201d an analyst at a crypto fund told DL News. The analyst asked for anonymity citing company media policy.\n\nConsolidation of DeFi\n\nAlthough the total value locked in Ethereum DeFi protocols grew more than sevenfold in 2021 to more than $110 billion, its share of the crypto market plummeted, from more than 90% to 55%.

The poor design of Terra\u2019s dollar-pegged stablecoin led to its spectacular collapse in May 2022.\n\nFTX was a prominent backer of Solana, which has yet to fully recover from the exchange\u2019s bankruptcy.

These so-called \u201crollups,\u201d or layer 2 blockchains, such as Arbitrum and Optimism, let users access Ethereum\u2019s security and decentralisation at a fraction of the price.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s a huge liquidity problem, because everyone\u2019s money is still locked up in Ethereum\u2019 \u2014 Tze Donn Ng, Tioga Capital\n\nLayer 2 blockchains built on top of Ethereum now handle more transactions than Ethereum itself.\n\nThere has been a \u201cconsolidation of DeFi onto Ethereum, where there\u2019s the most liquidity,\u201d according to Sebastien Guillemot co-founder and director at Paima Studios.\n\nWhen accounting for its rollups, Ethereum\u2019s share of TVL has grown since April 2022, to more than two-thirds of the DeFi market.\n\nMove over\n\nVenture funds last year poured hundreds of millions into a pair of blockchains built using Move, a programming language developed by Meta\u2019s Facebook during its attempt to create its own cryptocurrency. As many before them had, Aptos and Sui promised faster transactions at lower cost, luring funding from venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz, among others.\n\n\u201cAptos and Sui got a lot of fanfare a while ago when they announced all the funding rounds,\u201d Tze Donn Ng, an investment associate at Tioga Capital, told DL News.\n\nNOW READ: Sui launch throws market makers\u2019 cut into spotlight: \u2018No one really knows what the terms of the deal are\u2019\n\nThe reason is multifaceted.\n\nFirst, there\u2019s less innovation than meets the eye.\n\nDuring the bull market, tokens for newly launched protocols would surge in value the moment they began trading, Guillemot said.\n\nIn an attempt to ride this wave, developers launched clones of popular Ethereum applications on new blockchains, Guillemot said.\n\n\u201cBut now that we\u2019re in a bear market and that\u2019s not really an option, there\u2019s not so much appetite for this, which has caused everyone to consolidate on platforms that do have active users,\u201d he said.\n\nThe result? Fewer applications on new blockchains, and fewer reasons to go to those blockchains.\n\n\u201cThese new blockchains don\u2019t have anything fundamentally interesting for users at the moment,\u201d Tom Dunleavy, a former analyst at Messari, told DL News.\n\nThe \u2018liquidity problem\u2019\n\nThere\u2019s another, deeper issue facing alternative smart contract blockchains. Network effects mean that, as Ethereum grows in popularity, it becomes an even more attractive place for new users. More users means more assets, which means deeper liquidity and an easier experience trading.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a huge liquidity problem, because everyone\u2019s money is still locked up in Ethereum,\u201d Ng said.\n\nCreating a bridge between Ethereum and competing blockchains in order to allow Ethereum users to move their assets elsewhere likely won\u2019t help the matter \u2014 not after a year in which bridges became prime targets for hackers.\n\nNOW READ: DeFi hackers stole $3.2bn last year amid 35% surge in \u2018bridge\u2019 exploits\n\nSaid Ng: \u201cNo one likes to bridge assets. They want native assets.\u201d\n\nAnd as Ethereum transaction fees surge amid a craze in meme coin trading, rollups stand to benefit \u2014 enjoying tight integration with Ethereum but offering a cheaper and faster user experience.\n\nBut why did alternative blockchains succeed in the first place?\n\nThat success \u201cwas very much a function of the times,\u201d the anonymous analyst told DL News.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably the same reason why loss-making businesses were able to SPAC for the last two-and-a-half years,\u201d he said, referring to companies that went public via a merger with special-purpose acquisition companies.\n\n\u201cAll these terrible businesses that will never make a profit, they were able to SPAC because we were in such a low interest rate environment, money was flowing everywhere.\u201d"

        "title": "High Gas Fees Worth the Pain? Ethereum's Deflationary Model in Action - Blockworks",
        "content": "Using Ethereum is expensive.\n\nWhether it\u2019s from trading on DeFi, flipping NFTs, or gambling with memecoins, transaction fees have been driven upward for months on the network. The rise extends to simply sending tokens from one wallet to another.\n\nWhile recent memecoin buffoonery has exacerbated the problem, ether (ETH) gas fees have been gradually climbing long before the more recent get-rich-quick PEPE craze, with previous perpetrators Uniswap and Blur elevating costs.\n\nBut it\u2019s not all bad. New mechanisms introduced by EIP-1559 in 2021 brought in the burning of base fees, causing deflationary conditions for the network.\n\nThis fee model contributes to the narrative of Ethereum as \u201cultrasound money,\u201d reducing the supply of ETH as on-chain activity drives demand. Adam Smith might have been on to something.\n\nIn theory, a reduction in supply should increase Ethereum\u2019s value as an asset in the long term. Avi Felman, head of digital asset trading at GoldenTree Asset Management, and Jonah Van Bourg, Cumberland\u2019s global head of trading, spoke to Blockworks on the 1000x podcast about their evolving investment thesis for Ethereum.\n\n\u201cEven though 16 gwei is neutral gas levels for Ethereum,\u201d Van Bourg says, \u201cwe\u2019re consistently averaging 50 to 150 gwei.\u201d As a result, ETH is highly deflationary at the moment, he says.\n\n\u201cAnd even if it does eventually die down,\u201d he says, \u201cthe ETH that\u2019s being burned as a result of this activity is never coming back.\u201d\n\nVan Bourg asks Felman, \u201cWhat does it mean for price, and what does it mean for supply and demand of block space? Is there an investment thesis there?\u201d\n\nEIP-1559 opened the monetary door\n\nFelman says the \u201cbest thing\u201d Ethereum ever did for itself was the implementation of EIP-1559, which made ETH as an asset more attractive for investment.\n\n\u201cIt opened the door for so much institutional capital to come into this space,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cI gave a talk last week at a conference that was filled with a lot of pension fund allocators, a lot of institutional allocators. I got an obscene amount of questions on it,\u201d Felman says.\n\n\u201cMy job,\u201d he says, was to \u201cteach these guys about what crypto is, cuz these guys knew, when I say nothing, I mean literally nothing, about crypto.\u201d\n\nFelman suggests Ethereum fee burns behave like traditional finance stock buybacks. Just as a company can buy back their own equity to indirectly increase value for shareholders, a fee burn can indirectly drive price action for anyone holding ETH. \u201cIf ETH annualizes out to $5 billion a year in burn fees, that\u2019s a pretty substantial \u2018buyback,\u2019 right?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd this is all during a bear market,\u201d he adds.\n\n\u201cThat really hit home for a lot of people.\u201d\n\nEthereum stands apart from other layer-1 protocols because of this formula, Felman says.\n\nOther layer-1s like Solana, he says, do not generate fees in the same way \u2014 and, importantly, do not burn fees to reduce supply. Alternative layer-1s as such do not \u201cgenerate revenue for their shareholders in the same way that Ethereum does,\u201d so \u201callocators are just way less likely to come in and buy it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause all eyes are on Ethereum, because that\u2019s where the speculative money is, because that\u2019s where the market participants are, they\u2019re able to charge those fees,\u201d he says.\n\nFelman compares the current attractiveness of Ethereum to the appeal of living in New York. \u201cYes, Manhattan\u2019s expensive, but it\u2019s expensive for a reason \u2014 because everybody\u2019s there, and everybody that you want to be around is already there.\u201d\n\nAnd the beauty of proof of stake is that all of those fees that are burned and all the fees that are generated, Felman says, \u201care now paid back to owners of the asset.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin Net Worth 2023: How Rich Is the Founder of Ethereum? - CoinCodex",
        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has an estimated net worth of more than $400 million, which takes into account one of his publicly known crypto wallets. However, Vitalik Buterin\u2019s net worth could be much higher, as his investments and other crypto holdings are not publicly known.\n\nWho is Vitalik Buterin?\n\nVitalik Buterin is a Russian-Canadian computer programmer best known as a co-founder of the Ethereum network. Image source: Michael Ciaglo/Getty Images\n\nVitalik Buterin is a co-founder of Ethereum and one of the leading figures in the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry. He was born in 1994 in Russia, but spent most of his early life in Canada. Buterin developed an interest in Bitcoin at a young age and became involved in the cryptocurrency community while still in high school. In 2011 he co-founded Bitcoin Magazine, which has often been referred to as the first serious crypto publication.\n\nIn the 2013 whitepaper \u2013 called A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System \u2013 he proposed the creation of Ethereum, a decentralized platform that would allow for the creation of smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps).\n\nButerin's vision for the Ethereum blockchain was to create a decentralized platform that would allow developers to build and deploy dApps on top of it. He believed that this would allow for greater transparency and security, as well as the ability to build applications that were not controlled by any single entity. The Ethereum team raised 31,500 BTC in their ICO, and the mainnet officially launched in 2015. It has since become one of the leading blockchain platforms in the world, with a market capitalization of roughly $150 billion as of December 2022.\n\nButerin is a highly influential figure in the cryptocurrency and blockchain community and is frequently sought out for his insights and opinions on the industry. He has received numerous awards and accolades for his work, including the World Technology Award for Information Technology in 2014 and the Peter Thiel Fellowship in 2014. Buterin has also been recognized as one of the top 100 most influential people in the world by Time Magazine.\n\nWhat is Vitalik Buterin's net worth in 2023? Examining the Ethereum founder\u2019s crypto wallet\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s crypto wallet.\n\nVitalik Buterin has a crypto wallet that holds $440,259,570 in different types of coins and assets, as of May 17, 2023. There are also 4,163 NFTs in the wallet, although their exact value is unknown.\n\nETH is the only significant crypto holding in Vitalik Buterin\u2019s wallet.\n\nIn total, Buterin\u2019s wallet has 682 different types of coins and tokens. The vast majority of the wallet\u2019s total funds is in Ethereum (ETH), with over $440 million.\n\nCryptocurrency Quantity Value in USD % of Tot. Assets Ethereum 244,001 ETH $440,282,744 ~99.9% 0xBitcoin 210,050 0xBTC $23,380 ~0.01% yfarm.finance 25 YFM $1,552 ~0.0004% Jetcoin 100,000 JET $261 ~0.0003% Pomi 2,000,000,000 POMI $120 ~0.0003%\n\nThe reason for the vast number of different types of digital currencies lies in the fact that random crypto holders are sending crypto funds to Buterin\u2019s publicly known wallet address. This explains extremely low holdings for certain tokens, like less than one penny of Constitution DAO, or a couple of dollars of Meta Doge, for instance.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, pinpointing Vitalik Buterin\u2019s net worth is virtually impossible due to the nature of private investments. However, an interesting exchange that happened on social media in November seems to suggest that Buterin\u2019s crypto wallet holdings and real fortune seem to be aligned.\n\n$1b is still much more than I have \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) November 9, 2022\n\nIn the immediate collapse of FTX, a Twitter user pointed out that Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s networth plunged to $1 billion, to which Buterin responded: \u201c$1b is still much more than I have.\u201d\n\nHow much Ethereum (ETH) does Vitalik have?\n\nButerin has 244,001 ETH in his wallet as of May 17, 2022, worth over $440 million. The highest number of Ethereum in Buterin\u2019s wallet was 325,001 and was recorded in July 2021, per Etherscan data.\n\nVitalik Buterin held as much as $1.5 billion worth of ETH in his wallet last November.\n\nThe recent crypto downturn has had a notably negative impact on Vitalik\u2019s net worth. At Ethereum\u2019s peak value last November, Buterin had more than $1.5 billion worth of ETH in his cryptocurrency wallet.\n\nVitalik\u2019s crypto ventures\n\nIn addition to Ethereum itself, Vitalik has been involved in a number of blockchain projects. Some of these include the L4 research group, which focuses on the scalability of blockchain technology, and the Plasma Group, which is working on ways to improve the scalability and security of Ethereum.\n\nButerin is also involved in other projects and initiatives, such as the Ethereum Foundation, which supports the development of Ethereum, and the Zcash Foundation, which supports the development of the Zcash (ZEC) privacy-focused cryptocurrency. On the whole, Buterin is a major contributor to the blockchain industry and is an advocate of decentralization, smart contracts, and open-source code.\n\nFinal thoughts: Vitalik Buterin controls the 31st-largest ETH address\n\nButerin is a well-known figure in the crypto space and is respected for his technical and philosophical contributions to the industry. He is widely regarded as one of the leading voices in the industry and his direct and deep involvement with Ethereum has made him one of the richest individuals in crypto.\n\nAccording to Etherscan\u2019s list of the largest Ethereum account balances, Buterin is placed number 31st and accounts for roughly 0.203% of all ETH in circulation. This makes him one of the largest individual ETH owners, at least in terms of the amount of funds deposited into a single account.\n\nButerin\u2019s crypto wallet holdings closely edge out the net worth of Justin Sun, another prominent crypto figure and the founder of the TRON cryptocurrency.\n\nOn a related note, give our article on Elon Musk's net worth a read if you want to find out how he became the first person in history to lose $200 billion."

The platform was also one of the first to experiment with so-called yield farming, distributing its native COMP token to the platform\u2019s users back in 2020. The token currently trades at $34.7 at press time.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nArbitrum is the industry\u2019s largest layer-2 scaling solution by total value locked (TVL), per data from L2 Beat. TVL refers to how much money is sloshing around in a given project or chain.\n\nCompared to other popular Ethereum scalers, like Optimism or zkSync, Arbitrum takes the cake at a whopping $5.8 billion.\n\nCompound III is live on @arbitrum!

Members of this market niche include Starknet, Polygon\u2019s zkEVM, and zkSync. The collective TVL for just those three projects is $320 million.\n\nBoth solutions leverage rollups, which batch transactions off of the Ethereum mainnet (hence the term layer-2) and then convert those batched transactions into a small piece of data.\n\nThis smaller piece of data, called a proof, is what Ethereum ultimately validates. In this way, the mainnet remains relatively uncongested, keeping gas prices on the network low."

        "title": "With ETH Remaining Dominant, Does ETC Have a Future? - Securities.io",
        "content": "Currently, the crypto industry is grappling with regulatory issues, with the US cracking down on crypto and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) not wanting to clarify its stance on crypto regulations while the UK is pushing for crypto to be classified as gambling.\n\nWhile addressing these local issues, a more expansive situation unfolds. On a macroeconomic scale, the US government is anticipated to run out of cash on June 1. Paradoxically, this looming reality is predicted to bolster risk assets. In tandem with this broad economic context, the cryptocurrency market is experiencing a resurgence. The market capitalization has increased by 1.2%, pushing the total value up to $1.18 trillion, indicating a positive response to these macroeconomic events.\n\nWhile Bitcoin is trading just above $27,000, the second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum, is exchanging hands at $1,826. According to cryptocurrency data provider Kaiko, the correlation between Bitcoin and Ethereum prices has reached its lowest point since 2021, standing at 77%, which can potentially enhance trading activity within BTC and ETH pairs going forward.\n\nAmong altcoins, ETC is also in the green in USD but is in the red against BTC and ETH. Let's take a look at Ethereum Classic and if it has a future!\n\nClick here to learn how to buy Ethereum Classic (ETC) in just four steps.\n\nThe Distinction Between Ethereum & Ethereum Classic\n\nEthereum is a layer 1 blockchain that pioneered smart contracts, the self-executing programs that automatically carry out certain functions when predetermined conditions are met.\n\nFirst proposed in 2013 by Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum was designed to expand the utility of cryptocurrencies by allowing developers to create their own special applications called \u201cdecentralized applications,\u201d or dApps.\n\nETH is the native token of the blockchain that is used for sending and receiving value globally without any third-party interference. The token powers the Ethereum ecosystem and is used to pay the gas fees, which refers to the amount of Ether that's needed to perform a certain function on the network, such as creating smart contracts, interacting with dApps, minting NFTs, and sending transactions.\n\nWhen it comes to Ethereum Classic (ETC), it was the result of the Ethereum network experiencing a hard fork in July 2016.\n\nThe original Ethereum blockchain was supposed to die out after the upgrade, but some users disagreed with the hard fork, arguing that immutability is one of the key points of blockchains and transactions shouldn't be reversed.\n\nThis split the chain into two and resulted in the creation of Ethereum Classic. When the separation first happened, those who held ETH at the time received the exact same amount of ETC tokens in their wallets for free.\n\nThe old chain, or Ethereum Classic, executed a number of upgrades to adopt a deflationary monetary policy with a hard cap of 210 million on the total number of ETC that will be created. This step was taken to make ETC more attractive than Ethereum and supposedly make it a better store of value as its tokens are scarcer. Ethereum, meanwhile, has no limit to how many Ether can enter circulation.\n\nThe key difference between the two has been their goals, specifically, Ethereum Classic's special focus on immutability and \u2018Code is Law'.\n\nHowever, much like Ethereum, Ethereum Classic is a decentralized computing system that can run a wide variety of applications. Additionally, ETC is its native currency, which is used to power smart contracts and transactions on its network.\n\nUsers pay gas fees in ETC which is rewarded to miners who solve \u201cproof of work\u201d puzzles. While ETC can be mined using widely-available graphics processors, you'd need ASIC miners and specialized devices designed for crypto mining to be profitable.\n\nClick here if you wish to learn more about this: ETH vs ETC \u2013 What You Should Know?\n\nWhat's the Price Doing? ETH & ETC Performance\n\nIn 2014, ETH was launched through an ICO, during which the project raised over $16 million by selling some 50 million ETH tokens at a price of $0.31 per coin.\n\nBetween the period of 2014 and March 2017, the token's price remained range bound between $0.70 and $21. But when the bullish momentum resurfaced in the second half of the year, ETH price spiked above $100 for the very first time. In June 2017, Ether went to hit $414 before correcting only for the bullish momentum to regain strength about five months later that not only sent ETH's price to $1,418 but elevated almost every crypto token to new highs.\n\nThree years later, ETH retested its previous all-time high (ATH) price only for Eth's price to more than triple to set a new ATH of $4,880. Currently, the $220 billion market cap ETH is down 62.57% from this peak but up 52.33% in 2023 so far.\n\nIn contrast, ETC's price surged to a peak of $42 during the 2017 bull run before crashing to a low of $3 during the crypto-wide bear market. Amidst the bull market of 2021, ETC's price soared to a new peak of $167 but has since lost almost 89% of its value. ETC is only up 17.76% YTD.\n\nWhile ETC has managed to rally some against USD, it is struggling against other cryptos. ETC is down 1.40% against ETH and 1.34% against BTC in the past year, while ETH is up in the green by 0.05% against BTC during the same period.\n\nAs of writing, the 27th largest crypto with a $2.6 billion market cap, ETC, is trading at $18.62 while managing about $69 million in 24-hour trading volume compared to the $6.6 bln volume recorded by Ethereum during this period.\n\nWhile up 1.8% in the past 24 hours, the ETC price is down by over 15% in the past month and more than 12% in the past year. For ETC to continue seeing bulls, the price must stay above the $15 support. For now, ETC's price seems to be consolidating between $18 and $25 and could break on either side.\n\nThe token, however, has resistance near the 200-day EMA, reflecting the downward trend. More importantly, the volume of the cryptocurrency is decreasing, and fewer participants are active.\n\nClick here to learn all about investing in Ethereum (ETH).\n\nETH Continues to Improve, While ETC is Stagnant\n\nEthereum constantly goes through upgrades to make it more efficient. Ethereum 2.0, also known as \u201cSerenity,\u201d is a major upgrade that aims to make it faster and more scalable by migrating the network from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms.\n\nIn Dec. 2020, by launching Beacon Chain, Ethereum completed Phase 0 of ETH 2.0, which introduced staking to the network. The network users lock up their coins to become validators instead of using expensive, energy-intensive mining equipment.\n\nEach staker needs to lock up 32 ETH, or they can join a staking pool to combine their Ether with others to participate in creating new blocks on the Ethereum PoS blockchain.\n\nBeacon Chain was launched separately from the Ethereum blockchain, that's also responsible for transaction verification, staking rewards, and managing new Ethereum blockchains called \u201cshard chains.\u201d\n\nOn Sept. 15, 2022, Ethereum executed The Merge, marking the completion of its transition to the PoS system. Then in April 2023, with the Shapella upgrade, the network finally allowed for the unlocking of staked Ether.\n\nNext in line for Ethereum development is sharding, which creates multiple mini-blockchains. After this, further tweaks will be made to enhance the network's security.\n\nRecently, Ethereum reached a new milestone by locking away more than 20.5 million ETH, worth $37.4 billion, amidst the recent withdrawals. In addition to 18.28% of ETH supply being locked, a portion of gas fees is also being burned daily, which together makes ETH a deflationary asset.\n\nWith Ethereum's increasing popularity and adoption, the demand for ETH will likely rise while its supply continues to decline. This can potentially drive up ETH's price.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum Classic has no such plans to migrate to the PoS system and intends to keep traditional mining on its own blockchain. However, Ethereum Classic hasn't stopped its attempts to grow its network and join the latest trends of DeFi and NFT.\n\nSeveral projects have built on Ethereum Classic, namely Wrapped ETC, TurbineSwap, ghostNFT, Shiba Classic, ETCPlanets, SHP, Billionaire Boys Classic, ClassicHeroes, MVRSWood \u2013 Become Metaverse Degen Royalty, Matrixport, SoyFinance, Fusion, Nova USD Stablecoin, MonkeyDoo, ClassicDAO, ETCswap, Multichain, CoinRabbit, The Man Who Sold The World Metaverse, Canonical Wrapped Ether, Classic Rewards, Nft List, Lazy, ETC Bit Pixel, MoonLama, HENS, Token Factory, SwapCat, ETCZunks, and ETC HODL Contract.\n\nHowever, ETC's development and usage activity is nowhere near Ethereum, the most used blockchain and home to billions of dollars in assets.\n\nAccording to DeFi Llama, Ethereum Classic has less than $240k in total value locked (TVL), down from $1 million in August 2022, with HebeSwap accounting for over 94% of it. But ETC's TVL is immensely dwarfed by Ethreum's impressive $27.22 billion TVL, reflecting just how far behind the network is in the DeFi race.\n\nWhat Does the Future Hold?\n\nEthereum is a clear winner as Ethereum Classic has struggled to compete with Ethereum in every facet, be it market capitalization, developers, and network security since its creation.\n\nOn top of it all, throughout its history, Ethereum Classic has been subject to numerous \u201c51% attacks,\u201d also known as a double-spend attack. In such an attack, malicious actors control a majority of the mining power and, as a result, can spend coins they didn't actually own.\n\nWhile Ethereum Classic doesn't really have a thriving community, Barry Silbert, the CEO of Digital Currency Group, who was an early driving force behind ETC following the initial split, announced its plans to buy $50 million in shares of Grayscale's Ethereum Classic Trust (ETCG) in 2021. Currently, there are $218.6 million in assets under management (AUM) in the trust.\n\nDespite this, the future of Ethereum Classic (ETC) is uncertain due to the continued dominance of Ethereum (ETH). While ETC has a small community and offers a similar blockchain technology, it faces challenges in terms of market adoption and developer support.\n\nWith its larger network effects, extensive ecosystem, and ongoing development, ETH remains the preferred choice for most projects and investors. ETC's future depends on its ability to differentiate itself and attract users and developers, but it may struggle to compete effectively against ETH's established position in the market, as seen over the past many years.\n\nClick here to learn how to buy Ethereum (ETH) in just four steps."

        "content": "Is 2023 a good time to buy Ethereum, and how do investors feel about it?\n\nCynthia Madison, at Content Creator\n\nCynthia Madison, at Content Creator\n\n18.05.2023 12:00 pm #Financial\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation after Bitcoin, accounts for almost 20% of the $1.1 trillion global crypto market, making it one of the safest long-term bets if you are looking to diversify your portfolio with digital currency. While last year was defined by market turbulence and 2023 is no short of political developments, economic events, and other unforeseen occurrences, jumping off the plane and panic selling or making irreversible changes to an investment portfolio is not the go-to method to prevent losses among seasoned investors. Historically, markets do eventually bounce back after downturns, meaning that those who overreacted and sold their assets can't benefit from market rebounds.\n\nBefore discovering where Ethereum is going in 2023 and what events are going to bring positive media exposure, it's worth mentioning last year's highlights. Many cryptocurrency owners were caught off-guard several times in 2022, more precisely when FTX filed for bankruptcy and Luna Crash collapsed and rushed to sell their assets to recover some of the money invested. 2023, however, started on a positive note with cryptocurrencies prices surging, and following a period of downturns and dips, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies are finally witnessing a bullish momentum. Prices might recover slowly but hopefully surely, which is why it would make more sense now than three months ago to buy Ethereum .\n\nDespite the turbulence experienced last year in the cryptocurrency market, Ethereum remains one of the safest long-term bets for investors willing to weather the ups and downs of this volatile world. Let's discover the most important aspects impacting Ethereum this year so you can make informed decisions if you want to buy the dip.\n\nPhoto source: https://unsplash.com/photos/L2QB-rG5NM0\n\nIs it a good time to invest in Ethereum?\n\nAfter a bad year for the cryptocurrency market, 2023 started more positively. Ethereum prices have reached new highs in recent weeks, and coin issuance is once again deflationary, with 66,000 ETH reducing supply. This is due to the switch from Proof-of-Stake to Proof-of-Work in September 2022, when the long-awaited Merge upgrade is finally released. Owing to the new consensus mechanism, a fraction of Ethereum is being burned, turning it into a deflationary asset once again, after fluctuating between deflationary and inflationary over the years. This is good news for crypto enthusiasts looking for scarce virtual assets.\n\nA \"deflationary\" currency is one that sees its supply decrease over time, contrasting \"inflationary\" currencies, where the supply grows. Notably, deflationary currencies appeal to cryptocurrency enthusiasts, as they believe the scarcity will increase the value of their assets. Some cryptocurrencies' supply decreases over time, meaning their value grows if demand stays constant. Binance Coin (BNB), for instance, burns tokens quarterly to limit the supply and ensure a maximum of 200.000 coins. However, owing to burning events, the current BNB supply is lower.\n\nWhy are investors optimistic about Ethereum?\n\nSeveral things impact a cryptocurrency's price and must be considered when looking to add digital coins to your investment portfolio. Among the most important are the news and media exposure surrounding it. Whether now is a good time to buy the dip is debatable and depends on the investor. What's for sure is that Ethereum has gained quite a lot of good media exposure owing to the past upgrades that followed the highly anticipated merger of the Ethereum Mainnet and the Beacon Chain PoS system. Nevertheless, the impact of the Merge was not necessarily reflected in the cryptocurrency's value, but in a better global perception of the network, as it reduced energy consumption by more than 99.99%, according to Ethereum.org.\n\nThe Shanghai Upgrade, the next major event for Ethereum, will take place around April 12 and finally enable users to withdraw their staked ETH. Significant improvements like these may benefit the token's value thanks to improved scalability and efficiency for the network. Investors believe that the Ethereum price, which has recently risen, will skyrocket following this long-awaited upgrade.\n\nHow to approach Ethereum investments in the next period?\n\nThere are several types of investors, including those seeking to take advantage of market crashes to make investments at bargain prices, like billionaire Warren Buffet. On the other hand, sceptics are pessimistic about the revival of an asset when its value is low, so they choose to stay away from it.\n\nWhile it's true that Ethereum has yet to reach its all-time high of November 2021, this isn't a reflection of the future. This token, just like its counterparts, went through challenging situations. Even though nothing can guarantee that they ended just because 2023 started on a positive note, buying at a discount can be a smart move for those believing in the potential of digital currency.\n\nWhether Ethereum will experience similar returns again is uncertain. But since its price is two and a half times lower than its 2021 peak, investing in it at a bargain price is worth considering. Even if it doesn't see momentous returns, approaching its all-time high again could bring significant yield.\n\nFinal take\n\nDespite the turbulence experienced last year in the cryptocurrency market and the whole financial system, Ethereum remains one of the safest long-term bets for investors looking to diversify their investment portfolio with cryptocurrency. Those willing to weather the ups and downs of this volatile world may reap the benefits of patience in the bear market. However, nothing and no one can guarantee financial returns, especially in such volatile markets. Plus, investing in cryptocurrency requires thorough research on cryptocurrency options and a deep understanding of your long-term goals and risk tolerance. To establish the latter, consider your behavioural tendencies and what you would do when seeing your asset's value drop.\n\nEthereum has been having a good year so far, but only time can tell where it will be in the future. Ensure you are informed when you start investing in cryptocurrency, use common sense, and only spend money you can afford to lose."

Data from The Block revealed a 113% increment in the count of daily active addresses on the chain.\n\nAssessed on a month-over-month (MoM) basis, Solana recorded a total of 7.72 million active addresses in April.

        "title": "The 3 Types of Cryptos That Could Outperform Bitcoin This Year - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Even with its recent pullback from the $30,000 price level, Bitcoin remains one of the top-performing cryptos of 2023. It is up 65% this year, and it's hard to find any large market-cap coins that can top this.\n\nBut savvy investors know it's best not to put all your eggs into one basket. If you are looking to diversify your crypto portfolio, here are three types of digital coins that could outperform Bitcoin this year.\n\n1. Potential Ethereum replacements\n\nWhile Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) continues to be the dominant Layer 1 blockchain in the crypto world, there are plenty of up-and-comers that hope to dethrone it. Three rivals that stand out are Solana, Aptos, and Fantom. Both Solana and Aptos are up more than 100% this year, and Fantom is not too far behind, at 93%.\n\nJudging from their performance, investors are not entirely convinced that Ethereum is going to retain its dominant role in so many key blockchain sectors, ranging from non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to decentralized finance (DeFi). While The Merge helped to improve the speed, efficiency, and scalability of the core Ethereum blockchain, these blockchain rivals are still much faster and cheaper. That has huge implications in areas such as DeFi, where users are looking for near-zero fees and near-instantaneous settlement of transactions.\n\nOf these Ethereum rivals, my personal pick is Solana, which has been out-innovating Ethereum of late. For example, Solana recently launched the first-ever mobile phone for a major blockchain network (the Saga) and has been exploring new initiatives to leverage all the hype and excitement around artificial intelligence, including a new plug-in for ChatGPT. For Solana to outperform Bitcoin, it will need to show that mobile crypto and crypto AI are sustainable, long-term growth catalysts.\n\n2. Scaling solutions for Ethereum\n\nIf you are looking for a less risky way to outperform Bitcoin, then blockchain scaling solutions for Ethereum could be the answer. Simply stated, these scaling solutions sit on top of the main blockchain and help Ethereum process transactions faster and cheaper.\n\nFor that reason, they are referred to as Layer 2 solutions (i.e., they are the second layer on top of the base Ethereum layer). Each scaling solution uses its own form of proprietary technology to accomplish its goals, so it can sometimes be difficult to differentiate among these different solutions.\n\nIf you buy into the idea that these Layer 2 coins are essential to the future success of Ethereum, then there are a few key prospects to target, including Immutable, Optimism, and Polygon. The name that's probably most familiar to investors will be Polygon, which has been making waves recently with new NFT initiatives, including a high-profile partnership with Nike to create an entirely new NFT marketplace for digital sneakers. However, if you are craving maximum upside potential, a better pick might be Immutable, which is up a mind-blowing 99% this year.\n\n3. Cryptos that help people stake on Ethereum\n\nLastly, there are a growing number of cryptos that help people stake on Ethereum. Now that Ethereum has transformed from a proof-of-work blockchain into proof of stake, this is tremendously important. Crypto staking is suddenly big business, and investors are always looking for ways to earn the highest staking rewards possible.\n\nThe two big names to watch here are Lido DAO, which is up 95% this year, and Rocket Pool, which is up 157% this year. Both emerged from relative obscurity after The Merge due to the popularity of staking, and both now currently rank in the Top 50 cryptos in terms of market capitalization.\n\nWhich of these is the best buy?\n\nThe common theme of all three categories of cryptos detailed above is that they somehow involve Ethereum. The first category, for example, includes all those capable of displacing Ethereum one day as the preeminent Layer 1 blockchain. The second category includes all digital currencies helping Ethereum scale bigger and faster. And the third category includes all cryptos that involve staking on Ethereum.\n\nSo if the prospect of picking winners and losers in niche areas of the blockchain space seems too daunting, the classic buy-and-hold crypto is Ethereum, which is up a not-too-shabby 52% this year.\n\nBut if you're looking for a little extra turbocharging for your portfolio, then my best picks would be Solana and Polygon. I'm long-term bullish on both of them, and I still regard both as best-in-class for their respective blockchain categories."

Discover SCENE\n\nNFT marketplace Blur is growing by leaps and bounds.\n\nWith the launch of Blend, Blur\u2019s new lending platform, it\u2019s hit yet another milestone.\n\nData per Dune, now shows that Blend has facilitated more than 100,000 ETH in total volume, or roughly $181 million, just 17 days since its launch.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBlend lets users take out Ethereum loans by putting their NFTs up as collateral. They can then use this loan to purchase new NFTs on the Blur marketplace. In return, liquidity providers receive interest, a mechanism that\u2019s spawned the \u201cNFTfi\u201d niche in crypto.\n\nTotal volume on Blend in ETH. Source: Dune .\n\nThough the project racked up more than 3,000 loans from 900 unique lenders, adding Bored Apes Yacht Club (BAYC) and Mutant Ape Yacht Clube (MAYC) collections on Monday fueled further enthusiasm among NFT collectors.\n\nThese collections were added to the four collections previously available, Azuki, Wrapped Cryptopunks, DeGods, and Miladys.\n\nBAYC and MAYC accounted for a total volume of 2,267 ETH on day one. On Wednesday, BAYC was the third-most traded collection on the platform with a volume of 3,082 ETH, just behind Azuki (4,616 ETH) and Wrapped Cryptopunks (2,260 ETH).\n\nAzuki remains the top collection in total volume, having exceeded 50,000 ETH, which is nearly half of the total volume since the service was created.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCurrently, Blend does not take any fees from either borrowers or lenders. However, Blur has indicated that token holders could vote to implement fees after a 180-day period.\n\nBlur\u2019s bumpy start\n\nLaunched just last fall, Blur quickly became the most popular NFT marketplace, representing nearly 59% of the total NFT transaction volume to date.\n\nHowever, some suspect the platform of harboring wash trading operations, especially amid the platform\u2019s token launch.\n\nAccording to analyst Hildhobby, Blur indeed only accounted for 14,575 traders, compared to 46,353 on Opensea.\n\nAt the end of February, CryptoSlam, a platform for tracking NFT sales, announced that it would remove $577 million worth of Blur trades from its data due to \"market manipulation.\" The platform also said that it will filter future Blur trades on its platform through an updated algorithm that excludes what it sees as suspicious sales.\n\nNevertheless, the success of Blend only strengthens Blur's position, which seems set to establish itself in the long run as a major player in the NFT ecosystem."

Ethereum's genesis event was a public crowdsale that occurred in July and August 2014, where investors purchased ETH in exchange for Bitcoin.\n\nThe whale's Ethereum balance at the time of the tweet was 6.751 ETH, valued at approximately $12,288.33, based on Ethereum's current value. The whale's most recent transaction was recorded about six hours prior, and it's the same transaction in which the 4,032 ETH stake was made.\n\nWhether this activity is indicative of a larger trend among Ethereum ICO participants, or an isolated event, only time will tell."

        "content": "Asking one of the most advanced A.I systems for its analysis on the future price of Ethereum (ETH), ChatGPT predicted a value of $3,500 by the end of 2023. However, the true question is if HedgeUp (HDUP) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) will hit $1 as that would mean a much larger ROI for investors.\n\nThe Bold Ethereum (ETH) Prediction \u2013 Is It Reliable?\n\nCan we trust that ChatGPT\u2019s prediction of Ethereum (ETH) at $3,500 by 2023 is reliable? The question remains difficult to answer as the cryptocurrency market is unpredictable and subject to many external factors.\n\nThe success of Ethereum (ETH) is dependent on its network\u2019s ability to progress, its adoption rate, and the demand by investors. It is also important to consider if Ethereum (ETH) can stay ahead of its competitors. Ethereum (ETH) is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap so its future success is certainly worth considering.\n\nEthereum (ETH) reaching $3,500 is possible as the ATH has been above that and if a bull run is expected Ethereum (ETH) could reach that price. Ethereum (ETH) recently upgraded and there is a growing demand for the Ethereum network, so the prediction of ChatGPT could be accurate and reliable.\n\nIt is also worth noting that Ethereum (ETH) has already seen an impressive increase in its price over the past few months and could continue to trend upward as more investors buy into cryptocurrencies.\n\nHedgeUp (HDUP) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) \u2013 An Analysis By Humans\n\nAlthough it\u2019s interesting to use ChatGPT for price predictions, a more accurate analysis of HedgeUp (HDUP) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) must be done by humans. That\u2019s because HedgeUp (HDUP) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are unique cryptos that are new to the market and are still in their early stages.\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) \u2013 Meme-Based Momentum?\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) was created in 2020 and has been gaining a lot of attention recently due to its meme-based marketing campaign and its large community. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently trading at $0.000008743. So, Shiba Inu (SHIB) reaching $1 is unlikely. Shiba Inu (SHIB) does not have the fundamentals for sustainable growth. The only way Shiba Inu (SHIB) reaches $1 is if investors get lucky and it skyrockets for no obvious reason.\n\nHedgeUp (HDUP) \u2013 An Emerging Hero For Investors\n\nAs a more sound investment opportunity, HedgeUp (HDUP) has the potential to reach $1. This is because the platform is built on blockchain technology and uses NFTs. HedgeUp (HDUP) is also backed by physical alternative assets, like fine art, commodities, and collectibles. These investments are more likely to give consistent returns in the long run.\n\nSo, as early investors of HedgeUp (HDUP), as more people enter the platform, the price could rise dramatically and reach the $1 mark. The 30% presale bonus gives a headstart to early investors, so there could be a lot of growth potential.\n\nFind out more about the HedgeUp (HDUP) presale here:\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Best Cross-Chain Bridges in Crypto - DailyCoin",
        "content": "Cross-chain bridges are an essential instrument in your DeFi toolbox. As the cryptocurrency industry expands at a dizzying rate, being able to shift your funds across different blockchain networks securely helps you explore new ecosystems easily.\n\nDespite what the maxis tell you, no one chain will rule them all. There are hundreds of different networks in the Web3 world, each with its unique identity and decentralized applications.\n\nStaying fixated on just one chain, like Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH), will significantly limit your opportunities within the crypto market. The need for interoperability between networks has never been higher.\n\nWhat exactly are cross-chain bridges, and why should I use them? Are blockchain bridges safe?\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll explain why bridging between blockchain ecosystems is such a valuable skill and why cross-chain interoperability is so important for the growth of the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nWhat Is a Cross-Chain Bridge?\n\nA cross-chain bridge is a blockchain-based application that allows users to transfer digital assets and data from one network to another. For example, you can bridge ETH tokens from the Ethereum mainnet to the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), which has lower gas fees.\n\nIn the true spirit of DeFi (decentralized finance), crypto bridges are permissionless, meaning anyone with a crypto wallet can access them and transfer tokens without being intercepted by centralized authorities.\n\nMost bridges use a \u2018Lock and Release\u2019 function, similar to how wrapped crypto assets like wBTC work.\n\nImagine each blockchain is an island. When you initiate a token transfer, you deposit cryptocurrency onto the bridge from one side. The bridge application locks your deposit into its wide liquidity pool and releases an equal number of the same tokens to your wallet on the destination chain, or new island.\n\nWhile it may sound surprising, the same token can exist simultaneously on multiple networks. An easier way to think of it is to imagine apps in a mobile phone. Underneath the hood are slight differences between the Twitter app on Android and the Twitter app on iOS. However, the average end user isn\u2019t bothered by the technicalities.\n\nWhy Would I Want to Use a Cross-Chain Bridge?\n\nUsing various networks is a great way to learn about blockchain technology and its use cases. While the Ethereum network has far more dApps than other chains, every blockchain has its own thriving ecosystem, with exclusive applications, tokens, and NFTs.\n\nUser experience varies from chain to chain, with some networks being much more affordable than others. For example, the Ethereum blockchain is plagued with scalability issues. A token swap might cost upwards of $50 in transaction fees, while the same swap on Polygon would only cost you a few cents.\n\nBridging tokens to emerging chains is another excellent way to qualify for crypto airdrops. Sending a handful of ETH tokens and interacting with a handful of smart contracts on Arbitrum netted some users thousands of dollars worth of ARBI.\n\nBest Cross-Chain Bridges\n\nNow that you\u2019re clued up on why bridging over to exciting new blockchains is worthwhile pursuit, let\u2019s take a look at some of the best cross-chain bridges in crypto. While there are hundreds of directional bridges and cross-chain swaps, it\u2019s essential to know what to look for.\n\nThe top cross-chain crypto bridges should provide the following:\n\nA good variety of networks and tokens.\n\nSecure transfer of assets.\n\nAn easy-to-use interface.\n\nLet\u2019s see who made the list!\n\n1. Synapse\n\nThe Synapse Bridge is one of the most trusted cross-chain bridges in the crypto space. With a simplified UI that resembles a basic DEX (decentralized exchange) and over one million users, Synapse protocol is a popular choice for first-time bridges.\n\nThe platform offers a wide variety of ERC-20 token standards and EVM-compatible blockchain networks. What\u2019s great about Synapse is that it also supports several popular stablecoins, like USDT and USDC.\n\nSynapse also converts a small percentage of your transfer to the destination chain\u2019s native cryptocurrency. For example, when you bridge to the BSC, a smart contract in the dApp automatically provides you with a small amount of BNB to pay the first few gas fees as you explore the chain.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nUser-friendly design.\n\nMillions of users.\n\nFast transfer of assets.\n\nOffers staking.\n\nSupported networks: Ethereum, Arbitrum, Avalanche, BNB Chain, Optimism, Polygon, Aurora, Boba, Canto, Cronos, DFK Chain, DogeChain, Fantom, Harmony, Klaytn, Metis, Moonbeam, Moonriver.\n\n2. Portal (Wormhole)\n\nThe Portal bridge is the epitome of interoperability. While most other bridges are limited to transfers between EVM-compatible networks, Portal takes things one step further.\n\nWith Portal, crypto enthusiasts can bridge digital assets between alternative Layer-1 blockchains that don\u2019t use an EVM. These include popular PoS (Proof-of-Stake) chains like Aptos and NEAR. This gives experienced chain-hoppers greater flexibility than other cross-chain bridges and opens immense opportunities.\n\nIf that wasn\u2019t enough, Portal also supports NFT bridging. Like wrapped tokens, tokens can be locked and minted on other chains. A famous example of this was when HGE.SOL, a Solana NFT whale, fractionalized and bridged 50 cryptopunks to the Solana blockchain.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nSupports transfers between EVM and non-EVM networks.\n\nBridge ERC-721 tokens (NFTs).\n\nSupported networks: Acala, Algorand, Aptos, Arbitrum, Aurora, Avalanche, BNB Chain, Celo, Ethereum, Fantom, Injective, Karura, Klaytn, Moonbeam, NEAR, Oasis, Optimism, Polygon, SUI, Terra, XPLA.\n\n3. Multichain (formerly Anyswap)\n\nPreviously known as Anyswap, Multichain truly lives up to its old name. This cross-chain bridge offers the widest breadth of networks of any application in the crypto space.\n\nWithin Multichain\u2019s spread of 92 different blockchains are the classic chains we all know and love, with a multitude of other networks most people haven\u2019t even heard of.\n\nMultichain also supports NFT wrapping and bridging, as well as cross-chain swaps and staking services. If Multichain had one fault, its user experience is comparatively sluggish and unintuitive.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nThe crypto industry\u2019s range of integrated networks.\n\nNFT wrapping and bridging.\n\nPopular supported networks: Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, Arbitrum, Fantom, Optimism, Cardano, Solana, Aptos, NEAR, Moonbeam, Cronos, Telos, Fuse, Litecoin, Bitcoin.\n\n4. Polygon Bridge\n\nWhile the Polygon bridge has far fewer integrations than other members of this prestigious list, it brings its own X factor. Designed by Polygon Labs, the Polygon Bridge is explicitly built for products and services within its native ecosystem.\n\nIt enables users to bridge cryptocurrencies like ETH, MATIC, and popular stablecoins between the Ethereum mainnet and the Polygon sidechain. Most importantly, it is the first official application with a bi-directional bridge to the Polygon zkEVM chain.\n\nLike everything built by Polygon Labs, the Polygon Bridge has been designed with simplicity and mass adoption in mind and boasted a beginner-friendly interface.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nAccessible user interface.\n\nOfficial access to Polygon zkEVM.\n\nSupported networks: Ethereum, Polygon, Polygon zkEVM.\n\n5. Avalanche Bridge\n\nDesigned by AvaLabs and Core, the Avalanche Bridge serves various functions. Not only does it facilitate the transfer of assets between the Avalanche C-Chain and other networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum, but it\u2019s also used internally within the Avalanche ecosystem.\n\nWhat many users don\u2019t understand about Avalanche is that the network is comprised of three separate blockchains, X-Chain, P-Chain, and C-Chain. While most DeFi and NFT enthusiasts are only interested in the C-Chain, blockchain engineers often use the other two chains for development.\n\nAvalanche bridge developers expect to introduce further support for more ERC-20 tokens in the future.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nOfficial bridge of the Avalanche Ecosystem.\n\nConnects users to internal Avalanche chains.\n\nSupported Chains: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Avalanche C-Chain, and other internal chains.\n\nWhat Happened to Binance Bridge?\n\nUntil recently, the Binance Bridge was one of the industry\u2019s largest and most popular cross-chain bridges. It appears that the Binance Bridge is either currently unavailable or discontinued.\n\nThe most recent publication from Binance mentioning their bridge indicates that an updated V2 bridge was rolled out in March 2020. However, visiting the application encourages users to either transfer tokens internally through the Binance exchange or use an alternative platform.\n\nBinance recommends using AnySwap, which rebranded to Multichain in 2021.\n\nAre Crypto Bridges Safe?\n\nFor all the wonder and excitement that cross-chain bridges bring, there are some risks. Blockchain bridges are notoriously complicated at an architectural level, making them a common target for hacks and exploits. In fact, over $1.4 billion was stolen through crypto bridge hacks in 2022.\n\nBridge hacks are devastating, with some networks never truly recovering from a catastrophic attack. Since hackers drained the Harmony Horizon bridge and disappeared with over $100 million in crypto, the Harmony network has struggled to recapture its former glory.\n\nEven the most popular and reputable bridges are liable to make mistakes, and blockchain security audits always look good until a malicious hacker finds a chink in the code.\n\nTo keep yourself safe in the crypto space and protect your funds, you should always revoke any approvals confirmed in your wallet after using a bridge. This only takes a couple of seconds with sites like Revoke.cash, and might protect you from getting your entire crypto portfolio stolen in a bridge hack.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nBridging tokens is a great way to explore dApps and NFT collections on different blockchain networks. However, the Web 3 world is plagued with user experience issues, making this a daunting and intimidating task for first-timers.\n\nBeyond that, bridge hacks are the most common exploit in the crypto space, so please revoke token approvals after bridging to protect your wallet\u2019s integrity.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nThe cryptocurrency industry is growing at a startling pace. The variety of innovative dApps, products, and services in a cross-chain world is staggering and opens a world of opportunity to those willing to explore emerging ecosystems. Many Ethereum NFT maximalists refused to buy DeGods because they couldn\u2019t be bothered bridging to Solana. Today, they\u2019re some of the most valuable NFTs in the market.\n\nFAQs"

The answer could be ERC-6551, which will provide seamless interactions and functionality.\n\nERC-6551 was created to address a limitation on ERC-721 tokens. Before, ERC-721 tokens couldn't act as owners of other on-chain assets or perform actions like an Ethereum account. This limited their usefulness in the real world.\n\nTo overcome this, ERC-6551 introduces token-bound accounts (TBA) \u2014 unique smart contract accounts associated with each ERC-721 token. These accounts are created through a permissionless registry and come with all the capabilities of an Ethereum account, allowing for more practical and user-friendly interactions.\n\nStart now\n\nThe benefits of ERC-6551\n\nWhile the token standard is still new, since its release on May 7, 2023, it has offered a much-needed rewrite to NFTs, making them more dynamic and interactive.\n\nImproved capabilities: TBA can be used to engage with other smart contracts and dApps, opening up near endless possibilities for NFTs.\n\nTBA can be used to engage with other smart contracts and dApps, opening up near endless possibilities for NFTs. Greater interoperability: TBA is compatible with other Ethereum standards, which makes it easier for NFTs to be used across different platforms.\n\nTBA is compatible with other Ethereum standards, which makes it easier for NFTs to be used across different platforms. Enhanced user friendliness: The key to mass adoption is to keep both crypto natives and the crypto curious in mind. TBA makes it easier for users to manage their NFTs and can be accessed from any web3 wallet.\n\nThe limitations of ERC-6551\n\nWhile getting caught up in the excitement of a new token standard is normal, doing your own research to get the full picture is also essential. With that in mind, there are some limitations with ERC-6551.\n\nHigh gas fees: The gas fees associated with ERC-6551 can increase, especially during periods of network congestion. This can make it expensive to use ERC-6551 NFTs.\n\nThe gas fees associated with ERC-6551 can increase, especially during periods of network congestion.

Limited compatibility: While this new token standard is exciting, it's essential to know not all wallets and platforms support ERC-6551.\n\nWhile this new token standard is exciting, it's essential to know not all wallets and platforms support ERC-6551. Lack of awareness: ERC-6551 is a new standard and is not yet widely known. Only some users know of it and how to use it. What's next for ERC-6551\n\nERC-6551 unlocks new possibilities for NFTs, going beyond their conventional uses. For example, NFTs can now become repositories for in-game wearables and digital items, enhancing user immersion and familiarity. Additionally, PFP (Profile-for-Proof) projects can incentivize collectors by rewarding token bound account holders. Finally, having multiple token bound accounts and support for multiple chains further enhances the utility and stimulates innovation in the NFT ecosystem.\n\nStart now\n\nDisclaimer: THIS ARTICLE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.

        "title": "Australian CBDC trials execute first FX transaction - Ledger Insights",
        "content": "Yesterday, blockchain startup CANVAS announced the successful execution of its central bank digital currency (CBDC) trial in Australia, using the eAUD to test foreign exchange (FX) transactions.\n\nTokenized FX settlements hold significant benefits, including round-the-clock trading and instant payments. The test is part of a series of pilots conducted by the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Digital Finance Cooperative Research Center (DFCRC).\n\nDetails of the FX transaction\n\nDuring the trial, the eAUD was exchanged for the USDC stablecoin between DigitalIX and TAF Capital on an Ethereum layer 2 solution. This allowed the transaction to be settled instantaneously without sacrificing privacy, scalability, and regulatory compliance.\n\nAccording to the team, another crucial aspect of their solution is that participants always maintain control and custody of their assets.\n\nKey benefits\n\nThe test also demonstrated the advantages of tokenized settlements compared to traditional FX trading and international remittance networks, including 24/7 trading and atomic (instant) payments. This removes the counterparty risk.\n\n\u201cThe eAUD, as a CBDC, holds the potential to address crucial challenges in both FX and International Remittance Markets such as improving transaction times, reducing fees, and providing more open access,\u201d said David Lavecky, CEO at CANVAS.\n\n\u201cWe believe that CBDCs, Digital Securities and Tokenized Assets will radically transform finance and markets over the next decade. Our use case demonstrates the benefits of using CBDCs in tokenized FX transactions and how our privacy focused Layer 2 blockchain provides improvements over traditional markets by eliminating market inefficiencies, errors, and settlement risks.\u201d\n\nAustralia\u2019s CBDC Pilots\n\nCANVAS\u2019 project is one of 15 selected use cases in the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s CBDC pilot. The list includes major names, such as Mastercard, which will explore the use of eAUD on a public blockchain, as well as others like Intuit, ANZ and Commonwealth Bank. It also involves a wide variety of applications, ranging from offline payments and CBDC custodial models to nature-based asset trading and livestock auctions.\n\nA Layer 2 Ethereum solution\n\nThe public Ethereum blockchain has benefits, such as decentralization and a large user base. However, transparency can be a disadvantage in payments and the core blockchain lacks scalability.\n\nHence, the CANVAS Connect blockchain used for the FX transaction is a Layer 2 ZK-Rolllup scalability solution based on Starkware\u2019s StarkEx, which is used by DeFi platforms such as dYdX and the Sorare fantasy sports platform.\n\nCANVAS was keen to emphasize that it is privacy enabled. All that\u2019s stored on the main Ethereum network is a transaction hash like a fingerprint. At the second layer, only the parties to the transaction can see the details by default. However, CANVAS confirmed permissioned access to the data for regulators and the government for AML purposes.\n\nUnsurprisingly the central bank is using a permissioned blockchain for its CBDC issuance. While StarkEx solutions can be permissioned, CANVAS Connect is an open network targeted at financial services and hence is designed to incorporate KYC and AML."

        "title": "Why Ethereum Price Could Struggle in the Near Future? - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Despite the recent surge, Ethereum price could still struggle in the short term\n\nEthereum is the second largest cryptocurrency in the world. It\u2019s also one of the best altcoins, and went on a massive bull run in 2021 and increased by almost US$4,000 at its highest, reaching its current all-time high (ATH) of US$4,840. The coin has made new lows since then. At the time of writing, the live Ethereum price is US$1,823.23, (more than 60% down from its ATH).\n\nWith Ethereum Merge, many investors thought that 2023 could be an excellent year for ETH. As it meant to allow Ethereum to implement sharding, which, amongst other exciting improvements, will supercharge transaction speeds on the network. Here is why Ethereum price could struggle in the near future:\n\nGas prices and network issues\n\nEthereum\u2019s high gas prices have always been a subject of discussion in the crypto sector. Over the last few days, due to the hype around memecoins, gas prices on the Ethereum network surged. The Ethereum network is experiencing problems caused by surging gas fees, the cost associated with transactions, including those performed by smart contracts.\n\nDevelopers have come out and explained the reasons as to why the issues on the network occurred. According to one of the developers, Potuz, \u201cthe Ethereum network experienced a 25-minute loss of finality due to several valid but untimely attestations being broadcast. This stressed consensus clients, especially those on weaker hardware, causing them to struggle while following the chain.\u201d\n\nEthereum price prediction\n\nEthereum\u2019s value decreased in 2022 to US$1,781, but most experts predict that the price will rebound in the future. Here\u2019s a long term Ethereum price prediction from experts below:\n\nWallet Investor, an algorithm-based crypto-asset prediction website, projected that ETH\u2019s price could grow to over US$10,000 in November 2023 and even reach US$16,391 by the end of 2025.\n\nThe same was said by DigitalCoin, which predicts that the ETH price will average around US$7,569 in 2025 before rising to US$16,858 in 2028.\n\nAccording to net, Ethereum is forecasted to reach an average price of US$18,213 in 2025.\n\nConclusion\n\nUndoubtedly, much of the crypto market is very bullish on Ethereum price prediction. The coin is an essential part of the industry and without it, many of the top applications and services that have risen to popularity in the last few years would not be here today.\n\nOf course, not everyone feels the same and there are plenty of reasons some investors will not touch ETH. You don\u2019t necessarily have to agree with them, but you must hear them out. You should be fully aware of ETH\u2019s pitfalls as well as its benefits.\n\nDespite these bullish fundamentals, Ethereum could still struggle in the short term. Recently, ETH tapped into the US$1800 resistance zone after a surge in buying activity. With prices looking extremely overextended, ETH will likely fall to between US$1775 and US$1925 in the coming days and weeks. From there, ETH could tumble even further if adverse macroeconomic conditions worsen.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

It\u2019s especially tough for centralized crypto exchanges, which have seen tremendous regulatory pressures.\n\nThe environment is so fragile that centralized exchanges face scrutiny for everything they do. For example, Coinbase has just suspended ETH staking reward withdrawals amid its beef with the SEC.\n\nCoinbase Halts ETH Staking Reward Withdrawals\n\nCoinbase, the second-largest centralized crypto exchange in the world, announced on Tuesday that it had suspended ETH staking reward withdrawals.\n\nThe exchange said the halt was due to a \u201ctechnical issue\u201d the team had already identified.

Two prominent Ethereum whales, identified as 0x6071 and 0x7641, sold a combined total of 19,090 ETH, amounting to roughly $35.7 million. This massive sell-off comes after the Ethereum Foundation offloaded 15,000 ETH ($29.7 million) to Kraken.\n\nThe considerable sales have triggered a wave of selling activity, resulting in a notable effect on Ethereum's price, which dropped from $1,900 to $1,850 in a matter of hours. As Ether currently hovers around the 50-day moving average, investor uncertainty and conjecture are on the rise. The latest moves by Vitalik Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation have left numerous individuals pondering the future of the cryptocurrency and the consequences of such extensive selling on the market.\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) holders benefit from another phase of meme coin euphoria\n\nDespite the recent purchase of over 10.25 trillion Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens by large buyers, the price of Shiba Inu (SHIB) continues to decline. The substantial volume of purchases failed to prevent an 8% drop in Shiba Inu (SHIB) price over the past week, marking the third consecutive week of decline.\n\nOne possible explanation for this paradox is the rise of the Pepe (PEPE) meme token, which gained incredible momentum and reached a $1.66 billion market cap within the same three weeks.\n\nIt appears that PEPE may have diverted liquidity from Shiba Inu (SHIB), contributing to its ongoing price drop.\n\nJoin Presale: https://buy.yachtify.market\n\nWebsite: https://yachtify.market\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/yachtify"

        "title": "Ganache Blockchain: All you need to Know - Blockchain Council",
        "content": "Difference between Ganache and Truffle\n\nGanache and Truffle are two popular tools developers use to make their lives easier when developing smart contracts. While both tools have unique features, they also have limitations, making it essential to understand when to use them.\n\nGanache: A Personal Blockchain for Testing Smart Contracts\n\nGanache is a personal Blockchain that allows developers to create a private Ethereum network to test their smart contracts. It offers all the functionalities of the leading Ethereum network without the costs associated with deploying and testing arrangements on the main network. Ganache provides developers with advanced mining controls and a built-in block explorer, making testing and inspecting smart contracts during development easier.\n\nHowever, Ganache has its limitations. Since it is a private network, it does not accurately mimic the actions of miners on the primary grid. This can cause issues when developers need to test the behavior of smart contracts that depend on miner actions. Additionally, the gas limit on the leading network is a moving target that can change, making it important to be mindful of the potential for issues when using exact numbers in Ganache.\n\nTruffle: A Developer Environment for Building Smart Contracts\n\nTruffle is a development environment, testing framework, and asset pipeline for Blockchains. It provides developers with a project structure, files, and directories, making deployment and testing much more accessible. Truffle also allows developers to spin up a smart contract project at the click of a button, streamlining the development process.\n\nOne of the main advantages of TruffleTruffle is that it is not limited in terms of the features it provides, as it simply provides a framework for developers to sculpt their projects. However, TruffleTruffle offers different control over Ganache\u2019s Blockchain network, which can disadvantage developers who need a more customized testing environment.\n\nChoosing the Right Tool for Your Smart Contract Development\n\nUltimately, the choice between Ganache and Truffle depends on the needs of the developer and the requirements of the smart contract project. Developers who require a more customized testing environment with advanced mining controls may find that Ganache is the better option. On the other hand, developers who need a more streamlined development process with a robust project structure may find Truffle is the better choice. Understanding the differences and limitations of these tools is vital for making the right decision for your smart contract development needs.\n\nHow to get started with Ganache\n\nGanache is a popular smart contract development platform that simplifies the complex process of building smart contracts. This platform allows developers to test their smart contracts without spending Ether on the main Ethereum network. This article will provide a step-by-step guide on downloading, installing, and using Ganache to develop smart contracts.\n\nDownloading Ganache\n\nTo start using Ganache, go to the Truffle Suite website and search for the \u201cDownload\u201d option for Ganache. Downloading a suitable file format compatible with your operating system is essential. The file versions for Ganache and the specific operating systems they are consistent with are as follows:\n\nWindows: Ganache-*.appx\n\nLinux: Ganache-*.AppImage\n\nMac: Ganache-*.dmg\n\nAfter downloading the file, double-click to launch the installation process. You can efficiently complete the installation procedure by following the on-screen instructions.\n\nConfiguring Ganache\n\nOnce the installation is complete, you can configure your local Blockchain by clicking the \u201cQUICKSTART\u201d button on the Ganache UI. This action will start a new Blockchain with ten accounts preloaded with 100 fake Ether each. Adjusting the settings allows you to set the network to suit your needs.\n\nUsing Ganache\n\nAfter configuring the local Blockchain, you can use Ganache to develop and test your smart contracts. The Ganache UI provides advanced mining controls, allowing you to mimic various mining scenarios to test your smart contracts. You can also inspect the current state of your Blockchain using the built-in block explorer.\n\nGoogle Analytics Tracking\n\nWhen downloading Ganache, you will be asked to confirm your decision to allow Google Analytics to track your activities. The development team can gather insightful data on how developers use Ganache by allowing Google Analytics tracking. This data helps the team identify areas that require improvement and make adjustments to enhance the platform\u2019s performance.\n\nAnonymous Tracking\n\nIt is essential to note that account information and private keys are never shared during Google Analytics tracking. Therefore, the data collected is anonymous, and no personal information is shared with third parties.\n\nGanache simplifies innovative contract development by providing developers with a testing platform mimicking the Ethereum leading network. The platform\u2019s user-friendly interface and advanced mining controls make it easy for developers to test and deploy their smart contracts. Developers can quickly build and deploy smart contracts by downloading, installing, and using Ganache.\n\nWhat to do after installing the Ganache?\n\nWhile we have already discussed the installation process in great detail, there are specific steps before you can enjoy the functionalities of this Blockchain thoroughly. You may know some of them as we discussed in brief about them in the installation itself; now we will delve into them in detail.\n\nDeveloping the workspace\n\nWhen you install Ganache, you can create a workspace to get started. When you open Ganache for the first time, you can create your custom workspace or use the default options for a one-click Blockchain. You can quickly start a one-click Blockchain by selecting the Ethereum or Corda network from the QUICKSTART drop-down option. Once you choose your preferred option, click the QUICKSTART button again to create your workspace. In your workspace, you can expect to find a user-friendly interface that allows you to test your smart contracts, execute commands, and explore blocks. It\u2019s an easy way to get started with Blockchain testing!\n\nDifferent workspaces\n\nSeveral workspaces depend on the Blockchain you use to develop your application. Multiple options, like Ethereum, Corda, and Solidity, are among the most famous workspaces. In this section, we will discuss the Ethereum and Corda workspace in detail, as they are easy to understand and use for beginners.\n\nEthereum Workspace and its Settings\n\nWhen you create an Ethereum workspace on Ganache, you\u2019ll see a bunch of information about the server. The default view shows all the accounts created and how much fake ETH each one has. There\u2019s also a page showing all the blocks mined on the Blockchain, with details about the transactions and fees involved. The events page lists all the events that have been started since the workspace was created, and the transactions page shows all the transactions on the network. There\u2019s also a page that shows the server logs, which can be helpful for debugging. And finally, there\u2019s a contracts page that lists all the contracts included in the workspace. If you need to find a specific transaction or block, use the search box at the top of the UI.\n\nEthereum\u2019s workspace settings\n\nThe Ethereum workspace on the Ganache Blockchain testing network has several necessary settings for developers.\n\nThe first one is called workspace, which allows you to name your workspace and see which Truffle projects are linked.\n\nAnother important setting is Accounts & Keys, which lets you create new accounts and specify whether to use a specific mnemonic or one created by Ganache.\n\nThe Advanced setting in Ganache allows developers to enable Google Analytics to track usage data.\n\nThe Server set provides information about the network connection, such as hostname, network ID, and port. It also lets developers choose whether to automatically mine each transaction in one block.

        "title": "25-Min Ethereum Cold Wallet Issue Peeks Briefly As Big Eyes Coin's Stage 3 Price Returns - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "On May 11, panic filled the air as the Ethereum mainnet pressed pause for about 25 minutes. Though brief, it left users and developers on the edge of their virtual seats. Amidst the brief chill, Big Eyes Coin emerges with a mischievous wink. The Big Eyes team has unveiled a delightful surprise for their devoted token holders: the return of its affordable $0.00017 price from Stage 3!\n\nEthereum\u2019s Mainnet Briefly Froze For 25 Minutes!\n\nThe Ethereum mainnet, Beacon Chain, unexpectedly decided to take a breather on Friday. During this time, blocks were in the process but failed to go through. Users and developers were on edge, afraid of the risk of transactions being altered due to the issue.\n\nEthereum core developers swiftly took to the Twitterverse to announce that the blockchain wasn\u2019t finalizing. After about 25 minutes, the Ethereum mainnet was finalizing blocks again. A clear reason behind the malfunction is still unknown.\n\nThe Beacon Chain is Ethereum\u2019s original proof-of-stake blockchain, officially breaking ground on September 15, 2022.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Enduring Popularity\n\nA similar issue to the recent mainnet crash arose on March 15, causing a delay in the Goerli Testnet version of Ethereum\u2019s \u201cShapella\u201d upgrade. However, the upgrade was successfully executed on the mainnet on April 12.\n\nDespite this, and a few other mishaps before this, how is Ethereum still so popular? Simple: Ethereum has the network effect and first-mover advantage hallmarks in its arsenal. The network effect essentially ensures Ethereum\u2019s power as more cryptocurrency firms use its blockchain and follow its smart contract protocols. Meanwhile, the first-mover advantage refers to Ethereum\u2019s edge by being the first to introduce a programmable blockchain that enables the development of decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts.\n\nBig Eyes Coin \u2014 Ethereum-Based Crypto\n\nEthereum has been the shining savior of crypto startups, including Big Eyes Coin. This decentralized meme project uses the Ethereum Request for Comment 20 (ERC-20) protocol, which solidifies its stance in the crypto industry, where it can promote affordability, transparency, and interoperability on its own.\n\nWhat is Big Eyes Coin?\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG), the emerging Ethereum-based meme project, has been hitting big goals since its first presale. Now on its 13th one, the BIG presale funds are at about $36.8 million. Due to this exceptional milestone and the plea of its community, Big Eyes Coin will officially close its presale journey on June 3! Less than a fortnight from that, this meme project will launch on Uniswap on June 15, 2023.\n\nIn a bold move to cement its position as more than just a passing meme coin, Big Eyes Coin reveals that it will launch its own Online Casino and Play-to-Earn (P2E) Games, scheduled for August 29, 2023. This groundbreaking initiative allows users to convert their crypto assets into Big Eyes tokens and enjoy an extensive selection of over 4,000 thrilling games.\n\nAnd, just recently, it announced that token holders can now trade and invest in BIG for only $0.00017. This generous offer lets users enjoy $BIG at a lower price!\n\nEthereum is an incredibly powerful cryptocurrency that houses a library of digital assets. But, as evidenced by its mainnet issue, it is not without challenges. Nevertheless, its slew of upgrades and potent community make it a powerful cryptocurrency. Inarguably, it helps lay a sturdy groundwork for platforms like Big Eyes Coin to soar high and unveil ingenious solutions to their cherished users.\n\nFor All Things Big Eyes Coin (BIG)\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/BigEyesCoin/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/BigEyesCoin\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "How To Transform Physical Art into NFT Art? - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are digital representations of unique and scarce assets that can be bought, sold, and traded on the blockchain. NFTs have become a popular way for artists to showcase and monetize their work and for collectors to own and appreciate digital art. But what if you have physical art that you want to turn into NFTs? How can you transform your paintings, sculptures, or drawings into digital assets that can be verified and valued on the blockchain?\n\nDigitize the artwork: Begin by digitizing the physical art using a high-resolution scanner or a professional photographer. Ensure that the digital image captures all the details and colors accurately.\n\nEdit and enhance the digital image: Use image editing software like Adobe Photoshop or GIMP to make any necessary adjustments to the digital image. This may include adjusting the brightness, contrast, and colors, and removing any imperfections or blemishes.\n\nChoose an NFT platform: Select a suitable NFT platform where you can mint and sell your NFTs. Popular NFT platforms include OpenSea, Rarible, SuperRare, and Foundation. Each platform has its guidelines and requirements, so familiarize yourself with the platform of your choice.\n\nSet up a digital wallet: Create a digital wallet compatible with the chosen NFT platform. Most NFT platforms operate on Ethereum, so you will need an Ethereum-compatible wallet like MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Follow the wallet provider\u2019s instructions to set up and secure your wallet.\n\nMint the NFT: Once you have your digital wallet set up and connected to the NFT platform, you can proceed to mint your NFT. This typically involves providing details about the artwork, such as its title, and description, and attaching the digital image file. You may also set the desired price or choose an auction-style listing.\n\nPay the minting fees: Minting NFTs on most platforms requires paying a transaction fee, known as \u201cgas fees,\u201d in the native cryptocurrency (usually Ethereum). Confirm the transaction and pay the fees from your connected wallet. The fees cover the cost of storing the NFT on the blockchain.\n\nConfirm the minting process: Once the transaction is processed, the NFT will be minted and assigned a unique token ID on the blockchain. You\u2019ll receive confirmation from the NFT platform, and the artwork will be publicly available for viewing and purchase.\n\nMarket and sell your NFT: Promote your NFT art through social media, art communities, and various online platforms. Utilize the features provided by the NFT platform, such as creating collections or participating in community events, to attract potential buyers. Engage with collectors and art enthusiasts to build interest in your NFT art."

        "content": "While the Ledger Recover is completely optional, the company noted that those who opt-in will have their key phrases stored by 3 different parties on cryptographically-secure Hardware Security Modules.\n\nThe community was outraged by the update since Ledger has in the past been compromised leading to phishing attacks on users.\n\nThe Ledger hardware wallet is under harsh scrutiny after enabling a software update that could leak crucial security data. In the latest firmware update dubbed version 2.2.1, the Paris-based company announced a new feature called Ledger Recover to ostensibly help users backup their seed phrases with a third party through an ID-based system.\n\nAvailable in several markets \u2013 including the European market, Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom -the software update has been dubbed controversial as Ledger had previously marketed its services as a non-sharing private key platform.\n\nAs a result, most of the Ledger Wallet users have been outraged by the firmware update, which could cause losses of billions of dollars. The Ledger hardware wallet has in the past been compromised exposing crucial customers\u2019 data. The Ledger data breach led to a phishing attack on the affected users.\n\nWith the latest update, which is touted as optional, most Ledger users are skeptical of storing high amounts of digital assets in fear of backdoor attacks. Furthermore, it is only a matter of time before the third party sees phrase recovery companies are compromised leading to losses in billions of dollars.\n\nOne Twitter user @oklahodl1 shared a video of a Ledger Nano X being destroyed after the firmware update announcement. Several similar videos have emerged on different social media platforms as Ledger users urge others to ditch the hardware wallet.\n\nLedger in Defense\n\nAfter a huge uproar by the crypto community, Ledger has defended the firmware upgrade stating that it is optional. According to Ledger CTO, Charles Guillemet, the company remains focused on self-custody and will never have or create a backdoor on users\u2019 wallets.\n\nLedger Recover is an optional subscription for users who want a backup of their Secret Recovery Phrase. You don\u2019t have to use it, and can continue managing your recovery phrase yourself if that\u2019s why you bought a Ledger,\n\nFurthermore, Guillemet noted that the sharing of users\u2019 secret key phrases happens in a secure channel to the three different companies. Notably, the encrypted fragments are stored by three different parties on cryptographically-secure Hardware Security Modules.\n\nIf you choose to subscribe, Ledger Recover encrypts a version of your private key and splits it into three fragments (using Shamir Secret Sharing) \u2013 all of this happens on the Secure Element chip, so your Secret Recovery Phrase is not at risk. \u2014 Ledger (@Ledger) May 16, 2023\n\nThe company has fragmented the key phrases into three different third parties to help strengthen self-custody. Furthermore, the individual encrypted fragments are completely useless since they cannot access a wallet without users\u2019 verification. \u201cWhen you want to restore your keys, 2 of these 3rd parties will send back their fragments to your Ledger device (and not us as an organization), which will be able to reconstitute your Secret Recovery Phrase,\u201d Ledger added.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

        "content": "With the new Layerswap solution, users of Coinbase and other leading crypto-exchanges will now be able to transfer funds to zkSync Era, the Layer-2 protocol that scales Ethereum with cutting-edge ZK technology.\n\nCoinbase, Kraken, KuCoin: traders can access zkSync Era thanks to Layerswap\n\nLayerswap announced its integration with zkSync Era, which will allow users to transfer funds from a variety of sources, including Coinbase, to zkSync Era in minutes.\n\nIn addition to Coinbase, Layerswap\u2019s list of crypto-exchanges also includes KuCoin, Kraken, Binance.US, Huobi, Bittrex, Bitfinex, and others.\n\nHence, thanks to Layerswap\u2019s new seamless solution, users will be able to make frictionless transfers of tokens such as ETH, USDC, LRC, from 17 exchanges to 16 networks, and transfers from 9 networks to CEXs, as well as cross-chain transfers.\n\nMoreover, with the new integration with zkSync Era, Layerswap aims to join the huge growth being experienced by the Layer 2 protocol scaling Ethereum with cutting-edge ZK technology.\n\nCoinbase and the connection to the zkSync Era ecosystem\n\nOverall, the zkSync Era project has been funded to the tune of $458 million by the Ethereum Foundation and other venture capitalists such as a16z, Dragonfly, Coinbase Ventures, Blockchain Capital, and others.\n\nSince its launch, zkSync Era has seen a huge surge in network activity, the highest that any Ethereum scaling solution has ever experienced in such a short period.\n\nAs Messari points out, zkSync Era\u2019s growth in Q1 2023 was greater than even Polygon\u2019s zkEVM in terms of TVL (or Total Value Locked in DeFi).\n\nIn the few weeks since the launch of@zksync's Era and @0xPolygon's zkEVM, the zkSync ecosystem has been growing at a rapid pace.\n\n\n\nAt the end of Q1, zkSync had nearly $200M in TVL across its ecosystem while Polygon\u2019s zkEVM had seen little adoption in comparison. pic.twitter.com/FT5aGf1CQg \u2014 Messari (@MessariCrypto) May 14, 2023\n\nzkSync\u2019s new Layer 2 scaling solution can scale Ethereum without compromising network security, offering fast, low-power transactions.\n\nNot only that, zkSync is also part of the rollup category, which are those blockchain innovations that allow a group of transactions that occur off-chain to be wrapped, validating only one transaction made in the main substrate.\n\nThe future airdrop of zkSync Era\n\nRecently, there has been an analysis of everything there is to know about a future airdrop of zkSync Era.\n\nFirst, it is worth mentioning that the zkSync technology was invented by Matter Labs, the company that set out to scale Ethereum through Zero-Knowledge proofs, so as to maintain the principles of freedom and decentralization.\n\nCurrently, there are two versions of zkSync, the 1.0 version called zkSync Lite and the 2.0 version called zkSync Era, which, unlike the former, offers the ability to implement smart contracts.\n\nThat said, in order to achieve a future airdrop of zkSync Era, it is deemed appropriate, for those who have not already done so, to transfer some of their ETH onto the two blockchains. Using MetaMask\u2019s self-custodial crypto-wallet, it will be possible to transfer one\u2019s ETH to zkSync Lite and zkSync Era."

        "title": "How EigenLayer Is Going To Revolutionize Blockchain Security - Blockzeit",
        "content": "Blockchain technology has transformed the way we conduct transactions online. With the rise of decentralized finance, the security of these networks has become more important than ever. Enter EigenLayer or Eigen, a restaking protocol that is poised to change the way we think about blockchain security.\n\nWe've led the $50M Series A financing of @eigenlayer!\n\n\n\nFounder @sreeramkannan is a technical visionary who's revolutionizing our ecosystem.\n\n\n\nMore on our thesis. \u2193 pic.twitter.com/ozO9F8PbDw \u2014 Blockchain Capital (@blockchaincap) March 28, 2023\n\nWhat is EigenLayer?\n\nAccording to its maker, EigenLabs, EigenLayer is a blockchain utilizing a protocol based on the security-as-a-service (SECaaS) concept. It rehypothecates or puts back to work staked Ethereum to provide security for other, newer projects. This means that the Ethereum network is being used to secure other projects, providing an added layer of security to the entire blockchain ecosystem.\n\nHow Does EigenLayer Work?\n\nThe Ethereum network uses a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism to secure the network. This means that validators can join the network by staking 32 ETH and they can earn an ETH-denominated yield as a reward according to Decrypt. However, if a validator fails to do its job or behaves maliciously, it will be penalized, and a portion of its staked ETH will be taken away.\n\nEigenLayer goes beyond staking Ethereum by reusing staked ETH to enhance security for other blockchain projects. This also enables stakers who participate to earn a higher yield and benefit from the success of multiple projects. Likewise, it makes it more convenient for developers to deploy their projects with the confidence that they are backed by a secure and reliable network.\n\nFor added context, there\u2019s a total of 20 million Ethereum staked right now to keep its blockchain secure. This involves the participation of over 625,000 validators. As of writing, a unit of ETH is trading over $1,800.\n\nStatus of EigenLayer\n\nAs of March this year, the team behind this platform, EigenLabs, has already raised $50 million in a Series A round. The funding round was facilitated by Blockchain Capital, which is a venture firm focused on the blockchain industry.\n\nThe new protocol was praised by none other than Joseph Lubin, the co-founder of Ethereum. In his tweet, he stated that the work that EigenLabs is doing now puts them at the forefront of the \u201cmost exciting work\u201d happening in the Ethereum blockchain. Additionally, he expressed his support to Sreeram Kannan, the founder of EigenLayer, and the rest of the team behind the new platform.\n\nThe Eigen Labs team is at the forefront of some of the most exciting work happening in Ethereum. @etherealvc is proud to have supported @sreeramkannan and the @eigenlayer team since inception. https://t.co/WP6qu5rW5z \u2014 Joseph Lubin (@ethereumJoseph) March 29, 2023\n\nBenefits of Restaking Early with EigenLayer\n\nSo far, there\u2019s no definite timeframe for the launch of the EigenLayer Mainnet, but there are indications that it\u2019s drawing near. With that, EigenLabs promises the following benefits to those who choose to restake their ETH to EigenLayer before its launch:\n\n1. Secured Spot\n\nBy restaking early, users can secure their place within the EigenLayer ecosystem and gain an advantage over those who wait to restake. This can help them maximize their staking opportunities and potentially earn greater rewards over time.\n\n2. Skip the Withdrawal Queue\n\nNative restakers identified by their 0x00 prefixes get to bypass the withdrawal queue and directly connect their validators to EigenLayer\u2019s contracts, which could potentially streamline the process of withdrawing staked tokens.\n\n3. Maximize Staking Opportunities\n\nIt allows users to enjoy the earliest possible access to restaking on services that launch on EigenLayer. Some services may cap their initial restake amounts, so restaking early can help early adopters to take advantage of these more flexible opportunities.\n\n4. Access to Premium Services\n\nThose who choose to restake early with EigenLayer can take advantage of a variety of exclusive benefits, including access to curated working groups with EigenLabs, operators, modules, and other restakers. This will enable them to stay informed about the latest developments and network with other important players in the EigenLayer ecosystem.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nEigenLayer is an innovative protocol that promises to revolutionize the blockchain industry. By utilizing a restaking mechanism, it aims to provide an added layer of security to the entire blockchain ecosystem.\n\nWith its promising benefits, such as a secured spot, skipping the withdrawal queue, maximizing staking opportunities, and accessing premium services, early restakers can enjoy greater rewards over time. As the EigenLayer Mainnet launch draws near, restaking early could prove to be increasingly advantageous.\n\nOverall, EigenLayer is a project to watch out for, and it could potentially transform the way we think about blockchain security."
