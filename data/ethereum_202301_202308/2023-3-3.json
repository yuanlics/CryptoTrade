        "title": "What Is the Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade? - Investopedia",
        "content": "The Ethereum Shanghai hard fork upgrade in March 2023 is designed to give Ethereum cryptocurrency network users access to their staked ether (ETH) funds for the first time, which is a major change for the platform.\n\nThese assets have been allocated toward Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake (PoS) Beacon Chain network backbone, so the move will allow ETH holders to stake the tokens without locking them up indefinitely, perform transaction validations, and receive rewards of newly created tokens.\n\nEthereum is a decentralized global software platform powered by blockchain technology that has been advancing at a steady pace since its launch in 2015. Now, the network is set to change significantly again with the Shanghai upgrade.\n\nKey Takeaways The Ethereum cryptocurrency network\u2019s so-called Shanghai upgrade is a hard fork slated to launch in March 2023.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade will let holders of ether (ETH), Ethereum\u2019s native token, unstake the assets for the first time, giving them greater access to their holdings.\n\nEthereum surpassed 500,000 validators on its network, which is a large number considering that stakers\u2019 ETH assets are locked up.\n\nEthereum\u2019s development team will focus its attention on sharding, or database partitioning, and other important changes after the Shanghai upgrade is completed.\n\nWhat Is the Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade?\n\nIt\u2019s important to understand the history of recent events at Ethereum before diving into the Shanghai upgrade. This major upgrade is, after all, the culmination of what came before.\n\nThe Ethereum network is designed to be scalable, programmable, secure, and decentralized. It is the blockchain of choice for developers and ventures creating technology based upon it to change how many industries operate and how we conduct our daily lives.\n\nEthereum started off with a proof-of-work (PoW) validation mechanism but began its journey toward PoS with the launch of the Beacon Chain in December 2020. This was a new era for Ethereum, with the Beacon Chain coordinating user staking, which is only possible on PoS systems, on Ethereum. The contract for the Beacon hit its target of 524,288 ETH a week before the launch.\n\nStaking gives crypto holders a way of putting their digital assets to work and earning passive income without selling the assets, similar to putting money in a high-yield savings account. When someone deposits funds, the bank takes the money and often lends it out. In return for locking up that money, the account holder is given a small portion of the interest earned from lending.\n\nIn September 2022, the Ethereum Merge joined Ethereum\u2019s PoS Beacon Chain with the Ethereum Mainnet to transition the Ethereum blockchain off the legacy PoW system. The merge gave birth to Ethereum 2.0, a new version of Ethereum that will lead to a 99.95% reduction in Ethereum\u2019s energy consumption and the ability to further scale its ecosystem.\n\nOver several months, the merge went through many testnet checks before eventually being completed\u2014a development that made the Ethereum network a PoS one. The event was covered in both the crypto industry and the mainstream media.\n\nHowever, one sizable issue remained: cost. The minimum amount of ETH required for staking to join the Beacon Chain was 32 ETH. The price of ETH, at the time, was about $4,000 (it traded around $1,550 on March 3, 2023). That $128,000-equivalent entry point was beyond the reach of most individuals, but at least it was the start of a more democratic PoS mechanism for Ethereum.\n\nAt that time, staked ETH couldn\u2019t be unstaked\u2014which is what the Shanghai upgrade changes. This left users\u2019 ETH funds locked until they could be released.\n\nSome teams in the crypto industry saw opportunities to address this issue. Several projects in the space began working on a more accessible way to stake on Ethereum. Called liquid staking, this allowed individuals to contribute smaller amounts of ETH, receiving a token that represents their staked ETH value. This token can be traded freely and used elsewhere, and in that sense is liquid.\n\nSome of the most popular liquid-staking options are offered on the platforms Lido, Coinbase, and Rocket Pool. Lido has especially been popular and accounts for the vast majority of the liquid-staked ETH.\n\nUnderstanding the Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade is actually a series of upgrades for the Ethereum network, and, collectively, their effects are significant.\n\nThe scheduled March 2023 launch was preceded by the Shandong network test, or testnet, in 2022. Shanghai comprises several upgrades, but the most impactful one allows ETH stakers to remove both their staked ETH and the rewards accrued. This has long been sought by Ethereum users and the crypto community at large. This change is established in the EIP-4895 proposal.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade also has several other proposals related to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Object Format (EOF), which is a software component of all EVM-compatible blockchains that contains more than 120 operation codes that give decentralized programmability to the networks. However, developers have said that if these can\u2019t be implemented in time, they will be postponed until later in the year to avoid delaying the unstaking of ETH.\n\nNotably, one of the proposals that won\u2019t be present in the March 2023 release is EIP-4844. This proposal introduces what the team calls \u201cproto-danksharding,\u201d which sets up the highly anticipated sharding upgrade for Ethereum due in 2024. This proposal will increase scalability by sharding data, which is a database-partitioning technique used to enable platforms to process more transactions per second.\n\nEthereum has been experiencing some heavy deposit activity in the lead-up to the Shanghai upgrade. The platform\u2019s total validators surpassed 500,000 validators in mid-January 2023\u2014a sizable figure, given that ETH can\u2019t yet be unstaked.\n\nMetaMask also has joined in, with the wallet integrating both Lido and Rocket Pool so that their users can stake ETH directly from their MetaMask wallets, once the Shanghai upgrade is complete.\n\nWhat Will Change with the Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade?\n\nMore than $17 million in ETH was staked after the Ethereum Merge, as of March 2023, so that likely means many individuals will want to unstake their ETH. However, there will be a cap of around 43,200 ETH per day for withdrawal amounts. That way, there won\u2019t be a large migration of validators out of the network.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see the price of ETH rise after a successful upgrade. This has happened in the past, and, so far, everything looks on track for the Shanghai hard fork.\n\nWhat Does the Future Hold for Ethereum?\n\nEthereum\u2019s future amounts to much more than its switch to proof of stake. The platform\u2019s developers have systematically analyzed the changes that the network needs, not rushing into alterations, in an attempt to ensure that everything is in place for a successful upgrade.\n\nAllowing stakers access to their ETH will eliminate this concern about Ethereum for the crypto community. The development team can then turn its attention to something even more important for Ethereum\u2019s success: the introduction of sharding. Ethereum\u2019s scalability goals ultimately will determine if the network becomes the future of finance, as many have projected.\n\nWhat is Ethereum? Ethereum is a decentralized global software platform powered by blockchain technology. It is most commonly known for its native cryptocurrency, ether (ETH).\n\nWhat is Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade? When is it scheduled to happen? The Ethereum Shanghai upgrade is actually a series of upgrades for the Ethereum network, and, collectively, their effects are significant. Perhaps most impactful is that this scheduled update will give ETH token holders access to their staked assets, a major change for the network and its users. It\u2019s set to launch in March 2023.\n\nWhat improvements will Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai update bring? The biggest improvement is that users will be allowed to unstake their ETH. The Shanghai upgrade also has several other proposed changes related to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Object Format (EOF), which is a software component of all EVM-compatible blockchains that gives decentralized programmability to the networks. And it sets the stage for sharding later, which should add scalability and faster transaction processing for Ethereum.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nEthereum enthusiasts and the crypto market in general should welcome the changes coming from the Shanghai upgrade. It is a relatively small step for the project, but it paves the way for many more major adjustments ahead.\n\nFor the crypto movement, the Shanghai upgrade stands as the next major milestone for Ethereum, forever altering how it operates and giving staking users new access to their ETH assets."

        "content": "The expected launch of the Shanghai hard fork has been delayed from late March to the first two weeks of April, according to Ethereum developers at a meeting on Thursday.\n\nSee related article: Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai Mainnet moves one step closer as \u201cShadow Fork\u201d goes live\n\nFast facts\n\nThe Shanghai hard fork will be the first major upgrade since the \u201cMerge\u201d last September. A hard fork is a permanent split between a new blockchain and its latest version, often adding or fixing features of a network.\n\nThe Shanghai fork will allow validators to withdraw their locked Ether for the first time since the staking feature went live in 2020. Over 17 million Ether (about US$26.7 billion) has since been staked.\n\nDuring the meeting, core developers agreed that the hard fork should occur at least two weeks after the \u201cGoerli testnet launch,\u201d which has been scheduled for March 14.\n\nThe \u201cShanghai Capella\u201d upgrade to Goerli, one of Ethereum\u2019s popular testnets, will be the last chance for Ethereum clients and staking providers to ensure the Shanghai hard fork can go through smoothly when the final \u201cmainnet\u201d version launches.\n\n\u201cSo imagine Goerli happens on the 14th, everything goes well, and on the 16th, we agree to move forward with mainnet \u2013 I think the earliest that puts us is like the first week of April,\u201d said Ethereum core developer and project coordinator Tim Beiko.\n\nBeiko noted in a Thursday Twitter thread that the Ethereum team did not explicitly agree to a mainnet date.

        "content": "What happened\n\nMany cryptocurrencies continued to slide today as investors digest the fallout from the crypto bank Silvergate Capital (SI -2.94%) and evaluate its ability to stay in business.\n\nThe price of the world's largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC 0.58%), is trading 4.3% lower than late yesterday afternoon as of 10 a.m. ET today. The price of the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum (ETH 0.33%), is roughly 4.1% lower, while the price of the meme token Shiba Inu (SHIB 0.09%) is down 5.8%.\n\nSo what\n\nAfter the market closed Wednesday, Silvergate submitted a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), stating that it would need to delay the filing of its annual report as it analyzed the impact of several events on its business.\n\nSilvergate operates a real-time payments network for U.S. dollars that crypto exchanges and institutional traders use to better facilitate crypto transactions. The network is very helpful for the crypto ecosystem because cryptocurrencies trade around the clock and the U.S. banking system operates on a lag.\n\nBut the scandal-laden bankruptcy of FTX, which had been a large client of Silvergate, prompted a bank run, and Silvergate saw nearly 70% of its digital-asset-related deposits leave the bank in the fourth quarter of 2022. The bank had to sell a big chunk of its bond portfolio, while it traded at a loss, to cover the deposit outflows, wiping out a big chunk of shareholder equity. Furthermore, many investors believed Silvergate could face some severe regulatory action due to its relationship with FTX, and media outlets have reported that the U.S. Department of Justice is looking into the bank.\n\nIn its filing with the SEC, Silvergate said it continued to sell bonds at a loss in January and February and that its capital levels could now be below regulatory requirements as a result. Furthermore, Silvergate is also currently assessing the impact of regulatory inquiries and investigations into the bank. All of this has led the bank to assess its \"ability to continue as a going concern.\"\n\nYesterday, some of Silvergate's major clients, such as Coinbase (COIN 0.78%), announced they would stop using the bank, and Silvergate's stock fell a whopping 58% and is down nearly an additional 11% today, trading around $5 per share. Although most cryptocurrencies fell yesterday, they held up decently given the news. Today, however, investors seem more worried.\n\n\"The bearish turn could certainly be a delayed reaction to Silvergate's ongoing issues,\" said Clara Medalie, director of research at Kaiko, according to CNBC. \"Many large exchanges and market makers partner with Silvergate for fast transactions between entities, and any halt in activity could have an impact on global crypto liquidity.\"\n\n\"In addition, there are now wider industry concerns that U.S. regulators are trying to cut off further banking relationships between crypto firms and FDIC-insured banks,\" Markus Thielen, the head of research at digital asset platform Matrixport, told Cointelegraph.\n\nNow what\n\nFederal banking regulators have issued multiple statements warning banks about the risks associated with certain crypto activities, and another large crypto bank, Signature Bank (SBNY), has also scaled back its crypto activities.\n\nThe news is of industrywide interest because services provided by Silvergate help exchanges, traders, and others easily change dollars to crypto and vice versa.\n\nI still think the largest cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, will be here for a long time and that people will continue to be able to swap them for fiat currencies. However, I have no interest in meme tokens like Shiba Inu right now."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price has been rejected from a significant resistance level following the turmoil surrounding Silvergate. However, there are still multiple support levels available to hold the price for now.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy: Edris\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nOn the daily timeframe, the price has been struggling to break above the $1800 level. The higher boundary of the large symmetrical triangle pattern and a bearish rejection has led to the breakdown of the 50-day moving average located around the $1600 mark.\n\nThe 200-day moving average, located around $1400, seems like the next probable support zone, followed by $1300, which could be tested if a deeper pullback occurs.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nOn the 4-hour chart, the price has been impulsively rejected from the $1650 level and is likely to test the $1500 support level soon. If this support level holds, ETH could once more target the $1650 level and the higher boundary of the triangle pattern.\n\nOn the other hand, a breakdown of the $1500 level would likely result in a deeper drop toward the $1350 area, as no significant support level exists between these 2 levels. The RSI indicator is also showing values below 50%, which points to the bears\u2019 dominance.\n\nHowever, the RSI is approaching the oversold zone, which could lead to a consolidation or bullish pullback in the short term.\n\nOnchain Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe following chart demonstrates the Estimated Leverage Ratio metric alongside ETH\u2019s price. The metric measures the average amount of leverage used by the futures market participants. Typically, increasing values indicate that more investors are taking high-leverage risk in the derivatives market.\n\nThe Estimated Leverage Ratio has slightly increased during the last few weeks, showing that the futures market might become overheated due to the recent bullish price moves.\n\nThe metric hasn\u2019t reached concerning levels yet, but if it continues spiking, participants should be wary due to the possibility of a short or perhaps even a long-squeeze event. In this case, a sudden impulsive move will occur in Ethereum\u2019s price.\n\nIn conclusion, the metric\u2019s behavior should be monitored in the upcoming weeks to prevent further losses."

Source: CoinGecko .\n\nThose are certainly respectable gains, but for a pretty slim majority of users.\n\nIn fact, in dollar terms, since staking began, just 16% of stakers are in the money, per Dune. Were the upgrade to be executed today, the vast majority of users would be hit with some pretty serious losses.\n\nHow much staked money is in profit since staking began? Source: Dune .\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to know what people will do when faced with potentially double-digit losses. Still, there are about $6.25 billion staked that\u2019s in the money; it\u2019s likely some of them sell.\n\nThat\u2019s the bear argument.\n\nThe bull argument is this: after nearly three years, during which the devs finally delivered the highly-anticipated merge event, people are going to double down. The risk profile of staking drops tremendously once people can see that, yes, if they put their money into this black box they can earn a yield and can take the money out of that black box whenever they like.\n\nSome DeFi projects are also making this bet too, rolling out a unique levered mechanism.\n\nAave\u2019s latest upgrade does precisely this. Here\u2019s how it works: Deposit your Ethereum into liquid staking protocol Lido Finance to receive staked ETH (stETH); use that stETH to borrow more Ethereum on Aave; restake the Ethereum on Lido; and repeat the cycle depending on how degenerate you are.\n\nSpark Lend, a not-yet-launched product from a handful of MakerDAO engineers, will also offer a similar tool.\n\nThis is obviously hugely risky and if Ethereum hits any volatility, consider yourself liquidated.\n\nDecrypting DeFi is our DeFi newsletter, led by this essay.

        "title": "Bitcoin is for Republicans, Ethereum is for Democrats - Fortune",
        "content": "Greetings from Colorado\u2019s capital, where more than 20,000 Ethereum enthusiasts have descended to celebrate ETHDenver, a multi-day extravaganza dedicated to demos, workshops, and a whole lot of hoopla related to their favorite blockchain. As usual, many of this year\u2019s attendees turned up wearing rainbows or outlandish animal costumes\u2014a colorful pageant that felt especially striking given that this year\u2019s ETHDenver is taking place at the city\u2019s fabled stockyard and rodeo grounds, which is adorned by images of cowboys, Budweiser, and other icons typically associated with red America.\n\nI remarked on the hippie-like vibe\u2014which included a \u201czen zone\u201d and an arena full of sleepings bags for 500 Ethereum scholarship attendees to stay overnight\u2014to a 50-something crypto industry professional, who was himself dressed in a vibrant shirt and hipster glasses. He nodded and observed, \u201cBitcoin is for Republicans, Ethereum is for Democrats.\u201d It\u2019s hard to disagree. While the hardcore Bitcoin crowd is fixated with hodling and suspicion of the government, the Ethereum set is more given over to radical experimentation and eccentricity.\n\nI put this characterization to Kevin Owocki, the founder of the open software promulgator Gitcoin, who has just launched Supermodular, a venture studio that aspires to commercialize a wide variety of Ethereum innovations. He described the political labels as \u201cvery reductionist,\u201d but conceded the broad strokes are correct. \u201cBitcoin is about red meat and guns\u2026Ethereum has rainbows and unicorns,\u201d Owocki noted.\n\nAll of this underscores the degree to which crypto culture has grown and become more diverse since the libertarian Satoshi published his famous white paper in 2008, and soon after embedded a warning about central bank profligacy in the first block of Bitcoin. Today, the two most important blockchains have come to embody very different political tribes, both of which offer new and distinct ideas, but also overlap with broader progressive and conservative cultural movements.\n\nFor the thousands of mostly young people packed into the stockyard building, however, politics was far from their minds. They were instead consumed by the prospects for the next phase of Ethereum, which successfully pulled off a very difficult switch to the environmentally friendly proof of stake last year, and is on track to introduce a host of other updates that will make the blockchain faster and easier to use. In May, it will be Bitcoin\u2019s turn to be the center of the crypto universe when its devotees gather in Miami Beach for an extravaganza of their own. We\u2019ll have a dispatch from there too, but for now, it\u2019s enough to observe that\u2014even after one of the industry\u2019s toughest years ever\u2014crypto and its colorful culture are more entrenched than ever.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nCoinbase purchased digital asset manager One River in a bet on future institutional demand for crypto.

        "content": "In a recent Twitter thread, Chris Burniske, a partner at venture capital firm Placeholder, has expressed a quite bullish forecast for ethereum.\n\nThe ethereum Shanghai Upgrade is an optimistic development for ether investors, according to Chris Burniske. He believes that the fact that ethereum stakers can exercise control over their own assets is positive for the whole ecosystem.\n\nI\u2019m shocked it\u2019s a debated question that *de-risking $ETH staking by allowing for unlocks* is bullish. And unfortunately for doubtoooooors, the fact it\u2019s even a question makes me more bullish. \u2014 Chris Burniske (@cburniske) April 3, 2023\n\nThe BR Capital fund creator, Rezo, expressed an opinion quite similar to this one on Twitter. The flexibility to stake and unstake ETH will positively impact the long run, as observed by Rezo. He thinks that the Shanghai Upgrade will enhance general trust in ethereum.\n\nExperts agree that stakeholders will have more control over their assets after the ethereum Shanghai update, which is expected to be a key milestone for the entire ethereum community. Several market analysts have a favorable outlook on the long-term prospects for ethereum, even though the market has a degree of uncertainty and anxiety.\n\nEthereum, widely regarded as the preeminent platform for smart contracts and decentralized financial ecosystems, is getting ready to implement a big update to its network. The ethereum community will reach a significant new point of significance on April 12 when the ethereum Shanghai update goes live.\n\nYou might also like: How ethereum has fared 200 days after it transitioned to PoS\n\nThis upgrade will allow speakers to withdraw ethers from the PoS beacon chain. As a result of this news, investors who are bullish on ethereum have seen a remarkable gain of fifty percent so far this year, according to statistics from TradingView\u2019s market.\n\nTraders of ethereum have an optimistic perspective as the first quarter ended. They anticipate that the Shanghai upgrade will cause more upward swings.\n\nNevertheless, there is a concern that the staked ethereum may be sold on the secondary market. It could result in an increase in the total amount of pressure to sell. In addition, the price of ethereum has decreased by more than 61% since the beginning of the staking program two years ago.\n\nEthereum price today\n\nAs the Shanghai upgrade draws closer, the price of ethereum is currently trading at $1,822 as bulls try to grip the market. The asset has recorded a price increase of close to 1% as of presstime, with the trading volume surging by 28%, revealing the increased whale activity in anticipation of the upgrade.\n\nETH 24-hour charts | Source: CMC\n\nCurrently, over 561 thousand ethereum validators have wagered a total of approximately 17.9 million ETH. Experts anticipate greater volatility during the event; however, it is unknown how the market will respond to the upgrading at this time.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Immutable continues its partnership with Warner Bros with the launch of the web3 mobile game Blocklete Golf from Discovery Sports on Immutable X.\n\nWarner Bros web3 adoption\n\nLast month, Warner Bros added a web3 quiz game to create the Bleacher Report Watch-to-Earn (B/R W2E game.) In addition, Warner is furthering its partnership with Immutable by migrating Blocklete Golf from the Flow blockchain to Immutable X. The migration is reportedly due to the \u201cfast transactions and gas-free NFTs minting backed by Ethereum\u2019s robust security and decentralization.\u201d\n\nAndrew Sorokovsky, VP of Global Business Development at Immutable, commented that,\n\n\u201c[Warner Bros]dedication to pushing the envelope and early adoption of web3 proves that decentralized solutions are on the fast track to mass adoption \u2014 offering millions of people new and exciting ways to interact with entertainment mediums while retaining full control over their digital assets.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Yang Adija, SVP of Digital Operations and Innovation for WBD Sports, called the move to Immutable \u201ca natural choice for us.\u201d\n\nBlocklete Golf\n\nBlocklete Golf is an interactive traditional mobile golf management game that allows players to guide golfing characters across virtual links in PvP matchups and tournaments. The game features the evolved Play-and-Earn model, which has become the default for many games looking to move away from the Play-to-Earn model, which saw Axie Infinity rise to stardom during the last bull run.\n\nCryptoSlate reported on the move away from \u2018Play-to-Earn\u2019 as far back as April 2022 in an interview with Polkastarter co-Founder Daniel Stockhaus who argued that web3 games should not focus on a purely \u2018Play-to-Earn\u2019 model. He said,\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it should be about earning for clicking within the game[\u2026] That\u2019s not providing value that\u2019s not creating a good world or good economy.\u201d\n\nBlocklete Golf looks to set the game apart from other web2 mobile games by allowing gamers to collect, train, and trade unique NFT-based avatars or use them to compete with others.\n\nBlockchain adoption\n\nThe Flow blockchain has been a first choice for several U.S.-based companies, such as the NBA and UFC. However, the surge of activity on the Immutable X blockchain, and adoption from companies such as Warner Bros, indicates a further appreciation of decentralized technologies by legacy web2 brands.\n\nWhile Flow introduced a permissionless smart contract offering in July 2022, it relies on an original scripting language called Cadence, unlike Immutable X, which uses the more widely used Solidity. In addition, inter-chain connectivity could be seen as a reason for exploring alternatives to Flow, given that Immutable X is an Ethereum layer-2 solution that can potentially integrate with other EVM chains.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, on Tuesday, published a blog post highlighting some of Ethereum\u2019s user issues in need of improvements in the last three years. The insightful report comes barely days after Arbitrum, a layer one scaling solution for Ethereum, surpassed Ethereum in daily processed transactions for the first time since its inception in 2021.\n\nArbitrum had surpassed the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency twice in February\u2014first with a margin of 10,000 transactions and 20,000 the second time. Cost per transaction is considered one of the most influential factors attracting more users to Arbitrum as it charges over 2000% less than Ethereum on average for a single transaction.\n\nVitalik, in his blog post, chiefly pointed to Ethereum\u2019s rising cost as one of the network\u2019s persistent Achilles heels in need of improvement.\n\nMore Scale, Fewer Fees\n\nWhile Ethereum has significantly improved its average transaction fees to a fraction of a dollar\u2013during off-peak periods\u2013since the merge, Vitalik believes more could be done to lower it even further as the blockchain continues to solve its scaling problems. Other problems highlighted are non-internet payment options and UI/UX fixes.\n\nCiting an experience of a failed transaction ten years ago at a Sushi restaurant in San Francisco, Vitalik encouraged developers of crypto payment apps to integrate broader payment options like near-field communications that rely less on the internet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe internet is not 100% reliable, and customer internet is less reliable than merchant internet. We need in-person payment systems to have some functionality (NFC, customer shows a QR code, whatever) to allow customers to transfer their transaction data directly to the merchant if that\u2019s the best way to get it broadcasted.\u201d\n\nSimple UI/UX Fails\n\nVitalik also highlighted some common UI complexities where users could not see real-time fluctuations in gas fees or are helplessly stuck with an unknown transaction status minutes after making them.\n\n\u201cThere has been a surprisingly long time delay between my transaction getting accepted on-chain, and the service acknowledging the transaction, even as \u201cunconfirmed\u201d\u2026.there has [also] been a surprisingly long and unpredictable time delay between sending a transaction, and that transaction getting accepted in a block. Sometimes, a transaction would get accepted in a few seconds, but other times, it would take minutes or even hours.\n\nEIP-1559 significantly improved this, ensuring that most transactions get accepted into the next block, and even more recently, the Merge improved things further by stabilizing block times\u2026.but wallet UIs suck at showing this. There are no big red flashing alerts and [a] very little clear indication of what you\u2019re supposed to do to solve this problem.\u2019"

Secure your seat today\n\nFlashbots, an Ethereum research and development firm, has made open source a new block builder operating in a trusted environment, in this case a private mempool, on Ethereum\u2019s Sepolia testnet, according to a press release shared exclusively with CoinDesk.\n\nThe research that Flashbots details will allow blocks to be built without revealing data on users\u2019 transactions, a step toward enhancing privacy.\n\nFlashbots has not given an immediate timeline when it will move out of the testnet.\n\nBlock builders are specialized third-party participants who construct blocks based on optimizing transactions. Block builders offer those blocks to relays, such as the relay Flashbots runs for MEV-Boost, in order to extract extra revenue made from reordering or including certain transactions.\n\nA mempool is like a waiting room, where pending transactions are sorted and stored before they are added to create a new block.\n\nRead more: What Is MEV, aka Maximal Extractable Value?\n\nFlashbots told CoinDesk the move aims to enable privacy features on Ethereum. The code was made open source in an effort to decentralize block building on the Ethereum protocol.\n\n\u201c\u200b\u200bImplementing block building inside encrypted enclaves brings us one step closer toward transaction confidentiality and decentralization of the block building role,\u201d Flashbots wrote in a blog post.\n\nExcited to announce that Flashbots is successfully running a block builder inside an SGX enclave!\n\nThis brings us a step closer toward transaction confidentiality and decentralization of the block building role.\n\nTons of open learnings, code and tooling! \u26a1\ufe0fhttps://t.co/rrlLq6jxLW \u2014 Chris Hager \u26a1\ud83e\udd16 (@metachris) March 3, 2023\n\nThis is not the first time that Flashbots has made its code open source. In August, when Tornado Cash was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Asset Control, Flashbots conveyed that its relay would also be censoring Tornado Cash transactions. As a result, Flashbots raced to open its code so others could decide whether to censor or not censor.\n\nOne reason open-source software is part of the Flashbots agenda is so others in the block-building space can \u201cbuild off the shared knowledge and test other solutions,\u201d the Flashbots team told CoinDesk. \u201cAnd, in reality, try to break it!\u201d\n\nRead more: Flashbots Proposes New Class of \u2018Matchmakers\u2019 to Share MEV Gains With Ethereum Users"

Though this time round, there\u2019s a feature that proves the user is not a North Korean bad actor or some other type of criminal.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned Tornado Cash in August because they said criminals\u2014mainly North Korean state-sponsored hackers, Lazarus Group\u2014were using it to launder dirty cash.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Treasury Department\u2019s move, which essentially banned Americans from interacting with the app, was criticized not only by many in the crypto world but also politicians like Rep Tom Emmer. \u201cPrivacy is normal,\u201d he said at the time.\n\nTornado Cash\u2019s team was also targeted: Dutch police arrested the app\u2019s main developer Alexey Pertsev; he is set to remain in jail until an April hearing.\n\nNow, Privacy Pools (which is currently just a demo and has not been audited) aims to pick up where Tornado Cash left off\u2014but in a way that regulators and law enforcement will leave it alone.\n\nI sincerely hope no one thought we were finished pic.twitter.com/YVpSMtjeCd \u2014 ameen.eth (@ameensol) February 26, 2023\n\n\u201cIt is not meant to be a final replacement product\u2014it is meant to start a conversation,\u201d the man behind the new app Ameen Soleimani told Decrypt.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSoleimani is widely credited as an early contributor to Tornado, though he says he did not contribute to the project\u2019s code. Soleimani told Decrypt that he helped steer the project\u2019s direction during its early days, besides contributing to Tornado\u2019s initial funding through the developer\u2019s MolochDAO\n\n\u201cThe hope is that regulators are less interested in sanctioning [Privacy Pools], because it helps them accomplish their goals.\u201d\n\nPrivacy Pools\u2014a fork of Tornado Cash created by Soleimani and one other developer\u2014works by allowing users to show publicly that their withdrawals are not linked to bad actors.\n\nUsers can still make anonymous transactions but there is the option to make it clear that the money being moved is not from something criminal\u2014like a hack. The new app works just like Tornado Cash, but when users click the option to withdraw funds, they can generate a zero-knowledge proof which publicly shows they are not using a criminal blockchain address, but without revealing who they are.\n\nZero-knowledge proofs are used in cryptography to prove that something is known without revealing the known information directly.\n\nOne of the reasons the feds sanctioned the app last year was because hackers used Tornado Cash to launder funds from the massive attack on play-to-earn game Axie Affinity.\n\nA coin mixer allows users to obfuscate the origin and destination of cryptocurrency movements by grouping various transactions together.\n\nAuthorities initially said that over $7 billion in illegal funds passed through Tornado since its creation in 2019\u2014though blockchain data company Elliptic later said in a report that of the $7.6 billion that passed through the app, only $1.5 billion was dirty.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCoin mixers\u2014which are used for a number of reasons\u2014are just one of the things U.S. authorities are now paying attention to since launching a tough crackdown on the crypto world.\n\nA number of U.S. lawmakers claim the fast-moving industry\u2019s coins, tokens and apps are favored by criminals. And most politicians\u2014even those who like crypto\u2014are at the very least calling for clearer regulatory guidelines.\n\nMany in the digital asset space are hoping that with regulation, they can still build and use tools that will protect their privacy.\n\n\u201cThere is no guarantee that they [the authorities] won\u2019t sanction [Privacy Pools],\u201d added Ameen. \u201cWe live in a regulatory-by-enforcement regime.\u201d\n\nEditor's note: This article was updated after publication to clarify that the Privacy Pools demo is set to be released tomorrow, March 4."

        "title": "Bitcoin & Ethereum Tussle With Crypto Foes: Big Eyes Coin Locked And Loaded Ahead Of Next Bull Run - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The year 2022 was a rather testing period for the cryptocurrency industry. The scandal surrounding the currency exchange FTX caused governments, consumers, and other stakeholders to question the credibility, transparency, and security of users in the industry. While the start of 2023 appeared to have indicated a remarkable turnaround, cryptocurrency still seems to be fighting old demons.\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market capitalization seemed to have recovered from $797 million when the year started to $1.12 trillion by February. Fresh scrutiny on the crypto industry however, has once again caused a decline in the global crypto market cap dropping to $1.07 trillion. The volatility, while it may seem gloomy to the naked eye, experts suggest that it is the calm before the storm, in the sense that the industry is poised to explode to new heights before the year is out.\n\nWhile Big Eyes Coin (BIG), being the new entry to the industry has shown a positive outlook to become the next big meme coin in the crypto market, how have Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) fared, and what does 2023 hold for these three currencies.\n\nBitcoin: Reeling from $80 Million Wipeout\n\nBitcoin (BTC), the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency has dropped 4.89% in the past week, down to $23,439.35. Bitcoin did post a marginal rise of 0.04% in the last 24 hours after a wipe-out of nearly $80m in leveraged crypto long positions caused a rippled effect across the board.\n\nBitcoin, which posted a 30-day high of $25,134.12, dipped to $22,910.99 over the weekend as investors remained cautious over persistent inflation concerns in the US, which have increased the possibility of the Federal Reserve implementing more aggressive interest rate hikes than previously anticipated.\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin held a market capitalization of $452 billion with a 24-hour trading volume of $22 billion.\n\nEthereum: Bearish Movement Ahead\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second most powerful cryptocurrency in the industry, has been following a similar pattern to that of Bitcoin in terms of price movement. Having posted a 30-day high of $1,732.80, Ethereum\u2019s price has shown a weekly decline of 2.53% on the weekly charts and currently trades at $1,634.67, a 0.73% drop from the day before.\n\nEthereum is currently trading just above the support level at $1,600 but a bearish movement has been established on the daily chart, so be warned. Big Eyes Coin: Packed and Ready to Take on the Next Bull Run\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG) is a new community-owned meme token created on the Ethereum Network to generate wealth and shift that wealth into the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) ecosystem while ensuring 5% of its total token supply is donated to ocean-saving charities.\n\nBig Eyes Coin believes in keeping its community on its toes with new and exciting offers. And in its latest initiative, Big Eyes Coin has launched the Big Eyes Coin Loot Boxes, which are mystery boxes featured in a video game and can be found during gameplay, earned as a reward, or paid for with real money.\n\nThe three loot boxes, Cute Box, Kitty Vault, and Super Saiyan Box will be available only during the presale stage of Big Eyes Coin and the results are always randomized. The Cute Box costs $100 to open with the largest prize of $5000 worth of BIG tokens. The Kitty Vault costs $500 and contains the grand prize of $25,000 worth of BIG tokens. The Super Saiyan Box which costs $1000 to open carries the ultimate prize of $100,000 worth of BIG tokens. The Loot Boxes only guarantee a win because, at the minimum, users will always get their money back and there are a very limited number of loot box drops before they run out.\n\nThe meme token is currently in its Initial Coin Offer (ICO) and in stage 12, Big Eyes Coin has raised $30.62 million in presale tokens and will go live on the market when it reaches its target of $50 million presale tokens.\n\nFind out more about Big Eyes Coin (BIG):\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Today the day started with a nasty surprise for Bitcoin and Ethereum holders, with the price dropping more than 4%.\n\nIt all started yesterday, when after the US stock exchanges opened, news began to spread that crypto bank Silvergate was losing half of its market value in a single session.\n\nThe fact is that Silvergate was a supplier to many exchanges, primarily including Coinbase, and this put some fear into investors. Indeed, for example the same Coinbase stock on the exchange had opened with -11% in the first hour of trading alone.\n\nHowever, over the course of the day many exchanges, including Coinbase itself, distanced themselves from Silvergate, so much so that the problem seemed to be winding down, with the stock of the US-based exchange eventually closing with an unceremonious -1.5%.\n\nIndeed, up to that point Bitcoin and Ethereum prices had not reacted badly, with BTC at $23,400 and ETH at $1,640.\n\nThe statements of the SEC chairman bring down the price of Bitcoin and Ethereum today\n\nShortly after the US markets closed their daily session, news came out that SEC Chairman Gary Gensler had stated that crypto exchanges cannot be considered qualified custodians, in other words, secure.\n\nGensler was referring to all crypto exchanges, but particularly those that claim to be secure, such as major exchanges.\n\nHe wrote:\n\n\u201cMake no mistake, again: Based upon how crypto trading and lending platforms generally operate, investment advisers cannot rely on them today as qualified custodians. To be clear: just because a crypto trading platform claims to be a qualified custodian doesn\u2019t mean that it is. When these platforms fail\u2014something we\u2019ve seen time and again\u2014investors\u2019 assets often have become property of the failed company, leaving investors in line at the bankruptcy court.\u201d\n\nThese statements are indeed the reality of the current state of the crypto markets, and written by the SEC Chairman they carry their weight.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that the price of Bitcoin and Ethereum did not start falling as soon as this news was released, but about two hours later.\n\nThe cause of today\u2019s descent by the price of Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nThe fact that yesterday\u2019s descent of the price of Bitcoin and Ethereum happened practically within a quarter of an hour would suggest that some single event happened shortly before, and that it triggered sudden and massive selling.\n\nThe only event that would seem to have triggered the sales is the news of Gensler\u2019s statements, but the timing does not match.\n\nIt is therefore possible that the general trend was simply downward, but that some event was required to trigger some fear by convincing speculators to sell.\n\nAnd so within about 15 minutes, the price of Bitcoin fell from $23,400 to $22,400, and then even fell below $22,000 in the following half hour, but for very few minutes.\n\nEthereum\u2019s price in the same period fell from $1,640 to $1,560, before making a very quick hike to $1,540 and later returning again to around $1,560.\n\nIt is worth noting that in the next eleven hours virtually nothing more happened, in the sense that the two prices began to lateralize around $22,400 and $1,560, respectively.\n\nIt is as if they were waiting for nothing more than to fall to these levels, and they did so suddenly two hours after Gensler\u2019s statements were published.\n\nNot least because, to be fair, what the SEC chairman is calling for could be good, not bad, for the crypto markets, particularly for the very investors who may have panicked and sold out yesterday.\n\nGensler, referring to a new regulatory proposal for crypto markets, wrote that the new safeguard rule would expand the safeguards of the custody rule to cover all assets and would make important improvements to the protections provided by qualified custodians.\n\nIn other words, he called for greater protection for investors and speculators against, for example, fraudulent, or unsafe exchanges that can fail at any moment causing them huge potential losses.\n\nThe current cycle\n\nOver the medium term there seems to be a real cycle underway for the price of Bitcoin, which is also shared by the price of Ethereum.\n\nAt the beginning of the year there was an initial rise, from $17,000 to $21,000.\n\nStarting on 21 January there were four unsuccessful attempts to bring itself firmly back above $24,000, followed by ten days of lateralization below $23,000.\n\nAfter returning above $24,000 in mid-February, Bitcoin\u2019s price then failed four times to break above $25,000.\n\nStarting on 22 February, it began a phase of apparent lateralization below $24,000 that resembles that of early February.\n\nShould this phase end like the previous one, it is possible to imagine that after about a week below $23,000 the price of Bitcoin could return to try to attack $25,000."
