        "title": "Should You Buy Ethereum While It's Still Below $2,500? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "For the first six months of 2023, Ethereum (ETH 0.55%) was one of the standout performers in the crypto market. Ethereum is now up 55% year to date, and was recently trading at $1,865.\n\nHowever, of late, Ethereum has had difficulty pushing past the $2,000 price level, much as Bitcoin had trouble breaking through the $30,000 mark. Clearly, crypto investors are mixed on what's going to happen next in the financial markets, and there could be some turbulence ahead. So should you buy Ethereum while it's still trading below $2,500? Here's what you need to know.\n\nEthereum as market leader\n\nOne major factor in Ethereum's favor is that it remains the acknowledged market leader in just about every niche of the blockchain and crypto world, from non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to decentralized finance (DeFi), the metaverse, and Web3. In part, this is due to Ethereum's first-mover advantage. Ethereum was first to market with innovations such as smart contracts, and has not let up since then, despite the arrival of many new competitors.\n\nTake, for example, the NFT market. Ethereum created the NFT boom with groundbreaking collections such as the Bored Ape Yacht Club and the CryptoPunks, and these remain among the most valuable NFT collections in the world. All of the top 25 NFT collections are on the Ethereum blockchain. And while Bitcoin has had some recent success with the introduction of Ordinals, Ethereum still remains the top blockchain in terms of NFT sales volume. As a long-term investor, that's exactly what I'm looking for: a best-in-class crypto with a clear competitive advantage and a huge market share edge.\n\nTrack record of tech upgrades\n\nAnother key factor in Ethereum's favor is its strong track record of new technological upgrades. With each new upgrade, Ethereum remains one step ahead of the competition. Last year, for example, Ethereum captured the imagination of investors with The Merge, its long-anticipated transformation from a proof-of-work blockchain to a proof-of-stake blockchain. This was a technological tour de force, with some comparing its difficulty level to that of changing the engine of an airplane mid-flight.\n\nAnd Ethereum shows no signs of letting up on these technological upgrades for its underlying blockchain infrastructure. In April, Ethereum completed the Shapella upgrade, which made Ethereum much more attractive for crypto staking. The next major upgrade, tentatively known as Dencun (a mashup of \"Cancun\" and \"Deneb\"), is coming in the fourth quarter of 2023. This upgrade will further improve Ethereum's storage capacity, scalability, and efficiency. The goal is now 100,000 transactions per second for the Ethereum blockchain, which is far more than what any of its primary competitors can offer.\n\nAt the end of 2022, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin unveiled a comprehensive series of updates and upgrades designed to transform Ethereum into \"Ethereum 2.0.\" While many of these upgrades are incredibly wonky from a technological perspective, all of them are designed to make Ethereum more attractive for both users and developers. This detailed roadmap for future development gives me tremendous confidence that Ethereum is playing the long game here, and is not just reacting instinctively to temporary moves in the crypto market.\n\nImportant caveats\n\nOf course, investing in Ethereum is hardly a slam dunk. First of all, Ethereum has plenty of competitors, all of them vying to become an \"Ethereum killer.\" And that means tremendous competition in areas such as NFTs, DeFi, the metaverse, and Web3. Over time, it is likely that Ethereum's market share in each of these segments will decline.\n\nMoreover, while Ethereum's tech upgrades are impressive, they are also extremely complex, time-consuming, and, at times, frustrating. The Merge, for example, was filled with a series of delays, to the point where some investors questioned whether it was going to happen at all.\n\nAnd, of course, crypto remains a volatile and speculative investment filled with regulatory uncertainty. Any new crypto crackdown by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), for example, could put an immediate halt on Ethereum's growth ambitions.\n\nThat being said, I remain bullish on Ethereum's future prospects. Ethereum has a best-in-class blockchain, a clear competitive advantage, and plenty of diversification, thanks to its prowess across a wide range of blockchain niches. Moreover, Ethereum has planned a series of new tech upgrades that will only make it better over time. All of which leads me to believe that, yes, you should buy Ethereum while it's still below $2,500. Even at that elevated price, Ethereum would still be nearly 50% below its all-time-high, suggesting that there's plenty of upside potential ahead."

        "content": "Blockchain software development firm Consensys has gone down as the latest to join the zero-knowledge rollup game, unveiling Linea on Ethereum\u2019s mainnet.\n\nThis move comes after Linea\u2019s testnet phase on Goerli, which saw over 5.5 million wallet addresses execute over 46 million transactions.\n\nLinea is a type 2 zero-knowledge Ethereum virtual machine, or a zk-EVM \u2014 meaning it is an EVM equivalent, but not an Ethereum equivalent. The layer-2 network is designed to replicate user experience on mainnet, but at faster speeds and transaction costs by up to 15 times lower compared to Ethereum layer-1.\n\n\u201cBy leveraging its industry-leading prover, Vortex, the result of over four years of R&D, Linea can generate efficient ZK proofs and offer performances that unlock cheaper transactions for users and faster settlement finality with Ethereum,\u201d Declan Fox, senior product manager at Consensys, told Blockworks.\n\nBeing fully EVM compatible also means that there are no switching costs for Ethereum, Fox said.\n\nAt launch, Linea will be integrated with existing Web3 products such as MetaMask and Infura, meaning that, from the get-go, infrastructure ought to be familiar to developers.\n\nLinea\u2019s mainnet launch will also be introducing new features:\n\nBatch conflation \u2014 designed to reduce costs by optimizing layer-2 transactions, so that it can fit better into a batch submitted to Ethereum layer-1\n\nA new Canonical ERC-20 bridge \u2014 designed to enable any ERC-20 tokens to be created on Linea when bridged\n\nDynamic fee mechanism \u2014 used to manage Ethereum gas fees\n\nA new outer proof system will also be introduced.\n\n\u201cThe Linea prover, Vortex, offers fast proof generation by using lattice-based cryptography and self-recursion to compress a proof of computation, this \u2018inner proof\u2019 is then compressed in a final step, known as the \u2018outer proof\u2019 to reduce its size and the costs to verify on Ethereum,\u201d Fox said. \u201cLinea uses PLONK as its outer proof as it requires a universal trusted setup \u2014 essentially, each time the circuit is updated, a new setup ceremony does not need to be conducted to dispose of the randomness.\u201d\n\nTo prevent any implementation risks, Linea will be using a multi-prover approach, Fox said.\n\n\u201cThe Multi-Prover uses multiple diverse implementations of a zkEVM to prove a transaction thus ensuring if one prover has a bug or becomes unavailable, as long as a quorum is reached amongst the other available proofs, the system will continue to operate reliably,\u201d he said.\n\nWith the zero-knowledge rollup space drawing significant competition, Consensys notes it will unveil a major NFT collection on its network on July 18. All testers who participated in Linea Voyage will be eligible to mint the collection. Developers will also be able to participate in a hackathon with prizes of up to $50,000.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Alluvial raises $12 million to build out Liquid Collective, an Ethereum staking protocol for institutions - Fortune",
        "content": "The software company Alluvial announced on Tuesday that it\u2019s closed a Series A round, raising $12 million co-led by Ethereal Ventures and Variant, with other backers including Brevan Howard Digital, Coinbase Ventures, Kraken, and Avon Ventures, which is affiliated with Fidelity.\n\nAlluvial is the developer behind Liquid Collective, a protocol that supports \u201cliquid staking\u201d for Ethereum. Unlike competitors such as Lido and RocketPool that offer a \u201cstaking-as-a-service\u201d product, Alluvial is catering to institutions and traditional finance, predicting that larger players will want to enter the space. With regulators including the Securities and Exchange Commission circling around staking, Alluvial is making a long-term gamble on the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nProof of stake\n\nBlockchains require a decentralized consensus mechanism, where network participants verify and validate transactions, adding them to the distributed ledger. Bitcoin employed a proof-of-work mechanism, in which miners race to validate blocks in exchange for rewards. Its energy-intensive nature led later projects to adopt a proof-of-stake model, where validators who lock up large amounts of cryptocurrency within the blockchain get a chance at processing transactions. In late 2022, Ethereum\u2014the second-largest blockchain by market cap\u2014switched to proof of stake in a process known as the Merge.\n\nWhile staking can yield lucrative rewards, it poses multiple challenges, including a technical cliff to entering as well as the difficulty of accessing staked Ether, despite the recent Shanghai upgrade. Liquid staking providers such as Alluvial\u2019s Liquid Collective ease these challenges, working with exchanges to offer simple on-ramps into staking as well as a \u201creceipt token\u201d that users receive after staking cryptocurrencies. Liquid Collective\u2019s token, LsETH, reflects the accrued network rewards and can be traded on exchanges such as Coinbase.\n\nLiquid Collective differs from other products by catering to institutions. While individual users can purchase LsETH on exchanges, they cannot stake Ether with Liquid Collective without access to institutional trading platforms like Coinbase Prime and Bitcoin Suisse, which require a higher barrier of entry for traders.\n\nRegulatory clarity\n\nIn recent months, the SEC has targeted staking, with Chair Gary Gensler noting in public comments that proof-of-stake tokens should be regulated as securities, and the SEC suing both Coinbase and Kraken for their staking-as-a-service programs, alleging that the products constitute an unregistered security. A task force of 10 state securities regulators also alleged that Coinbase\u2019s staking program violated state securities law.\n\nIn an interview with Fortune, Alluvial CEO Mara Schmiedt argued that the company\u2019s focus on compliance will position it for a future where there is more \u201cregulatory clarity,\u201d even if that means staking services are not viable in the short-term in the U.S. Unlike other products, Liquid Collective\u2019s closely guarded entry means that it includes more know-your-customer and anti-money-laundering checks than competitors. Schmiedt also said that its noncustodial model, meaning it doesn\u2019t hold users\u2019 Ether, and fixed reward mechanism from Ethereum differentiates it from other services that bear the characteristics of a security offering.\n\nJesse Walden, a general partner and co-founder of Variant, said his firm invested in Alluvial because it uses Liquid Collective. They chose it over other KYC-compliant services, including Coinbase\u2019s, because of its diversification of validator nodes. He acknowledged the regulatory risk but remains bullish on staking\u2019s future. \u201cAccess to this very large\u2014and growing\u2014market that is not going away is going to triumph over the short-term regulatory uncertainty,\u201d he told Fortune.\n\nAlluvial is a Delaware-incorporated company, with the Liquid Collective Foundation registered in the Cayman Islands. The team is distributed, including across the U.S., Europe, and Dubai. Schmiedt said Alluvial plans to use the funding to grow the team, particularly in engineering, to continue product development and expand staking services to other blockchain networks."

The radio is calculated by dividing the price of Ethereum by the price of Bitcoin and offers an intriguing comparison against previous market cycles, especially when assessing performance from the cycle\u2019s all-time high (ATH).\n\nThe 2015 to 2017 cycle saw an outstanding performance from Ethereum, with returns exceeding 60,000% and markedly outperforming Bitcoin. This period marked a significant high point for the Ethereum to Bitcoin ratio.\n\nIn the subsequent cycle from 2017 to 2021, Ethereum continued to perform well, although with a decreased, impressive return high of 1,000%. This cycle hinted at a declining trend in Ethereum\u2019s dominance over Bitcoin.\n\nNow, we find ourselves in a cycle that commenced in November 2021. Ethereum\u2019s performance in this cycle is marginally better than the preceding cycle but is generally viewed as underperforming.\n\nAs we move forward, it\u2019s a point of speculation whether Ethereum will continue this pattern of underperformance in each succeeding cycle or whether it will disrupt the trend.

Yet, a recent development has brought about a welcome decrease in these expenses.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nEthereum gas fee decreases\n\nSantiment recently shared an insightful update revealing a notable decrease in gas fees. The accompanying chart vividly displayed the fluctuating nature of these fees, illustrating a surge to over $7 around 5 July, followed by a subsequent decline.\n\nBefore this July spike, an even more significant surge occurred in May, with gas fees skyrocketing to nearly $14\u2014an unprecedented high for the network in the current year.\n\nAdditionally, in the last 24 hours, most fees were primarily attributed to wrapped ETH (WETH) and native ETH transactions. These two forms of Ethereum tokens accounted for the largest portion of the fees generated on the network during this period.\n\nAs of this writing, the gas price had settled around $1.93, offering significant relief to Ethereum users. It\u2019s worth noting that the lowest gas price witnessed this year occurred in February, dipping to approximately $1.7.\n\nA drop in transactions?\n\nAccording to data provided by DefiLlama, transactions on the Ethereum network have consistently maintained a steady pace, experiencing no noticeable decline since its inception. While occasional spikes have been depicted on the chart, the overall transaction volume was within the normal range.\n\nAs of this writing, the network boasted an impressive 1 million transactions.\n\nA possible reason for Ethereum\u2019s gas price drop\n\nThe Ethereum network\u2019s congestion and the consequent high gas prices have spurred the development of alternative Layer 2 solutions (L2). These solutions aim to alleviate the strain on the Ethereum mainnet, thereby reducing the fees caused by congestion.\n\nAccording to data provided by L2 Beats, L2s have gained significant traction regarding user adoption and Total Value Locked (TVL). At the time of writing, the TVL of L2s amounted to an impressive $9.51 billion, with Arbitrum and Optimism leading the market share.\n\nThe emergence of additional L2 solutions suggests the potential for lower gas fees on the Ethereum network and faster transaction processing soon.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nTrend of ETH\n\nAs of this writing, ETH has encountered a setback in its attempt to surpass the $1,900 price threshold. Although it briefly surpassed this level in the previous trading period, it experienced a slight decline in its value during the press time trading period.\n\nThe press time trading price hovered around $1,860, reflecting a less than 1% loss. On the Relative Strength Index (RSI), ETH was positioned on the neutral line, signaling a weak bullish trend."

It boasts one of the strongest communities, known for its passion for the company, its native cryptocurrency, and the ecosystem.\n\nEthereum, on the other hand, also has one of the largest groups of followers as it spreads across multiple purposes, use cases, and whatnot.\n\nWe decided to pin both against each other in a question to none other than the world\u2019s most popular AI-based chatbot \u2013 ChatGPT.\n\nWe asked if Ripple\u2019s XRP will outperform Ethereum\u2019s ETH in the next 5 years.\n\nIt\u2019s Not That Simple\n\nFirst things first, ChatGPT told us that we shouldn\u2019t expect any predictions on his behalf:\n\nAs an artificial intelligence model, I don\u2019t predict future events, including specific financial or investment outcomes. The performance of cryptocurrencies such as Ripple (XRP) and Ethereum (ETH) is influenced by a wide range of factors.\n\nThis was somewhat expected. It\u2019s also worth noting that it seems that ChatGPT\u2019s knowledge cutoff on this subject is in September 2021, which was quite some time ago.\n\nSo what are the factors it had in mind? They include:\n\nTechnological developments\n\nRegulatory decisions\n\nMarket demand\n\nMacroeconomic factors, and others.\n\nThere\u2019s been a lot going on in the cryptocurrency field since September 2021. In Ethereum\u2019s case, most notably, it was the Merge \u2013 the event that saw the network\u2019s long-awaited transition to a Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm.\n\nBut Wait, There\u2019s More!\n\nIn addition to the above, ChatGPT also said that the broader context is also important when assessing the potential of both cryptocurrencies.\n\nFor example, the regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies can greatly influence their adoption and price. It\u2019s also crucial to consider the broader macroeconomic climate, such as trends in institutional investment and the overall health of the global economy.\n\nETH has so far been the more obvious choice for institutional investors, with regular flows from various companies.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting, though, that there\u2019s a major difference between both cryptocurrencies \u2013 the SEC is calling XRP a security in a flat-out lawsuit that\u2019s been dragged on for a few years already. It\u2019s entirely possible that this is stopping many big investors from participating, as they might be waiting to see what the outcome of the lawsuit will be.\n\nIn conclusion, ChatGPT failed to provide a precise answer but based its arguments on important considerations, some of which have yet to unfold."

        "content": "A trader who skillfully rode the surge in the crypto markets earlier this year is outlining a scenario where Ethereum (ETH) could witness a significant burst to the upside.\n\nIn a recent strategy session, trader DonAlt tells his 52,200 YouTube subscribers that Ethereum continues to consolidate just under its key resistance level at $1,935.\n\nAccording to the top trader, further consolidation at current prices could lead to an eventual breakout.\n\n\u201cETH is actually consolidating in an area where it\u2019s actually okay because this resistance really should produce a down move. So far, it\u2019s done that a couple of times, but nothing really stuck\u2026\n\nBitcoin should move soon. Otherwise, it\u2019s going to be not nice. And then I look at ETH, if this stays (like) this for two, three, four more weeks that resistance should be cooked\u2026\n\nYou get a close above ($1,935), I think it\u2019s pretty likely that you\u2019re going to go higher.\u201d\n\nDonAlt also says that a move above $1,935 could ignite a rapid rally that could send ETH to a level last seen in May 2022, before Ethereum broke down due to the collapse of the Terra (LUNA) ecosystem.\n\n\u201cTo the upside, we close above $1,935, it seems pretty damn clear that we\u2019re going to go to $2,500. There\u2019s pretty much just empty air\u2026 Given that we\u2019ve stuck around the $2,000 handle so much just seems sensible to go up quite quickly if we do get through it.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Ethereum is trading for $1,882.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "The much-anticipated Quantum Leap upgrade by layer-2 scaling protocol Starknet was recently deployed on the Ethereum mainnet, allowing for as much as 90 transactions per second (TPS), boosting the network\u2019s speed.\n\nMOARRR TPS DADDY STARKNET MAINNET QUANTUM LEAP 0.12.0\n\n\n\nLIVE ON MAINNET pic.twitter.com/RaI1XKcgy7 \u2014 Starknet (@Starknet) July 12, 2023\n\nIn an announcement sent to Cointelegraph, Uri Kolodny, the co-founder and CEO of StarkWare, said it\u2019s a momentous day for the Ethereum blockchain, as the scaling ceiling has been \u201csmashed.\u201c He explained that \u201chigh TPS is finally a reality on Ethereum mainnet\u201d because of the new update, adding:\n\n\u201cWe said this upgrade would deliver potential TPS of hundreds within Q3, and only hoped from the stress test to check we\u2019re on target. A few dozen TPS at this early point would have left us excited \u2013 but we got more than we bargained for.\u201d\n\nKolodny also highlighted that it managed to achieve a consistent 37 TPS. In addition, the executive also noted that during its peak moments, the tests showed that the transfer transactions per second almost hit 100.\n\nRelated: DeFi borrower uses luxury watch-backed NFT as collateral for a loan\n\nOn July 5, Starknet\u2019s Quantum Leap was deployed in a testnet, recording speeds of up to triple figures. At the time of the testnet deployment, the team announced it was expecting the \u201ctime to inclusion\u201d to be around 15 seconds. This means decentralized applications (DApps) can confirm on-chain transactions in seconds, but the reality exceeded expectations.\n\n\u201cWe were aiming for latency of under 15 seconds, and in the end the vast majority of transactions had a time-to-inclusion of under 10 seconds,\u201d he explained. According to the Starknet team, more throughput and faster inclusion would pave the way for faster DeFi applications. This also means that AAA-rated games will become more realistic within the network.\n\nEli Ben-Sasson, StarkWare co-founder and president, told Cointelegraph that this means the community is basically being given a \u201csupercharged power tool.\u201d With this, they will suddenly be able to build things that weren\u2019t possible until now.\n\nThe executive also highlighted the short-term and long-term effects of the new development. \u201cAlmost overnight, it will make DeFi faster and less clunky, and make on-chain gaming far more seamless. Long term, it will lead to new and creative projects that will transform how we interact with technology and each other,\u201d he explained.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: Web3 Gamer: GTA 6 crypto rumors, Dr Who/Sandbox, Thai tourist NFTs review"

        "content": "Disclaimer: The information presented does not constitute financial, investment, trading, or other types of advice and is solely the writer\u2019s opinion.\n\nThe price action of Ethereum in the past three weeks showed large volatility and no clear trend.\n\nThe psychological level at $1900 was retested as resistance in recent hours.\n\nEthereum [ETH] showed some conflicting signs on the higher timeframe charts. The asset has been on an uptrend in 2023 after the move above $1350, but the trend shifted bearishly in mid-April.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nOn 16 June, ETH dropped as low as $1626 before rallying to $1976 on 3 July. This signified a bullish structure- but is ETH ready to rally?\n\nThe lower timeframe picture was clearer. The 4-hour chart showed a strong possibility that Ethereum is preparing for the next big move. The price was in a phase of consolidation, but can the bulls drive another rally?\n\nThe rejection from $1978 saw selling pressure dominate\n\nA range formation between $1843 and $1934 was highlighted in yellow. The brief breakout above this range in early July was quickly swatted down by the bears. Moreover, the OBV, which had been trending higher until then, declined.\n\nOver the past week, the OBV continued to drop as the price dropped to the range lows. A candlewick to the $1826 mark on 7 July saw a quick reversal, which suggested that the bulls were not ready to give up on the range formation yet.\n\nThe RSI oscillated between bullish and bearish territory over the past few days to indicate the lack of a trend. However, on lower timeframes such as 1-hour, there was momentum for traders to profit from.\n\nBut, given the decline in OBV, the consolidation phase could be followed by a downtrend for Ethereum. Until the range lows are ceded to the bears, buyers can look to bid in the $1840-$1860 targeting the high at $1935.\n\nThe spot CVD remained flat despite Ethereum\u2019s bounce from the range lows\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nOn 7 July, after the dip below $1830, Ethereum prices recovered. At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $1885 after rejection from $1900. Even though it was a minor bounce, the spot CVD did not climb higher.\n\nNor did the Open Interest budge much. It remained flat over the past few days and reflected the lack of conviction from speculators. The lack of reaction on the OI despite a minor bounce for Ethereum suggested the bullish side could be weakened."

However, ETH failed to settle above the $1,900 resistance and remained in a range, similar to Bitcoin.\n\nThere was a bearish reaction below $1,880. A low is formed near $1,862 and the price is now moving higher. There was a break above the $1,880 level. The price climbed above the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $1,905 swing high to the $1,862 low.\n\nEther is now trading above $1,870 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.

There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,890 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe trend line is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $1,905 swing high to the $1,862 low. The first major resistance is near the $1,900 zone. A close above the $1,900 resistance could start a decent increase toward $1,955. The next major resistance is near the $1,975 level. Any more gains could send Ether toward the $2,050 resistance.\n\nAnother Decline in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,900 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,870 level or the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is also a connecting bullish trend line at $1,870. The first major support is near the $1,845 level, below which the price might revisit the key support at $1,825. The next major support is near the $1,770 level.

        "content": "Justin Sun, the co-founder of Tron, withdrew 30,000 ETH, worth roughly $56 million, via two addresses via Lido, a liquidity staking service provider, on July 10, Lookonchain reveals. Following his move, his Ethereum stake via Lido is down to 263,294 ETH, or $491.6 million at spot rates.\n\nJustin Sun Unstakes From Ethereum\n\nLookonchain, a blockchain analytics platform, notes that between February 25 and 27, Sun staked 288,100 ETH, or $538 million, and earned 5,194 ETH, or $9 million. This translates to average daily earnings of 38 ETH, or $72,000, going by the annualized percentage yield (APY) of around 4.87% offered by Lido on Ethereum stakers.\n\nThe reasons behind Sun\u2019s withdrawal of 30,000 ETH from Lido are unclear. It could indicate his intention to sell some of the ETH, transfer to a different staking platform, or even run his private Ethereum validator node.\n\nDespite this transfer, Sun remains one of the largest stakers at Lido, accounting for over 9% of the total ETH staked. While Sun\u2019s decision to unstaked and transfer coins may be a cause of concern, ETH prices are firm when writing on July 10 and edging closer to $1,900.\n\nContrary to fears ahead of the Shanghai upgrade in mid-April, the number of users staking ETH remains upward. Trackers show that over 21 million ETH has been locked by over 657,000 validators as of July 10.\n\nWith the Shanghai upgrade implemented, ETH holders who had staked at least 32 ETH in the Beacon Chain from December 2020 can withdraw their assets. Despite earlier fears that more coins will be withdrawn and sold in the spot markets, impacting ETH prices, more validators and more coins have been locked on the Beacon Chain and other staking solutions.\n\nWill The SEC Dampen Coin Staking?\n\nLido, the leading staking provider for ETH, is the largest decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol by total value locked (TVL), according to DeFiLlama. As of July 10, Lido managed over $14.6 billion of assets, most of which are ETH.\n\nOver $14.5 billion of ETH have been delegated and locked through Lido infrastructure. In Lido, users can stake ETH and other supported coins without needing lock-up periods or meeting high requirements, making it an attractive option for some investors.\n\nIn lawsuits filed against crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase in early June, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) alleged that some proof-of-stake coins, including Cardano\u2019s ADA and Algorand\u2019s ALGO, were unregistered securities.\n\nFollowing this assessment, their prices tanked, even impacting ETH. This is partly because Ethereum is now a proof-of-stake network after transiting from a proof-of-work algorithm and uses the same consensus system as those employed by competing smart contract platforms accused of issuing unregistered securities. The situation is worsened by Gary Gensler\u2019s failure to clarify whether ETH is a utility like Bitcoin.\n\nCover image from Canvas, chart from Tradingview\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin price could flip $43,860 into a support floor, bringing the $50,000 psychological level into view.\n\nEthereum price could climb 7% to the $2,500 level as bulls show determination.\n\nRipple price could extend 10% north as bulls make a comeback in the XRP market.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price remains steadfast on the higher timeframe, amid news that spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETF) discussions are now at the technical stage of approval. Specifically, talks with Spot BTC ETF issuers have advanced to key technical details, with Reuters indicating that it could signal a shift toward a potential approval.\n\nAlso Read: This is the level to beat as Bitcoin eyes $50,000 next\n\nBitcoin price could overcome $43,860\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is confronting the $43,860 critical support, marking the midline of a weekly supply zone extending from $40,698 to $46,999. A decisive candlestick close above this mean threshold on the weekly timeframe would confirm the continuation of the primary trend, flipping the supply barrier into a bullish breaker and using it as the springboard for a race to the $50,000 psychological level.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains northbound despite BTC being overbought, indicating momentum continues to rise. Meanwhile, the histogram bars of the Awesome Oscillator (AO) remain in positive territory, flashing green to show that bulls are leading the BTC market. These bolster the case to the upside.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-week chart\n\nOn the flipside, if the supply zone holds as a resistance level, Bitcoin price could face a rejection, deflecting south to lose the support offered by the $40,000 psychological level. In a worse case, the fall could extend to the $30,000 psychological level, with a weekly candlestick close below this level invalidating the bullish thesis.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price hits $44,000 as Coinbase CEO speculates BTC could be key to extending Western civilization\n\nEthereum price could climb 7%\n\nEthereum (ETH) price action remains bullish since mid-October, consolidating within an ascending parallel channel. This is a bullish technical formation, promising more growth as long as the asset\u2019s price remains within its confines.\n\nWith both the RSI and AO indicators supporting the bullish outlook, Ethereum price could rise 7% to the $2,500 level last tested in May 2022.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, should profit-taking kick in, Ethereum price could fail to realize the $2,500 target. The ensuing selling pressure could see ETH dwindle to lose the $2,147 support.\n\nEthereum price could then extend a leg down, converting the midline of the April 18 supply zone extending from $2,049 to $2,107 from a resistance area into a support area by breaking and closing below its midline at $2,075. A daily candlestick close below this level would not only invalidate the bullish thesis but also confirm the continuation of the downtrend.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH attempts to flip $2,300 into support"

        "title": "ERC 7265: An Ethereum Standard For DeFi Security - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nERC 7265 proposes a circuit breaker mechanism to enhance security and mitigate risks in DeFi protocols.\n\nThe circuit breaker temporarily pauses token outflows when predefined thresholds are exceeded, reducing potential losses and improving protocol stability.\n\nDevelopers benefit from flexibility in tailoring the mechanism to their protocol\u2019s requirements.\n\nUser protection is strengthened, which can boost confidence and adoption of DeFi platforms.\n\nThe loss of billions of dollars in user assets as a result of the alarmingly frequent attacks on decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols prompted a group of Ethereum community members to create a new standard targeted at increasing security precautions.\n\nUsers have suffered considerable financial losses as a result of the ongoing wave of vulnerabilities aimed at DeFi technologies. According to recent data from DeFiLlama, almost $6.73 billion has been lost through various flaws, with a startling $5.44 billion finding its way into the hands of DeFi protocol hackers.\n\nWhat Is The ERC 7265 Standard?\n\nERC 7265 is a proposed standard within the Ethereum community that advocates for the inclusion of a \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d mechanism in DeFi protocols. The Circuit Breaker feature is designed to temporarily pause token outflows across an entire protocol when a predefined threshold for a specific metric is surpassed. This mechanism is independent of the underlying protocol structure and primarily acts as a conduit for token outflows.\n\nTo ensure accurate internal accounting for integrated protocols and to offer developers greater flexibility, the circuit breaker contract allows for two options: delaying settlement and temporarily holding custody of outflows during the cooldown period, or reverting attempted outflows. This approach enables developers to tailor the circuit breaker functionality based on their specific requirements while maintaining control and maximizing protocol stability.\n\nBy implementing this fail-safe measure, potential losses can be minimized and the security of DeFi protocols can be significantly enhanced.\n\nWhat Is the Potential Impact Of ERC 7265 On Risk Mitigation?\n\nThe ERC 7265 standard could impact DeFi risks in following ways:\n\nAdded Security\n\nThe security of DeFi protocols can be greatly increased by including a circuit breaker mechanism. The circuit breaker can protect potential losses during unusual market situations or when specific metrics signal potential hazards by momentarily pausing token outflows when predetermined thresholds are exceeded. Users\u2019 funds and general protocol stability may both be protected by this feature.\n\nRisk Reduction\n\nBy giving developers the option to postpone settlement or undo attempted outflows, the circuit breaker mechanism adds another layer of risk reduction. This adaptability enables protocols to quickly address unforeseen risks or problems. Potential losses can be reduced and the overall risk profile of DeFi protocols enhanced by putting in place such fail-safe procedures.\n\nProtocol Stability\n\nWhen market conditions are erratic or anomalies are found, the circuit breaker mechanism can help keep the protocol stable. Protocols can evaluate and address potential problems by temporarily stopping token outflows, which lowers the likelihood of catastrophic failures. People may feel more secure as a result of this consistency, which may also draw more people to DeFi platforms.\n\nFlexibility For Developers\n\nThe circuit breaker contract\u2019s two options provide developers with flexibility to tailor the mechanism based on their specific requirements. This customization can be crucial for protocols with different use cases, risk profiles, or tokenomic designs. Developers can choose the option that aligns best with their protocol\u2019s needs, allowing them to maximize stability and control.\n\nUser Protection\n\nBy reducing potential losses, the circuit breaker mechanism can serve as a safety feature for users. The circuit breaker can assist in preventing more funds from being at risk in the event of a severe circumstance, such as a smart contract vulnerability or an unexpected market meltdown. The adoption of DeFi platforms and a rise in user confidence can both be attributed to this protection.\n\nWill The Implementation Of The ERC 7265 Standard Drive Widespread Adoption Of DeFi?\n\nPotential losses and risks related to protocol weaknesses or unexpected market changes can be reduced by including a fail-safe solution, such as the circuit breaker. Users and investors may feel more secure using this approach because it strengthens the protocol\u2019s security.\n\nAdding a consistent circuit breaker mechanism to diverse DeFi protocols can also increase interoperability and make it simpler for users to move between and engage with different platforms. By lowering complexity and boosting user confidence, standardization encourages uniformity, compatibility, and ease of integration, which can support larger DeFi adoption.\n\nNonetheless, it is important to remember that the success of the ERC-7265 standard\u2014or any standard, for that matter\u2014will depend on a variety of elements, including community support, technical viability, and successful implementation. Additionally, the evolution of DeFi is a dynamic and rapidly changing landscape, with new proposals and standards continuously emerging.\n\nConclusion\n\nRisk reduction and security could both be considerably improved by the proposed ERC-7265 standard inside the DeFi ecosystem. The circuit breaker can reduce possible losses and increase protocol stability by momentarily pausing token outflows when predefined thresholds are exceeded.\n\nDevelopers can customize it depending on individual protocol requirements due to its flexibility, and user safety is improved thanks to lower risks and greater confidence. By enhancing interoperability and streamlining user interaction with various platforms, the standardization of such techniques can help promote broad adoption.\n\nFAQs:\n\nIs ERC 7265 a recognized standard in the Ethereum community?\n\nERC 7265 standard has recently gained recognition and adoption within the Ethereum community.\n\nHow does the circuit breaker mechanism work in ERC 7265?\n\nThe circuit breaker mechanism in ERC 7265 temporarily pauses token outflows across a DeFi protocol when a predefined threshold for a specific metric is surpassed. This helps mitigate risks and potential losses during abnormal market conditions.\n\nCan the circuit breaker be customized by developers?\n\nYes, the circuit breaker contract in ERC 7265 allows developers to choose between delaying settlement and temporarily holding custody of outflows during a cooldown period or reverting attempted outflows. This flexibility enables developers to tailor the mechanism to their specific protocol requirements.\n\nCan the implementation of ERC 7265 propel the adoption of DeFi on a large scale?\n\nWhile the inclusion of fail-safe mechanisms like the circuit breaker can enhance security and reduce risks, widespread adoption of DeFi depends on various factors such as community support, technical viability, and successful implementation. Standardization efforts, including the introduction of ERC 7265, can contribute to larger adoption by increasing interoperability and user confidence."

The NDX continues to outperform current liquidity conditions. This also happened in the past in 2019, for example \u2013 you can\u2019t hold a beach ball underwater for long \u2013 the NDX will always tend to outperform.\u201d\n\nPal says the NDX is likely to keep climbing on the back of secular trends like the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and a weakening dollar.\n\n\u201cRemember: NDX = Debasement + Secular trend.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Ethereum is trading for $1,880, up 1% during the last 24 hours. ETH reached an all-time high of $4,878 on November 10th, 2021.\n\nThe macro guru is also watching the performance of the US dollar index (DXY), which compares the American currency versus a bucket of other fiat currencies.\n\nPal says that the DXY is likely to break its support at 100 in the coming months, which he notes could boost the performance of risk-on assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies.\n\n\u201cOur base case at GMI (Global Macro Investor) is that we\u2019re trading within a larger symmetrical triangle (continuation pattern). A break of 100 likely means the next stop is 90, which we expect to play out over the next twelve to eighteen months as the business cycle starts to bottom \u2013 a broadly supportive environment for risk assets\u2026\n\nDollar weakness is not the ONLY thing that matters for risk assets and crypto markets, but looking back, it\u2019s a pretty big plus.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is worth $30,367 at time of writing, up 0.7% in the last 24 hours.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Over the past few days, the Ethereum price has remained relatively stable, with minor gains seen on the daily chart. Meanwhile, Bitcoin\u2019s indecisiveness has resulted in slower movement for altcoins.\n\nDespite this, Ethereum has risen on its chart, although the technical outlook suggests low demand and accumulation due to reduced buying strength.\n\nDespite the fall in buying strength, buyers still hold an advantage over sellers in the market. However, if Ethereum fails to move above its immediate resistance, the coin may retrace on its chart, potentially falling below its local support level and activating bearish sentiment.\n\nInvestors are now looking ahead to the release of US CPI data, which analysts predict will significantly impact the market in the coming weeks. The market capitalization of Ethereum has fallen slightly, indicating slow demand for the altcoin.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis: One-Day Chart\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH was priced at $1,870. The daily chart indicated a potential breakout as the price approached the upper boundary of a rectangle pattern. The crucial overhead resistance for Ethereum was identified at $1,880. If the price managed to surpass this level, it could potentially exceed $1,900 and ultimately reach the milestone of $2,000. However, it was essential for ETH to surpass the $1,880 mark in the upcoming trading sessions. On the downside, there was a local support level of $1,820. A dip below this point could lead to a decline towards $1,770. Technical Analysis The inability to break through the $1,900 level had a detrimental impact on investor confidence, resulting in ongoing challenges for Ethereum regarding demand on the daily chart. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) remained positive, although it suggested a relatively low level of demand. Furthermore, Ethereum\u2019s current position below the 20-Simple Moving Average line indicated a decline in buying strength, indicating that buyers were gradually losing control of the price momentum. In addition to the low buying strength, ETH also experienced a decline on capital inflows. This indicated a decline in investor interest, as evidenced by the Chaikin Money Flow indicator. Conversely, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) formed declining red histograms, suggesting a potential breakout in the upcoming trading sessions. The MACD is a useful tool for identifying price momentum and trend changes.

Discover SCENE\n\nBankrupt crypto lender Celsius has accused StakeHound of failing to hand back $150 million worth of various tokens which it had entrusted to the liquid staking platform.\n\nIn a complaint filed as part of Celsius\u2019s ongoing bankruptcy proceedings, lawyers also alleged that StakeHound had violated bankruptcy rules by commencing an arbitration proceeding against the business in Switzerland.\n\nLeveling claims of breach of contract and \u201cwillful misconduct\u201d against StakeHound, the complaint says the firm should be required to turn over Celsius\u2019 property, as well as pay compensatory damages and attorneys\u2019 fees.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt the heart of the case are $120 million worth of Ethereum (ETH), $30 million in Polygon (MATIC), and Polkadot (DOT) tokens worth $300,000, based on recent prices.\n\nStakehound, which discontinued its staking activities in June 2021, offered liquidity to users who wanted to \u201cstake\u201d crypto\u2013a process whereby tokens are pledged to the network and earn rewards in return\u2013by wrapping assets into \u201cstaked tokens\u201d which represent the underlying asset on a 1:1 basis.\n\nWhile their assets were locked up, customers received so-called \u201cstTokens,\u201d which they could present when they wanted to claim their tokens back.\n\nBut Celsius claims that StakeHound refused to return its assets in exchange for the stTokens.\n\nAccording to the filing, StakeHound blamed the loss of the keys associated with 35,000 of Celsius\u2019s ETH tokens for its failure to return the assets.\n\nThe incident was made public in June 2021, with StakeHound blaming the supposed negligence of custody firm Fireblocks.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn action taken in a Swiss court in April this year, StakeHound argued that it had \u201cno obligation\u201d whatsoever to exchange Ethereum for the stTokens it had issued to Celsius.\n\nLaunching that arbitration process violates Section 362 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, according to Celsius\u2019 lawyers. Known as the \u201cautomatic stay,\u201d this provision prevents creditors and other entities from pursuing debts or taking legal action against a company that has filed for bankruptcy.\n\nCelsius was, its lawyers claim, by far StakeHound\u2019s largest customer. Its business is thought to have accounted for more than 90% of the total tokens managed by the platform.\n\nThe Ethereum in question was locked up in anticipation of the blockchain\u2019s long-awaited upgrade, which took place in April this year, unlocking a bumper pool of staked ETH.\n\nHowever, StakeHound has allegedly refused to confirm whether Celsius\u2019s assets became unlocked once the upgrade was completed."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nEthereum Improvement Proposal 1153 is set to change the way Ethereum (ETH) blockchain processes the data. As a more advanced storage function, it will make the second largest blockchain more gas efficient than ever before.\n\nHere's how Ethereum (ETH) becomes more gas efficient with EIP-1153\n\nUniswap v4, a much-anticipated release by the world's most popular DEX Uniswap, will rely on EIP-1153 \"Transient Storage Opcodes,\" the new thread says. Therefore, it will allow traders and liquidity providers to save on gas fees.\n\n1/ EIP-1153 will be a huge step forward for Ethereum and we hope to see in the next hard fork \ud83c\udf34\n\n\n\nAmong other things, it saves gas on transactions \u2014 making it better for all dapps, including v4.\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s dive into it: \u2014 Uniswap Labs \ud83e\udd84 (@Uniswap) July 11, 2023\n\nThe upgrade is designed to change the manner in which the blockchain writes and erases data about transactions happening between accounts. Instead of writing to storage and clearing it before the transaction is over, smart contracts will now be able to leverage \"transient storage,\" a completely new data mechanism. Its activation will take place with the addition of some new opcodes.\n\nTransient storage is a cheaper and more streamlined instrument for data management. It also enables a couple of new use cases for Ethereum (ETH) and EVM ecosystem dApps.\n\nFor instance, in Uniswap v4, all liquidity pools will be held in one smart contract. This will make liquidity logistics between various pools faster and cheaper.\n\nInstead of transferring assets between pools, the system will only change net balances with cross-asset swaps.\n\nEIP-1153 to be activated after Cancun upgrade\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, \"Transient Storage Opcodes\" are among the most anticipated additions to Ethereum's (ETH) network design.\n\nThe Ethereum Cancun upgrade that features major improvements to Ethereum's (ETH) design is expected to be activated in Q4, 2023. Besides EIP-1153, it will include a new \"pay\" opcode, advance memory efficiency, re-camp call instructions and so on.\n\nWith EIP-4844, Ethereum (ETH) fees are expected to drop by 100x, per the estimations of long-term Ethereum (ETH) ecosystem enthusiasts."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin continued to trade flat at roughl$31,700 on Wednesday after the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) published June\u2019s inflation data, reflecting a monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) increase of 0.2%, and a yearly increase of 3.0%.\n\nEthereum also only faced a minor gain of 1.3%, per CoinGecko, and is now trading at nearly $1,900.\n\nThe increase fell just short of economists' estimates as polled by Dow Jones, which expected a 0.3% month-over-month increase, and an annual rise of 3.1%.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, core CPI\u2013which discounts the food and energy sectors due to their known volatility\u2013rose by just 0.2% which is the \u201csmallest 1-month increase in that index since August 2021,\u201d per the BLS.\n\nSince March 2022, the Federal Reserve has rapidly risen its policy interest rate in a mission to bring searing inflation back to its 2% target in the United States, after peaking last June at 9.1%.\n\nSo far, the central bank\u2019s efforts seem to be paying off, with annualized inflation down 1% from last month alone.\n\nSadly for investors, rising interest rates have also contributed to cratering stock and crypto prices throughout the last year, with both major tech and blockchain companies being forced to enact massive layoffs.\n\nAs such, falling inflation is generally taken as bullish for markets, since it means the Fed is closer to ending its hawkish monetary policy.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile the central bank chose to keep its policy rate unchanged last month, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has been hesitant to indicate whether this means rate hikes will pause or resume in the near future.\n\nAccording to the CME FedWatch tool, markets are 91% confident that another 0.25% rate hike is in the cards at the next Federal Open Markets Committee Meeting (FOMC) on July 26.\n\nMarkets are still waiting on June\u2019s Personal Consumption Index (PCI) figures, which track how consumers change their buying habits over time. This is the Fed\u2019s preferred measure of inflation as it\u2019s considered a strong predictor of where inflation is headed in the future. It currently projects this figure at 3.2%.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s non-reaction on Wednesday may be an indication of its current place in its cyclical market cycle.\n\nAs reported by Glassnode on Monday, Bitcoin\u2019s price has reached an \u201cequilibrium point\u201d which often signals an incoming \u201caccumulation phase\u201d during which the asset\u2019s price trades flat for many months to come."

Sign-up to receive world-class macro analysis with a daily curated newsletter, podcast, original content from award-winning researchers, cross market strategy, equity insights, trade ideas, crypto flow frameworks, academic paper summaries, explanation and analysis of market-moving events, community investor chat room, and more.\n\nSummary\n\nTrading View (next 2-4 weeks): We like to be slightly bullish ethereum.\n\nInvestment View (next 1-3 years): We like to hold ethereum.\n\nMacro Signals\n\nThe labour market is still hot.\n\nWe expect the Federal Reserve (Fed) to hike twice more this year.\n\nWe think the Fed\u2019s two planned hikes are unlikely to break the broader risk market rally.\n\nOn-Chain/Flow Signals\n\nWe have three bullish signals, two bearish, and one neutral.\n\nOverall View\n\nWith the macro backdrop neutral and our on-chain/flow metrics slightly bullish, our overall signal is slightly bullish ethereum (Chart 1).\n\nMacro: The Labour Market Is Still Hot\n\nThe labour market is still hot. The US ADP private sector employment report revealed 497,000 private-sector jobs were added in June against expectations of 220,000. Furthermore, despite a negative surprise in nonfarm payrolls (NFPs), the details continue to show a strong labour market: labour demand growth is slowing from the unsustainable highs of the pandemic but remains well above pre-pandemic levels.\n\nThe Fed will hike twice more this year. The Fed is on track to hike 25bps this month, and we expect a second 25bp hike in November. Markets are convinced of a July hike but are yet to fully price a November hike, which is Dominique\u2019s base case. Furthermore, they are also overestimating Fed 2024 rate cuts.\n\nWill rate hikes break the risk rally? Dominique sees the two rate hikes planned by the Fed this year as unlikely to break the broader risk market rally, though signs of inflation persistence temper her optimism longer term.\n\nOn-Chain/Flow Metrics: HODLers Dominate\n\nWe have two bullish signals this week:\n\nLiquidity demand: bias for exchange outflows.\n\nbias for exchange outflows. P&L: the profitability of the coin supply has ticked up recently, and realised profits still dominate on chain (SOPR > 1).\n\nthe profitability of the coin supply has ticked up recently, and realised profits still dominate on chain (SOPR > 1). HODLer behaviour: 62% of the coin supply has not moved in at least a year, and the uptrend in the proportion shows no signs of abating yet.\n\nWe have two bearish signals:\n\nInstitutional demand: ETF outflows resume.\n\nETF outflows resume. : total value locked in DeFi for ethereum falls.\n\nThe remaining signal is neutral:\n\nFutures activity: futures open interest has not moved meaningfully on a MoM basis despite funding rates remaining positive on average (though trending down in magnitude).\n\nOn balance, on-chain/flow metrics are giving a slightly bullish bias for ethereum. Here are the details of each metric (with explanations in the Appendix).\n\nInstitutional Demand: Bearish Ethereum\n\nOur preferred metric to track institutional demand is flows into ethereum ETFs. After a brief period of inflows toward the end of June, outflows have resumed (Chart 2). In general, the year so far has had a bias for outflows. This is bearish for ethereum.\n\nDemand for Liquidity and Exchange Activity: Bullish Ethereum\n\nOn exchange flows:\n\nShort term, a bias exists for exchange outflows with net 109,000 ETH exiting exchanges over the past two weeks (Chart 3).\n\nLonger term, the 30-day change in the exchange balance remains in deep negative territory with the total exchange balance down 1.2mn ETH MoM (Chart 4).\n\nOn balance, the bias for exchange outflows is bullish for ethereum.\n\nFutures Activity: Neutral Ethereum\n\nOn futures markets:\n\nFutures open interest, a good proxy for investor interest, is currently around $4.9bn (-2% MoM, Chart 5).\n\nPerpetual funding rates have been trending down, though they remain positive on average, meaning traders are paying a premium to keep open long positions (Chart 6).\n\nFutures open interest has not moved meaningfully on a MoM basis and, despite funding rates remaining positive on average, their magnitude has been decreasing. Overall, this is neutral for ethereum.\n\nHODLers: Bullish Ethereum\n\nOn HODLer metrics:\n\nThe 30-day moving average of the coin days destroyed (CDD) metric is down -5% MoM, suggesting reduced movement of older coins over the past month (Chart 7).\n\n\n\nSplitting the entire coin supply into those who have held for under one year and those for one year or more reveals the latter vintage continues to set new all-time highs, with 62% (+62bps MoM) of the coin supply having not moved in at least a year (Chart 8).\n\nA sizeable proportion of the ethereum supply remains dormant, pointing to a strong investor base that continues to hold despite ongoing macroeconomic and regulatory headwinds. This is bullish for ethereum.\n\nInvestor Profit and Loss: Bullish Ethereum\n\nOn profitability of the coin supply:\n\nThe percentage of circulating supply in profit (PSIP) is 60% (+11bps MoM, Chart 10).\n\nNet unrealised profit/loss (NUPL) is now 0.15 (15% of market cap, +5bps MoM, Chart 11). This means that the overall ethereum supply remains in a state of unrealised profit (NUPL > 0) as market cap exceeds realised cap.\n\nThe spent output profit ratio (SOPR, price sold/price paid) has been falling on average this month, but it still maintains a bias for levels above one (realised profits, Chart 12). Year to date, 80% of days have seen realised profits. Furthermore, over the past 30 days, 80% of days have had a SOPR value above one.\n\nThe profitability of the coin supply has recovered to over 50% and realised profits on-chain (SOPR > 1) still dominate. Overall, this is bullish ethereum.\n\nDeFi: Bearish Ethereum\n\nOf the top five DeFi protocols by total value locked (TVL), all are down in terms of their TVL (Charts 13 and 14). Ethereum\u2019s TVL is down the most (-3% WoW) \u2013 this is bearish.\n\nAppendix\n\nInstitutional Demand\n\nPerhaps the largest institutional vehicle for ethereum is the Grayscale ETHE Trust, with over $27bn in assets. It invests solely in ETH, and so many investors, notably institutional, who cannot hold ETH directly can get exposure through investing in Grayscale. Consequently, if the trust trades at a premium to ETH prices, it may imply \u2018excess\u2019 demand from institutions, but \u2018excess\u2019 supply if it trades at a discount. Alternatively, the discount may suggest investors have found other ways to get exposure to ETH, whether through ETFs or directly holding ETH. We therefore focus on how the discount has changed in recent months to gauge investor interest. Alternatively, investors may be using other vehicles to get exposure such as ETFs or holding ETH directly. We put more weight on ETF flows than the Grayscale premium.\n\nLiquidity Demand\n\nAnother measure of cryptocurrency bullishness is whether investors are willing to hold it in illiquid form (e.g., a private wallet) or prefer a liquid form (e.g., on an exchange). The former would suggest investors are bullish, as they are comfortable with being unable to sell easily. Conversely, holding it in liquid form would suggest investors are bearish, as they prefer being able to sell easily.\n\nTherefore, large flows onto crypto exchanges would suggest investors want to convert their holdings to a more liquid form, implying more bearishness.\n\nFutures Activity\n\nWe track the growing market of ethereum futures. Open interest \u2013 the sum of long and short contracts \u2013 is a good measure of investor interest.\n\nPerpetual funding rates reveal the directional bias of investors. Exchanges set funding rates to prevent a lasting divergence in the price of the futures contract and the underlying since perpetual contracts have no expiry date so never settle in the traditional sense. Consequently, we can interpret funding rates as the cost of holding ethereum via perpetual futures. Positive funding rates imply longs pay shorts and vice versa. We use it as a proxy for trader sentiment since a positive funding rate implies traders are paying a premium to keep open long positions.\n\nHODLers\n\nIn our introductory bitcoin flow framework, we explained \u2018HODLers\u2019 and \u2018HODLing.\u2019 HODLing refers to buy-and-hold strategies in the context of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Those who HODL for extended periods are die-hard adherents.\n\nWe can categorise HODLers by the length of time they have held ETH. We define long-term or staunch HODLers as those who bought ETH five or more years ago and have held it ever since, medium-term HODLers as those who bought 6-12 months ago, and short-term HODLers as those who bought 3-6 months ago.\n\nThe coin days destroyed (CDD) metric is defined as the number of coins in a transaction multiplied by the number of days since the coins were last spent. So, increasing CDD suggests older coins are being spent (more coin days are destroyed) and vice-versa.\n\nProfit and Loss\n\nThe percent supply in profit (PSIP). This tracks the share of circulating ETH supply in profit. That is the percentage of circulating ETH whose current price is higher than when it was last transacted (movement).\n\nNet unrealized profit and loss (NUPL). This is the ratio of unrealised profits over total market capitalisation. While PSIP just focuses on whether ETH coins are in profit or not, the NUPL focuses on the size of profits. So, we could have a situation where the PSIP is low \u2013 that is, a low share of supply is in profit \u2013 but the NUPL could be high if the size of those profits is large.\n\nSpent output profit ratio (SOPR). While PSIP and NUPL focus on unrealised profits or mark-to-market, this measure focuses on realised profits. SOPR is the realised value of a transaction divided by the value at initiation (or creation) \u2013 more simply, price sold divided by price paid. If SOPR is above one, investors in aggregate have realised profits, while below one means they have realised losses. In broad uptrends, SOPR spends a significant amount of time above one, whereas the opposite is true for broad downtrends.\n\nWhen SOPR is rising, sellers are increasingly realising profits. The opposite is true when it is falling. A price rally with a flatter SOPR trend indicates investors are not yet realising their profits with the rally. The reluctance of investors to sell and realise a profit may be because they believe the price will increase further, which would be bullish. At the same time, more profit taking could precede a correction. Typically, buying as SOPR moves around one during bullish periods has proven to be a profitable strategy.\n\nMining Activity\n\nComputing power is central to the crypto market. Miners use advanced computing hardware to solve complex problems that confirm ETH (and other coins) transactions on the public ledger or blockchain. The miners are rewarded with new coins for their efforts. A measure of the complexity of the problems and so the computing performance required to solve them is the hash rate. The higher this rate, the more computing performance is needed to maintain the blockchain. The rate can fluctuate depending on demand for crypto.\n\nDeFi\n\nWe track the total value locked (TVL) in decentralized finance (DeFi) \u2013 the sum of all assets deposited in DeFi protocols, many of which use ethereum as the underlying protocol. The more DeFi products are created, the more ethereum gets locked into the DeFi system and removed from the broader market. This reduction in supply should lead to higher ethereum prices.\n\nDalvir Mandara is a Quantitative Researcher at Macro Hive.

However, more protocols will be added in the future.\n\nThe announcement also noted that the staking feature will only be available in \u201cselect markets.\u201d Unfortunately, the official release does not state which markets the new staking initiative will be available in. The feature is not available to citizens or residents of the U.S. and its territories, Australia, Canada, Hong Kong SAR, South Korea, Singapore, Thailand, and Malta.\n\nAlso Read: Rise in Ethereum Staking Still Carries Major \u2018Lido\u2019 Risk\n\nThe minimum staking amount for all three protocols is currently set at 1.00E-08. Moreover, there is no minimum staking period for all three projects. However, the frequency of rewards is different for each asset. Ethereum (ETH) stakers will receive rewards every 7 days, Solana (SOL) stakers every 2.5 days, and Polkadot (DOT) stakers will receive them every day.\n\nStaking allows investors to participate in securing the network while receiving rewards for doing so. Typically, stakers join staking pools managed by validators, who aid in transaction verification and adding them to the network. In exchange, they are rewarded with freshly minted tokens. After deducting their costs, validators can proportionally distribute the rewards to stakeholders.\n\nEthereum, Solana, and Polkadot staking on the rise\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) network has seen a significant rise in staking after the Shapella upgrade. According to crypto analysis firm Glassnode, the total ETH locked in staking has surpassed 26 million. On the other hand, ETH\u2019s circulating supply has consequently declined.\n\nSource: Glassnode\n\nThe Shapella upgrade allowed stakers to unstake their tokens, which has boosted investor confidence.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Could be a Layer-2 for Solana: Co-Founder\n\nSolana (SOL) on the other hand, had seen a massive plummet in TVL (total value locked) since June 2022. However, the trend is slowly changing in 2023. According to DefiLlama, locked SOL has seen an upward movement since the beginning of this year.\n\nPolkadot (DOT), according to Messari, has about 45.7% of its supply currently staked, which amounts to about 607.20 million tokens, in Q2 2023. This is a decline from the 50% which was staked in Q1 2023. According to Messari, the lower percentage results in higher stake rewards, which promotes greater stake involvement. Moreover, the analysis firm noted that Polkadot has consistently kept its staking percentage towards its desired level.\n\nAlso Read: Vitalik Buterin Advocates for Bitcoin\u2019s Exploration of Layer-2 Solutions"

        "content": "Aave V3 users will be able to mint GHO tokens on Ethereum\u2019s mainnet if the proposal is approved by the community.\n\nThe proposal also suggested using staked Aave coins as a way to cut down GHO borrowing costs and incentivize users to mint the stablecoin.\n\nGHO developers rigorously tested the stablecoin on Ethereum\u2019s Goerlie testnet since February and did not encounter any major bugs with the product.\n\nThe Aave DAO community will soon vote on a proposal aimed at launching the GHO stablecoin on Ethereum\u2019s mainnet after months of testing on Goerli, a popular testnet on Ethereum.\n\nIf approved, users would be able to mint GHO tokens against their collateral directly on Ethereum\u2019s main chain. GHO\u2019s interest rate will be changeable through Aave DAO governance votes.\n\nProposed by Aave Companies, an active contributor to the DeFi lender, the plan hopes to generate additional revenue for the project\u2019s DAO. The proposal also would bootstrap competition among stablecoin borrowers on the lender\u2019s platform, per the AIP.\n\nIf approved, the introduction of GHO would make stablecoin borrowing on the Aave Protocol more competitive and generate additional revenue for the Aave DAO by providing to the DAO treasury 100% of the interest payments made on GHO borrows.\n\nVoting on the proposal opens later today at 22:02 UTC +01:00 and ends 14 Jul 2023, 14:02 UTC +01:00.\n\nGHO Minting Via Aave Facilitators, Aave DAO Plans\n\nThe proposal plans to introduce GHO minting on Ethereum through facilitators \u2013 protocols or entities that are able to burn and mint GHO coins. \u201cThis proposal combined two previously approved Facilitators (the Aave V3 Ethereum Pool and the FlashMinter)\u201d, the proposal reads.\n\nThis means that users have two options for minting GHO tokens. They can either deposit collateral in the V3 Ethereum Mainnet Pool and borrow GHO through Aave V3 Ethereum Pool or lash mint GHO tokens without any collateral using the FlashMinter Facilitator. The latter option requires that users repay the loan in a single transaction.\n\nThis AIP also proposes slashing the cost of borrowing GHO by using a mechanism built on Staked Aave (stkAAVE).\n\nIn other related news, the DAO is also voting to increase staking revenue by converting unproductive ETH from its treasury into wrapped staked ETH and rocket pool ETH."

Ethereum is one of the most popular and widely used blockchain decplatforms, known for its ability to Dentralized applications (DApps). However, as Ethereum gained popularity, it became evidexecute smart contracts and build ent that the network\u2019s capacity was struggling to keep up with the increasing demand, leading to issues such as high fees, network congestion, and slower transaction speeds.\n\nTo address these challenges, developers and researchers have been working on scaling solutions that aim to improve Ethereum\u2019s scalability, throughput, and efficiency. These scaling solutions can be categorized into two main types: layer-one (on-chain) solutions and layer-two (off-chain) solutions.\n\n1. Layer-One Scaling Solutions:\n\nLayer-one scaling solutions involve making changes to the underlying Ethereum protocol itself, primarily focusing on improving the blockchain\u2019s base layer. These solutions aim to enhance the Ethereum network\u2019s scalability and capacity, allowing it to process a higher number of transactions per second (TPS) and reducing fees. Some notable layer-one scaling solutions include:\n\na. Ethereum 2.0 (Eth2): Ethereum 2.0 is a major upgrade of the Ethereum network that is being implemented in phases. It introduces a new consensus mechanism called Proof of Stake (PoS) to replace the existing Proof of Work (PoW). Eth2 also introduces shard chains, which will enable parallel processing of transactions, significantly increasing the network\u2019s scalability and capacity.\n\nb. Beacon Chain: The Beacon Chain is the core component of Ethereum 2.0 and serves as the coordination and consensus layer for the entire network. It manages validators, handles consensus, and coordinates crosslinks between shard chains, enabling parallel processing and improving overall scalability.\n\nc. Shard Chains: Ethereum 2.0 introduces shard chains, which are additional chains that run in parallel to the Ethereum main chain. These shard chains allow for increased transaction throughput and improved scalability by dividing the network\u2019s workload across multiple chains.\n\n2. Layer-Two Scaling Solutions:\n\nLayer-two scaling solutions build on top of the existing Ethereum network and aim to scale Ethereum by processing transactions off-chain or using sidechains, while still maintaining the security and trust of the main Ethereum blockchain. These solutions provide faster and cheaper transactions without directly impacting the base layer. Some prominent layer-two scaling solutions include:\n\na. State Channels: State channels enable off-chain transactions between participants, where only the final state of the transaction is recorded on the Ethereum blockchain. By conducting most of the transactions off-chain, state channels reduce congestion and improve scalability.\n\nb. Plasma: Plasma is a framework that allows for the creation of sidechains connected to the Ethereum main chain. Sidechains can handle a high volume of transactions and periodically commit their state to the main chain, providing scalability while retaining the security of the Ethereum network.\n\nc. Rollups: Rollups are layer-two solutions that bundle multiple transactions into a single transaction that is submitted to the Ethereum main chain. There are two types of rollups: optimistic rollups and zk-rollups. Optimistic rollups assume that transactions are valid by default but allow challenges if any invalid transactions are detected. Zk-rollups use zero-knowledge proofs to validate the correctness of the bundled transactions, providing scalability while maintaining high security.\n\nThese layer-one and layer-two scaling solutions are not mutually exclusive, and they can be combined to achieve even greater scalability and efficiency. Ethereum developers and the community are actively researching and implementing these scaling solutions to address the network\u2019s limitations and unlock the full potential of decentralized applications, enabling a more scalable and sustainable Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nEthereum Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin, on a #Twitter Spaces said: \u201cI think if we want #Bitcoin to be more than payments, it needs more scaling solutions, pointing to several experiments that #Ethereum has been trying out over the past years\u201d.#Crypto #BTC #ETF #BitcoinETF\u2026 pic.twitter.com/nlvLsE1yDp \u2014 Fahad Faqeeh (@FahadFaqeeh65) July 10, 2023\n\nAlso read: 10 Best Books To Learn About Ethereum To Understand Open- Source Blockchain\n\nRelation between Ethereum Scaling Solutions and Blockchain\n\nEthereum scaling solutions and blockchain are intricately connected.

        "content": "After a strong rally in the second half of June 2023, the Bitcoin (BTC) price has been consolidating for a while around the $30,500 level. As we can see in the below image, BTC has been consolidating throughout July around these levels showing signs of compression. This shows that there\u2019s a possibility of an imminent breakout going ahead.\n\nOn-chain data further support that the breakout could be in the upward direction going ahead. Crypto analytics firm Santiment points out the net realized profit loss vs price for BTC and ETH.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIt notes that after three weeks of prices fluctuating, both Bitcoin and Ethereum are experiencing slight losses compared to their previous values. Average traders are moving their assets at small losses. When the Net Realized Profit/Loss (NRPL) indicator is negative in relation to the price, there is a greater chance of positive price movement in the future.\n\nOther good signs for Bitcoin have been the growing whale accumulation over the last three weeks as BTC enters price consolidation. On the other hand, the exchange reserves have also been falling.\n\nJust Like Bitcoin, Ethereum Shows Strength\n\nLast week, Ethereum (ETH) experience some greater price volatility with its price taking a dive under $1,850. However, it has recovered since then and has moved closer to the $1,900 level.\n\nIt is worth noting that Ethereum has strong support in the price range of $1,800 to $1,870. Within this range, a total of 3.4 million addresses have bought 11.2 million ETH.\n\nOn the other hand, there is a significant resistance level between $2,040 and $2,100. In this range, 1 million addresses had previously purchased 27 million ETH, explains popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez.\n\nCurrently, there\u2019s a tight battle between the ETH bulls and bears, but technical indicators show a possibility of a breakout to $2,050. Any further movements in the BTC and ETH prices could provide a major push to the broader crypto market."

It was proposed by Vitalik Buterin in late 2013 and officially launched on July 30, 2015. Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency is called Ether (ETH), which is used to facilitate transactions and incentivize participants on the network.\n\nEthereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain platform that enables the creation and execution of smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). It was proposed by Vitalik Buterin in late 2013 and officially launched on July 30, 2015. Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency is called Ether (ETH), which is used to facilitate transactions and incentivize participants on the network.\n\nAt its core, Ethereum is a decentralized platform that allows developers to build and deploy smart contracts. Smart contracts are self-executing agreements with predefined rules and conditions written into code. They automatically execute transactions and actions when specific conditions are met, eliminating the need for intermediaries or third parties.\n\nEthereum introduced the concept of a Turing-complete programming language within its blockchain, allowing developers to create complex and highly customizable decentralized applications. This flexibility has led to the rapid growth of the Ethereum ecosystem and the development of various decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized exchanges, and much more.\n\nEthereum operates on a distributed network of computers called nodes. These nodes maintain a copy of the entire Ethereum blockchain and work together to validate and record transactions. This decentralized nature ensures that there is no central point of control or failure, making the network resilient to censorship and single points of failure.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain uses a consensus mechanism known as Proof-of-Work (PoW), although there are plans to transition to a more energy-efficient consensus algorithm called Proof-of-Stake (PoS) with the upcoming Ethereum 2.0 upgrade. PoW requires miners to solve complex mathematical puzzles to validate transactions and secure the network. Miners are rewarded with Ether for their computational efforts.\n\nEthereum\u2019s blockchain consists of a series of blocks, each containing a list of transactions and a reference to the previous block, creating a chronological chain of data. This ensures the immutability and integrity of the blockchain. Ethereum also allows for the storage of data and the execution of code within its blockchain, enabling developers to create decentralized applications that are censorship-resistant and tamper-proof.\n\nThe Ethereum ecosystem is supported by a vibrant community of developers, entrepreneurs, and enthusiasts. The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a runtime environment that executes smart contracts on the Ethereum network. It enables developers to write code in various programming languages, including Solidity (Ethereum\u2019s native language), Vyper, and others.\n\nIn addition to its role as a platform for creating DApps, Ethereum has its own economy and serves as a financial instrument. Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency, can be used for various purposes within the Ethereum ecosystem. It can be traded on cryptocurrency exchanges, used to pay for transaction fees (gas) when executing smart contracts or transferring tokens, and staked to participate in the network\u2019s consensus mechanism.\n\nOverall, Ethereum has revolutionized the blockchain industry by providing a powerful platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts. Its open nature, flexibility, and growing ecosystem have made it a popular choice for developers and entrepreneurs seeking to build innovative and transparent applications in a decentralized manner.\n\nBlockchain is a decentralized and distributed ledger technology that allows multiple participants to maintain a shared, tamper-resistant, and transparent record of transactions or information. It was originally introduced as the underlying technology for the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, but its potential applications have expanded far beyond digital currencies.\n\nAt its core, a blockchain is a chain of blocks, where each block contains a list of transactions or data. These blocks are linked together using cryptographic hashes, creating a chronological and immutable record of all transactions or information stored on the blockchain.\n\nThe key features of blockchain technology are decentralization, transparency, security, and immutability.\n\nDecentralization: Unlike traditional centralized systems where a central authority, such as a bank or government, maintains and controls the data, a blockchain operates in a decentralized manner. It is distributed across multiple computers or nodes that participate in the network. Each node has a copy of the entire blockchain, and transactions are validated and added to the ledger through a consensus mechanism agreed upon by the network participants. This decentralized nature eliminates the need for intermediaries and creates a trustless environment where participants can interact directly with one another.\n\nTransparency: Blockchain provides transparency by allowing anyone to view the transactions or information recorded on the blockchain. Once a transaction is added to the blockchain, it becomes visible to all participants in the network. This transparency promotes accountability and reduces the potential for fraud or manipulation since the data is open and verifiable by anyone.\n\nSecurity: Blockchain ensures the security of transactions and data through cryptographic techniques. Each transaction or block is secured using a cryptographic hash, which is a unique digital fingerprint generated by an algorithm. Any modification to the data within a block would result in a different hash, making it easily detectable. Moreover, blockchain\u2019s decentralized nature and consensus mechanism make it highly resistant to attacks or unauthorized changes. To alter a transaction or block, an attacker would need to control the majority of the network\u2019s computing power, making it computationally infeasible and economically unviable.\n\nImmutability: Once a transaction or block is added to the blockchain, it is nearly impossible to alter or delete it. This immutability is a result of the cryptographic linking between blocks and the decentralized consensus mechanism. As new blocks are added to the blockchain, they are linked to previous blocks using cryptographic hashes. This chaining of blocks makes it computationally expensive to alter past transactions, as it would require modifying all subsequent blocks as well. The immutability of blockchain provides a high level of data integrity and builds trust among participants.\n\nBlockchain technology has expanded beyond cryptocurrencies and is now being explored and implemented in various industries and sectors. It has the potential to revolutionize supply chain management, voting systems, financial services, healthcare, identity verification, real estate, and more. Smart contracts, which are self-executing agreements with predefined conditions written into code, can be deployed on blockchains to automate and enforce contractual obligations without the need for intermediaries.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that blockchain technology also has its limitations. It can be computationally expensive and slower compared to centralized systems, and scaling the technology to handle large volumes of transactions is an ongoing challenge. Nevertheless, ongoing research and development efforts are focused on improving scalability and addressing other limitations to unlock the full potential of blockchain technology.\n\nAlso read: 10 Best Books To Learn About Ethereum To Understand Open- Source Blockchain\n\nRelation between Ethereum and Blockchain\n\nEthereum is one of the most prominent implementations of blockchain technology.

        "content": "Ethereum layer-2 ecosystem is heating up with the space seeing yet another entry by ConsenSys, an already established player in the industry. ConsenSys, the firm behind MetaMask, announced the launch of its layer-2 network \u2013 Linea \u2013 to the main Ethereum blockchain this week. It will soon begin onboarding partners as well.\n\nThe new layer-2 scaling solution is a zkEVM rollup network leveraging zero-knowledge proofs while making it an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) equivalent.\n\nConsenSys\u2019s zkEVM Rollup Network \u2013 Linea\n\nConsenSys is the latest company to ride the growing trend of zkEVM with its new offering Linea that has already witnessed a successful testnet phase with 5.5 million unique wallets conducting more than 46 million transactions. According to the company, Linea has emerged as one of the largest and fastest-growing projects in Goerli.\n\nBefore hitting the mainnet at ETHCC, Linea will begin onboarding its launch partners starting this week.\n\n\u201cLinea combines the power of zero-knowledge proofs with full Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) equivalence, allowing builders to create scalable decentralized applications (dapps) or migrate existing ones without the hassle of changing code or rewriting smart contracts.\u201d\n\nAs per ConsenSys\u2019s announcement, the alpha release provides faster throughput while lowering the transaction fees up to 15x lower than Ethereum layer-1. The firm also said that the release will allow deeper integrations with its crypto wallet MetaMask.\n\nLinea will be made available to users next week once partners have had an opportunity to onboard their dApps and infrastructure. The company also confirmed that the network uses Ether as its native currency, which is bridged directly from the Ethereum Mainnet. It urged users to remain cautious about fraudulent advertisements of an existing or imminent Linea token sale or drop.\n\nzkEVM Popularity\n\nA zkEVM is an EMV-compatible rollup that is secured by zero-knowledge proofs. By pooling in ZKPs with EVM compatibility, zkEVMs offer the security and privacy-preserving features of zk-Rollups while simultaneously enhancing Ethereum interoperability by protecting EVM compatibility. Such a system helps zkEVMs to be interoperable with smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) used on Ethereum.\n\nThe first zkEVM to be publicly available was zkSync\u2019s solution called \u2018zkSync Era,\u2019 which went live to much fanfare in March. Days later, Polygon announced the final mainnet for its zkEVM product and added subsequent optimizations a month later."

        "content": "EigenLayer, a protocol designed to allow staked Ether to secure additional applications outside of the Ethereum blockchain, is unquestionably on crypto investors\u2019 radars.\n\nEarlier today, the project raised the cap on liquid staking tokens (LSTs) users could deposit in the protocol from 9,600 to 30,000 staked ETH. After investors quickly piled in, EigenLayer bumped the limit up to 45,000 tokens less than an hour later.\n\nEigenLayer Attracts Over 30,000 ETH Just Minutes After Raising Deposit Caps\n\nDeposits of Lido\u2019s stETH and Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH, the two most widely held LSTs, are now full. Deposits of cbETH, issued by Coinbase, stand at just above 12,600 at the time of writing. In total, EigenLayer has roughly $75M worth of LSTs deposited in its smart contracts.\n\nEigenLayer Attracts Over 30,000 ETH Just Minutes After Raising Deposit Caps\n\nLSTs are yield-bearing tokens which represent ETH staked to secure the Ethereum blockchain and have fostered a burgeoning sector dubbed LSTfi.\n\nEigenLayer is one of the more recognizable projects in LSTfi, and the speed at which investors filled up its deposits demonstrates the demand for the project\u2019s restaking capabilities.\n\nEigenLayer is designed to allow other projects, like bridges or oracle networks, to rely on restaked ETH for security, rather than needing to bootstrap their own validator sets and native token economies. These projects would pay EigenLayer for its services, resulting in additional yield for restakers.\n\nEigenLayer Attracts Over 30,000 ETH Just Minutes After Raising Deposit Caps\n\nPotential Airdrop\n\nEigenLayer doesn\u2019t have a token yet, so some early users are undoubtedly hoping for a future airdrop.\n\nEigenLayer\u2019s rollout is planned in three phases, the first of which was completed with the launch of the restaking mainnet last month. Next up, which EigenLayer has said will happen later this year, is the mainnet for \u201cOperators\u201d who facilitate the usage of the restaking protocol. The final phase is \u201cactively validated services\u201d or AVS, which will be the projects reusing Ethereum\u2019s security to bootstrap their own ventures.\n\nEigenLayer has been the source of some controversy because of concerns that it may threaten the neutrality of Ethereum\u2019s consensus mechanism as more applications come to rely on LSTs.\n\nimg,[object Object]\n\nEigenLayer launched last month with an initial cap of 9,600 LSTs, which was filled in minutes."

        "title": "Introducing Starknet: The answer to Ethereum's scalability challenge? - OKX",
        "content": "Blockchain technology has revolutionized the way we conduct transactions and store data securely. However, one major challenge that blockchain faces is scalability. As the number of users and transactions on a blockchain network increases, the system becomes slower and more expensive. This scalability challenge has hindered the widespread adoption of blockchain technology in various industries.\n\nMeet Starknet \u2014 a cutting-edge solution that addresses blockchain's scalability challenge. Starknet is a permissionless decentralized validity rollup, also known as a zk-rollup, built on the Ethereum network.\n\nIt serves as a Layer 2 solution, allowing decentralized applications (DApps) to achieve unlimited scalability for their computations while maintaining the composability and security of the Ethereum ecosystem. Starknet leverages the power of STARK (Scalable Transparent Argument of Knowledge) technology, one of the safest and most scalable cryptographic proof systems available.\n\nBy using STARK, Starknet validates transactions and computations without requiring all network nodes to verify each operation. This significantly reduces the computational burden and increases the throughput of the blockchain network.\n\nWith Starknet, developers can build and deploy complex applications with high computational requirements on Ethereum without worrying about scalability limitations. The future looks promising as Starknet plays a crucial role in unlocking the full potential of decentralized applications and bringing blockchain to the mainstream.\n\nWhat is Starknet?\n\nStarknet is an advanced Layer 2 solution designed to scale Ethereum and alleviate network congestion. It achieves this through zk-STARKs, a zero-knowledge proof technology that enhances data security, privacy, and scalability. By implementing Starknet, developers can build and run high-performing smart contracts in a decentralized environment without worrying about expensive transaction fees or compromising the security of their applications.\n\nThe purpose of Starknet is to provide a platform for developing DApps that require high performance and low transaction costs. This makes it particularly suitable for sectors such as decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and gaming (GameFi).\n\nWith its flexibility and advanced features, developers can leverage the Cairo language and take advantage of Starknet's high throughput and customizability to build innovative and customized DApps.\n\nStarkWare, the team behind Starknet, is an Israel-based company focused on building Layer 2 blockchains for Ethereum. In addition to Starknet, StarkWare is also developing another product called StarkEx, geared towards enhancing scalability and efficiency for decentralized exchanges.\n\nThe Starknet ecosystem has experienced significant growth, with a notable increase in total value. This growth can be attributed to the advantages Starknet offers, the innovative projects being developed within the ecosystem, and the challenges it aims to address. As Starknet continues to evolve, it holds the potential to revolutionize the scalability and functionality of Ethereum, driving the adoption of blockchain technology across various industries.\n\nWhat's the technology behind Starknet?\n\nStarknet uses advanced technology called zk-STARKs to achieve scalability as a Layer 2 solution.\n\nSo, what are zk-STARKs? They're a cryptographic innovation developed by StarkWare, and they play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and privacy of computations on blockchains. Zk-STARKs allow blockchains to move complex computations off-chain to a single STARK prover, which generates cryptographic proofs. These proofs are then verified on-chain by a STARK verifier to guarantee the correctness of the computations.\n\nTo make zk-STARKs practical, StarkWare has combined modern algebra with battle-tested hash functions. The organization has made significant breakthroughs in areas like quasi-linear PCPs, interactive oracle proofs (IOPs), and fast algebraic coding protocols like FRI.\n\nThis has made their STARK prover and verifier the fastest in the class, outperforming other cryptographic constructions. Significantly, the tech relies on fewer and safer cryptographic assumptions and is secure against quantum attacks. It's also transparent, meaning it doesn't use risky cryptographic elements during setup and has no hidden vulnerabilities.\n\nStarknet offers a robust platform that enables efficient and cost-effective processing of smart contracts. It achieves this through a combination of different components, each playing a crucial role in the ecosystem.\n\nContract registry\n\nThe contract registry is a record keeper for all the smart contracts deployed on Starknet. It maintains a comprehensive list of these contracts, making accessing and interacting with them easy. It's like a directory that helps you find the suitable contract you want to work with.\n\nZK operator\n\nThe ZK operator is the master of ZK proofs. It generates these proofs for transactions and sends them to the execution manager. Additionally, it manages a special type of data structure called a Merkle tree, which is used to create these proofs. The ZK operator makes sure the proofs are generated accurately and can be trusted.\n\nExecution manager (EM)\n\nThink of the execution manager as the conductor of the Starknet orchestra. It manages the execution of smart contracts and handles transactions. Whenever a transaction occurs, the EM updates the network's state accordingly. It makes sure everything runs smoothly and in harmony.\n\nVerifier\n\nThe verifier is like a detective with a keen eye for authenticity. It validates the ZK (zero-knowledge) proofs created by users. These proofs are essential for preserving the accuracy and integrity of executed contracts. The verifier checks if the inputs to the proof satisfy the contract's conditions, making sure everything is legitimate.\n\nCairo programming language\n\nStarknet was built using the Cairo programming language. This language is optimized explicitly for zk-STARKs, a cryptographic proof system. Cairo empowers developers to write complex and secure smart contracts. It provides a framework that allows developers to test their contracts locally before deploying them to the Starknet network, guaranteeing reliability and efficiency.\n\nProof verifier factory\n\nThe proof verifier factory is like a factory that produces verifiers whenever needed. It's responsible for creating new verifiers and managing their lifecycle. It ensures the system has enough verifiers to handle the validation process efficiently.\n\nStorage\n\nStarknet has a storage layer where smart contracts are stored and data is retrieved. This storage layer is based on a Merkle tree, which is an efficient data structure. It allows for quick and easy access to contract-related information, making interactions with smart contracts faster and smoother.\n\nGateway\n\nThe gateway acts as a bridge between Ethereum and Starknet. It lets users deposit and withdraw funds from Starknet using the Ethereum network. This connection makes it convenient for users to move their assets between the two platforms and benefit from the advantages offered by Starknet.\n\nStarknet achieves scalability through zk-STARKs, a cutting-edge cryptographic technology. Zk-STARKs enable off-chain computations and on-chain verification, ensuring the integrity and privacy of computations on the blockchain. Starknet's underlying technologies, such as Cairo, the STARK prover, and STARK verifiers, have been battle-tested and proven their reliability and efficiency in real-world production environments.\n\nWhat's the relationship between Starknet and Ethereum?\n\nStarknet and Ethereum share a close relationship, with Starknet being a Layer 2 solution built on top of the Ethereum network. This integration brings multiple benefits to both Ethereum users and developers.\n\nEthereum's mainnet currently processes about 30 transactions per second (TPS), which can be limited during times of high congestion. Using the power of StarkWare's STARK-based Layer 2 solution, Starknet significantly enhances Ethereum's scalability. It can potentially reduce gas fees by a factor of 100 to 200, making transactions more affordable and accessible for users.\n\nAdditionally, with the implementation of rollups like Starknet, Ethereum's transaction throughput has the potential to reach 100,000 TPS, according to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin.\n\nFor developers, Starknet provides an efficient platform to build and deploy high-performance DApps. Developers can use Starknet's features, such as its reliance on zk-STARKs for cryptographic proof and its compatibility with the Cairo programming language.\n\nThis enables them to create complex and innovative DApps without compromising security or scalability. By leveraging Starknet, developers can overcome the limitations of Ethereum's mainnet, unlocking new possibilities for building DeFi protocols, NFT platforms, gaming applications, and more.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation and prominent investors in the crypto space support the integration of Starknet with Ethereum. This backing demonstrates the recognition of the potential impact of Layer 2 scaling solutions, including Starknet, on the Ethereum ecosystem. As Ethereum continues to evolve and expand, Layer 2 solutions like Starknet play a vital role in achieving the network's vision of scalability, high throughput, and reduced transaction costs.\n\nWhat's the impact of Starknet on crypto?\n\nThe potential impact of Starknet on the broader blockchain ecosystem is significant.

Smart contracts deployed on Starknet benefit from increased scalability and reduced gas fees, enabling the execution of more complex computations and interactions. This opens up possibilities for sophisticated financial instruments, decentralized exchanges, supply chain management systems, and other use cases that require high computational capabilities.\n\nDevelopers can build secure and scalable smart contracts without compromising on the security and composability of the underlying blockchain. What's more, Starknet's impact extends beyond Ethereum. As a Layer 2 solution, it has the potential to be adopted by other blockchains, improving their scalability and performance.\n\nThis interoperability can contribute to the overall growth and development of the blockchain ecosystem, as different networks can leverage Starknet's technology to enhance their capabilities.\n\nStarknet can be a game-changer for the blockchain ecosystem by addressing the scalability challenge and providing a platform for developing high-performance DApps and smart contracts. Its impact can be seen in improved user experience, reduced transaction costs, and expanded use cases across various industries.\n\nAs blockchain technology continues to evolve, solutions like Starknet play a crucial role in driving innovation, adoption, and the realization of the full potential of DApps.\n\nWhat's new with Starknet?\n\nThe Starknet Foundation is launching the Starknet Provisions Program \u2014 the first distribution of Starknet Tokens (STRK) to the community. Over 700 million STRK will be allocated to around 1.3 million addresses as part of the first round of distribution. The tokens are drawn from a dedicated pool of 900 million STRK for the Provisions program, which is part of a broader 1.8 billion STRK allocated for community distribution.\n\nThe token will be used for transaction fees, staking, and governance voting within the Starknet ecosystem. The distribution targets users of Starknet and StarkEx, contributors to the Ethereum protocol, and developers of selected open-source projects.\n\nFollowing the Provisions program, STRK holders will participate in governance and future staking mechanisms, influencing Starknet\u2019s evolution. The Starknet Foundation plans further STRK distributions for community initiatives, including special rebates and programs.\n\nThe Starknet Foundation emphasizes community interaction and vigilance against scams. The Provisions program is in line with Starknet's goal of promoting decentralization and engagement in the blockchain ecosystem. This contributes to the growth and governance of the network.\n\nThe final word\n\nStarknet is a Layer 2 solution built on Ethereum that addresses the scalability challenge of blockchain technology.

        "title": "From Ethereum to Consensys: Joseph Lubin's Visionary Journey - Entrepreneur",
        "content": "Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nYou're reading Entrepreneur Middle East, an international franchise of Entrepreneur Media.\n\nFrom robotics and artificial intelligence to the financial services industry, Joseph Lubin's multifaceted background paved the way for his transformation into a leading figure of the Web3 revolution.\n\nLubin, a founding member of Ethereum and founder of Consensys, has always possessed a forward-thinking mindset, which he applied early on in identifying systemic flaws in our global financial institutions. Today, he stands as a torchbearer guiding us into the era of Web3, decentralized systems, and beyond.\n\nOver a decade ago, Lubin observed unsettling patterns within our financial systems, including unprecedented levels of debt in the system that suggested a looming global crisis. As he delved into these concerns, he became aware of the Strauss and Howe generational theory. This theory describes 80-100 year cycles composed of four generations. It paints a picture of cycles of growth and expansion, which eventually meet their downfall due to societal developments that outgrow the once-novel visions. This pattern leads to a societal reset, calling for a fresh vision and a new system- a pattern that seems to echo our present reality.\n\nWhen Lubin encountered Bitcoin in 2011, he saw the dawn of this new era. Satoshi Nakamoto's revolutionary whitepaper introduced a technological innovation, a decentralized database that could fundamentally alter the foundations of trust and authority upon which our society is built. By ensuring that everyone sees the true history of transactions and making it virtually impossible to overturn this history, Bitcoin invented a new higher-powered form of trust: decentralized trust. It shifted the societal trust paradigm from top-down \u2013with authorities working through intermediaries to control all aspects of society\u2013 to bottom-up, where everyone can inspect what happened and when with respect to transactions in the economy, and the only intermediary required is the open global decentralized database.\n\nA few years later, Lubin found himself at the forefront of the Ethereum project. Its whitepaper, penned by Vitalik Buterin, promised a platform where any software developer could contribute to the new economy, removing the need for esoteric specialists. Recognizing this potential, Lubin devoted himself to nurturing Ethereum \u2013the first decentralized blockchain that allowed for smart contracts\u2013 and its ecosystem. This then gave way to the birthing of Consensys, a hub for fostering faster adoption of Ethereum, by incubating projects and exploring the vast potential of the ecosystem.\n\nToday, the fruits of Lubin's work are apparent across diverse corners of the globe. In countries like Zimbabwe, Venezuela, and Argentina, where the monetary systems have been unstable for decades, blockchain technologies offer essential solutions such as value preservation and remittances. However, in Western liberal democracies, the implications run deeper, creating novel ways of looking at industries and offering them the means to evolve rather than just disrupt.\n\nConsider the entertainment industry, where artists can directly connect with their fans through non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized organizations. Here, Web3 technologies promise a future where the majority of the value created isn't pocketed by industry intermediaries, but by the creators themselves. Similar opportunities are unfolding in the advertising sector, as the traditional web cookie used to track and exploit browsers are slowly being \"decommissioned\" by regulators, companies, and users who value privacy, and will be replaced by NFTs and decentralized identities, putting the control back in users' hands.\n\nAccording to Lubin, Web3 brings major foundational gamechangers such as decentralized finance (DeFi). Although DeFis currently the playground of crypto and finance enthusiasts, Lubin envisions a future where the entire finance world is stampeding into this space once regulatory hurdles are overcome. In decentralized finance, the potential for instantaneous, programmable, and high liquidity systems promises unprecedented opportunities. Eventually, much of global finance will be built using decentralized finance technology simply because DeFi will bring much-needed improvements like increased transparency around the formation and enforcement of the rules under which systems operate, and the virtual elimination of counterparty risk when one's counterparty is a smart contract or a protocol rather than a person or company. These are just two of many directions that the world of finance can explore as it begins to understand the profound benefits of this paradigm-shifting disruptive technology.\n\nIn today's rapidly evolving and increasingly dangerous world, a profound existential choice faces humanity. On one hand, we could journey down a path of tyrannical control, where governments manipulate everything, endeavoring to prevent the misuse of cheap and exponentially destructive technology. This path, successful or not, is rife with pitfalls. The other way, a far more hopeful path, embraces progressive decentralization as its organizing principle. Here, we can envision a future based on decentralized organizations and protocols, where transparency is a given, and negative externalities are identified and incorporated into a more holistic system so they can be properly accounted for and ameliorated.\n\nSource: Lucidity Insights\n\nIn natural ecosystems, every waste product serves as the feedstock for some other organism or system. This is how we must design the systems we build and steward going forward, whether they be agricultural, water management, social media/advertising or AI. This vision for the future requires rapid dissemination and robust action to create the next system of the world, and education plays a central role, believes Lubin. Initiatives like Consensys Academy and MetaMask Learn are at the forefront of this movement, striving to mentor the next generation and provide compelling, extensible tutorials. \"We're starting to view our software developers and end-users as two Web 2.0 vintage bookends bounding a growing population of Web3 builders,\" Lubin said, explaining the increasing democratization of technology-enabled participation.\n\nIn this Web3 world, individuals have much more control and influence over the systems that guide their lives because they will be first-class members of those communities, not just customers, and no longer the product of the service provider. Here, the power that currently resides solely with corporations like Meta platforms (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp), TikTok, or Twitter, becomes decentralized, providing end-users and developers more agency, and enabling them to become active builders of, and participants in, communities and ecosystems that affect and improve their lives. The Web3 builder class will eventually grow to encompass the entire global population, as Web3 tools enable direct participation in online communities. As we all rise to the calling to be more active in the systems and communities on which our lives and quality of life depend, we will soon be able to call on our personal artificial intelligence (AI) allies who enable all of us to level up fast, understand any issue that affects us, and participate in the governance and decision-making that tangibly improves our lives.\n\nProperly decentralizing social networks doesn't mean you add NFTs to them or add decentralized asset organization (DAO)-based decentralized governance, or cut moderators in on the profits they generate as a labor of love. These are significant steps towards a decentralized model. In this setup, rather than being reliant on a handful of social network accounts that are controlled and can be revoked by Web 2.0 companies, everyone will establish their own decentralized IDs. These IDs will be used alongside verifiable credentials, in line with World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) standards, as well as NFTs and badges. Collectively, these elements will form the backbone for building and maintaining the identity and reputation of individuals, intelligent entities, organizations, and even things.\n\nThe next generation of social networking will put the user at the center of and in control of their social graph. They will construct and maintain multiple social graphs for different purposes. They will own their identities, and publish their own profiles tailored to different contexts. They will subscribe to other entities' social graphs, and publish content to their own graphs, inviting people to subscribe to them if they are interested. They will own her graphs and select tools from different providers to operate on the content of her graphs, or on the graph structures themselves- perhaps to increase readership or monetization or political influence. They may link their graphs with other graphs in order to share certain content if the owners of those graphs choose to work together to share the relevant content with their subscriber base. They will be in control of their identities and social graphs and there will be many social network tool companies that add value to their feeds while the user remains fully in control.\n\nOur social graphs in the Web3 era will be a profound extension and expression of our identities, interests, and, ultimately, our reputations. They will be a fundamental construct representing who we are. In the Web3 era, we will be the owners and controllers of the core elements of our lives, not manipulated and addicted users, not just consumers and not exploited products of Web 2.0 and traditional economy megacorps that have become producers of as many negative externalities as valuable products and services. The Web 2.0 era served us well and evolved us as a species in important ways. But we desperately need the community-focused and user-centric ethos of Web3 to heal deep schisms and establish healthier collective paths forward. Or Web3 children will look back on the constructs of Web 2.0 society in disbelief and horror that we all outsourced many core aspects of our identities and reputations to soulless, profit-maximizing companies that nearly broke the world.\n\nAligned with this vision, Consensys unveils its evolved brand, aiming to \"inspire and empower the builder within each of us.\" A call to action that encourages individuals to embrace their role in constructing a more decentralized future.

        "title": "Monthly: Themes for Second Half 2023 - Coinbase",
        "content": "The second half of the year promises to be no less eventful, as the regulatory overhang remains a challenge. But there\u2019s also no shortage of endogenous narratives that should drive this asset class as well. Among these, layer-2s remain an important theme in 2H23, although we expect the market to turn its focus to how value accrues to these scaling solutions. Rollups will also be affected by the Cancun (Dencun) Fork, the next major milestone on Ethereum\u2019s upgrade roadmap. Re-staking may also promise to disrupt the industry. Meanwhile, once the Mt.Gox bitcoin disbursements are complete, we expect more attention on the bitcoin halving in 2024.\n\nWhen the rally was interrupted by a US dollar recovery in mid 1Q23, the US regional banking turmoil positioned bitcoin in particular as an alternative to the failures of the traditional financial system. But then regulatory headlines began to derail performance and some market makers pulled liquidity just as global spigots were tightening . Enter the institutions\u2013 relief at the end of 2Q23 came from positive news associated with BlackRock, Fidelity, Charles Schwab and other Wall Street giants announcing new initiatives in the space.\n\nWe believe there were several reasons why crypto markets surprised expectations to the upside in the first half of 2023. Developments in this space at the end of last year left market pundits with almost uniformly negative predictions, while outlooks on the macro environment didn\u2019t appear much rosier. This enabled a short covering rally that was sustained by supportive supply dynamics . That is, demand picked up just when many assets were being locked up in the custody of different government authorities or self-hosted wallets.\n\nSome have argued that even if these ETF proposals are approved in the US, it may not be as transformational for crypto markets as their advocates may think. The argument is that these products already exist in Europe and Canada but haven\u2019t gained significant traction in the years they\u2019ve been around. We think that view is short-sighted, as it focuses on the potential retail demand for these products. In fact, the ETF market in the US is the largest and most developed globally because asset managers and financial advisors tend to use ETFs in portfolios as a means of gaining exposure to a variety of asset classes. Having an available bitcoin spot ETF in the US may facilitate allocations that ultimately translate into significant effects on demand. We may also see institutional investors potentially using an approved bitcoin spot ETF as the underlying for new derivative instruments that could also expand trading volumes.\n\nNote that the timeline for the US SEC\u2019s decision making process has recently been reset due to refilings. For example, the application for BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust was recently refiled on July 3 which means that it may only enter the Federal Register for public commentary on July 17. A final decision could take as much as 240 days (putting a potential deadline sometime in mid-March 2024). See table below.\n\nDevelopments included the launch of a new crypto exchange by a consortium of major financial players \u2013 Fidelity, Charles Schwab and Citadel - mainly targeting Wall Street participants. Separately, asset-management giant BlackRock filed to launch a spot BTC ETF partnering with Nasdaq. Fidelity, WisdomTree, VanEck, ARK Invest and Galaxy/Invesco followed suit, partnering with Cboe. Incidentally, Coinbase supports issuers in a few ways, including as custodian for the underlying BTC. Separately, the Nasdaq and Cboe have also named Coinbase as their surveillance sharing partner in their 19b-4 filings.\n\nThe first half of 2023 ended with a potential game changer for the crypto industry as some of the world\u2019s biggest financial firms announced major initiatives in this space. In the wake of these announcements, BTC rallied above US$30,000 for the first time since April.\n\nThe second half\n\nMt. Gox repayments\n\nLooking ahead, we see several crypto specific themes in 2H23 that could be relevant for markets. One of the most well telegraphed sources of pressure in the months ahead may be the 141,686 BTC that\u2019s due to be distributed to creditors as part of the Mt. Gox rehabilitation plan.\n\nBase, intermediate and early lump sum disbursements are supposed to be paid by October 31 (though the deadline may still be extended). But bitcoin selling could take place before then to raise the cash needed for settlements. The general framework is that the first JPY200k (~US$1440) of each creditor\u2019s claim will be paid in cash followed by a mix of around 70%/30% token vs cash for the remaining balance \u2013 unless a creditor has explicitly requested a different split (e.g. 100% bitcoin or 100% cash). Incidentally, the two largest creditors representing around 20% of all Mt. Gox claims have also elected to be paid in mostly bitcoin.\n\nNote that we do not know the current number of available creditors as an unspecified number have sold their claims to third parties, but as of end-March 2023, there were 42,394 permitted creditors according to the rehabilitation trust. But in 2019, CoinTelegraph indicated there were 24,000 creditors affected by the Mt. Gox hack, and more recently, they reported 10,000 creditors. Taken together, we estimate the potential upper limit of forced bitcoin selling could be around 35k BTC. Currently, the Mt. Gox trustee is sitting on 137,891 BTC, a balance that has remained constant since May 2018.\n\nBitcoin halving\n\nFollowing Mt. Gox, the next most important bitcoin-related event will likely be the \u201crewards halving\u201d in April or May 2024, which we covered in our last monthly report . In our view, the halving will likely have a material impact on the market, though that\u2019s based less on the historical evidence and more on (1) our macro view and (2) how crypto markets have grown since previous halving events. That is, there is sidelined capital and a much bigger market today than there was 3 years ago. That could make a big difference, particularly if central banks start to cut rates in 4Q23 or early 1Q24. In other words, we don\u2019t think it will be the halving alone that will drive stronger bitcoin performance, but more likely a confluence of factors.\n\nChart 2. Rolling regression of global liquidity, US 2y rates and DXY vs bitcoin\n\nEthereum upgrade and blobs\n\nOn Ethereum, the upcoming Cancun (Dencun) Fork promises to support scaling on the network via layer-2 (L2) rollups, potentially increasing throughput and making transactions cheaper. Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844 ( proto-danksharding ) is at the core of this upgrade, which will increase data availability for rollups by creating a new data type called \u201cblobs\u201d (binary large objects).\n\nWhy this is significant is that this change will create new temporary space on blocks dedicated solely to the data that rollups submit to the main Ethereum network. That is, at the moment, rollups reduce transaction fees for users by batching multiple transactions into one transaction that gets stored on-chain indefinitely. With EIP-4844, that data will instead be stored as a blob transaction on the consensus layer for only three weeks, during which time the data can be verified. (It\u2019s cheaper if the data doesn\u2019t sit on the network forever.) The initial limit will be up to four blobs per block. The takeaway is that this will lower the floor for transaction fees on rollups and possibly allow rollup operators to post more data per transaction.\n\nNotably, proto-danksharding is only the prerequisite for full danksharding, which is expected to come later and incorporate data availability sampling, so that the verification of blob data will not require a full download each time. We think a more realistic release date for the Cancun Fork is in 1Q24 rather than 4Q23.\n\nAccount abstraction\n\nMore importantly is what comes next. In our view, this upgrade lays the foundation for account abstraction, which could lead to broader web3 adoption by making the experience more user-friendly. To oversimplify, account abstraction is the means by which the details of user accounts are hidden from the Ethereum protocol by allowing accounts to function like smart contracts. One net benefit of this is that it could allow decentralized applications (dapps) to pay for users\u2019 gas fees or possibly use other non-ETH tokens to pay for gas. When the transaction fees are low enough, we think more dapps may pursue this path, effectively changing the user experience on blockchains and allowing users to focus only on high-level interactions.\n\nL2s and decentralized sequencers\n\nMeanwhile, we think the conversation about L2s themselves will change in 2H23. In the first half of the year, market players were mainly focused on which protocols were dominating market share (as well as speculating over token airdrops to a lesser extent). We think their attention will now turn to figuring out how value will accrue to these scaling solutions and their associated tokens.\n\nChart 3. Monthly L2 gas usage remained high in 2Q23\n\nCurrently, fees on rollups mainly accrue to the sequencers that take transactions in the mempool and order them before submitting them to Ethereum. But most rollups rely on a single, centralized sequencer. An alternative would be to replace this with a network of nodes to order and validate those transactions, such that staking could be employed for validators to earn rewards.\n\nThe idea of shared sequencers also seems to be gaining more traction, whereby independent decentralized networks of sequencers could compete and be utilized by any rollup. Such a proposal could also introduce benefits like cross margining across rollups and minimizing liquidity fragmentation, though at the risk of distorting incentives.\n\nSecurity-as-a-service\n\nTraditionally, we have characterized the business model for layer-1 networks as blockspace-as-a-service. But in our 2023 Crypto Market Outlook , we alluded to the growth of middleware solutions that could introduce a new revenue stream for ETH validators in the form of \u201csecurity-as-a-service.\u201d Effectively, the concept of \u201cre-staking\u201d by EigenLayer is a way for validators to secure new features in Ethereum \u2013 like data availability networks, rollups, bridges, oracles, etc \u2013 or even secure other networks, possibly earning additional rewards in the process. EigenLayer recently launched on Ethereum mainnet in mid-June (phase 1) but has not yet started to support actively validated services.\n\nWhile re-staking allows validators to diversify their revenue sources, providing such security services comes with risk. For example, validators can be slashed by the EigenLayer network for possibly all of their 32 ETH deposits depending on the conditions imposed by a given actively validated service. In the normal course of processing Ethereum transactions, validators are rarely slashed their entire ETH stake. Moreover, the size of the potential earnings is still unknown as it is market-price driven and will depend on the level of demand for these services."

        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nConsenSys has announced the launch of its layer-2 network Linea, as the Ethereum ecosystem welcomed yet another scaling solution.\n\nLinea incorporates zero-knowledge cryptography and has produced considerable scaling milestones during testing, achieving faster throughput and significantly lower transaction costs compared to the main Ethereum network.\n\nA New Scaling Solution\n\nLinea is ConsenSys\u2019s new layer-2 scaling solution that enables developers to build or migrate decentralized applications (dApps) for Ethereum. The layer-2 network utilizes zero-knowledge proofs and is EVM-compliant, meaning applications on the network can seamlessly interact with the Ethereum blockchain. Zero-knowledge (zk) cryptography helps facilitate greater scalability and improved transaction speeds, thus helping address network congestion and high gas fees on Ethereum. The rollup network implemented by Linea is commonly known as zkEVM, thanks to its compliance with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\n\nA Highly Successful Testing Phase\n\nThe Linea zkEVM has been launched after a lengthy and highly successful testing phase after it was revealed that the ConsenSys team had been working on the rollup for the past four years. The testing phase began when ConsenSys released a public testnet on the 28th of March, enabling the stress-testing of the new layer-2 technology. The testnet phase saw around 5.5 million unique wallets conduct 46 million transactions. ConsenSys noted several improvements when it came to Linea\u2019s performance, transaction costs, and user experience throughout its testing phase.\n\nConsenSys has claimed that the fees on the network will be 15 times lower than those prevailing on the Ethereum main network. The alpha phase began on the 11th of July, with over 100 partners involved. Joseph Lubin, the founder and CEO of ConsenSys, talked about the number of layer-2 Ethereum scaling solutions and protocols and highlighted their importance when it came to driving the development of Web3 functionality and applications.\n\n\u201cWith the Merge to Proof of Stake and the broad traction of the rollup-centric roadmap, Ethereum L2s are set to play a crucial role in making great advances in scalability and usability.\u201d\n\nThe announcement also highlights several decentralized finance (DeFi) applications migrating to Linea to take advantage of its fast finality, security from the Ethereum mainnet, and capital-efficient bridge. The network also offers users low gas fees, high throughput, and low latency, all of which are critical to power blockchain gaming, non-fungible tokens, and social applications. App developers can deploy their projects and applications on Linea\u2019s \u201cAlpha\u201d network as early as Friday. However, general users will have to wait until next week to access the network.\n\nThe launch of the Alpha mainnet will use several safeguards to protect decentralized applications, users, and the network itself. Measures include allowing only launch partners to execute calls over the network for the first week. ConsenSys plans to further open up the network during ETHCC, which is scheduled to take place in France from the 17th of July. It also plans to hold a bug bounty and monitor performance before opening up the network to end users.\n\nConsenSys also announced the launch of its Linea Ecosystem Investment Alliance (EIA). The alliance will see over 30 venture capitalist firms give advisory assistance and lend capital to ecosystem builders. Ethereum layer-2 solutions have become a major talking point in 2023, with Polygon also taking its zkEVM network public in March. Starknet has also highlighted plans to increase the throughput on its network this year. Starknet founder Eli Ben-Sasson is the pioneer behind zk-proofs.\n\nKey Features\n\nLinea has seen the introduction of several features and upgrades with its alpha mainnet phase. These include a dynamic fee mechanism and a new outer-proof system. The alpha mainnet phase also introduces a feature called \u201cbatch conflation.\u201d This feature optimizes the number of layer-2 transactions and blocks that can fit into a layer-1 batch. This allows it to reduce fixed costs typically associated with layer-1 and help provide a cost-effective transaction experience. These upgrades will help Linea offer transaction costs that are far lower than Ethereum\u2019s main layer.\n\nAdditionally, MetaMask will also offer support for Linea soon, allowing users to access the network through the MetaMask Portfolio and Bridge, Swap, and Buy features. The MetaMask integration can be expected in the next few weeks and allow wallet users to interact with decentralized applications and protocols based on Linea.\n\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Layer 2 refers to a secondary framework built on the main blockchain that addresses scalability issues by processing transactions off-chain while maintaining the underlying blockchain's security and decentralization benefits.\n\nWhile layer 2 solutions come in various forms, they generally involve aggregating multiple transactions into a single transaction on the main blockchain. This helps reduce the overall load on the main chain and increases transaction throughput, resulting in faster and cheaper transactions.\n\nOne unique layer 2 solution is zkSync, which uses zero-knowledge proofs (zk-proofs) for enhanced scalability and privacy. zkSync allows for secure, trustless, and low-cost transactions by bundling multiple transactions and submitting them as proof on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nBy leveraging zk-proofs, zkSync validates all transactions and keeps information private, while also significantly reducing the computational requirements and costs associated with on-chain transactions.\n\nIn February 2023, Matter Labs, the brains behind zkSync, rebranded, renaming zkSync 2.0 to zkSync Era and zkSync 1.0 to zkSync Lite. This strategic move aimed to more closely align their products. On the same day, zkSync announced the start of onboarding for registered projects onto the zkSync Era mainnet. The onboarding set the stage for the full mainnet launch. As expected, zkSync Era became available to all users on March 24, 2023, marking the first of many impactful launches related to zkEVM.\n\nOKX Wallet recently launched Cryptopedia, a unique Web3 project experience and learn-to-earn platform. We're working with several projects and partners to create learning quest sections that educate the community and give you the chance to earn exciting rewards.\n\nOur first themed event is based around zkSync Era. After you complete the quests around the zkSync Era, you can participate in an NFT lottery for every completed DApp interaction quest. Take your best shot, and have fun!\n\nzkSync Era: A tech revolution for Ethereum?\n\nAt its core, zkSync is a ZK rollup. What does that mean exactly? ZkSync is a trustless protocol that leverages cryptographic validity proofs to provide fast and cost-effective transactions on Ethereum. By moving most of the computation and data off-chain, zkSync achieves scalability without compromising security.\n\nOne of the most exciting aspects of zkSync is that it provides the same security level as Ethereum. How? All transactions on zkSync are proven on the Ethereum mainchain, meaning you can trust the system just as you'd trust Ethereum.\n\nBut zkSync isn't just about security and scalability. It's also designed to provide a familiar and seamless experience. With zkSync Era, the user interface is designed to resemble Ethereum, so you'll feel right at home.\n\nPlus, you can write and interact with smart contracts using Solidity or Vyper, just like you would on Ethereum. The best part? With zkSync Era, you can use the same clients compatible with other Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains, making it even more accessible.\n\nOther highlights of zkSync Era include:\n\nUnparalleled security: Experience the same level of security as the Ethereum mainnet without depending on any third parties. Rest assured that your transactions and assets are safeguarded with utmost trust and reliability.\n\nEmpowering smart contracts: Enjoy the freedom of permissionless EVM-compatible smart contracts on zkSync Era. Unleash your creativity and bring innovative ideas to life on this powerful platform.\n\nSeamless integration: Connect effortlessly to the broader blockchain ecosystem with zkSync Era's standard Web3 API. Interact with zkSync using the familiar tools and libraries you already know, simplifying integration.\n\nPreserving Ethereum's essence: Embrace zkSync Era while retaining the key features that made Ethereum successful. Smart contract composability remains intact, allowing you to combine and integrate contracts seamlessly.\n\nAccount abstraction: zkSync Era's groundbreaking account abstraction feature represents a major advancement in decentralized finance. The innovation opens up new possibilities, allowing you to manage and use your funds uniquely.\n\nZero-knowledge rollups enhancing Ethereum's ecosystem\n\nZero-knowledge rollups are a way to make Ethereum faster and cheaper by improving its scalability and transaction speed. Blockchains like Ethereum can be slow and expensive to use because every transaction needs to be verified by thousands of nodes in the network. However, layer 2 systems, specifically rollups, solve this problem.\n\nZero-knowledge rollups reduce Ethereum's workload by verifying transactions with minimal data. Instead of burdening the network with individual transactions, rollups bundle hundreds of transactions together as a single transaction. This bundled transaction is verified and added to Ethereum's public ledger, keeping the main network uncongested.\n\nThe reduced workload on Ethereum makes it faster and cheaper to use. When the network is not congested, the fees for transactions, known as gas fees, decrease significantly. This is important because, during high network traffic, such as during a bull cycle, Ethereum fees tend to rise.\n\nBy offloading transactions to layer 2 rollups, the Ethereum network remains less congested and more affordable for users.\n\nZero-knowledge rollups adopt a technique called zero-knowledge proof to accomplish their task. Zero-knowledge proof verifies the authenticity of the bundled transactions on a layer 2 network, such as ZK-Sync, by providing proof of validity.\n\nThis proof acts as a receipt, confirming transactions are genuine and can be added to Ethereum. Using minimal data in zero-knowledge cryptography ensures privacy and faster, less expensive transactions.\n\nZK-rollups rely on two smart contracts: the main and verifier contracts. These contracts operate on Ethereum and connect the layer 1 and layer 2 networks. The main contract stores the bundled transactions and determines the state of users' withdrawals and deposits. The verifier contract authenticates the transactions using zero-knowledge proof.\n\nThe actual execution of ZK-rollups occurs off-chain through a virtual machine specifically designed for rollups. This offloading process ensures that Ethereum's main network remains uncongested. The ZK virtual machine functions similarly to the EVM and runs the smart contracts that process the transactions.\n\nDespite executing off-chain, ZK-rollups still rely on Ethereum itself. After batching the transactions off-chain, ZK-rollups submit the transaction as a validity proof back to the layer 1 network, making sure Ethereum confirms the correctness of the updates.\n\nzkSync Era transaction speed\n\nAre you frustrated with slow Ethereum transactions and high fees? zkSync Era is here to help by taking scalability to a whole new level. While Ethereum can currently handle around 13 transactions per second (TPS), zkSync Era boasts an impressive peak load capacity of up to 2,000 TPS.\n\nSo, how does zkSync Era achieve this? By validating multiple transactions as a single transaction on the Ethereum network, it streamlines the process and reduces congestion. This means faster and more cost-effective transactions for you.\n\nzkSync: A path towards decentralized scalability?\n\nzkSync Era aims to achieve hyper-scalability while preserving the core values of Ethereum, including decentralization and trustlessness. It does this using zero-knowledge cryptography.\n\nOne of the key goals of the zkSync Era is to make decentralized applications (DApps) more accessible and affordable, regardless of the scale. By using hyper-bridges, assets can be transferred from one hyperchain to another at the cost of a normal transfer.\n\nLike hyperlinks taking you from one web page to another with a single click, hyperbridges streamline asset transfers across different hyperchains without needing separate transactions on each layer. This asynchronous communication ensures trustless and eventual delivery of assets and messages between hyperchains.\n\nHyperchains are instances of zkEVM running in parallel and settling on the Ethereum mainnet (layer 1). They can be developed and deployed by anyone, providing permissionless innovation.\n\nHowever, to maintain trust and interoperability, each hyperchain must be powered by the same zkEVM engine as the main zkSync layer 2 instance. This means all ZKP (Zero-Knowledge Proof) circuits remain identical, inheriting the same security as Ethereum's layer 1.\n\nThe modular approach allows developers to customize their hyperchains, except for the zkEVM core, which guarantees consistency and avoids additional trust assumptions.\n\nThrough the zkSync Era, Ethereum's scalability is enhanced while staying true to its core values. The protocol expands Ethereum's security and values, such as trustlessness, permissionless access, censorship resistance, resiliency through decentralization, and community ownership.\n\nBy employing zero-knowledge cryptography, zkSync Era aims to increase personal sovereignty and drive mass adoption of cryptocurrencies.\n\nSpotlight on zkSync Era projects: SyncSwap and Mute.io\n\nThere are two zkSync Era projects to highlight, but it's essential to do your own research before participating.\n\nSyncSwap\n\nSyncSwap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that operates on the zkSync Era, using zero-knowledge technology for enhanced security. It aims to provide a wider audience with easy-to-use, cost-effective decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions.\n\nThe vision for SyncSwap is to create a user-friendly DeFi hub that offers advanced features and accessibility, even to those unfamiliar with Ethereum and blockchain technology. It aims to achieve this on the scaled Ethereum network.\n\nAt its core, the SyncSwap protocol serves as an exchange layer and liquidity solution for the zkSync Era network. It is an open-source and composable protocol, enabling seamless integration with the zkSync ecosystem.\n\nSyncSwap aligns with zkSync's mission of accelerating the mass adoption of cryptocurrencies and personal sovereignty. It is a community-driven project designed with user-friendly features in mind. The objective is to bring the benefits of scaled Ethereum, zero-knowledge technology, and Web3 to more people, fostering the mass adoption of decentralized finance.\n\nOne of the notable features of SyncSwap is its dynamic fee structure. Trading fees on the SyncSwap DEX can be adjusted flexibly based on market conditions or the community's preferences. There are four key facets to the fee system:\n\nVariable fees: This feature allows fees to be customized separately for different pool models and specific liquidity pools. Each pool model has a default fee, and liquidity pools inherit the default fee unless explicitly set otherwise. Variable fees apply to both trading fees and protocol fees.\n\nDirectional fees: SyncSwap enables liquidity pools to have different trading fee tiers for buying and selling tokens. For example, a liquidity pool for XXX/USD may have a lower fee for buying XXX but a higher fee for selling XXX. This flexibility can be determined based on community and token issuer preferences.\n\nFee discount: Similar to centralized exchanges (CEXs), SyncSwap supports fee discounts. Token stakers can receive fee discounts based on different tiers. The more tokens staked, the higher the discount ratio.\n\nFee delegate: This innovative feature allows the trading fees of specific pools to be delegated to partner ecosystem projects democratically. External sources, such as other ecosystem projects, can control a specific pools' fees by delegating the decision-making power for trading fees.\n\nSyncSwap adopts an Auto Market Maker (AMM) as the core mechanism for pool models and liquidity pools. Instead of relying on Oracle prices, AMMs determine prices algorithmically.\n\nCurrently, SyncSwap offers two types of pools:\n\nClassic pool: This pool is designed for general-purpose trading and employs the constant product algorithm (x * y = k), also known as x*y=k. The Classic Pool can support a wide range of assets and maintains a balanced reserve of 50% for each token. However, it is not optimized for stable assets.\n\nStable pool: The Stable Pool is optimized explicitly for trading stablecoins like USDC/USDT. It uses a hybrid algorithm combining the constant product and constant sum concepts. When the price is pegged around 1:1, the pool functions as a constant sum AMM for highly efficient trading (x + y = k). When the price deviates from the peg, it reverts to the constant product AMM (x * y = k). This pool model is ideal for assets tightly pegged around a 1:1 ratio.\n\nAdditionally, SyncSwap plans to introduce a Concentrated Pool, which dynamically adjusts prices instead of maintaining a fixed 1:1 ratio. This pool will concentrate liquidity around the market price, providing a tighter spread and improved efficiency.\n\nMute.io\n\nMute.io is a DeFi platform that serves as a liquidity hub for protocols built on zkSync, a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. Its main product, Mute Switch, is a DEX incorporating AMM with limit orders, a farming platform, and a Bond platform. Mute.io aims to provide liquidity solutions for protocols on zkSync, allowing them to incentivize liquidity for their specific use cases.\n\nThe team behind Mute.io has extensive experience with zero-knowledge protocols in the crypto space. They've previously developed the first Zero-Knowledge Atomic Swap protocol between Bitcoin and UTXO-based chains and innovative work on Zerocoin and Sigma addressing schemes and transactions.\n\nWith their expertise, the team is focused on building Mute.io and their Mute DAO initiative to become a leading player in the zkDeFi (zero-knowledge decentralized finance) space. They leverage zkSync's technology to drive long-term value for the Mute community.\n\nThe Mute Switch, Mute.io's flagship DApp, is a DeFi platform built on zkRollup technology, specifically zkSync v2. It offers various features such as investing, trading, earning yields, and participating in bonds. The platform allows users to capitalize on the security of Ethereum without high gas fees, thanks to the scalability provided by zkRollup.\n\nOne of the key components of Mute Switch is its liquidity pools. The platform is designed to have dynamic setups for liquidity pools, accommodating both stable and normal AMM curves. Stable pools are meant for assets that should be traded within a tight price range, while normal pools are suitable for non-correlated and volatile assets.\n\nThe Mute Switch automatically finds the best-priced trades regardless of the pool type. Each pool operates independently, and fees for each pool are separate from others.\n\nStable pools are optimized for high volume trades with capital-efficient swaps. The trade price in stable pools maintains a tight spread once the pricing is set upon pool creation. On the other hand, normal pools apply a generic AMM formula and are suitable for most trading pairs.\n\nMute Switch also allows for the creation of pools with different liquidity provider (LP) fees, ranging from 0.01% to 10% for normal pools and 2% for stable pools. These fees can only be changed through the LP governance system, which requires an LP provider (or a delegated provider) with over 50% vote weight to make the change.\n\nTo prevent manipulation, there is a 0.1% fee on total votes when changing pool fees, discouraging flash loans from altering fee structures without losses.\n\nGovernance plays a vital role in the Mute Switch ecosystem. The platform features a built-in LP governance and delegation system, enabling complex protocols to be built on top of it. LP providers can set the fee for their pools upon creation, and the LP governance system allows for fee changes based on votes tied to LP token supply balances.\n\nLP providers can also delegate their votes to other providers, allowing for increased pool weight and lobbying for delegates. This design concentrates liquidity within one pool and enables dynamic fee adjustments through governance.\n\nThe Mute Switch has two types of fees: dynamic fees (a percentage of LP pool fees) and fixed fees (a fixed percentage of the overall trade). If the protocol's fixed fee is set and is larger than the LP pool fees, LP providers will not earn fees for trades. The fixed fees are primarily used during the early stages until the LP total value locked (TVL) grows to a sustainable level.\n\nThe final word\n\nThe zkSync Era ecosystem shows promises of bringing improvements to the Ethereum network. As a ZK rollup, zkSync uses cryptographic validity proofs to achieve fast and cost-effective transactions on Ethereum while maintaining trustlessness and security.\n\nOne of the remarkable aspects of zkSync is its ability to provide the same level of security as Ethereum. All transactions on zkSync are proven on the Ethereum mainchain, providing high trust and reliability.\n\nAlongside security and scalability, zkSync Era delivers a familiar and simple user experience. Its user interface resembles Ethereum, making it easy for users to transition and feel at home.\n\nMoreover, developers can write and interact with smart contracts using Solidity or Vyper, just as they would on Ethereum. Compatibility with existing EVM clients further enhances accessibility.\n\nSome notable highlights of zkSync Era include unparalleled security, empowering smart contracts, seamless integration with the broader blockchain ecosystem, preservation of Ethereum's key features, and the introduction of groundbreaking account abstraction.\n\nWith zkSync Era, users can experience a secure and reliable platform for executing transactions and managing their assets, while developers can leverage its capabilities to build innovative and permissionless applications.\n\nNow you have a deeper understanding of zkSync Era, why not try out our learn-to-earn Cryptopedia platform? By flexing your brain, you'll have a chance to earn some exciting rewards.\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nTHIS ARTICLE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.

        "content": "After enduring a turbulent year in 2022, investor sentiment toward cryptocurrencies has taken a positive turn in 2023. With improving economic circumstances, crypto assets are once again attracting investor interest and optimism.\n\nThis trend has been particularly evident in more recent weeks after a series of applications for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) raised hopes that the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency could finally witness mainstream acceptance among institutional investors.\n\nIn line with this, crypto investors have been shifting their holdings from stablecoins into Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), suggesting that market participants are growing hungrier for riskier assets such as cryptocurrencies, crypto expert Ali Martinez noted on July 12.\n\n\u201cCrypto investors are shifting from stablecoins into Bitcoin and Ethereum. A decrease in stablecoin holdings points to a higher risk appetite among investors as they move their capital to BTC and ETH.\u201d \u2013 Martinez said in a tweet.\n\nStablecoin holdings shifting into BTC and ETH. Source: Ali Martinez\n\nIncreased interest and holdings in Bitcoin and Ethereum are likely to have a noteworthy impact on their respective prices highlighted by the aggravated market realized value net position change. As more investors enter the market and acquire these cryptocurrencies, the demand for them will rise, potentially driving up their prices.\n\nAt the same time, Bitcoin fund holdings have also increased significantly recently, particularly after BlackRock applied for a spot BTC ETF in mid-June. Specifically, the number of BTC held by funds jumped to almost 850,000 \u2013 the highest level in 6 months.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nAt the time of writing, the price of Bitcoin was standing at $30,680, up around 0.95% in the past 24 hours.\n\nThe largest cryptocurrency gained more than 18% over the past month amid institutional crypto hype, adding almost $100 billion in market cap over that period.\n\nBTC 1-month price chart.

However, we do not have any trade confirmation yet to indicate the sell-off has started for the Altcoin price.\n\nFor that to happen, we need to see the ETH price first breakout of the channel pattern to the downside. A bearish breakdown like this could easily lead to the Head and Shoulders pattern sell-off we are waiting for to play out in the coming days.\n\nClaim up to $30,030 in Bonus 100x Leverage Start Trading\n\nHow to Trade Bitcoin (BTC)?\n\nTo understand the basics of Bitcoin trading, you can read our How To Trade Bitcoin Guide.

        "content": "Although the cryptocurrency market behemoths Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have been consolidating their gains recently, plenty of cryptocurrency supporters have shared their optimistic prognoses for the industry\u2019s future, including Elon Musk.\n\nAs it happens, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) and Twitter (NYSE: TWTR) CEO was replying to a July 11 post by Twitter user Daniel, a.k.a. growing_daniel, who shared his prediction that, by the end of the decade, all traditional currencies might become digitalized through computer processors or graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nBy 2030 all currencies will be backed entirely by GPUs which five years ago would've sounded like a crypto prediction \u2014 Daniel (@growing_daniel) July 11, 2023\n\nNamely, the author referred to the fact that proof-of-work (PoW) crypto miners use GPUs used to mine digital assets, as well as the growing trend of fiat currency digitalization. In response, the billionaire entrepreneur agreed with the general sentiment, albeit specifying that there should be a change in terminology for the underlying technology as such. As Musk replied:\n\n\u201cWe should probably stop calling them GPUs, but yeah.\u201d\n\nNotably, such powerful statements as above, particularly expressed by influential figures like Musk himself, have been known to influence the general sentiment in the crypto sector, driving upward the price of the relevant digital assets mentioned or the market as a whole.\n\nWith this in mind, Bitcoin and Ethereum, as the industry\u2019s representatives and largest digital assets by market capitalization, could see a significant increase in price, particularly coinciding with other trends and indicators that could assist this bullish move.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum price analysis\n\nAt press time, Bitcoin was trading at $30,728, demonstrating an increase of 1.08% on the day, a 0.12% decline across the previous week, and an 18.56% gain on its monthly chart, as per the latest data retrieved by Finbold on July 12.\n\nBitcoin 24-hour price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nIndeed, the pseudonymous crypto market analyst known as Seth has noted Bitcoin\u2019s earlier chart patterns, specifically those from 2016 and 2019, which suggest that \u201cthe Bitcoin bull market has officially kicked off,\u201d as Finbold reported earlier.\n\nMeanwhile, the price of the Ethereum cryptocurrency stood at $1,889.36, up 1.07% in the last 24 hours, down 2.15% over the past seven days, as well as gaining 8.36% to its value across the previous month, as the recent charts suggest.\n\nEthereum 24-hour price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum, too, has been giving off a bullish vibe, leading crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa to express the belief that it could \u201cgo as high as $3,000 before a pullback,\u201d the strength of which will depend on the wider macro factors, according to the tweet.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "The stellar ecosystem will welcome liquidity and developers from other chains with the help of Allbridge and the $100 million Soroban Adoption Fund\n\nThe Allbridge protocol specializes in integrating EVM with non-EVM blockchains thus improving the general Web3 development.\n\nThe future growth prospects of blockchain technology are undeniably pegged to the ability of different chains to communicate safely and in a scalable manner. The Stellar network clearly understands the importance of opening up to other chains amid the mainstream adoption of Web3 products. Furthermore, the Stellar (XLM) ecosystem is actively developing infrastructure for decentralized applications (Dapps) developers to reach a wider audience.\n\nStellar Network Welcomes Allbridge\n\nAmid increased cryptocurrency adoption by institutional and retail traders, the Stellar ecosystem has stepped up its operations by welcoming the Allbridge solution to its network. According to the announcement, Allbridge has established a new cross-chain bridge to enable a seamless digital asset transfer between the Stellar network and other prominent chains such as Ethereum, Binance Chain, Solana, Celo, and Polygon.\n\nAt Allbridge, we are committed to increasing cross-chain interoperability between diverse blockchain ecosystems.\n\nsaid Andriy Velykyy, co-founder and CEO of Allbridge.\n\nThe latest integration with the Stellar network is the result of our hard work, delivering on the expectations set out by the Bridge Bounty Program. With this new bridge, we are bringing access to the Stellar ecosystem to the countless DeFi users, allowing them to experience Stellar\u2019s expansive ecosystem of dApps and services.\n\nThe announcement was warmly welcomed by the Stellar community including Ultra Stellar, a software engineering company specialized in developing financial solutions for the Stellar network.\n\nBig news: @Allbridge_io introduces cross-chain bridge, unlocking interoperability between Stellar, Ethereum, Solana, Celo, and Polygon for seamless asset transfers. https://t.co/Ht5SPiQvPa \u2014 Stellar (@StellarOrg) July 11, 2023\n\nReportedly, the Ultra Stellar team played a crucial role in the creation of a new cross-chain network with Allbridge. According to Dmitri Gmyza, a team member of the Ultra Stellar network, the leading products including LOBSTR, StellarX, and StellarTerm will have more utility with adoption from other chains.\n\nSimilarly, Tomer Weller, Vice President of Tech Strategy at the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF), reiterated the importance of a new cross-chain network between Allbridge and the Stellar ecosystem.\n\n\u201cWhen we launched the Stellar Bridge Bounty Program, we sought to support the development of cross-chain solutions on the Stellar network. With one powerful innovation, we are expanding the Stellar network\u2019s reach and utility while welcoming more developers and projects from different networks to join the Stellar ecosystem,\u201d Weller noted.\n\nOne of the largest utilities of the Allbridge on Stellar ecosystem will be the stablecoins market, which will help holders bridge assets to and from other chains seamlessly.\n\nMarket Outlook\n\nThe Stellar network is slated to attract more institutional investors and central banks seeking to tap into blockchain technology. Furthermore, the $4.8 billion valued network has the infrastructure in place to adopt CBDCs and mint stablecoins at scale. Additionally, Stellar Network has not been sued by the United States SEC on allegations of selling unregistered offerings and continues to build more DeFi products.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

        "title": "How Much Ethereum Punks \u201cTake Down\u201d Will Damage Ethscriptions? - The Coin Republic",
        "content": "With the emergence of Ethscriptions in June this year, the crypto space assumed another innovation unfolding down the road. Before the Ethereum-based inscriptions protocol could pick up pace, it met with a bump. The protocol saw the minting of a significant collection within hours of launch: Ethereum Punks. And now the Ethscribed punks on Ethereum are gone from the official website.\n\nCo-founder and former CEO of music website Genius.com, Tom Lehman created Ethscriptions. The protocol was released on June 17, 2023, and became the talk of the town within a matter of hours. Ethereum Punks was among the first collection over the network having 10,000 Ethscribed punks.\n\nThe idea of inscriptions already gained a lot of heat following the launch of Bitcoin Ordinals in January this year. However, many argued, including the Ethscriptions creator, that the concept of Ethscriptions has been around since 2016, but became a formal protocol with the website and \u201cindexer\u201d after Middlemarch, popular name of Lehman, developed them.\n\nAkin to Bitcoin Ordinals Inscriptions, Ethscriptions allow users to inscribe \u201cnon-financial data.\u201d Where it was to put data on individual Satoshi (SAT) on Bitcoin, Etheruem-based inscriptions use transaction call data. They are considered NFTs without NFTs.\n\nThe official website offers easy creation of Ethscriptions and suggests step-by-step procedures. Though it is meant to allow sharing of data, it is currently limited to sharing only images. As the website noted, an image size of less than 90 kilobytes (KB) needs to be converted to a Base 64-encoded data URI using specific tools. Then the converted data is sent to hex using tools again for further conversion.\n\nEthscriptions uses 0 ETH transactions which could be sent to someone or to self. Following the steps mentioned over the website, one can easily mint an Ethscribed token within a minute, says some creators.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Ethereum Punks were the earliest and significant collections on the platform. The collection has a similar appearance to the popular NFT collection from Yuga Labs, CryptoPunks.\n\nRecently Ethscriptions creator Middlemarch announced the taking down of the official website of its prominent collection Ethereum Punks. He cited the reason for CryptoPunks creator Yuga Labs to request for the same.\n\nAt the request of Yuga Labs, the owner of CryptoPunks, I am taking down the Ethereum Punks website, removing all Ethereum Punks images from https://t.co/ZcR9HKlexS, and deleting my Tweets that reference Ethereum Punks, including my Tweet introducing the Ethscriptions Protocol. \u2014 Middlemarch (@dumbnamenumbers) July 11, 2023\n\nIn addition to the website takedown, the Ethereum Punks images were also erased from Etherescriptions.com website. Middlemarch even deleted his Tweets related to the Ethereum inscribed collection.\n\nsource \u2013 ethereumpunks.net\n\nEarlier the website used to have the content as the image shows above. But now the address shows the error as the image shows below.\n\nsource \u2013 ethereumpunks.net\n\nUntil the time of writing, there is no official comment or confirmation from Yuga Labs about the instance. The Ethereum Punks deleting announcement was the last message from Middlemarch until now."
