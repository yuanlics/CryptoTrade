        "title": "Ethereum Now Deflationary for 2 Months Straight - Blockworks",
        "content": "Ethereum has been deflationary for two months straight due to a surge in on-chain activity on protocols such as Uniswap and Blur.\n\nThe network pushed an upgrade (EIP-1559) in August 2021 that meant transaction fees would be burned instead of directed to the network\u2019s miners \u2014 a precursor to Ethereum\u2019s switch to proof-of-stake last September.\n\nEIP-1559 at times inspired Ethereum to produce deflationary blocks (more ETH burned than distributed). But the asset has now been solidly deflationary every day since late January, per network tracker ultrasound.money.\n\nPrior to that, Ethereum had briefly entered deflationary status in November 2022, about two months after Ethereum\u2019s Merge cut issuance by more than 90%, before slipping back to inflationary by December.\n\nUltrasound.money only maps Ethereum\u2019s deflationary status since the Merge \u2014 making its recent streak the longest on record for this particular tracker.\n\nResearch analysts at Compass Point Research and Trading said in a research report earlier this month that the increase in burned ETH has largely been driven by increased Uniswap usage in response to centralized exchange uncertainty, as well as continued usage of the Blur NFT marketplace.\n\nUniswap tops the ETH burned leaderboard in the past 30 days, with roughly 8,766 ETH ($16 million) burned in that span. NFT marketplace and aggregator Blur has burned about 6,535 ETH ($11.9 million) over the last month.\n\n\u201cThe amount of ETH burned has seen a steady climb over the past two months due to an increase in on-chain activity, with the largest surge occurring on March 10 as fear surrounding USDC\u2019s backing caused a depeg,\u201d Blockworks Research Analyst Sam Martin said.\n\n\u201cOn-chain users scrambled to dump USDC for USDT, which led to the largest daily burn since the Merge\u2019s implementation.\u201d\n\nRead More: Blur Still Sees Record NFT Volumes Even After Crypto Airdrop\n\nThe depegging of USDC followed the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). It plunged to as low as $0.87 before ultimately returning to its $1 peg.\n\nThe failures of financial institutions in recent weeks, including Silvergate, SVB and Signature Bank, have prompted crypto industry participants to advocate for decentralized financial infrastructure as a more secure and reliable alternative.\n\nCompass Point\u2019s March 9 report predicted that the introduction of layer-2 blockchains can take market share away from so-called \u201cETH killers\u201d and bring users back to the Ethereum network.\n\n\u201cWe continue to believe that L2 scaling and liquid staking growth have the potential to be significant catalysts for Ethereum this year, and help drive on-boarding of users, adoption and overall demand and activity of the network,\u201d analysts wrote.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "NYAG calls Ethereum a security and destroys decentralization myth - CoinGeek",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s developers have locked in a date for the network\u2019s next big upgrade, dubbed \u2018Shanghai\u2019: April 12. While ETH fans will laud the update for introducing the ability to \u2018unstake\u2019 ETH, it couldn\u2019t be happening at a worse time.\n\nSEC chair Gary Gensler indicated again this week that proof-of-stake models\u2014like those used by Ethereum\u2014are securities. Meanwhile, the NYAG filed charges against the KuCoin exchange for illegally selling securities and specifically named ETH as a security in large part due to the fact that Ethereum is not decentralized after all.\n\nAdd to that the fact that the past 12-24 months have seen legislators, regulators, and law enforcement all clamp down on illegalities within the industry in different ways. For instance, in January, the SEC took action against lend-to-earn programs jointly operated by Genesis and Gemini on the basis that they amounted to illegal securities offerings. Nexo Capital paid the SEC a $45 million dollar settlement over its lend-to-earn program around the same time.\n\nMost notable about these actions is that they confirm that the SEC is beginning to deconstruct the myth of decentralization and the role it plays in determining whether a given asset offering amounts to a security. Look at the language used by Gensler in an interview with The Block in 2021, right as the SEC began to look at lend-to-earn products:\n\n\u201cI would note to your readers that if you\u2019re investing on a centralized exchange or a centralized lending platform, you no longer own your token. You\u2019ve transferred ownership to the platform. All you have is a counterparty risk. And that platform might be saying, as many of them do, we\u2019ll give you a four percent or seven percent return if you stake your coins with us or you actually transfer ownership and we the platform will stake your tokens. That takes on all the indicia of what Congress is trying to protect under the securities laws.\u201d\n\nThis should represent an enormous red flag for Ethereum and BTC\u2014two projects that the SEC has long considered the rare exceptions to its general position that most digital assets are, in fact, securities. That\u2019s because these exceptions arise from the SEC\u2019s assumption that both projects are decentralized: without a centralized body governing projects like these, according to the SEC\u2019s logic, it can\u2019t be said that investors had a reasonable expectation of profits relying on the efforts of others, as is required by the Howey test for securities (their belief that BTC is not a security is also based on a misguided interpretation of that project\u2019s history).\n\nThese exceptions were always highly tenuous and at odds with reality. As time has gone on, they have become increasingly difficult to justify. Now, it seems, regulators and law enforcement have finally seen the lie for what it is.\n\nEthereum was always a security\u2014but now it\u2019s obvious\n\nThe idea that Ethereum is anything but a security has always been a sham. This was obvious from Buterin\u2019s own marketing at the time of the ETH ICO right through to the language used on Ethereum websites today. The point is made repeatedly: ETH production will slow dramatically over time, increasing scarcity and, as a consequence, value.\n\nwidth=\"562\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nThe Ethereum foundation website also refers to the fact that ETH is viewed as an investment.\n\nBut the biggest lie of all was that Ethereum is or has ever been decentralized. This was obvious back in 2016 when a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) holding almost 15% of all ETH in circulation was hacked. Ethereum\u2019s developers, led by founder Vitalik Buterin, proposed, approved, and implemented the solution to fork the network and recover the stolen assets. There was the charade of a vote on the proposal, but just 6% of all ether holders participated, and 25% of the votes came from a single address, while the proposals at the heart of the vote were still authored by Ethereum\u2019s core team. This can be seen again as recently as this week with the Shanghai update announcement: If Ethereum is decentralized, then who is designing, proposing, and implementing these radical upgrades? That would be the very same people that intervened after the DAO hack, of course. This is not decentralization by any realistic definition.\n\nThe notorious Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, which moved the network\u2019s consensus mechanism from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake, did nothing to change this reality. If anything, the migration to Proof-of-Stake moved Ethereum even deeper into security territory. In contrast to Proof-of-Work, where miners are at least undertaking work of their own in solving hash puzzles, those staking under a Proof-of-Stake system are relying entirely on the work of others to deliver profits on whatever coins have been staked. In fact, this week, Gensler again indicated that Proof-of-Stake networks are likely to trigger U.S. securities laws, saying:\n\n\u201cWhatever they\u2019re promoting and putting into a protocol, and locking up their tokens in a protocol, a protocol that\u2019s often a small group of entrepreneurs and developers are developing, I would just suggest that each of these token operators \u2026 seek to come into compliance, and the same with the intermediaries,\u201d he said, reported by The Block.\n\nAuthorities are already taking action on the basis that ETH is a security\n\nThis sea change by authorities is not just a speculation over some hypothetical future enforcement drive. Instead, the enforcement drive is already here.\n\nLast week, the New York Attorney General filed charges against exchange KuCoin over failing to register as a securities and commodities broker-dealer: ETH, which is listed by the exchange, was expressly labeled a security in the charges. The language used by the NYAG couldn\u2019t be clearer:\n\n\u201cETH\u2019s development and management is largely driven by a small number of developers who hold positions in ETH and stand to profit from the growth of the network and the related appreciation of ETH.\u201d\n\nFurther down:\n\n\u201cButerin and the Ethereum Foundation retain significant influence over Ethereum and are often a driving force behind major initiatives on the Ethereum blockchain that impact the functionality and price of ETH.\u201d\n\nThe language could have been taken straight from Howey: ETH is not decentralized, and the continued development of the network is closely governed by a core group of developers who promote the asset on the basis that its value will increase over time. It is a classic security.\n\nThe NYAG\u2019s action is against KuCoin rather than anyone directly connected to Ethereum, but between Ethereum\u2019s recent upgrades, Gensler\u2019s public statements on centralization and the SEC\u2019s recent enforcement actions, it seems that the SEC charges against Ethereum and its developers directly can\u2019t be far away. The ramifications of an SEC case against Ethereum can be much wider reaching: the SEC is empowered to levy fines and penalties against those violating the U.S.\u2019 securities regime, including disgorgement of all profits made in connection with an unregistered securities offering and injunctions against carrying on further business. In short, it could spell the end of Ethereum altogether.\n\nAnd if the myth of decentralization with respect to ETH has finally been pierced, then you can bet that BTC is up for the same treatment.\n\nFollow CoinGeek\u2019s Crypto Crime Cartel series, which delves into the stream of groups\u2014from BitMEX to Binance, Bitcoin.com, Blockstream, ShapeShift, Coinbase, Ripple,\n\nEthereum, FTX and Tether\u2014who have co-opted the digital asset revolution and turned the industry into a minefield for na\u00efve (and even experienced) players in the market.\n\nNew to blockchain?

        "content": "More than $1 billion of ether has been lost forever due to bugs and human error, according to research by Conor Grogan, director of product strategy and business operations at Coinbase.\n\n\"I've categorized thousands of instances of Ethereum typos, user errors and buggy contracts,\" Grogan said on Twitter on Monday. He noted that he'd cataloged 636,000 ETH ($1.15 billion) that is lost, representing 0.5% of the coin's circulating supply.\n\nThe majority \u2014 some 514,000 ETH \u2014 is due to a 2017 bug in the Parity crypto wallet. Defunct crypto exchange Quadriga lost 60,000 ETH to a contract fault and the Akutars NFT collection lost 11,500 ETH in a failed Mint. On top of those, Ethereum users have cumulatively sent 24,000 ETH to a burn address, where the coins can no longer be accessed.\n\nIn most of these cases, the ether wasn't worth anywhere as near as much in dollars at the time of the loss.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nGrogan added that his estimate, if anything, is an understatement. \"This $1.1B+ number significantly undershoots the actual lost/inaccessible ETH amount \u2014 It just covers instances where Ethereum is locked forever,\" he said.\n\nThis is because access to many wallets will have been lost but there's no way of knowing which ones by looking at blockchain data alone.\n\nUpdate: Fixed the amount lost in the Parity bug."

        "content": "The second-largest crypto asset by market cap, Ethereum (ETH), has more upside potential, according to analytics platform Santiment.\n\nThe crypto analytics firm says that Ethereum is likely to soar above the $2,000 price after hitting a high last reached seven months ago over the weekend.\n\n\u201cEthereum\u2019s price hadn\u2019t eclipsed $1,840 since August 18th. Despite this seven-month high, the network hasn\u2019t appeared to heat up and create notable transaction barriers due to high demand. This is a good sign that ETH has a door open to $2,000 and beyond.\u201d\n\nDespite the price jump, Santiment says that Ethereum\u2019s transaction fees fell below $2 when ETH hit a seven-month high compared to rising above $8 earlier this month when the second-largest crypto fell to a two-month low.\n\nA Twitter survey conducted by Santiment over the weekend also indicated that there are more people who believe Ethereum will rise above $2,000 first than those who think it will drop below $1,600 first. Nearly 10% of the respondents said they see Ethereum soaring above $2,000 next while 5.2% said they see ETH falling under $1,600 next.\n\nOn Bitcoin (BTC), Santiment further says that March\u2019s rally is legitimate. According to Santiment director of marketing Brian Quinlivan, Bitcoin\u2019s rally has coincided with the banking sector\u2019s meltdown.\n\n\u201cWith the calendar past the halfway mark in March, Bitcoin has gone on another tear, breaking above $27,800 for the first time since June, 2022.\n\nSo why did prices manage to soar? Well, there were a few different key events in the first half of March.\n\nThe most obvious appeared to be the collapse of one of the larger US banks, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). And it appears this has caused massive ripple effects among the banking sector, in general.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "After scalability, privacy is the next big thing in the blockchain space - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Public blockchains provide decentralization and transparency, but they lack on the privacy side. The anonymity of transactions on blockchains like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) is steadily losing ground, as transactions and addresses are easily tracked. With KYC imposed on most crypto exchanges, the majority of blockchain transactions can be traced to their initiators, exposing user activity, holdings, and financial data.\n\nEven decentralized finance (DeFi) interactions can be easily monitored by advanced on-chain analysis systems. This is why privacy is just as important as speed and scalability for crypto to reach mainstream acceptance. Average consumers expect at least bank account level privacy to freely transact and RAILGUN is a ZK (Zero-Knowledge) based solution for existing blockchains that provides such wallet-level privacy.\n\nThe utility of digital assets comes with major downsides amid a lack of privacy. What happens when a crypto user pays for a coffee in crypto? They risk revealing their holdings, income and shopping preferences to merchants, peers and anyone who wants to extract value from their data. And taking it a step further, how many people would be comfortable receiving their salaries in crypto if it meant broadcasting all their financial information to the world? The necessity for increased privacy in the crypto space is essential to mainstream adoption.\n\nPrivacy gains more attention across the blockchain community\n\nPrivacy is an important goal for public blockchains, especially Ethereum, which accounts for about two-thirds of all DeFi activity. The need for privacy on Ethereum has increased after the adoption of the widespread adoption of layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum.\n\nIn January 2023, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin admitted the need for improved privacy on the blockchain. He proposed a \u201cstealth address system\u201d to increase the privacy degree of Ethereum transactions. Stealth addresses would be generated by wallets and would represent obfuscated public key addresses to receive funds in a private environment. Access to stealth addresses would require a special code referred to as a \u201cspending key.\u201d This would enable two parties to transact without being visible to the public. However, stealth addresses are an incomplete solution as they don\u2019t account for full DeFi functionality.\n\nIt\u2019s still too early to know when Ethereum will implement privacy features and to what extent, but the good news is that there are solutions that can already achieve a high degree of privacy. RAILGUN is a smart contract system that provides crypto and DeFi users with privacy through zero-knowledge proof (zk-SNARK) technology.\n\nRAILGUN is currently among the leading complete privacy solutions for the DeFi space, as it generates zk-SNARK encryption entirely within a smart contract. That enables users to store their funds anonymously and interact with decentralized applications (DApps) in an anonymous, noncustodial manner.\n\nSource: Railgun\n\nRAILGUN, which is governed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), employs zk-SNARKs to encrypt transaction details, wallet balances and transaction history. Unlike other third-party, Layer-2 privacy solutions, RAILGUN works directly on-chain, enabling users to transfer, swap, lend, borrow and transact with all kinds of DApps anonymously.\n\nOn top of that, the RAILGUN smart contracts can be plugged into any Ethereum Virtual Machine DApp for shielded transactions using the RAILGUN Connect dev toolkit.\n\nRecently, RAILGUN was deployed to Arbitrum \u2014 a layer-2 rollup technology for Ethereum, bringing privacy combined with speed and high throughput to the second-largest decentralized network. RAILGUN DAO'S co-founder Alan Scott stated:\n\n\u201cThe Arbitrum deployment of RAILGUN is a massive accomplishment for privacy in DeFi. Arbitrum\u2019s scaling and RAILGUN\u2019s zk-SNARK-based privacy together are an exciting match. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing how DeFi builders will use RAILGUN\u2019s infrastructure to create interesting and new privacy-preserving DeFi solutions on Arbitrum.\u201d\n\nBesides working on Ethereum and Arbitrum, RAILGUN enables on-chain privacy for BSC and Polygon. What\u2019s more, contributors are working on adding support for Solana, Near and Metis as well.\n\nDevelopers and users are starting to pay more attention to privacy as blockchain adoption expands across multiple use cases. Therefore, if developers can crack the puzzle, privacy is poised to become one of the most important trends in blockchain in the coming years.\n\nMaterial is provided in partnership with RAILGUN DAO"

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price is showing a very bullish signal right now, with a couple of key resistance levels getting broken to the upside. If the breakout is valid, things could look much better for the crypto market in the coming months.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy: Edris\n\nThe Daily Chart:\n\nOn the daily chart, the price has been rallying since a sharp rebound from the 200-day moving average around the $1400 mark. It has climbed above the 50-day moving average located around the $1600 level, before breaking through the higher boundary of the large symmetrical triangle pattern.\n\nCurrently, the key $1800 resistance level is also seemingly getting tested, and the price could soon target values above $2000, especially the $2300 level, in the coming weeks if the current breakout is valid.\n\nOn the other hand, in case a fake breakout occurs, a pullback towards either of the 50-day or 200-day moving averages or the $1300 support area could be expected.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart:\n\nLooking at the 4-hour timeframe, the recent price rally becomes more clear. The cryptocurrency has been struggling with the higher boundary of the symmetrical triangle and the $1800 level over the last few days, with the latter yet to be broken to the upside.\n\nThe RSI indicator also demonstrates a bearish divergence between the recent price highs, which could point to a possible correction in the short term. The $1680 and $1500 levels could be possible turning points for the price in case a bearish move materializes.\n\nHowever, from a price action perspective, ETH is seemingly willing to continue higher, considering the last two 4-hour candles, which are breaking above the $1800 area.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nBy: Edris\n\nEthereum Coinbase Premium Gap\n\nWith a banking crisis seemingly on the horizon, investors are getting worried about the potential effects on the crypto market.\n\nInteresting signs regarding American investors\u2019 recent behavior have emerged. The Coinbase premium gap chart shows a huge spike that recently occurred, demonstrating the gap between Coinbase\u2019s ETH/USD pair and Binance\u2019s ETH/USDT pair. Positive values indicate higher buying pressure in the U.S., while negative values are associated with selling pressure.\n\nIf this behavior continues, the market would likely sustain its uptrend in the mid-term, and a new bull market could begin. However, if the value declines in the coming days and falls below zero, investors should be cautious, as it could be an early sign of a bearish reversal."

        "content": "Qadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nThe price of cryptocurrencies increased over the weekend as bitcoin and Ethereum reached their highest levels in months this week. While Ethereum trades close to the 2022 September highs, Bitcoin nearly reached $27,000, which is its highest level since early June. Both the leading assets of the cryptocurrency industry seem to be performing well.\n\nEthereum Could Outperform Bitcoin in Coming Cycle\n\nAccording to Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal, the technicals and fundamentals of Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, indicate that it could significantly outperform Bitcoin (BTC) in the upcoming cycle. Pal claims to be keeping a watch on the Ethereum against Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) chart in a recent interview on the cryptocurrency-focused YouTube channel Altcoin Daily.\n\nAccording to the macro expert, the ETH/BTC pair is coiling inside a wedge, and a breakout could drive ETH into a surge that puts Bitcoin in second place. According to him, the ETH/BTC pair needs to overcome resistance at about 0.077 BTC ($2,115) in order to verify the breakout.\n\nETH/BTC is currently trading at 0.0639 BTC ($1,755). On the fundamentals of Ethereum, the Real Vision CEO thinks that the entire addressable market is much larger than Bitcoin\u2019s.\n\nSimilar Prediction Made Earlier\n\nIn 2021, a similar forecast that ETH would overtake Bitcoin was made. The explanation given was that Ethereum is a programmable blockchain, which implies that those who possess the necessary technical know-how can use it to trade not only ether tokens but also any other digital asset, including bitcoin. Furthermore, ETH offers the added benefit of being able to sell and buy NFTs.\n\nFollowing this in 2022, numerous analysts believed that ETH would unquestionably overtake BTC when they heard that the Ethereum Mainnet would merge with the Beacon Chain proof-of-stake system.\n\nHowever, all of these were just predictions and BTC continues to be the top dog among the crypto assets."

        "content": "Ethereum Classic sees a surge in TVL fueled by increased activity from one of its DEXes.\n\nETC bulls make a comeback but market conditions will dictate its next move.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) just concluded a bullish week but its price action is not the only aspect that achieved a pivot. Its total value locked also registered some upside after previously experiencing outflows.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Classic Profit Calculator\n\nETC had a $363.982 TVL, at the time of writing, which represented a significant improvement and pivot from its $279,884 low in February.\n\nBut despite this noteworthy improvement, Ethereum Classic\u2019s TVL was immensely dwarfed by Ethreum\u2019s impressive $28.93 billion TVL. ETC\u2019s anemic TVL is a rough indicator of just how far behind the network is in the DeFi race.\n\nA major reason for Ethereum Classic\u2019s TVL shortfall is that it has not been very successful in attracting DeFi projects to run on its network.\n\nNevertheless, there is one particular protocol running on the Ethereum Classic network that seeks to change that. The HebeSwap decentralized exchange currently accounts for most of Ethereum Classic\u2019s TVL.\n\nThe amount of TVL that HebeSwap contributed to Ethereum Classic peaked at $236,928 after surging by 42.87% in the last 7 days.\n\nIt had the highest gains out of the DeFi projects currently running on the Ethereum Classic network.\n\nThe DEX recently expressed its commitment to improving ETC\u2019s ecosystem through the latest addition, a farm APY pool.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) price action\n\nETC bounced back by as much as 25% from its weekly low to its weekly high. Its 40% gain from its current monthly low is even more impressive. It traded at $21.12 at press time.\n\nCan ETC sustain the rally for the next few days? Its latest upside has so far pushed above the 50% RSI level which means relative strength is now leaning in favor of the bulls. Multiple on-chain metrics also support this observation.\n\nHow many are 1,10,100 ETCs worth today?\n\nThe weighted sentiment metrics remained high after the rally it secured in the last 7 days. In other words, investors are still optimistic about ETC\u2019s bullish prospects.\n\nInvestors should also note that the price volatility metric ended last week with a pivot. It remains to be seen whether this volatility surge will carry the momentum forward for the next few days.\n\nMore good news from the NFT side of things. Ethereum Classic\u2019s total NFT trades volume registered a surge in the last few days. A confirmation that the demand for NFTs on the network was also enjoying improved health.\n\nAlthough these are favorable observations, Ethereum Classic\u2019s development activity demonstrated signs of weakness during the weekend."

The wallet generates an Ethereum address that allows users to receive funds through the Ethereum network.\n\nUsers can also manage multiple Ethereum accounts and choose between the built-in Edge wallet or an extension.\n\nMicrosoft has partnered with Consensys to make available a swap feature supporting ETH, DAI, UNI, USDC, and USDT, according to Bleeping Computer.\n\nMicrosoft and Consensys did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nIt remains to be seen if Microsoft will add support for other digital assets in the future.\n\nAccording to Albacore, the wallet may launch soon.\n\n\u201cEnabling the crypto wallet ended up being less complex than I anticipated, which is also why I think that a launch might not be far away,\u201d he told Blockworks.\n\nAccording to the screenshots, the beta version of the wallet also features a news section to keep track of industry developments, which includes the ability to connect to decentralized apps.\n\nSimon Kertonegoro, who previously helped usher in the implementation of a collaborative program between Microsoft and Enjin known as Azure Heroes, told Blockworks the tech giant\u2019s Web3 wallet was a \u201csavvy play\u201d as it sought to \u201cgain an upper hand\u201d against rival Google Chrome.\n\n\u201cThis would be amazing for us as users too, we\u2019ll no longer need to input our credit card information every time we make a payment,\u201d the founder of MyMetaverse said.\n\nWhile the Edge crypto wallet is still in the testing phase, it could be a significant development for Microsoft, as it allows users to easily send and receive crypto without installing additional extensions or apps.\n\nThe move signals a pivot from its previous Web3 endeavors; Microsoft axed its metaverse unit in February, just four months after it had created a team tasked with building industrial networks.\n\nJane Ma, co-founder of zkLend, a layer-2 money-market protocol built on StarkNet, told Blockworks the emergence of Web3 technologies has spurred a growing trend of Web2 infrastructure companies looking to explore ways to integrate these decentralized solutions into their platforms.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft\u2019s prototype crypto wallet for its Edge browser is a prime example of this trend, as it aims to simplify the onboarding process for new users,\u201d Ma said. \u201cWith a massive user base of over 200 million, Microsoft Edge\u2019s approach of providing a ready-made, packaged solution within its browser would break down technical barriers,\u201d she said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

The news was revealed amid the start of the annual Game Developers Conference (GDC).\n\nTo be clear, Polygon and Immutable aren\u2019t merging, and they\u2019ll continue their respective projects and initiatives. Polygon\u2019s own zkEVM mainnet network is set to launch in beta on March 27, while the existing Immutable X scaling network\u2014based on the StarkEx zk-Rollup tech\u2014will also continue on alongside the new Immutable zkEVM network.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nImmutable co-founder and President Robbie Ferguson told Decrypt that the partnership was an \u201cobvious move\u201d that lets the core builders behind both existing networks combine their efforts in the service of Web3 video game adoption.\n\n\u201cFor us, this is the endgame,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cThis is how the next billion users will be onboarded into Web3.\u201d\n\nBoth are Ethereum scaling networks: Polygon\u2019s current primary network is a sidechain, while Immutable X is a layer-2 network. Although the approaches are different, both ultimately make Ethereum more useful for things like video games, large-scale NFT projects, and other decentralized apps (dapps) by enabling faster, cheaper transactions than Ethereum\u2019s mainnet.\n\nA zkEVM solution like Polygon\u2019s and others is expected to take Ethereum scaling to the next level, pairing transaction rollups based on zero-knowledge proof cryptography with full Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) support. In other words, it\u2019s billed as a fast and secure solution that is natively compatible with Ethereum\u2019s own smart contract capabilities.\n\nImmutable X and Polygon are competing scaling networks, however, and have previously competed to lure in developers, brands, and users alike.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPolygon Labs President Ryan Wyatt admitted to Decrypt that it was a bit awkward at first to discuss a unified path forward when the two sides began chatting about nine months ago.\n\n\u201cWhen we first came together\u2014yeah, it was certainly hard to wrap our heads around it,\u201d Wyatt said. \u201cIt took time for both sides to figure out: OK, how does this actually make sense for all of us? The more that we talked and the more time that we spent together, it\u2019s actually very naturally aligned.\u201d\n\nFerguson said that despite their history as competitors, both Polygon and Immutable X sought to scale Ethereum rather than try to compete against it as a layer-1 rival. That shared belief in expanding the capabilities of Ethereum, rather than try to beat it with a new, bespoke network, also gave them a shared foundation to work from.\n\n\u201c[That] made it a very easy philosophical alignment,\u201d Ferguson added, \u201conce we looked past the intense competition we'd had on the gaming front over the past couple of years.\u201d\n\nImmutable zkEVM is slated to start rolling out towards the end of Q2 2023, Ferguson said, which is when Immutable is \u201caiming for usable things to go live,\u201d but developers can start building on software development kits (SDKs) today to explore the tech.\n\nThe network will use Immutable\u2019s IMX token for gas fees and transaction sequencing. The current Immutable X network will continue operating, and Ferguson said his team\u2019s goal is to develop cross-rollup liquidity between the networks.\n\nHe also expects there to be bridges built to help move assets between Immutable zkEVM and Polygon\u2019s own zkEVM network, for example.\n\nUltimately, the pair said they see Immutable zkEVM as the best of both worlds\u2014a network that will utilize Polygon\u2019s next-generation scaling tech while tapping into the gaming infrastructure that Immutable has built, providing a potentially appealing place for developers to take root as the Web3 gaming market expands.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWyatt believes that Web3 gaming is inching closer to a point of mainstream adoption, despite previous pushback from many traditional video game fans. He pointed to this weekend\u2019s live event for the Polygon-powered shooter Deadrop\u2014from a studio founded by Twitch personality Guy \u201cDr. Disrespect\u201d Beahm\u2014as an example of Web3 games that can appeal broadly.\n\nAs he also recently discussed on Decrypt\u2019s gm podcast, Wyatt reiterated what he sees as an increasing push to \u201cabstract away a lot of the crypto and tech jargon\u201d around Web3 games, and just focus on \u201creally fun games where I own assets that I pay for, I can trade them easily, and I can have this really seamless experience.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat's ultimately what the combination of the partnership does,\u201d he said."

        "content": "Venture capitalist Chris Burniske says that Ethereum (ETH) rival Solana (SOL) could be setting itself up for a massive move to the upside.\n\nBurniske, a former ARK Invest analyst and a current partner at venture capital firm Placeholder, says that a big rally may be in store for Solana if it can clearly break the 200-day simple moving average (SMA),\n\n\u201cSOL definitively reclaiming its 200-day SMA should be a glorious move.\u201d\n\nSOL\u2019s 200-day moving average is currently hovering at about $23. At time of writing, SOL is trading for $22.42.\n\nBurniske has previously predicted that Solana could be the next \u201cEthereum-level\u201d opportunity should another bull market happen.\n\nLast month, Burniske said,\n\n\u201cI think if I had to pick an ecosystem that\u2019s contentious and that you should pay attention to, and in its contentiousness is undervalued, it would be Solana. Placeholder, each bear market, tends to pick an ecosystem or two and build an aircraft carrier strategy around that ecosystem. And so the last bear [market], it was ETH and Bitcoin, because those were really the only things at scale and liquid enough to justify.\n\nAnd what I mean by aircraft carrier \u2013 if you take Ethereum, buy a bunch of the core ETH asset, but then venture invest around it and really get to know that ecosystem and who all the people are that are working on say, at that point in time, lending or DEXs [decentralized exchanges] or asset management or whatever. And then you can pick the best teams of the teams that most speak to you from a venture perspective. We\u2019re doing that exact same aircraft carrier strategy around Cosmos and Solana right now.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "A popular crypto analyst known for calling the 2018 Bitcoin (BTC) bottom thinks Ethereum (ETH) is primed for a breakout.\n\nPseudonymous trader Smart Contracter shares a chart with his 221,700 Twitter followers that suggests Ethereum could shoot up past the $1,900 range in short order.\n\n\u201cI believe there\u2019s a strong chance low of the week is in on ETH, as it ran the highs and lows on hourly and pulled back after weekly close with no upside wick, plus structure looks like an ABC [wave].\u201d\n\nSmart Contracter is a popular practitioner of the Elliott Wave theory, an advanced technical analysis approach that attempts to predict future price action by following crowd psychology that tends to manifest in waves. According to the theory, a bullish asset tends to resume its uptrend after going through an ABC corrective move.\n\nEthereum is trading at $1,736 at time of writing. The second-ranked crypto asset by market cap is down 2.9% in the past 24 hours.\n\nSmart Contracter also thinks Bitcoin\u2019s recent price rally could mean a couple of different things, though he thinks they\u2019re all bullish for the top crypto asset.\n\n\u201cBTC rallying into all this mayhem and having a monster weekly breakout is telling us one of two things, but too early to tell which one yet.\n\n#1. It\u2019s telling us that BTC is still a risk on asset and is simply moving before equities, like it always does and equities play catch up soon\n\n#2. It\u2019s telling us that its finally decoupled from trad finance and is now a safe haven asset doing what it was originally intended to do.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is trading at $27,812 at time of writing and is down 0.19% in the past 24 hours.\n\nSmart Contracter also thinks Ethereum competitor Solana (SOL) could rally against Bitcoin (SOL/BTC) after taking out its diagonal resistance on the hourly chart.\n\n\u201cNice SOL/BTC breakout brewing on the back of a beautiful SOL/USD weekly close.\u201d\n\nSOL is worth $22.47 at time of writing.

Bitcoin maintained its new high of $28,000 after it went bullish.\n\nEthereum to USD price chart | Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nEther\u2019s value against bitcoin had decreased since March 12, when the TradFi scene started facing a crisis. Any specific event has not triggered the sudden surge of ETH.\n\nThe ratio rose from 0.072 bitcoin per ETH to 0.062, equivalent to $280. It changed to 0.064 today, which might be the beginning of a recovery phase.\n\nThe Ethereum token supply has decreased by almost 67,000 ETHs, equivalent to $122 million, for the first time since its launch in 2015. ETH went into deflation on Jan. 16, 2023, and its total supply has steadily declined by 1,000 to 2,000 per day. More than 2,100 ETH are getting burnt daily. However, around 2,000 are issued to perchers, making the supply deficit around 100 ETH.\n\nSo far, bitcoin has been the primary crypto asset for market speculators and investors running out of banking. Bitcoin\u2019s high position might be because it is the most acknowledged crypto asset integrated into the general financial system.\n\nThe ETH surge might suggest a calmness in the banking system, but no solid evidence exists. However, with the ongoing government intervention, the banking crisis might end, and there is hope for improved market sentiment.\n\nThe placating of the banking crisis\n\nSignificant banks on the verge of collapsing have made incredible recoveries while the federal government and FDIC intervened for the ones that have been crushed completely.\n\nAs industry proponents speculated a possible crash, the First Republic Bank stock dived by 50% on Monday. However, with $212 billion in total assets as of December 2022, the bank bounced back today, with the price increasing by an average of 30%.\n\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the government might offer catchers to all banks speculating about a potential system contagion.\n\nIntervention by big banks such as the ECB, J.P. Morgan, and the Bank of England might save the banking scene and suggest that the crisis is ending. The falling behind of the bank collapse scene might make the Bitcoin price rise to slow down too.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

After Euler issued an on-chain ultimatum demanding the funds\u2019 return, the hacker offered to start a dialogue.\n\nThe message, embedded in an Ethereum transaction, read:\n\n\u201cWe want to make this easy on all those affected. No intention of keeping what is not ours\u2026 Setting up secure communication. Let us come to an agreement.\u201d\n\nAfter several hours, Euler responded with its own on-chain message, acknowledging the message and asking the exploiter to speak \u201cin private.\u201d\n\nOn March 13, the DeFi platform was attacked with a flash loan exploit, draining approximately $196.9 million in various cryptocurrencies.\n\nWe are aware and our team is currently working with security professionals and law enforcement. We will release further information as soon as we have it. https://t.co/bjm6xyYcxf \u2014 Euler Labs (@eulerfinance) March 13, 2023\n\nThis loot included $8.7 million in DAI stablecoin and $18.5 million in Wrapped Bitcoin [WBTC]. Around $135.8 million in Staked Ethereum [stETH] and $33.8 million in USD Coin [USDC] were also stolen.\n\nA few days later, Euler Finance offered the hacker 10% of the $200 million stolen in exchange for returning the rest within 24 hours. When that did not happen, Euler Finance formally announced a $1 million reward for information on the hacker and the return of all funds.\n\nToday the Euler Foundation is launching a $1M reward in the hope that this provides additional incentive for information that leads to the Euler protocol attacker\u2019s arrest and the return of all funds extracted by the attacker. \u2014 Euler Labs (@eulerfinance) March 15, 2023\n\nHowever, on 16 March, the hacker transferred funds associated with the Euler exploit to the Tornado Cash mixing service. The 10 transactions totaled 1,000 ETH (worth $1.74 million at the time of writing).\n\nOther transactions from the exploiter\u2019s wallet address also include 3000 ETH sent back to Euler Finance on 18 March, as well as funds sent to a possible apparent victim of the exploit.\n\nStrategy for @eulerfinance exploit.\n\nYesterday the Hacker returned 3k eth (~5 mio USD) of the stolen ~200 mio USD to Euler.\n\nTo be exact the first transfer took place at 6:53 AM and this is where things are getting interesting. pic.twitter.com/OFxb4d59ze \u2014 Johannes(?) (@0xJohannes_) March 19, 2023\n\nUnknown hacker mocking the system?\n\nJohannes, a crypto Twitter user, pointed out that just minutes after these transactions, EUL\u2019s price went up by 70% from $2.3 to $3.95. He speculated that the hacker might be mocking the Euler team so others can profit if the funds are returned.\n\nThe language used by the exploiter indicates that more than one person is involved in the loot.\n\nIn an earlier tweet, blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis said that the wallet address to which 100 ETH was transferred was linked to North Korea. According to Chainalysis, this could be an intentional attempt to mislead investigators."

        "title": "Ethereum and its impact on the blockchain landscape - NewsWatch",
        "content": "Blockchain technology has emerged as a game-changer in various industries due to its potential to create secure and decentralized systems for managing and exchanging data. One of the most significant blockchain platforms is Ethereum, which has gained popularity for its ability to support the development of decentralized applications and smart contracts. We aim to provide readers with a deeper understanding of Ethereum\u2019s architecture, features, and use cases. We will explore the potential of Ethereum to disrupt various industries, such as finance and supply chain management, and its impact on the broader blockchain landscape. By the end of this article, readers will have a better understanding of Ethereum and its potential for innovation and disruption.\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum\n\nEthereum\u2019s architecture and technical specifications are fundamental to its ability to support the development of decentralized applications and smart contracts. At its core, Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source platform that allows for the creation of smart contracts. Smart contracts are self-executing agreements between parties that are stored on the Ethereum blockchain, which enables them to be tamper-proof and transparent. The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is responsible for executing these smart contracts, and it is this innovative design that sets Ethereum apart from other blockchain platforms.\n\nThe key features that differentiate Ethereum from other blockchain platforms include its ability to support the development of decentralized applications and smart contracts. Ethereum allows developers to create decentralized applications that run on the Ethereum blockchain, giving them the ability to build trustless and transparent applications. Additionally, Ethereum\u2019s use of smart contracts enables developers to create automated agreements that execute once certain conditions are met. These features have contributed to Ethereum\u2019s popularity and its ability to drive innovation in various industries.\n\nSmart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps) are central to the Ethereum network, and they enable a wide range of use cases. DApps can be built to facilitate anything from online marketplaces to social media platforms, with the added benefits of security and transparency. The use of smart contracts allows for the automation of agreements between parties, making the entire process more efficient and trustworthy. The role of DApps and smart contracts on the Ethereum network is critical to its success and adoption in various industries.\n\nUse Cases for Ethereum\n\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi) is one of the most significant use cases for Ethereum, and it has the potential to revolutionize the financial industry. DeFi applications allow for the creation of decentralized financial products and services that operate without intermediaries, such as banks. These products and services include peer-to-peer lending, stablecoins, and decentralized exchanges, among others. The use of Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts enables these services to be transparent, efficient, and secure, providing a new level of financial access and inclusion to those who were previously excluded from the traditional financial system.\n\nNon-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are digital assets that are unique and cannot be exchanged for one another. Ethereum has played a significant role in the growth of the NFT market, providing the ability to create, buy, and sell NFTs in a secure and decentralized manner. NFTs have a wide range of use cases, from art and collectibles to gaming and virtual real estate. The growth of the NFT market has been driven by the ability to prove ownership and authenticity of digital assets, and Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts enable this proof to be stored on the blockchain.\n\nThe gambling industry has seen significant growth in the use of digital assets, and Ethereum has played a role in enabling this trend. Ethereum casinos allow players to use cryptocurrencies to gamble, providing increased security and privacy compared to traditional online casinos. The use of Ethereum smart contracts also enables provably fair games, which ensures that the outcome of a game is not manipulated by the casino or any other third-party. The growth of the gambling industry using digital assets has been driven by the convenience and security of using cryptocurrencies, and Ethereum\u2019s capabilities have made it a popular choice for this use case.\n\nSupply chain management is another area where Ethereum has the potential to drive innovation and transparency. By using Ethereum\u2019s blockchain technology, supply chains can be made more transparent and secure, reducing the risk of fraud and counterfeiting. The use of smart contracts enables the automation of supply chain processes, reducing the need for intermediaries and improving efficiency. Additionally, by storing supply chain data on the Ethereum blockchain, it becomes tamper-proof and transparent, allowing for increased accountability and traceability throughout the supply chain.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Impact on the Blockchain Landscape\n\nThe growth of the Ethereum network has had a significant impact on the broader blockchain landscape. Ethereum has become one of the most widely used blockchain platforms, with a large developer community and a wide range of use cases. Its popularity has contributed to the growth of other blockchain platforms as well, as the technology continues to gain mainstream acceptance. Additionally, Ethereum\u2019s success has led to the development of new technologies and platforms that build on its architecture, such as Polkadot and Cardano.\n\nThe potential for Ethereum to drive innovation and disruption in various industries is significant. Ethereum\u2019s ability to support the development of decentralized applications and smart contracts has opened up new possibilities for industries such as finance, supply chain management, and even social media. However, there are still challenges and limitations facing the adoption and scalability of the Ethereum network. The current gas fees required for transactions on the Ethereum network can be prohibitive, and the scalability of the network needs to be improved to handle the growing number of transactions. Despite these challenges, the potential for Ethereum to drive innovation and disruption in various industries is significant and will continue to be a driving force in the blockchain landscape.\n\nWhat We Learned\n\nEthereum has emerged as a significant player in the blockchain landscape, offering unique features that differentiate it from other blockchain platforms. Ethereum\u2019s ability to support the development of decentralized applications and smart contracts has opened up new possibilities for industries such as finance, supply chain management, and even social media. While there are still challenges and limitations facing the adoption and scalability of the Ethereum network, its potential impact on various industries is significant. Moving forward, it is clear that Ethereum will continue to drive innovation and disruption in various industries, and its popularity will only continue to grow. We encourage readers to explore Ethereum and its possibilities for innovation and disruption, and to consider its potential impact on their industries and businesses."

It dominated the last quarter of 2022 and also in early 2023.\n\nHowever, Arbitrum [ARB] has displaced OP from the top spot following its AirDrop distribution, and upcoming token listing on several exchanges. In turn, the hype that has surrounded the Arbitrum project seems to have triggered reactions to interactions with similar protocols.\n\nIn preparation for the unknown\n\nAccording to Nansen, token swaps and ETH bridges on protocols like zkSync and StarkNet tremendously increased last week.\n\nThese projects are similar in function to both Arbitrum and Optimism. However, StarkNet and zkSync differ from OP and ARB as the former are not Optimism rollups like the latter group.\n\nInstead, StarkNet and zkSync are zero-knowledge (zk) rollups whose aim is to enable any decentralized Application (dApp) to operate at an unlimited scale.\n\nInformation from the blockchain data and research platform showed that about 39,000 addresses bridged $871 million to zkSync within the said period.\n\nThe rise in interaction could be attributed to a possible AirDrop that users might get when they launch a token associated with the projects.\n\nHowever, zkSync has not confirmed that a token would come along with its several upgrades. But it would seem that these addresses are taking no chance if the projects announce a reward.\n\nBuilding the blocks\n\nInterestingly, zkSync has had quite a number of integrations in March. On-chain data services OKLink launched its explorer on the future-proof zk Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM). Also, immersive gaming project Horizon Land collaborated with the project to build a decentralized metaverse platform.\n\nOn the other hand, it seemed that StarkNet will allocate distributed tokens to its users. On 20 March, the StarkNet Foundation tweeted that it was setting up a committee to ensure fair distribution of the ecosystem-powered tokens.\n\nThe Provisions Committee is critical to ensuring the fair, decentralized and transparent distribution of the token that will power the Starknet ecosystem. \u2014 Starknet \u2728? (@Starknet) March 20, 2023\n\nThe project further mentioned that the function of the committee goes beyond AirDrop provision or token launch. In clearing this point, it noted,\n\n\u201cThe Ecosystem Onboarding Committee is responsible for empowering and integrating new developers and community members into the Starknet ecosystem.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, airdrops are no guarantee of the short or long-term performance of assets. Note that other factors like use cases, adoption, and fundamentals also play a role. Although both zkSync and StarkNet seem to have viable use cases, there is no certainty their tokens, if and when launched, might perform like ARB and OP."

The market cap was just below the $1.08 trillion mark a day earlier which prompted the prices of several cryptocurrencies to trade in the red zone.\n\nHowever, a massive rally for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) in 24-hour and weekly trading reversed the downward momentum amidst heavy volatility in the market as it tries to overcome the crisis caused by the closures of Silvergate Capital, Silicon Valley Bank, and Signature Bank in the United States last week.\n\nExpert predictions have indicated that the industry\u2019s market size is to grow annually by roughly 12% to $12 billion by the end of 2030, drawing massive potential for new currencies like Big Eyes Coin (BIG) which has been surging in its presale stage since its launch.\n\nBitcoin \u2013 Within Touching Distance of June 2022 High\n\nBitcoin (BTC) registered a sharp reversal in its price to post a 24-hour high of $26,234.39 after renewed confidence in Wall Street as efforts are being made to contain the US banking crisis. Overall the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency has climbed by 30.52% over the past week and about 57% so far this year and is within touching distance of the highest level since June 2022.\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $26,087.28 with a market capitalization of $504 billion, a 5.81% rise from the previous day while holding a 24-hour trading volume of $39 billion.\n\nEthereum \u2013 Price Surge After Shanghai Hard Fork Target Date News\n\nEthereum\u2019s (ETH) price jumped overnight by 3.64% to a high of $1,726.62 after news broke out that developers have agreed upon a target date for Shanghai hard fork update that will allow staked Ethereum withdrawals. The target date of 12th April has been brewing for some time as the much-anticipated merge was done in September.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum was trading at $1,723.05 with a weekly growth of 22.14% and a market capitalization of $210 billion, a rise of 3.86% from the previous day.\n\nBig Eyes Coin \u2013 Buy BIG, Use Vault PIN \u2018300\u2019 for 300% ROI\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG) is an ERC-20 meme token created on the Ethereum network with a cat-friendly layout that self-propagates using Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), which offers its community access to more content and events.\n\nSince its launch in August last year, the community-owned meme token has been named the most successful presale in recent history. The project is in its 12th stage of presale and has so far raised over $31.7 million in presale tokens and will launch on the market at the end of stage 15 and achieves its target of $50 million in presale tokens.\n\nRegarded as its biggest giveaway yet, Big Eyes Coin has launched the vault PIN \u2018300\u2019. A buyer simply has to use the \u2018300\u2019 PIN when purchasing $100 or more worth of BIG presale tokens or Big Eyes Coin Loot Boxes for a heavy return of 300% more in Big Eyes Coin Loot Boxes.\n\nBig Eyes Coin Loot Boxes offer buyers a 5000% ROI on a BIG purchase; the Saver Tin, Cute Box, Kitty Vault, Super Saiyan Box, and Excali-Paw Master Chest, each box drop carries a maximum ROI of $500, $5000, $25,000, $100,000, and $1,000,000 worth of BIG tokens, respectively.\n\nThe results are always random, and buyers are guaranteed their money back if a loot box does not generate any prize. The loot box drops will happen only during the presale stage and will end when the project goes live.\n\nFind out more about Big Eyes Coin (BIG):\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin is Not Leaving Ethereum - CoinJournal",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s Vitalik Buterin is recognisable in many ways: skinny, dressed in unicorn attire, bed-head, and a serene and faraway smile. Buterin is also the creator and de facto leader of one of the most promising technology networks in the world. Vitalik\u2019s influence stretches well beyond the Ethereum blockchain. His work has informed the entire blockchain space, and he\u2019s been identified as a global thought leader by Forbes and other international media outlets.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to think about Ethereum without considering its famous creator. And that\u2019s why Ethereum fans seem a little panicked when he talks about the possibility of receding from the spotlight. But is Vitalik really leaving Ethereum? And what would happen if he did? Fortunately, we don\u2019t think Ethereum buyers and fans have anything to worry about in this regard. Here\u2019s what Vitalik means when he talks about leadership decentralisation.\n\nVitalik Doesn\u2019t Plan to Leave Ethereum\n\nTo understand what Vitalik is talking about when he references \u201cfading into the background\u201d, you\u2019ve got to understand his vision for decentralisation. To Vitalik Buterin, a blockchain is no better than a traditional corporation if it\u2019s led by a centralised figure. Vitalik isn\u2019t the CEO of Ethereum; he\u2019s just the guy who started it. And sure, he may be more famous than any other person who works on Ethereum, but this doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s inherently the most important.\n\nAt various times in his career, Vitalik has made it clear that he\u2019s not the best coder in Ethereum. He\u2019s not the most competent engineer. He doesn\u2019t have the best ideas or the most original innovations. He\u2019s hired people with this expertise over the past couple of years, and many of these are doing the most important technical work on the platform.\n\nEthereum has also been putting more and more of its daily tasks into the virtual hands of algorithms and smart contracts. Many aspects of Ethereum run themselves. If Vitalik disappeared tomorrow, these autonomous wings of the network would continue without his daily influence.\n\nButerin recognises that to be successful for years and decades, Ethereum must be able to survive and thrive without his direct oversight. He also knows where his expertise lies, and where to rely on the skills of others. For this reason, he\u2019s allowing himself to fade into the background, rather than feed a cult of personality that won\u2019t be good for the long-term health of his beloved platform.\n\nIn his own words from Twitter, \u201cI am not leaving. No plans to stop or reduce blog posts/ethresearch posts/Github commits.\u201d These tasks have been the most important that he has ever committed to the protocol, and these he will continue even if he doesn\u2019t pursue the media\u2019s attention like he did a couple of years ago. This is a good thing for Ethereum, and for the leader that the Ethereum community has grown to trust so deeply.\n\nFeatured image source: Flickr"

        "content": "Ethereum Classic\u2019s hashrate dropped to its lowest level this year.\n\nDay traders remained bullish as they intensified accumulation.\n\nAt 106.59TH/s, Ethereum Classic\u2019s [ETC] hashrate has hit its lowest point so far this year, data from 2miners.com revealed. Moreover, the chain\u2019s network difficulty at 1.45P also declined to its lowest value since the year began.\n\nRead Ethereum Classic\u2019s [ETC] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nA network\u2019s hashrate refers to the computing power used by miners to validate transactions and secure the network. On the other hand, network difficulty is a measure of how hard it is to find a block on the blockchain. As more miners join the network and the hashrate increases, the difficulty also increases to maintain a consistent block time.\n\nWhen a blockchain\u2019s hashrate and network difficulty continue to drop, it suggests that the network is becoming less secure and potentially more vulnerable to attacks. It could also indicate a lack of interest or profitability for miners to continue mining the blockchain.\n\nThis might be the case for the ETC network, as data from Messari revealed stagnancy in miners\u2019 revenue from fees paid to process transactions on the blockchain. On a year-to-date basis (YTD), this has oscillated between 0.02% and 0.03%. It rallied to a high of 0.16% on 13 March but declined soon afterward. At press time, this was a mere 0.015%.\n\nETC holders to see gains?\n\nAt press time, ETC traded at $20.61. Moreover, increased buying was spotted during a 12-hour window period. ETC\u2019s price traded close to the upper band of the Bollinger Band indicator, suggesting that day traders have increasingly accumulated the alt.\n\nFurther, the asset\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) was 56.99, while its Money Flow Index (MFI) rested at 57.92 When both the RSI and MFI indicators of an asset are up, it suggests strong buying pressure in the market, which can drive higher prices.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETC Profit Calculator\n\nETC\u2019s On-balance volume was also spotted in an uptrend, sitting at 273.532 million at press time. An increasing OBV suggests that the asset volume is increasing over time, indicating that buyers are more active in the market than sellers.\n\nThe Directional Movement Index (DMI) confirmed increased buyers\u2019 presence. At press time, the buyers\u2019 strength (green) at 28.20 was solidly above the sellers\u2019 (red) at 15.97. The Average Directional Index (ADX) showed that the buyers\u2019 strength was a rock hard one that sellers might find impossible to revoke in the short term."

        "content": "Big Eyes Coin (BIG), is an irresistibly cute \u201cCat\u201d themed cryptocurrency, drawing much attention within the crypto industry after having raised over 31 million$ upon its presale launch. Feature packed with many attractive perks like the ability to yield big profits within a short time, Big Eyes Coin (BIG) belongs to the meme coins family and is expected to surpass its competitive counterparts like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) in the near future.\n\nThis article explores the technology and mechanism behind this cryptocurrency alongside scalability and stateful nature to ascertain whether Big Eyes Coin (BIG) is more aligned with Ethereum cryptocurrency or Solana cryptocurrency.\n\nWhat are the Major Differences Between Ethereum Cryptocurrency and Solana Cryptocurrency?\n\nPossibly the biggest difference between the two blockchain technologies would be the fact that Ethereum 1.0 relies on a Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism similar to Bitcoin, whilst Solana\n\nCryptocurrency uses an underlying consensus mechanism known as Proof-of-History (PoH), which takes a series of computing procedures to cryptographically determine the time interval between two events.\n\nAnother major feature that makes Ethereum different from Solana is its \u201cstateful\u201d nature which records all transactions on the network. This implies that each node in the network must update its copy of the network whenever a new transaction takes place to reflect the new transaction. Solana, meanwhile, has a \u2018stateless\u2019 architecture and reduces the overall memory consumption, leading to increased performance. Solana\u2019s ability to process a block every 400 millisecond is one of its strong selling points. This means Solana is able to process more than 50K transactions per second (TPS). However, Ethereum is currently progressing to Ethereum 2.0, which is capable of processing over 100K TPS.\n\nEthereum\u2019s scalability is a significant concern for the landscape and worsens in times of high market activity. However, Ethereum is the gold standard of the blockchain landscape, and quite a number of decentralized apps and other blockchain solutions are built in and around the chain.\n\nIn essence, Ethereum offers a more mature and decentralized network, while Solana offers high-speed and low-cost transactions.\n\nConcluding Thoughts About Where Big Eyes Coin (BIG) Fits In?\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG) operates on the Ethereum blockchain and uses the ERC-20 standard for its cryptocurrency exchanges, hoping to capitalize on the network\u2019s resources. Ethereum blockchain has the largest DeFi market, which translates to active users, which in turn makes sense for a cryptocurrency like Big Eyes Coin (BIG) to launch on a network where active users are, to allow the liquidity to help give life to the meme coin project.\n\nThe presale of Big Eyes Coin (BIG) began in the third quarter of 2022, and it has already managed to raise over 31 million $, with over a million dollars worth of BIG tokens sold in the first week of the presale alone.\n\nTo see more information or to buy Big Eyes Coin (BIG), check out the links below.\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

The game has yielded an annual convention in Iceland, an array of spinoff games, and even books documenting historical in-game battles between its contentious rival crews.\n\nWhile this is CCP\u2019s first move into Web3 gaming, P\u00e9tursson has long been interested in the potential for blockchain to revolutionize concepts like user ownership and open economies in the gaming world.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut he\u2019s been realistic about it.\n\nIn 2020, P\u00e9tursson told Decrypt that he thought the addressable market for blockchain games was too small at the time for CCP to make any moves. He also noted the complexities around handling crypto, and said that it could be five to 10 years before a blockchain game had the potential to be a true \u201ckiller app.\u201d\n\n\"I'm not sure necessarily that it will be a tipping point,\u201d he said in 2020. \u201cBut you could foresee a time where there's a killer app, where you just really have to get involved regardless of whether you need to figure something out, and that pulls in a wave of people and kind of starts an avalanche.\"\n\nCCP Games isn\u2019t the only major traditional game maker to enter the Web3 world.\n\nAssassin\u2019s Creed publisher Ubisoft has been experimenting and investing in the space for years, for example, while Final Fantasy creator Square Enix is actively developing NFT games\u2014such as the upcoming Symbiogenesis on Ethereum scaling network, Polygon."

        "content": "Undoubtedly, cryptocurrencies represent some of the most innovative uses of digital technology in the 21st century. Crypto tokens allow users to do more than they can with traditional financial institutions. These tokens have also created a thriving ecosystem where different assets are traded against one another \u2013 called the coin or crypto market. You can make plenty of money from this market by gauging price differences and movement. The only downside to this ecosystem is that price changes could be rapid and detrimental.\n\nTo enjoy the best of the coin market, you need to make well-calculated purchase decisions. You should only invest in high-potential crypto tokens with strong utility and infrastructure. But what are they? This piece will introduce you to unique crypto tokens and reveal how these projects will benefit you.\n\nDogetti\u2019s Battle to Get to the Top of The Meme Sector\n\nFor a long time, the coin market has been dominated by dog-themed meme coins. These coins, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have dominated news headlines in the meme sector. And it\u2019s almost as if there would be no worthy replacement. Dogetti(DETI) is set to change this stereotype.\n\nAccording to its whitepaper, Dogetti is a revolutionary meme coin that wants to create a close-knit community of users. It will refer to this community as a family to indicate their commitment to the growth of the project. They understand the importance of an active community to the long-term growth of a crypto token. And that\u2019s why they wish to create an ecosystem where holders can communicate, contribute and share ideas to reward. Dogetti will encourage involvement from its users through its DAO. This DAO will keep holders in the driving seat, unlike other meme coins.\n\nThe main selling point of Dogetti is the project\u2019s commitment to rewarding its users. It uses a 2% reflection model. This model ensures that 2% is deducted from all transactions. This will serve as the main source of income for those who have opted to join this project. There\u2019s a sharing fee for all deductions from the platform. So, you can rest assured the money will go to the right place. It\u2019s clear that the Dogetti team business. They have created a detailed outline of their token\u2019s roadmap.\n\nDETI is the token that powers this ecosystem. Finally, there\u2019s a maximum token supply of 100 billion DETI. This figure is considerably less than other meme coins.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Ability to Host Decentralized Applications\n\nWhen Vitalik Buterin launched Ethereum, no one could predict that it would become the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world. But Ethereum\u2019s success has been due to the innovativeness it introduced to the coin market. Ethereum was the project that showed coin market developers the true meaning of decentralization.\n\nEthereum serves as a cryptocurrency and blockchain. It can use its blockchain to host other decentralized applications, games, and crypto projects. Through the reliance on smart contracts, new projects increased exponentially on Ethereum. But this blockchain\u2019s main utility turned out to be its major problem. As more projects were added to Ethereum, it didn\u2019t take long before the project became slower and more expensive.\n\nEthereum\u2019s development team is working on several solutions to restore the project to what it used to be. They will use layer-2 networks to boost the project\u2019s network.\n\nAvalanche\u2019s Capacity to Replace Ethereum\n\nAvalanche is one of the latest projects on the coin market. It belongs to a special category of crypto tokens developed to replace Ethereum. Avalanche can host decentralized applications on its smart contracts. However, Avalanche can handle its processes faster than Ethereum.\n\nBecause of Avalanche\u2019s speed, many prefer hosting their project on this blockchain. More and more projects have gradually been added to this network. This network also supports scalability, making it attractive to different types of investors.\n\nIf you wish to jump on the Dogetti band, use the links below;\n\nPresale: https://dogetti.io/how-to-buy\n\nWebsite: https://dogetti.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/Dogetti\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_Dogetti_\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Ethereum worth more than Turkish lira and Norwegian krone - CoinJournal",
        "content": "A little over two weeks ago, I wrote about the value of ETH versus fiat money, with an emphasis on the Russian ruble. ETH is up 35% during this period, so a good time to look back.\n\nEthereum in 27th place\n\nAs can be seen from Coinmarketcap's data, Ethereum is ranked number 27 by market value. This is 13 spots below bitcoin, which has not moved a single spot in the same time period. Ethereum is four spots higher than two weeks ago.\n\nEthereum is under the Polish zloty, which is still number 26. But ETH has gained territory against the Chilean peso, the Norwegian krone and the Turkish lira. These fiat currencies are now worth less than Ethereum, and that is a big win.\n\nRussian ruble is crawling back up\n\nIn total, there are 101 currencies on Coinmarketcap's list, with Bitcoin being the highest ranking crypto in the list at number 14, below the Swiss franc, but above the Thai baht. The comeback of the Russian ruble is however striking.\n\nTwo weeks ago, this coin was still in place 25. That is eleven places difference with bitcoin. Ethereum came pretty close at the time by six spots, but since then the ruble has risen in market value. Right now, the ruble is back on the heels of bitcoin, with only two spots in between.\n\nMarket cap back above 2 trillion\n\nEthereum, like Bitcoin, is on the rise again. The crypto market was booming last night, with Ethereum up 7% from the day before. The market seems to be slowly turning bullish again as fiat currencies are depreciating against BTC and ETH.\n\nThe market is thriving as the total market capitalization recaptures two trillion dollars (1.82 trillion euros). For the people who don't see this for themselves; a trillion is a number with twelve zeros. Of this, about 900 billion dollars (681 billion pounds) is bitcoin and about 400 billion dollars (302 billion pounds) Ethereum."

        "content": "Shiba Inu may be a meme, but where it comes to wealth, it ain\u2019t no joke! Data from WhaleStats shows that out of the top 100 Ethereum Whales, SHIB is the most popular of all altcoins, accounting for over 1/5th of all the (non ETH) crypto held by these ETH whales. Orbeon Protocol is an up and coming crowdfunding and community VC project, whose token is up by over 20x since last November, and is still in presale.\n\n>>BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE<<\n\nShiba Inu swims with the Whales\n\nThe ocean has been full of Shiba Inus this week (not literally thank goodness!), as a few days ago, a huge ETH and SHIB whale purchased 118,058,494,947 SHIB, worth $1.34 million. That might seem a lot but to for crypto behemoth it merely seems to be \u2018buying the dip\u2019, since they already hold a staggering $214 million worth of SHIB.\n\n>>BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE<<\n\nThe Story of Shiba Inu\n\nSHIB started as a small project on the Ethereum blockchain, with anonymous developers, capitalizing on the crypto and internet\u2019s love of Shiba Inu dogs and Dogecoin. At first many thought it was merely a joke, but things began to change for the crypto after anonymous developer \u2018Ryoshi\u2019 sent 50% of the supply to Ethereum\u2019s creator Vitalik Buterin. Buterin promptly sent 10% to a covid relief fund for India and burnt the rest, pumping the price and ensuring that he didn\u2019t have further power to move the markets, something he said he didn\u2019t want.\n\nThe team kept developing, and built an initially criticized dex and DeFi platform \u2018ShibaSwap\u2019. With time, though, the team got the bugs fixed and the Shiba Inu project became more decentralized, with various community projects, dapps and games being developed for the ecoystem.\n\nElon Musk famously has a pet Shiba Inu and takes pleasure in tweeting things that often send both SHIB and DOGE, if not to the moon, at least pumping to the clouds.\n\n>>BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE<<\n\nThe Shibarium finally arrives\n\nThe long awaited news for SHIB holders, is the release of the Shibarium, a totally functional layer 2 blockchain, which has just gone live on beta mode on the Goerli and Puppynet test networks, (at time of writing I was unable to connect using Puppynet but Goerli was working). Similarly, the beta of the Orbeon Protocol staking dashboard has just gone live on Goerli.\n\nCurrently, in beta, the Shibarium mainly has robot looking dogs and forms to work or collaborate with them, though it does have what seems to be staking dashboards.. They are apparently recruiting people for web3 AND web4 now. Hope they let us know what that means.\n\nRyoshi reminded people that this is just a testnet, nothing on there has any real world value and therefore, not to fall prey to any scams.\n\n>>BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE<<\n\nOrbeon Protocol to be the next big thing\n\nIt takes time to become a top 50 altcoin, and Orbeon Protocol, still in presale, has a long way to go. However if SHIB can capture the hearts of the people, then Orbeon Protocol can capture the budding venture capitalists of the people. Orbeon Protocol allows small and medium sized businesses to access a new way of funding, by using fractionalised NFTs and enabling the ordinary investor to get involved, no matter where from, who they are, or how much money they have.\n\nIn general, if you want to get in on really great investing deals, you need to be early. Even if SHIB increases dramatically in price, it still can\u2019t go that high, due to its already high market cap. ORBN on the other hand, is still in presale, so those getting involved now are still very early. Experts predict that ORBN, now worth $0.0877 could reach $0.24, which is 173% gain for those getting in today.\n\nFind Out More About the Orbeon Protocol Presale:\n\nWebsite: https://orbeonprotocol.com/\n\nPresale: https://presale.orbeonprotocol.com/register\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Top 10 Cryptocurrencies with Their High Transaction Speeds in 2023 - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Top 10 cryptocurrencies with high transaction speeds in 2023 are enlisted and detailed below\n\nIf you are a crypto enthusiast, you might be curious as to which cryptocurrencies have the fastest or fastest transaction speeds. You won\u2019t need to look any further because the information you require is right here. This article will focus on the top cryptocurrencies with the fastest transaction speeds and delve deeply into the world of Blockchain transaction speed. In addition, we will investigate the reason why speed is so important in the cryptocurrency industry. In this segment, we should investigate a portion of the highest-level 10 cryptocurrencies in 2023 with their high exchange speeds.\n\nThere are several cryptocurrencies, but bitcoin is the most well-known and costly one. However, bitcoin\u2019s transaction speed is rather sluggish. Due to their high transaction speeds, some cryptocurrencies are regarded as the most efficient.\n\nIn 2023, these are the top 10 cryptocurrencies with high transaction speeds.\n\nRipple (XRP): Ripple (XRP) is a digital payment protocol that facilitates low-cost, near-instantaneous international transactions. Ripple\u2019s rapid transaction speed is one of its key characteristics. The XRP Ledger settles transactions in 3-5 seconds, as stated on the Ripple website. Compared to other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which can take several minutes or even hours to process transactions, this is significantly quicker.\n\nEOS: EOS is a 2018-launched Blockchain platform. It is intended to give a quick and versatile framework for decentralized applications (dApps). Transaction speed is one of EOS\u2019s most important features. The maximum transaction speed of EOS is approximately 4,000 TPS. One of the most scalable Blockchain platforms currently available, the EOS Blockchain can process up to thousands of transactions per second (TPS).\n\nNEO: NEO is a Blockchain platform that first debuted in 2014 under the name Antshares before changing its name to NEO in 2017. Transaction speed is one of NEO\u2019s most important features. As indicated by the Bitdegree article you gave, NEO has an exchange speed of around 15 exchanges each second (TPS). Even though this is significantly faster than Bitcoin\u2019s transaction speed, it is still significantly slower than EOS and Ripple, and other Blockchain platforms.\n\nCardano (ADA): Cardano (ADA)\u2019s transaction speed is one of its most important features. Cardano can process more than 1,000 transactions per second (TPS), which is comparable to other high-speed Blockchain platforms like EOS and is significantly faster than Bitcoin\u2019s transaction speed.\n\nSolana (SOL): One of the most widely used payment processors, Solana (SOL), can process up to 24,000 transactions per second, while Ethereum, one of the largest Blockchain networks, can process approximately 15 transactions per second. Solana (SOL) Solana is a Blockchain platform that was launched in March 2020 to resolve the scalability issues faced by other Blockchain networks.\n\nSteller (XML): Steller (XML) According to Stellar\u2019s official website, the Stellar Core software enables the platform to process up to 1,000 transactions per second. Compared to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and a few other well-known Blockchain platforms, this speed is significantly higher.\n\nTron (TRX): TRON professes to have an exchange speed of roughly 2,000 exchanges each second (TPS). Utilizing delegated proof-of-stake, a network with high bandwidth, and a quick block time of just three seconds are some of the optimizations that contribute to this high speed.\n\nCosmos (ATOM): Cosmos (ATOM) Cosmos boasts high transaction speeds, with a Tendermint consensus algorithm throughput of up to 10,000 transactions per second (TPS). However, the application and network congestion may affect the actual transaction speed.\n\nEthereum (ETH): Ethereum (ETH) The most recent version of Ethereum, known as Ethereum 1.0, can process approximately 15 transactions per second (TPS) of transactions. Ethereum has been working on Ethereum 2.0, or Eth2, a significant upgrade. The current proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism will be replaced by a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism as part of this upgrade. It is anticipated that this change will significantly boost the network\u2019s transaction speed, with estimates indicating that Ethereum 2.0 could eventually process up to 100,000 TPS.\n\nWaves: Waves is a Blockchain platform for creating custom digital assets and developing decentralized applications (dApps). Up to 6,000 transactions per minute, or about 100 transactions per second, can be processed by the platform (TPS). This is made conceivable through the execution of Waves-NG, which utilizes a unique block size and focuses on exchanges in light of their expense rate.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Ethereum Fee Remains Low Despite Price Rise: What It Means - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "On-chain data shows the Ethereum transaction fee has remained low despite the recent price rise. Here\u2019s what this may mean for the market.\n\nEthereum Fees Saw Huge Spike During The Local Bottom\n\nAs per data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the ETH transaction fee has fallen below $2 per transfer now. The relevant indicator here is the \u201caverage fees,\u201d which measures the total amount of fees (in USD) that investors have to attach to their Ethereum transaction in order for it to go through on the blockchain.\n\nThe value of this metric can fluctuate depending on the traffic that the network is receiving. Generally, when there are a large number of transfers happening at once, transactions may take more time to be executed. So, those that want their transfers to go through quickly during such times of congestion simply attach a higher fee with their transactions to make sure that they are prioritized by the network.\n\nOn the other hand, when there aren\u2019t many users making moves on the chain, the average fees can plummet since there aren\u2019t many investors competing against each other to get their transactions done quicker anymore.\n\nBecause of this relationship, the average fees indicator can provide insight into whether the Ethereum network is seeing a high amount of activity or not at the moment.\n\nNow, here is a chart that shows the trend in the ETH average fees over the last few months:\n\nLooks like the value of the metric has observed some decline in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant\n\nAs displayed in the above graph, the Ethereum average fees had seen some pretty high values earlier in the month when the ETH price had plunged and hit a local bottom.\n\nDuring this spike, the indicator had reached a peak of about $8.12, suggesting that holders were active back then. This high network traffic naturally came in part from those who were applying selling pressure on the coin, thus the decline in the price.\n\nHowever, that wasn\u2019t all. The high fees would have also been a result of the buyers rushing in to buy the cryptocurrency at the low prices, hence why the asset\u2019s value sharply shot up not too long after.\n\nEthereum has continued this fresh price surge recently, with the asset even managing to break above $1,800 briefly during the weekend, a level that the coin hadn\u2019t previously reached since August 2022.\n\nAs this rise in the value of Ethereum has occurred, however, the average fees have only trended down. Now, the indicator\u2019s value has dropped to just $1.75, implying that the network isn\u2019t too hot right now despite the rally.\n\nSantiment thinks that this could be a good sign for ETH as it means the price wouldn\u2019t encounter any notable transaction barriers currently, something that could help open the door to $2,000 for the asset.\n\nETH Price\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $1,780, up 12% in the last week.\n\nETH seems to have shot up recently | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from DrawKit Illustrations on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, Santiment.net"

        "title": "Ethereum: increase the staking crypto on Lido - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "Very positive crypto news for the blockchain industry: the market capitalization of Lido\u2019s staked Ether has increased to $10.3 billion, with the cryptocurrency posting significant gains over the past week and Ethereum\u2019s price up 11.9%.\n\nThis recent increase has pushed the token\u2019s overall market valuation to the eighth position, according to Coingecko data.\n\nSome data regarding the crypto market: staking of Ethereum on Lido grows\n\nAs anticipated, the value of liquid staking tokens associated with Ethereum (ETH) increased significantly over the past week after Ether\u2019s 11.9% gains against the US dollar.\n\nNotably, Lido\u2019s staked Ethereum token, STETH, now has a market capitalization above the $10 billion range, reaching $10.36 billion on Monday 20 March 2023.\n\nAccording to Coingecko\u2019s statistics, STETH\u2019s market valuation now ranks eighth, with Dogecoin\u2018s (DOGE) market capitalization ranking tenth. Above STETH is the market valuation of Polygon (MATIC) at $10.42 billion.\n\nCurrently, there is a circulating supply of about 5.8 million STETH and in the last 24 hours the token has registered global exchanges of $22.35 million. The most active exchanges dealing with STETH are Bybit, Gate.io, and Huobi.\n\nSTETH has gained 12.4% this week and 4.6% in the past 30 days. Currently, the Lido Finance website estimates that STETH stakers are receiving an annual percentage rate (APR) of about 5.9% by staking the token.\n\nDefiLlama\u2019s statistics\n\nAt the moment, Lido is the largest decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol of the $49.01 billion total value locked (TVL) on Monday. Lido\u2019s TVL accounts for 21.59% of the entire amount of value locked in DeFi.\n\nIn the past seven days, DefiLlama\u2019s statistics show that the Lido\u2019s TVL has increased by 8.9% and in 30 days it has increased by 17.07%. DefiLlama explains that as of Monday, 7.83 million ETH worth $13.98 billion are staked in liquid staking protocols.\n\nLido\u2019s STETH accounts for 74.51% of the aggregate. Coinbase\u2019s Wrapped Ether token protocol has a total blocked value of $2.1 billion, or 1.16 million Ethereum. It is the second largest liquid staking project in terms of TVL.\n\nWhile STETH is shown on Coingecko as the eighth largest coin by market capitalization, this is not the case for other cryptocurrency market aggregation websites such as CoinMarketCap.\n\nSince it is a synthetic version of Ether, some cryptocurrency market aggregation sites do not include STETH in the top ten, despite its capitalization.\n\nLido and the $30 million in Ethereum: selling or staking?\n\nThe Decentralized Autonomous Organization behind Lido, Ethereum\u2019s largest staking pool, is considering whether to sell or stake the $30 million in Ether (ETH) from its treasury.\n\nA proposal was submitted on 14 February by DAO\u2019s financial unit, Steakhouse Financial: four possible choices, one of which contemplates staking some or all of its ETH on Lido in the form of Lido Staked ETH (stETH).\n\nAnother choice would see LidoDAO selling some or all of its 20,304 ETH in exchange for stablecoins. Thanks to the Shanghai and Capella upgrades, both scheduled for the first half of the year, users will soon be able to withdraw their staked ETH.\n\nAlthough the conversion of ETH to Staked ETH could lead to higher profits in the long run, Steakhouse Financial is concerned that locking too much of the funds within the smart contract could cause the risk of not having enough ETH on hand when needed.\n\nSteakhouse Financial stated that it may be necessary to exchange Ether for a stablecoin to ensure greater liquidity should operating expenses increase.\n\nSteakhouse Financial also revealed that LidoDAO currently boasts an inflow of about 1,000 stETH per month. In other words, DAO earns between $1.3 million and $1.5 million per month, with the price of ETH fluctuating between $1,100 and $1,700.\n\nHowever, Steakhouse Financial is considering whether it is worth converting excess stETH into stablecoins so that it can more calmly deal with potential changes in market conditions that could cause an increase in operating expenses.\n\nAt the moment, it appears that most LidoDAO members favor the partial sale and staking of a slice of the 20,304 ETH currently stuck in its Aragon smart contract."

        "title": "Microsoft may integrate an Ethereum wallet into its browser - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "A few days ago, screenshots surfaced on Twitter that appear to refer to an Ethereum wallet for Edge, Microsoft browser.\n\nNewest in the gauntlet of questionable upcoming Microsoft Edge features, a crypto wallet \ud83d\udcb8\n\nNot really sure how to feel about this kind of thing being baked into the default browser, what are your thoughts?\n\nMore screenshots of the UI in the next tweet \u27a1\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/GAUPiZGLIY \u2014 Albacore (@thebookisclosed) March 17, 2023\n\nIt appears from the screenshots that this is supposed to be a non-custodial Ethereum wallet, but for now there is no official confirmation.\n\nThe speculation is that the company is testing this new feature, namely the possible integration of an Ethereum wallet within its Edge browser.\n\nIs Microsoft Edge about to integrate an Ethereum wallet?\n\nEdge is Microsoft browser that replaced the historic Internet Explorer as of 2015.\n\nIndeed, Internet Explorer, born in the very distant 1995, was finally abandoned this year, overtaken by more advanced alternatives such as Google\u2019s Chrome, Apple\u2019s Safari, or Mozilla\u2019s Firefox.\n\nAs of today, with Internet Explorer still being used by 0.25% of web users, Edge has surpassed 4%, so it is among the little-used browsers although it is more widely used than Firefox. But Safari stands out with 19% and especially Chrome with almost 66%.\n\nMoreover, lately these percentages appear to be fairly stable, so much so that the use of Microsoft browser does not appear to be increasing significantly in recent times.\n\nAt one time, Internet Explorer dominated, and a decade or so ago it was still used by more than 30% of web users.\n\nThus it has been a real decline for Microsoft, from a dominant position to a totally marginal one in the space of some twenty years, with the new Edge failing to even remotely take the place of the old Explorer.\n\nHowever, it is worth pointing out that there has been a boom in smartphone browsing over the past two decades, and with Google\u2019s Android and Apple\u2019s iOS dominating the smartphone world, it is more than logical that the respective browsers have also taken over.\n\nIt is therefore not surprising that Microsoft is trying to evolve its new browser, for example by doing something that neither Chrome nor Safari have already done natively: integrate a crypto wallet.\n\nThe other browsers compared\n\nThere are actually two other browsers, Opera and Brave, that have already integrated a crypto wallet natively, but they are used very little, less than Edge.\n\nIn addition, there are third-party crypto wallets that can be easily integrated into Chrome, such as MetaMask, so Microsoft\u2019s is not much of a novelty.\n\nTherefore, this is not an attempt to challenge other browsers on the cryptocurrency terrain, but probably just an attempt to keep Edge up-to-date with new technologies.\n\nCrypto and Ethereum ecosystem: the importance of Microsoft initiative\n\nDespite the fact that there is still no official confirmation that Microsoft is really integrating an Ethereum wallet on Edge, the fact that it apparently stands the concrete technical feasibility may be something important.\n\nAccording to screenshots posted on Twitter, the initiative would be related to Web3 and NFTs, and not so much to cryptocurrencies, and this actually could make sense.\n\nA company like Microsoft has already approached the world of NFTs years ago, and since it is very much in the gaming business, it inevitably has to deal with these new technologies.\n\nAn eventual integration of an Ethereum wallet into Edge could have positive repercussions for the crypto markets.\n\nIn fact, it would be for all intents and purposes a kind of endorsement of the US giant toward the entire crypto sector, and not just the NFT sector.\n\nIn fact, it is worth mentioning that to send NFTs on Ethereum one has to pay fees in ETH, so if that wallet is integrated it will inevitably lead to an increase in cryptocurrency usage.\n\nMoreover, it also appears from the published screenshots that the wallet integrated into Microsoft Edge would also in turn have integration with Coinbase to enable cryptocurrency buying and selling and swaps.\n\nWhile the actual use of this wallet might be marginal, given the low usage of Edge in the world, it could, nonetheless, lead the way for possible similar initiatives by Google and Apple.\n\nIt is worth not forgetting that with Xbox, Microsoft is one of the world leaders in online gaming, so an eventual integration with one of its crypto wallets within the browser could easily convince Google to do the same with Chrome.\n\nGoogle has also been in this industry for some time, and should crypto wallets integrated into the browser be successful, it is to be expected that some initiative of its own in this regard will be forthcoming.\n\nBrowser-integrated crypto wallets\n\nBrowser-integrated crypto wallets have a huge advantage: they allow direct and immediate interaction with websites.\n\nFor example, they allow in-browser crypto payments, but also logins without passwords or digital signatures.\n\nThe more widespread the use of cryptocurrencies and NFTs becomes, the more users will feel the need to have a crypto wallet integrated within the browser.\n\nThen again, the resounding success of MetaMask, which was born only in 2016, shows how much need there already is for such technology. It is enough to mention that by the end of 2021 MetaMask already had more than 21 million monthly active users.\n\nConsidering that a crypto wallet can be a profit-making service, especially through fees or spreads on trades and swaps, it is hard to imagine that Google and Apple will pass up this opportunity.\n\nEspecially should Microsoft seize the opportunity, not least because no one prohibits Microsoft from creating its own Chrome extension that integrates its crypto wallet within Google\u2019s browser.\n\nMicrosoft other integrations\n\nRecently, another major integration made by Microsoft has caused a lot of buzz.\n\nAfter buying the company behind ChatGPT, Microsoft integrated the now-famous AI-based chat within its Bing search engine.\n\nNowadays the search engine market is dominated by Google, with 93% of searches, but in second place is Bing itself with just under 3%.\n\nThe integration of ChatGPT has brought a lot of interest in Bing, although so far it does not seem to have succeeded at all in undermining the almost absolute dominance of Google.\n\nNonetheless, this shows that Microsoft has by no means given up on competing with Google, and Apple, although so far none of its initiatives have produced big results in this respect. In terms of browsers and search engines Microsoft is still clearly behind Apple, but especially Google.\n\nIt could move forward with cryptocurrencies and NFTs thanks to a native Ethereum wallet that its two main competitors do not have.\n\nMoreover, theoretically speaking, the native crypto wallet could also turn a profit, so Microsoft could benefit twofold.\n\nIt is worth noting that in the stock market Microsoft still capitalizes more than Alphabet (formerly Google), and slightly less than Apple.\n\nIndeed, the company is still a leader not only in gaming, but also in office software (thanks to Microsoft Office, which is now pay-for-use), and in some industrial and professional areas, such as with its Azure cloud.\n\nIt is still a real giant with very few equals, even though it has long since lost its leadership in the web sector. Thus a public endorsement of Ethereum by it might be of significant importance to this network.\n\nEthereum Merge, common creative license"

        "title": "How is ERC-721 Used to Create Unique Digital Assets on the Ethereum Blockchain? - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "Welcome to the world of non-fungible tokens, where digital assets are as unique as your fingerprints, and ownership is forever engrained on the blockchain. ERC-721 is a groundbreaking standard on the Ethereum blockchain that has paved the way for the creation and exchange of non-fungible tokens, also known as NFTs.\n\nWhat makes ERC-721 different from other token standards on the blockchain? This is a stark contrast to fungible tokens like ERC-20s, which are interchangeable with one another. This article aims to tell you everything you need to know about ERC-721.\n\nWhat is ERC-721?\n\nERC-721 is a technical standard on the Ethereum blockchain that defines the rules for creating and exchanging non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Unlike fungible tokens like ERC-20s, each ERC-721 token is unique and represents a specific asset, whether it be a piece of artwork, a collectible, or even a virtual plot of land.\n\nSo, how does ERC-721 differ from other NFT standards on the blockchain? One key difference lies in its simplicity. ERC-721 is a straightforward and easy-to-understand standard that allows developers to create and exchange NFTs with ease. This has led to the widespread adoption of ERC-721 in the blockchain industry and beyond.\n\nAnother important feature of ERC-721 is its flexibility. Users can use ERC-721 to create truly unique assets that cannot be replicated or duplicated, unlike other NFT standards like ERC-1155. This has opened up a whole new world of possibilities for digital asset creation and ownership, with countless use cases across industries.\n\nERC-721\u2019s technical specifications are based on the Ethereum blockchain and implemented through smart contracts. Each ERC-721 token is stored on the blockchain and is associated with a specific owner, making it impossible to counterfeit or manipulate. The lifecycle of an ERC-721 token includes minting, transferring, and burning, all of which are governed by the smart contract rules defined in the ERC-721 standard.\n\nERC-721 was first proposed in 2017 by a developer named Dieter Shirley. The proposal outlined a new standard for creating and exchanging non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain. Unlike fungible tokens like ERC-20, each ERC-721 token is unique and represents a specific asset, whether it be a piece of artwork, a collectible, or even a virtual plot of land.\n\nThe Ethereum community officially adopted the ERC-721 standard in March 2018, after undergoing a rigorous review process. The blockchain community quickly embraced the standard, with developers using ERC-721 to create a wide range of unique digital assets, from virtual cats and monsters to rare digital artwork and virtual real estate.\n\nOne of the most notable early adopters of ERC-721 was the popular blockchain game CryptoKitties, which allowed players to buy, sell, and breed virtual cats using ERC-721 tokens. The game quickly became a sensation, with players spending millions of dollars on rare virtual cats and driving up the price of some of the game\u2019s most valuable assets.\n\nCountless applications have used ERC-721 since then, from virtual real estate and collectibles to ticketing and even identity verification. Its unique properties and flexibility have made it a powerful tool for creating and exchanging unique digital assets on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nHow Does ERC-721 Work?\n\nSmart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain create and manage ERC-721 tokens. These smart contracts established the rules for minting, transferring, and burning ERC-721 tokens, ensuring that each token is unique and non-fungible.\n\nMinting an ERC-721 token begins with a smart contract that defines the parameters of the token, such as its name, symbol, and metadata. By interacting with the smart contract through a user interface like a web application or mobile wallet, the creator can deploy the smart contract on the blockchain and mint new tokens.\n\nWhen one user transfers a token to another, the smart contract updates the ownership record on the blockchain. When one user transfers a token to another, the smart contract updates the ownership record on the blockchain, ensuring that the new owner is now the rightful owner of the token. This process is completely transparent and auditable, making it impossible to manipulate or counterfeit ERC-721 tokens.\n\nBurning ERC-721 tokens is another important function of the ERC-721 standard. When they burn a token, they reduce the total supply of that asset by permanently removing it from circulation. This can be useful for creating scarcity and increasing the value of certain assets, such as limited edition collectibles or rare digital artworks.\n\nUse Cases for ERC-721 Tokens\n\nThe potential uses for ERC-721 tokens are virtually limitless, with applications across a wide range of industries. Some of the most popular and innovative use cases for ERC-721 tokens include gaming, collectibles, real estate, ticketing, and even identity verification.\n\nIn the gaming industry, ERC-721 tokens have revolutionized the way we think about in-game assets. Instead of simply buying or earning in-game items, players can now truly own and trade unique assets that are verifiable and secure on the blockchain. This has opened up new opportunities for gaming companies to create rare and valuable in-game items, while also providing a more engaging and immersive experience for players.\n\nCollectibles are another popular use case for ERC-721 tokens. Whether it\u2019s rare digital artwork, limited edition sports cards, or even virtual pets, ERC-721 tokens provide a secure and transparent way for collectors to own and trade unique assets. This has led to the emergence of new marketplaces for digital collectibles, such as OpenSea and Rarible, that are powered by the ERC-721 standard.\n\nIn the realm of real estate, ERC-721 tokens can represent unique properties or plots of land in a decentralized world. This has the potential to revolutionize the way we think about property ownership and management, with the possibility of creating new marketplaces for virtual real estate that are powered by blockchain technology.\n\nTicketing is another industry that stands to benefit from the use of ERC-721 tokens. By issuing tickets as ERC-721 tokens, event organizers can prevent fraud and scalping, while also providing a more streamlined and secure process for attendees. This has the potential to reduce costs and increase efficiency for event organizers, while also creating a better experience for attendees.\n\nWe can use ERC-721 tokens to revolutionize the way we think about online identity verification, with each token representing a unique digital identity. This has the potential to revolutionize the way we think about online identity and security, with the possibility of creating new decentralized identity systems that are verifiable and secure on the blockchain.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nERC-721 is a remarkable standard on the Ethereum blockchain that has changed our idea of digital assets and ownership. Its non-fungibility and flexibility have opened up new opportunities for creating and exchanging unique digital assets, paving the way for a more decentralized and fair future. The potential applications of ERC-721 tokens are vast and varied, spanning industries from gaming and collectibles to real estate and ticketing."
