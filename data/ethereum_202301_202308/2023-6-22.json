        "content": "STEM\n\nYuzhe Tang, associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science in the College of Engineering and Computer Science, and his research team have been awarded a grant by the Ethereum Foundation for research to advance the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem. This grant will support Tang and his Ph.D. students in designing, developing and evaluating the security hardening code to protect the Ethereum network stack.\n\nEthereum is a network made up of several communities and toolsets that allow users to communicate or make transactions with digital money. Since the network is decentralized, users are in complete control of their data and what\u2019s being shared, so they don\u2019t need to give up any personal information\u2014all users need to access Ethereum is an internet connection.\n\nDenial of service security is critically important to the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem, and the research will explore ways to protect the Ethereum network from cyberattacks, involving systematic vulnerability discovery using applied formal methods. As cyber criminals attack networks like Ethereum and security concerns grow, Tang believes this research could have a lasting impact on the current landscape of cybersecurity and blockchain platforms.\n\n\u201cWith this grant, we can help solve some of the most critical problems in the real world. We expect to continue developing code merged into Ethereum codebase,\u201d Tang says. \u201cI am most excited about making real-world impacts out of the research works from my group.\u201d"

        "content": "Ethereum has reached another milestone, with over 23.5 million ETH deposited for staking.\n\nStaking is the process of locking up a cryptocurrency in a proof-of-stake blockchain to contribute to network security and earn rewards.\n\nSimilar to depositing cash into high-yield accounts at big banks, staking enables token holders to earn passive income on their assets without having to sell or trade them.\n\nThe more people who stake, the more secure the blockchain becomes.\n\nETH price is heavily dependent on its value against the US dollar. In November 2021, when the price of ETH reached an all-time high of $4,400, there had only been 8.2 million staked ETH \u2014 which is roughly $15 billion \u2014 locked in the network.\n\nCurrently, with ETH priced at $1,880, over $38 billion is being used to secure the network.\n\nAlthough validators have had the opportunity to stake ETH since the Ethereum Merge in September last year, staking didn\u2019t grow dramatically in popularity until the Shapella upgrade, which enabled withdrawals.\n\nThere has been a net inflow of 3.6 million staked ETH ($6.9 billion) following the Shanghai upgrade, showing that interest in the Ethereum blockchain has remained at an all-time high.\n\nThe total circulating supply of ether is currently at 120.2 million ETH, and staked ETH makes up roughly 19.4% of all the ether on-chain. That is equivalent to roughly 6.4% of bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization fully staked in Ethereum.\n\nIn fact, staked ETH is becoming so popular, that the raw number of ETH staked on the Ethereum blockchain is about to surpass the total amount of ether that is kept on all cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nThe growing interest in Ethereum staking is a positive sign for the network, and indicates that ETH holders are moving away from centralized entities and into more decentralized spaces.\n\nUpdated Jun. 25, 2023 at 5:01 pm ET: Corrected rate of change in headline.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Ethereum price is rallying above $1,850 against the US Dollar. ETH is clearly following Bitcoin\u2019s rally and might soon test the $2,000 resistance zone.\n\nEthereum is moving higher above the $1,850 and $1,880 resistance levels.\n\nThe price is trading above $1,850 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $1,890 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could rise further above the $1,930 and $1,950 resistance levels.\n\nEthereum Price Surges Over 6%\n\nEthereum\u2019s price started a steady increase above the $1,720 resistance zone. Recently, Bitcoin saw a major increase and helped ETH to clear the $1,850 resistance.\n\nThe price is up over 6% and there was a move above the $1,900 level. A high is formed near $1,930 and the price is now consolidating gains. It is trading well above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent rally from the $1,715 swing low to the $1,930 high.\n\nEther is also well above $1,850 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Besides, there is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $1,890 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nImmediate resistance is near the $1,930 level. The next major resistance is near the $1,950 level. A successful move above the $1,930 and $1,950 resistance levels might send the price further higher. The next resistance sits near $2,000, above which Ethereum could rise toward the $2,050 level. Any more gains above the $2,050 resistance zone might send the price toward the $2,120 resistance.\n\nAre Dips Supported in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,950 resistance, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,900 level.\n\nThe next major support is near the $1,880 level or the recent low. If there is a break and close below the $1,880 support, the price could drop toward the $1,820 support or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent rally from the $1,715 swing low to the $1,930 high. Any more losses may perhaps send the price toward the $1,780 zone or the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is in the overbought zone.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,780\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,950\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Cryptocurrency self-custody platform Casa has rolled out support for Ether (ETH) storage, touting its support for multisignature Bitcoin (BTC) and ETH self-storage as a first in the industry.\n\nSince its inception in 2016, Casa has promoted multisignature self-custody in the crypto industry. Its flagship Bitcoin vault allows users to store the cryptocurrency using up to five keys for more distributed security.\n\nCasa\u2019s service originally catered to Bitcoin \u201cwhales\u201d willing to spend $10,000 a year on custody before opening its service to a broader base of users. The company has now added an Ether vault to its platform, with ETH holders also able to use up to five keys to secure their holdings.\n\nAccording to Casa CEO Nick Neuman, with Bitcoin and Ethereum operating as entirely different protocols, the industry had not yet built a security solution that accommodates both on the same platform, aside from various hardware wallet models.\n\nThe firm is also engaging with users over the potential of adding self-custody support for various ETH-related assets, including nonfungible tokens, stablecoins and ERC-20 tokens.\n\nAs Cointelegraph previously reported, Casa co-founder and chief technical officer Jameson Lopp highlighted increasing calls for a multisignature ETH self-custody from its users and the wider cryptocurrency community.\n\nCasa announced its intent to launch an ETH storage solution amid several high-profile collapses of custodians like FTX, as many users not only lost access to ETH, but also to their Ethereum-based stablecoins and other ERC tokens.\n\nRelated: Ledger CEO says crypto key recovery service makes self-custody easier\n\nHackers also wrought havoc within the Web3 space in 2022, with billions of dollars stolen through decentralized finance bridge hacks and smart contract exploits. It\u2019s a point Neuman highlighted when Casa announced its plans for ETH storage on its platform, with many hacks across the \u201cWeb3/crypto space due to poor private key management.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with Cointelegraph journalist Joe Hall, cypherpunk Jameson Lopp stressed the importance of making self-custody solutions more accessible and easier to give users complete control of their assets and peace of mind managing the associated responsibilities.\n\nIndustry experts have also suggested that its difficult to estimate the amount of BTC currently held in self-custody wallets.\n\nMagazine: Ordinals turned Bitcoin into a worse version of Ethereum: Can we fix it?"

        "content": "Although Ethereum (ETH) has been struggling to regain the psychological threshold of $2,000 despite the recent positive momentum on the wider cryptocurrency market, its outlook might not look as bearish by the year\u2019s turn if BlockchainCenter\u2019s rainbow price chart for Ethereum is any indicator.\n\nSpecifically, some crypto traders and investors use Ethereum\u2019s rainbow chart to observe the historical movements of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization in relation to various moving averages (MAs) and find patterns that could help them make better investment decisions.\n\nAs it happens, this chart suggests that Ethereum is currently still in the \u2018Fire Sale\u2019 phase, indicated by the color purple, and ranges between $0 and $2,593, below the \u2018Undervalued\u2019 blue zone between $2,593 and $3,668, as per data seen by Finbold on June 23.\n\nEthereum rainbow price chart. Source: BlockchainCenter\n\nProjection for January 1, 2024\n\nSpecifically, Ethereum has been stuck in the \u2018Fire Sale\u2019 area since early October 2022, which, judging by the previous behavior, it might get out of in a matter of weeks, as the same had happened in July 20202, when ETH moved into the \u2018Undervalued\u2019 zone after a period of eight months in the \u2018Fire Sale.\u2019\n\nFurther crunching the numbers, it took Ethereum 10 months to peak at the \u2018But have we *earned* it?\u2019 level at $4,336. If the same trend occurs this time around, it would mean that the crypto asset would end up in the same zone \u2013 currently between $16,353 \u2013 $23,742, by April 2024.\n\nIn other words, seven months from now, around January 1, 2024, Ethereum could be changing hands in the \u2018Still cheap\u2019 price area on the rainbow chart, which currently stands between $5,290 and $7,705, taking into consideration the exact same pattern.\n\nBefore that action, Ethereum was in the \u2018Fire Sale\u2019 area only one time \u2013 in October 2015 \u2013 soaring to the \u2018Go back to BTC?\u2019 price level four months later, followed by a subsequent drop to the \u2018Undervalued\u2019 zone in January 2017, where it stuck around very shortly until moving up again and beyond the \u2018Maximum Bubble Territory.\u2019\n\nShould this pattern repeat itself instead, it would mean that Ethereum could skyrocket to the \u2018Go back to BTC?\u2019 area in October 2023, at a price between $23,742 and $34,283, before dropping to the \u2018Undervalued\u2019 zone at $2,593 and $3,668 once again in January 2024.\n\nAlternatively, another Ethereum Rainbow Chart tool developed by CoinCodex estimates that under the same scenario, the asset\u2019s price would hover around $778 per token if ETH remained inside the \u2018Undervalued\u2019 (or \u2018BUY!\u2019) zone in January 2024.\n\nEthereum rainbow price chart. Source: CoinCodex.com\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum was at press time changing hands at the price of $1,872.40, recording a decline of 1.31% on the day but still an increase of 12.48% across the previous week and a 3.21% gain on its monthly chart, as per the latest data.\n\nEthereum 30-day price chart.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nVolition, a new StarkWare product for the permissionless Starknet network, promises to drastically reduce Ethereum transaction fees, to the point where the network can support micropayments similar to Bitcoin's Lightning Network.\n\nSet to go live with Starknet v0.13.0 later this year, Volition will \"remove the big barrier to microtransactions,\u201d StarkWare CEO Uri Kolodny told Decrypt. \u201cIt will finally make the crypto for coffee transactions viable,\" he said, adding that, \"This will be very important for crypto adoption. It will have particular advantages in developing economies.\u201d\n\nEthereum fees, also known as gas fees, have been a concern for users of the Ethereum network for some time. Despite the network's recent major upgrades, the fees can still be often high, resulting in more challenges for users, particularly those who engage in frequent transactions or use decentralized applications (dapps).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs data from Bitinfocharts shows, Ethereum's average transaction fee, which measures the average fee when a transaction is processed and confirmed, was around $4.80 on June 22\u2014significantly lower than at this year\u2019s peak of more than $27 recorded just last month. But while that's considered reasonable for transactions involving larger amounts, it still represents a major roadblock to mainstream adoption of Ethereum.\n\nAside from the proverbial crypto for coffee, Volition's developers argue that it opens up a host of other use cases previously not possible in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nThese include on-chain voting governance applications that would enable decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) to vote cheaply, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), or buying in-game assets.\n\n\u201cVolition will make on-chain voting so much more accessible by radically reducing its cost. People missing voting because of high fees\u2014currently common in blockchain\u2014will become a thing of the past,\u201d said Kolodny.\n\nFor on-chain gaming, the StarkWare CEO says the new scaling solution \u201csuddenly sets designers free to give a more immersive experience.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s because you want to offer players all sorts of different assets at different price-points, some of them very cheap,\" Kolodny told Decrypt. \"Today, a five cent asset incurs several dollars in fees; with Volition it becomes viable. Volition will set gaming free,\u201d he said.\n\nSeparating data availability\n\nOn a technical level, Starknet is a decentralized, permissionless Validity Rollup that operates as a Layer-2 network built on top of Ethereum. It provides an opportunity for any decentralized app (dapp) to significantly enhance its computational scalability without compromising the security features of the Ethereum network. By utilizing Starknet, dapps can achieve increased scale for their computations while leveraging the robustness and security provided by Ethereum's underlying infrastructure.\n\nHowever, with the introduction of Volition, developers gain the ability to optimize the transaction process by selecting the data availability mode for each individual storage variable. This is achieved by implementing Starknet's state as two separate storage commitment trees: one for Layer-1 data availability mode, which refers to data being available on the Ethereum mainnet, and one for Layer-2 data availability mode, indicating data availability on the Starknet Layer-2.\n\nData availability on a blockchain refers to the accessibility and persistence of the stored data. In a blockchain, data is typically organized into blocks, which are linked together using cryptographic hashes to form a chain. Each block contains a set of transactions or other types of data.\n\nVolition enables developers and users to choose the data availability mode for each contract. Image: StarkWare\n\nIn public networks, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, all information is stored on every node, meaning that users end up paying for the burden this puts on every block forever as everything you do is saved forever whether you need it or not.\n\nVolition claims to give users the flexibility to store the data in a place where it\u2019s still very accessible, but is distributed less widely. In other words, it implies the option of saving cost by storing data on Layer-2 instead of Layer-1 in instances where high expenditure on data availability isn\u2019t merited economically.\n\nData availability matters because it allows users to calculate the state of the chain by themselves, enabling them to continue transacting with their assets even if other nodes in the system stop cooperating.\n\nAs explained by StarkWare, the default today is that users always pay for L-1 data availability\u2014which, in turn, bloats transaction fees for small-value transactions. That\u2019s why Volition pushing the data for these transactions to Layer-2 paves the way to micro-transactions: the functionality enables developers\u2014and eventually users\u2014to pick and choose exactly when they want to use cheaper or more expensive on-chain storage options.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStarkWare claims that this could reduce gas fees by up to 90%.\n\nAccording to StarkWare, this is a feature the wider blockchain community has been talking about for some time. It all comes down to giving users a finer degree of control.\n\nFor example, developers can seek compromises by weighing their security and cost requirements on a case by case\u2014or even hour by hour\u2014basis, before deciding on the right data availability solution.\n\nAnother possible use case for Volition is trading at a decentralized exchange (DEX); it could help traders reduce fees by keeping funds on the Layer-2 level, and moving funds to the Layer-1 level when they hit a high amount, making security a priority for the DEX.\n\nFirst used on StarkEx, a permissioned version of Starknet tailored for use by protocols, Volition is expected to go live on Starknet in the third quarter of 2023."

For instance, in the last seven days, when crypto markets started surging again, the Optimism (OP) ecosystem as well as DeFi coins somehow related to Bitcoin (BTC) managed to register double-digit upsurges.\n\nMeanwhile, some segments, including Solana (SOL) coins, Cosmos (ATOM) coins and native assets of blue-chip DeFis, are lagging behind the recovery of markets.\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, cryptocurrency markets started surging amid announcements of ETF filings made by the largest assets management firms. In recent days, BlackRock, Fidelity and Invesco have followed this trend.\n\nRight now, Bitcoin (BTC) is trying to stay above the crucial $30,000 level on major spot trading platforms."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price has been recovering from a crucial support zone. However, there exists a notable resistance level that must be surpassed in order for the market to potentially transition into a bullish phase in the long term.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy: Edris\n\nThe Daily Chart:\n\nThe daily chart demonstrates a notable rebound around the $1600 level, where the 200-day moving average provided significant assistance last week.\n\nSubsequently, the price has experienced a rally and successfully surpassed both the $1800 resistance level and the 50-day moving average, both of which are expected to function as support going forward.\n\nThe current focus appears to be on surpassing the psychological resistance level of $2000, followed by the important technical area around $2300.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart:\n\nExamining the 4-hour chart, it is evident that the price found support at the lower boundary of a significant falling wedge pattern, aligning with the $1600 support level.\n\nFollowing this support, Ethereum experienced a rally, successfully surpassing both the $1750 level and the upper boundary of the wedge pattern. A bullish breakout from a falling wedge is generally viewed as a positive signal.\n\nHowever, the price is currently encountering resistance around the $1900 zone. Additionally, the RSI indicator indicates overbought conditions, suggesting the possibility of a short-term pullback or consolidation.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nBy: Edris\n\nEthereum Open Interest\n\nEthereum\u2019s price has recently experienced an uptick after consolidation over the past few months. This upward movement might attract the interest of investors and traders, particularly speculators in the perpetual futures market.\n\nThe open interest metric, which indicates the number of open futures positions, currently shows a relatively low value compared to current levels.\n\nThis suggests there may be lower volatility in the market until the metric increases. Consequently, it is plausible to expect a continued upward trend in the short term unless unforeseen events disrupt the current scenario."

        "content": "Crypto staking explained\n\nWhat is crypto staking? Crypto staking is the process blockchain networks like Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies use to validate transactions on the blockchain in exchange for a reward. Crypto staking is similar to crypto mining, but unlike mining, it is not competition-based.\n\nHow does crypto staking work?\n\nCrypto staking relies on the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, which means one person is randomly chosen from a pool of willing participants.\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Users, aka crypto stakers, can stake tokens within the network for a chance to be selected as validators. A user must stake a minimum number of tokens per network requirement to be considered.\n\n\n\n2. One validator is chosen at random and is responsible for proposing a new block to the network and updating the ledger in exchange for a block reward. Each new block is signed by its validator.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Other validators review the block so they can hold the chosen validator accountable. This way they can ensure the best interest of the network or penalize if malicious activity occurs.\n\n\n\n4. While this process is happening, other nodes are continuously cross-checking each other for accuracy. Then, just like crypto mining, the process repeats for the next block.\n\nHowever, once coins are staked, they are locked, and you cannot use them for anything else until you withdraw them.\n\nDid you know? Every blockchain has its own set of requirements. For example, Ethereum requires each validator to stake at least 32 ether to be considered.1\n\nWhy is crypto staking important?\n\n\n\n\n\nVerify transactions Validators are responsible for verifying and batching transactions into blocks. They check the work of other validators, which keeps the blockchain accurate and efficient.\n\n\n\nSecure the network Validators are required to stake their own coins as collateral to discourage malicious activity. If a validator acts maliciously, there are financial repercussions, aka slashing, and a validator can lose some or all of their coins.\n\n\n\nCirculate new coins Rewards are given to the validator chosen because they are responsible for creating new blocks and accurately updating the blockchain ledger.\n\nDid you know? Ethereum's proof of stake mechanism only uses ~0.0026 terawatt-hours per year (TWh/yr) across the global network.2 Bitcoin's proof of work mechanism uses roughly 125 TWh/yr.3\n\nCrypto staking options\n\nThere are multiple ways to participate in crypto staking. The most common methods are solo crypto staking, crypto staking as a service, and pooled crypto staking.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolo crypto staking This option allows you to have full control. You\u2019re responsible for operating your own hardware, aka node, and you also get all the rewards if chosen.\n\n\n\nCrypto staking as a service Also known as SaaS, this option allows you to stake your coins but outsource node operations to someone else on your behalf. This service usually has a monthly fee, but you collect the full block reward.\n\n\n\nPooled crypto staking Crypto staking pools take a collaborative approach that allows users to each stake a smaller amount. Each pool creates a unique smart contract detailing terms, responsibilities, and reward distribution.\n\nDid you know? There are over 500,000 validators on the Ethereum network as of February 2023.4"

        "title": "Resolving Ethereum's Scalability Issues: Insights from Mantle's Igneus Terrenus | KrASIA - KrASIA",
        "content": "If you\u2019ve ever performed a transaction on the Ethereum network, it\u2019s likely that you\u2019ve paid a significantly high fee, sometimes reaching up to 5 USD for a simple transaction.\n\nThe primary reason behind Ethereum\u2019s high fees is its lack of scalability, as the network can only handle around 15 transactions per second, which is a stark contrast to Visa\u2019s capacity of over 24,000 transactions per second.\n\nWithin the world of Web3, Ethereum is considered Layer-1 infrastructure. Layer-1 in crypto is the foundation of a cryptocurrency network, just like the infrastructure of a city\u2019s transportation system. It sets up the basic rules, security, and structure for how transactions happen, similar to how roads and bridges provide the framework for transportation in a city. To alleviate congestion and reduce fees, scaling solutions known as Layer-2s have been developed on top of Ethereum.\n\nOne notable Layer-2 solution is Mantle, which adopts a unique modular approach to scaling and has prioritized decentralization from the beginning. KrASIA recently spoke with Igneus Terrenus, Head of Communications and Business Development at Mantle, to delve into the network\u2019s architecture and explore the future prospects of Ethereum and Layer-2s.\n\nThe following interview has been edited and consolidated for brevity and clarity.\n\nKrASIA (Kr): How does Mantle\u2019s modular rollup architecture differ from Ethereum and other Layer-2s that are already in the market?\n\nIgneus Terrenus (IT): Our modular approach involves splitting the tasks of the blockchain, such as execution, settlement, consensus, and data availability, among different specialized nodes. Unlike monolithic blockchains like Ethereum, where a single node performs all tasks, modularization brings efficiency gains, lower fees for users, and improved performance for decentralized applications.\n\nOne advantage of modularity is the flexibility it offers in updating our network without causing major disruptions. As such, users on older versions of our system can still participate without any issues. This agility allows us to keep pace with the latest technological advancements. In contrast, upgrades on monolithic blockchains like Ethereum often require a hard fork, making older versions incompatible.\n\nFurthermore, our modularity extends to the data availability layer, which we have separated from other layers. Unlike other Layer-2 solutions that rely on Ethereum for data availability, which can be costly and face scalability challenges, we have partnered with EigenLayer to route data availability through their specialized module. This strategic partnership has led to a substantial reduction in the price of our data availability solution during testnet trials, achieving cost savings of up to 90%. We believe that our transaction fees will be lower compared to these Layer-2 solutions.\n\nKr: As a DAO-led L2 network, how does Mantle showcase the potential of tokenized governance, and what advantages does this governance model offer?\n\nIT: What sets us apart is our unique approach to governance and decentralization. Unlike other chains or projects that develop the product first and then gradually decentralize, we have established a robust decentralized DAO governance system through BitDAO for over a year. We are now integrating Mantle with BitDAO through a rebranding initiative, as we aim to transition the emphasis from BitDAO and investments towards tangible blockchain products.\n\nWe maintain an open governance process that welcomes feedback and embraces challenges. When our initial proposal faced opposition from the community, we actively listened and integrated their suggestions. This level of engagement enables us to assess the true sentiment of our proposals and guides us in shaping our long-term trajectory.\n\nThe public nature of our check and balance system is significant. We openly present all possible paths and actively involve the community in decision-making, creating a more informed, engaged, and decision-oriented community.\n\nKr: What are some notable projects that can be found on Mantle?\n\nIT: While we refrain from picking favorites among the projects we support, we have seen an abundance of games in our ecosystem.\n\nWe recognize that the gaming and social sectors have been overlooked in the past. The high costs associated with conducting transactions directly on the Ethereum blockchain, even on Layer-2 solutions, have made it impractical for these sectors. As a result, many games have opted to operate on sidechains that offer lower fees but come with security concerns, as evidenced by the Ronin bridge hack.\n\nThe strong enthusiasm we receive from gaming projects indicates that we offer a unique solution not provided by other Layer-1 or Layer-2 chains. Our modular approach is well-suited for facilitating high-frequency transactions, a critical aspect of blockchain games.\n\nKr: In your view, what is the significance of fostering a culture of interoperability across the L2 ecosystem?\n\nIT: In terms of Layer-2 solutions, we have been collaborating with companies that implement zero-knowledge technology even before launching our own chain. Our partnerships include working with Optimism, Arbitrum, and zkSync.\n\nThere is a noticeable difference in how Layer-2s and Layer-1s interact and operate. Layer-1s primarily compete to attract users to their specific chains, resulting in isolated ecosystems. In contrast, we actively engage in ongoing conversations and regular calls with other Layer-2 chains. Since we all build on Ethereum, once all networks are fully operational, there will be a shared liquidity pool, enabling seamless transactions and movement across different chains.\n\nRather than a competitive battle, the relationship between Layer-2 solutions is characterized by friendly competition based on merit, where everyone can learn from one another. While interoperability is still in its early stages, the extensive communication between various Layer-2 solutions indicates a promising future.\n\nKr: Do you have any upcoming partnerships or expansion plans?\n\nIT: We already have established ecosystem partners in the gaming and education sectors, such as Game7 and EduDAO. Nevertheless, we welcome any ideas from both our team and the community via our proposal forum.\n\nWhile our immediate focus is on the successful launch of the Mantle mainnet in early Q3, we believe that combining our Layer-2 chain with Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs) \u2014 a token that represents your staked assets like Ethereum \u2014 holds great potential. We already have a dedicated team actively developing LSDs, and we want to take advantage of our modular rollup by swiftly incorporating this latest technological advancement. We have high expectations for both our rollup and LSD, and we are confident that they will be a success."

During this time, ETH has set up nearly four equal highs and four higher lows.\n\nConnecting these swing points using trend lines reveals an ascending triangle setup. This technical formation forecasts a 45% ascent on the breakout of the horizontal resistance at nearly $2,000. The target of $2,915 is obtained by adding the measured distance to the breakout point.\n\nAs Ethereum price gets squeezed at the triangle\u2019s apex, a volatile breakout is to be expected from ETH holders.

Still, the Wave Trend indicator suggests that a bullish crossover could occur soon.\n\nETH/USDT 3-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if Ethereum price produces a three-day candlestick close below the $1,639 support level, it will create a lower low and invalidate the bullish thesis for ETH. Such a development could see the altcoin revisit the $1,500 psychological level.\n\nIn a worse-case scenario, Ethereum price could slide as low as the $1,368 registered on March 8."

        "content": "As optimism grows regarding the potential approval of a bitcoin ETF in the United States, industry watchers suggest that fund issuers may soon apply to launch products holding crypto\u2019s second-largest asset.\n\nYet the fate of such yet-to-be-filed ether funds would likely hinge on how the SEC treats the latest wave of filings from spot bitcoin ETF hopefuls.\n\nThe recent effort by asset management titan BlackRock to launch an ETF that would hold bitcoin directly has reinvigorated a decade-long attempt by a range of firms to get such an offering past the SEC.\n\nThe $9 trillion asset manager\u2019s filing was followed by renewed attempts by Bitwise, WisdomTree, Invesco and Valkyrie to launch similar products.\n\nThe latest rush of spot bitcoin ETF proposals indicates prospective issuers believe \u201cnow is the time,\u201d according to Neena Mishra, director of ETF research at Zacks Investment Research.\n\n\u201cI would not be surprised to see an application to launch a spot ether ETF in the coming weeks,\u201d she told Blockworks. \u201cIf one issuer starts the process, others would quickly join the race, not wanting to be left behind.\u201d\n\nBut Townsend Lansing, head of product at crypto asset manager CoinShares, said ether ETF filings likely don\u2019t make much sense right now \u2014 beyond being a publicity stunt.\n\n\u201cThe SEC would react the same way it has reacted to all the BTC filings,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would analyze the filing, seek public comments, look at the underlying market and presumably reject it for a failure to evidence a proper surveillance-sharing agreement.\u201d\n\nRead more: How \u2018surveillance-sharing\u2019 is designed to deter bitcoin ETF manipulation\n\nBut a spot bitcoin ETF approval would further add interest from fund issuers to try ether (ETH) next, some said.\n\n\u201cIt would indicate that the new proposed surveillance arrangement is enough to address their concerns and the same would apply to the second largest cryptocurrency,\u201d Mishra said.\n\nLansing agreed, in the case of the SEC greenlighting a spot bitcoin ETF, that fund issuers looking to launch an ether ETF next is \u201ca reasonable assumption.\u201d\n\nBut the potential for such a product to be approved would depend on the SEC\u2019s reasoning for permitting a spot bitcoin ETF, \u201cand the extent to which the ether market exhibits similar characteristics,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cDespite the recent press and surge of filings, we continue to believe approval of any spot crypto ETF remains a difficult proposition,\u201d Lansing said.\n\nAndra Nicolau, head of business development and strategy at Origin Protocol, believes that it might still be premature to expect a spot ether ETF based on the demand for such a product.\n\nShe noted that institutional investors who hold bitcoin understand the asset\u2019s scarcity and the need for it as a store of value amid inflation.\n\n\u201cEthereum is better understood by those who understand technology and rebuilding the internet from the ground up,\u201d Nicolau said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that ETH is not ETF worthy. It just means it may take a little while longer.\u201d\n\nAn ether futures ETF first?\n\nThe SEC greenlit bitcoin futures ETFs in 2021 after Chair Gary Gensler said earlier that year the regulator would prefer reviewing filings limited to such contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).\n\nBitcoin futures are cash-settled and are regulated by the CFTC \u2014 attributes some have said offer the SEC an additional layer of comfort.\n\nGrayscale Investments and Bitwise were among several firms in May to file for ETFs that would hold ether futures contracts. But these firms quickly halted plans to do so.\n\nTwo sources directly familiar with the matter told Blockworks those moves came after the SEC asked the firms to pull the plans \u2014 telling them the regulator is not yet ready to approve such products. A spokesperson for the regulator did not return a request for comment at the time.\n\nIndustry participants have labeled concerns around current ether futures liquidity levels, as well as a lack of clarity on whether ether is considered a security or a commodity, as possible rationales.\n\nBut concerns over the liquidity of the ether futures market would not apply to spot ether ETFs, Mishra argued.\n\n\u201cThe approval of a spot bitcoin ETF would mean that the SEC\u2019s main concerns regarding fraud and manipulation, which many thought were inconsistent, have been addressed,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there would be any need for the agency to experiment with a futures-based ether ETF first.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss-owned cryptocurrency exchange Gemini continues to expand its services worldwide actively, debuting Ethereum staking in the United Kingdom.\n\nOn June 23, Gemini officially announced the expansion of Gemini Staking Pro in the United Kingdom. The service allows institutions and high-net-worth individuals to become Ethereum validators by locking up at least 32 Ether (ETH), worth around $60,000 at the time of writing.\n\nProvided by Gemini Trust Company, the institutional ETH staking program is immediately available on the Gemini web interface, the firm noted.\n\nAt launch, Gemini Staking Pro is the only staking product available in the United Kingdom. According to Gemini Support, the U.K. is the only country of Gemini\u2019s coverage where the platform runs institutional staking exclusively.\n\nThe Gemini Staking Pro service is currently live in the United States (excluding New York), Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia, Brazil and more than 30 other countries.\n\nGemini\u2019s staking services are not regulated by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, the announcement said.\n\nGemini also mentioned that the platform will reimburse stakers for \u201ccertain penalties imposed in connection with staking.\u201d\n\nRelated: \u2018The Great Accumulation\u2019 of Bitcoin has begun, says Gemini\u2019s Winklevoss\n\nCiting challenges related to running a validator node, Gemini referred to \u201csmall mistakes\u201d that can lead to network-imposed penalties and even losing staked tokens, known as \u201cslashing.\u201d The firm promised to help stakers avoid this issue, stating:\n\n\u201cAt Gemini, we simplify the staking process for you. With Gemini operating the validator nodes, users can stake their assets with more confidence and without the technical know-hows.\u201d\n\nThe news comes amid Ethereum core developers planning to increase the maximum amount of Ether required to become a validator from 32 ETH to as much as 2,048 ETH, worth roughly $3.9 million at the time of writing. The minimum staking amount would remain at 32 ETH.\n\nAs previously reported by Cointelegraph, the U.S.-based crypto exchange Gemini is currently facing a lawsuit from the U.S. States Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator believes that Gemini has violated securities regulations by offering unregistered securities as part of its lending platform known as Gemini Earn. Shortly after getting sued by the SEC, Gemini announced plans to expand into the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin is on a collision course with \u2018Net Zero\u2019 promises"

        "content": "A majority of the top crypto tokens continued to rise during the early hours on Thursday as the digital token market shrugged off the gloom of the previous week. Investors' confidence was boosted from the Bitcoin ETF applications by BlackRock and other large asset management firms, despite hawkish comments from the US Fed.\n\n\n\nBitcoin extended its gains as the largest crypto token advanced more than 5 per cent to top $30,000 mark. Its largest peer, Ethereum, was also trading higher as it jumped about 6 per cent and reclaimed $1,900 level. Price action in other altcoins was on the higher side.\n\n\n\nIn the last 24 hours, Bitcoin maintained a position above $30,000 mark, registering a 5% increase compared to the previous day. This surge was fueled by investors' enthusiasm following the news of various spot Bitcoin ETF filings, said Edul Patel, Co-founder and CEO at Mudrex\n\n\n\n\"After experiencing a downward trend for a few weeks, BTC reached its highest point since April 2023. Bitcoin continues to showcase a remarkable performance. On the other hand, Ethereum also displayed upward movement, surpassing the $1,900 level and indicating a strong buying momentum. Overall, the market sentiment remains positive,\" he said.\n\n\n\nBarring the US-dollar-pegged stablecoins, all other top crypto tokens were trading with big gains today. Shiba Inu surged about 9 per cent, while Litecoin, Dogecoin and Cardano gained 7 per cent each. Polygon rose over 6 per cent, while Polkadot was up 5 per cent.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading sharply higher, rising to $1.19 trillion mark as it surged as much as 5 per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes rallied about 35 per cent to $59.5 billion.\n\n\n\nEDX Markets, a crypto-platform supported by Schwab and Fidelity, has commenced trading for popular crypto such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash. Notably, an institutional non-custodial wallet, meaning it does not hold customer crypto-assets but relies on third-party custodians to ensure the security of customer funds, said CoinDCX Research Team.\n\n\n\n\"This approach eliminates concerns about potential fund misappropriation. The emergence of EDX, backed by prominent firms like Citadel Securities and Fidelity Digital Assets, has the potential to reshape the digital asset landscape, particularly in the face of increased scrutiny of the sector by US regulators,\" he said.\n\n\n\nTech View by WazirX Trade Desk\n\n\n\nStacks (STX) serves as a Bitcoin Layer designed to facilitate the utilization of Bitcoin as an asset and the execution of transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain by smart contracts and decentralized applications.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the daily timeframe, the STX/USDT chart has broken out of the descending trendline and has continued on an upward trajectory.

And USDC is a stablecoin\u2014a cryptocurrency pegged to a stable asset, in this case, the U.S. dollar.\n\nThe company added that customers can now take part in receiving USDC, which runs on Ethereum, as \"play money\" to test out the payment option. The test will run on a separate blockchain, not Ethereum, and doesn't involve real ERC-20 USDC tokens. But if clients do show interest, Ethereum-based crypto adoption would soar, as many major corporations use SAP\u2019s services.\n\nSchroeder added that \u201c99/100 of the world\u2019s largest companies\u201d are SAP customers.\n\n\u201cRather than using traditional payment rails, business partners agree on settling a cross-border transaction with USDC or EUROC, which are tokenized versions of the USD or Euro, manifested in a blockchain,\u201d the announcement read.\n\nCircle CEO Says 'Regulate Us' as Company Hires an Ex-Regulator\n\nIt added: \u201cAre you ready to get into the fascinating world of Digital Money and Decentralized Finance?\u201d\n\nThe experiment will not allow customers to make any payments with USDC, rather just receive some of the cryptocurrency along with an invoice to \u201cexperience how fast, affordable, and reliable cross-border payments will look like,\u201d according to SAP.\n\nUSDC is the fifth largest digital asset, with a market cap of $28.3 billion. In the past 24 hours, over $6 billion in USDC has traded hands on exchanges, according to CoinGecko.\n\nCircle, the fintech firm behind USDC, has been lobbying hard in Washington to sway lawmakers into making clear cut rules for the digital asset space."

The major innovation brought about by the second-gen blockchain was the advent of smart contracts, a significant value improvement from its predecessor Bitcoin [BTC].\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nHave the new capabilities improved ETH\u2019s status as a store of value (SoV), considered as the holy grail of any asset class?\n\nETH as a savings option?\n\nCryptocurrency investment firm CoinShares\u2019 latest research threw light on some interesting aspects of ETH\u2019s ownership and distribution across the world. According to the report, despite being primarily used as a medium of exchange (MoE) for transactions on the network currently, ETH\u2019s usage has begun to shift towards a SoV.\n\nAs indicated through the coin age bands below, ETH\u2019s dormant supply increased sharply over the past 4-5 years. The inactive supply, defined as coins that have not been transferred in the previous five years, climbed from 3% in 2020 to more than 10% in 2022. On the other hand, the coins that have moved over the last year dropped steadily in the same period.\n\nInterestingly, this period also included the 2021 bull market during which ETH attained its peak. This implied that investors resisted the urge to cash out their holdings.\n\nMoreover, ETH that was being locked in the staking contract continued to grow despite a considerable drop in yields. This suggested that users were locking up ETH as a savings mechanism.\n\nIt should be noted that the below data was before the launch of the Shapella Upgrade which enabled unstaking. However, staked ETH has increased even more after the upgrade, as seen in one of the earlier articles.\n\nETH retraces losses\n\nETH surged past the $1,900 mark at the time of writing, retracing all losses incurred after SEC\u2019s lawsuit against major crypto trading platforms earlier this month. As the prices rallied, investors became greedy. Whale transaction count i.e., number of transactions transferring ETH worth more than $100,000, shot up dramatically, as per Santiment.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nETH became the buzzword on crypto-focused social channels as a result of the rally.\n\nAccording to social intelligence firm LunarCrush, Ethereum was also one of the top trending cryptos by social engagements."

Traders remain concerned about the US SEC lawsuits filed against exchange powerhouses Binance and Coinbase, despite spot Bitcoin ETF filings with the US market regulator by three financial giants.\n\nBitcoin saw some profit booking after the gains of two days as the largest crypto token dropped about a per cent but managed to hold $30,000-mark. Its largest peer, Ethereum, was also trading lower and dropped about 2 per cent to slip below the $1,900-level. However, pain in the other altcoins was severe.\n\nMarkets have slipped after a three-day rally. The crypto fear and greed index has registered no movement. Bitcoins price is beginning to stall after the BTC ETF excitement within the market. Though we can expect the BTC price to hold firmly around the current levels with support at $29,700, said Parth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead, CoinSwitch Ventures.\n\n\"Institutional entry into the crypto market has shifted the narrative and investor sentiment away from regulatory developments from last week.

After a period of corrections and consolidations, ETH has started showing signs of appreciation by breaking out of its descending channel.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe asset is currently trading above its 100-day moving average of $1,844 which acts as an immediate support level. The RSI reading is currently at 58, slightly in overbought territory. If ETH is unable to break through the $1,900 barrier this week, the price may consolidate around $1,850 levels for a while.\n\n\n\nMajor Levels:\n\nSupport: $1,845, $1,795\n\nResistance: $1,900, $1,950\n\n\n\n\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

        "content": "Neon EVM announces the launch of its closed beta.\n\nWhat is Neon EVM\n\nNeon EVM is a low-friction solution that enables Ethereum DApps to settle transactions on Solana, eliminating the gap between these two leading blockchains.\n\nNeon EVM positions Ethereum developers to enjoy the best of Solana\u2019s network, from low fees to high transaction speeds and parallel transaction execution capabilities.\n\nWhile Solana is one of the fastest organically-growing chains, its incompatibility with EVM has left several hundred million in TVL, millions of users and an entire ecosystem untouched by EVM multichain DApp developers \u2013 until now.\n\nNeon EVM\u2019s pioneering solution is the anticipated innovation in the Solana ecosystem and makes Solana a viable option for multichain builders.\n\nNeon EVM brings together the best of both chains while ensuring the finality of settlements on Solana.\n\nWhat is Neon EVM closed beta\n\nThe launch of the closed beta version of Neon EVM \u2013 Neon EVM? \u2013 to Solana\u2019s mainnet is a significant milestone on the roadmap.\n\nNeon EVM? is a fully-functioning Neon EVM with one major alteration \u2013 it supports fee-free transactions.\n\nThis means that all transactions are settled to Solana\u2019s layer one and require payment in Sol, as per any Solana-settled transaction.\n\nHowever, in beta, the NEON token is not requested by the proxy operator responsible for accepting the transaction request and ensuring that it is finalized.\n\nWhy launch in beta\n\nThe Neon EVM ecosystem includes many more players than just the Neon EVM and the proxy operators that accept and settle transaction requests.\n\nIt includes DAO, oracles, indexers, wallets, multisigs, bridges, explorers and more.\n\nNeon EVM? provides an opportunity for all parties to deploy and test to ensure the seamless integration of their services before the official Solana mainnet launch.\n\nWhile Neon EVM could have chosen to do a Shadow mainnet launch on a fork of the Solana mainchain, launching directly to mainnet offers significant advantages \u2013 not least of which is that deployed and tested contracts will retain their addresses on Solana mainnet.\n\nWhy launch in \u2018closed\u2019 beta\n\nLaunching in closed beta allows the Neon EVM team to onboard and test the services of ecosystem players in controlled phases.\n\nThe first phase onboarded the infrastructure components, and the second phase accepted DApps and will test the connection of wallets.\n\nOperating in closed beta also controls the budget by keeping the activity limited to an invite-only list. Remember, while the proxy operator is not charging a fee, the Solana network still does.\n\nIt simply is not possible to provide an open beta and predict the cost in Sol for such an initiative \u2013 though it is possible to predict that the Sol cost will be less than the equivalent ETH cost would be for an EVM settling to Ethereum.\n\nWhen the testing period ends and NEON tokens are available on the market to pay for transactions, Neon EVM will switch back to its normal operation mode.\n\nThis means that independent proxy operators \u2013 P2P and Everstake \u2013 will resume responsibility for accepting and processing transactions. The proxy operator\u2019s RPC endpoints will be made available on ChainList.\n\nWant to get involved\n\nWhile Neon EVM is deployed to Solana mainnet at this address, as this is a closed beta, unless you are on the guest list, it won\u2019t accept your transactions yet.\n\nTo engage with the community, you can find us on Twitter, and join Neon EVM\u2019s very active Discord to meet some of our long-term and loyal community builders.\n\nFor a high-level overview of the technical architecture and features of Neon EVM, the whitepaper is available here.\n\nTo follow the activity of the network, you can view Neon EVM transactions settled to Solana with the NeonScan dashboard."

        "title": "Neon EVM Opens Ethereum dApps To Solana With Its Closed Beta - ZyCrypto",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nNeon EVM, an Ethereum Virtual Machine, allows developers to scale Ethereum dApps through Solana as the settlement layer.\n\nAs a fully Ethereum-compatible environment, Neon EVM is designed to allow Ethereum dApps to take full advantage of the functionality native to Solana, including parallel execution of transactions. This will enable dApps to operate with high transaction speed, low gas fees, and high throughput of Solana.\n\nNotably, Neon EVM provides a unique opportunity to developers who want to unlock access to the liquidity on Solana, enjoy a first-mover advantage, and reach new customers on Solana.\n\nBy choosing Solana, Neon EVM has eliminated the gap between two leading blockchains while ensuring the finality of settlements on Solana. Currently, Solana is one of the fastest organically growing chains. Solana\u2019s incompatibility with EVM has attracted millions of users, with hundreds of millions in TVL. The chain has an entire ecosystem untouched by EVM multichain dApp developers.\n\nNeon EVM is the first EVM on Solana, with an easy Smart contract adaption. In addition to scalability benefits and Solana\u2019s growing ecosystem, Neon EVM also has familiar smart contract languages and Ethereum-based tools like Truffle and MetaMask.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Neon EVM team recently launched a closed beta version, Neon EVM\u03b2 Solana\u2019s mainnet. Despite the working similarity to a fully functioning Neon EVM, Neon EVM\u03b2 supports fee-free transactions. The beta launch was fundamental in allowing all players within the Neon EVM ecosystem to deploy and test Neon EVM\u03b2 to ensure the seamless integration of their services before the official Solana Mainnet launch. Reportedly, launching directly to the Mainnet offers the project many significant advantages, including having the deployed and tested contracts retain their addresses on Solana Mainnet.\n\nThe closed beta launch was done in two phases. In the first phase, the Neon EVM team onboarded the infrastructure components. During the second phase, the team accepted dApps and planned test wallet connections.\n\nNEON, a utility and governance token, will run the Neon EVM ecosystem. NEON will be used to pay for all Neon EVM transactions, including Neon operators. NEON holders can propose and vote on changes to the Neon protocol.\n\nThe project is still under development, with the team planning to roll out Neon DAO, Integration with The Graph, Chainlinl and Pyth, launch grant programs, and much more.\n\nWant to participate?\n\nNeon EVM is currently deployed to the Solana Mainnet at the address NeonVMyRX5GbCrsAHnUwx1nYYoJAtskU1bWUo6JGNyG, however since this is a closed beta, it won\u2019t accept your transactions unless you are on the guest list.\n\nYou can connect with the community by following us on Twitter and joining Neon EVM\u2019s lively Discord to get to know some of our devoted, long-standing community builders. The whitepaper, which provides a high-level description of Neon EVM\u2019s technical design and functionality, may be found at NeonEVM.org/whitepaper.pdf. The NeonScan dashboard allows you to watch Neon EVM transactions settled to Solana in order to monitor network activities."

        "content": "After sliding for the past two months, the cryptocurrency market has seen a surge this past week and investors are once again on the hunt for cryptos that could 10x. The momentum is certainly there, and the resilience of the crypto market this year has been impressive. Snapping up some breakout cryptos right now can lead to some hefty gains if the trends continue.\n\nRegardless, there are still more long-term positive catalysts at play that can propel the crypto market. The upcoming Bitcoin (BTC-USD) halving and potential rate cuts are principal catalysts to keep in mind. Even if we see a cooldown from here, these three cryptos could 10x in the next few years.\n\nAs a side note, I will be excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH-USD), as they are two obvious choices.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTicker Coin Price SOL-USD Solana $16.66 CKB-USD Nervos Network $0.0029 STORJ-USD Storj $0.25\n\nSolana (SOL)\n\nSolana logo on phone screen stock image. Solana price predictions.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nSolana (SOL-USD) is the leading \u201cEthereum killer\u201d and it remains a very solid competitor to other alternative Web 3.0 blockchains. While stability issues have always been my top concern with Solana, their focus on fixing such issues this year makes me believe this is a great contender for cryptos that could 10x by 2025.\n\nSolana has a lot of potential to become a leader in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, as it offers low fees, scalability, and interoperability with other blockchains. It is capturing a lot of the non-fungible token market share from Ethereum, and once the project figures out its stability issues, I believe more developers are likely to migrate.\n\nStill, Ethereum remains the top dog, and fees are very low. Solana is much more cyclical and volatile and I only expect it to deliver substantial gains when the Ethereum network is congested.\n\nNervos Network (CKB)\n\nAn image of the blockchain, distributing digital crypto from a phone through the web to another tablet\n\nSource: elenabsl/Shutterstock\n\nNervos Network (CKB-USD) is an under-the-radar project with one very bullish catalyst this year. CKB will be undergoing a halving event sometime in November and we could see the price climb significantly from there.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite the lack of momentum here, I\u2019m optimistic about this project. The multi-layered blockchain network provides a secure, scalable, and interoperable platform for the next generation of decentralized applications.\n\nNervos consists of two layers: the Common Knowledge Base (CKB), which is a public and permissionless proof-of-work blockchain that stores data and assets; and the Application Chain Layer (ACL), which is a set of layer-2 solutions that enable fast and low-cost transactions. Simply put, it can combine the best aspects of both Ethereum and Bitcoin.\n\nThat said, I believe a lot of patience is needed here. That primarily concerns the lack of marketing. But as blockchain development continues to advance, the flexibility and interoperability offered by this project will make it very appealing.\n\nNervos Network is currently trading with a market cap of over $120 million and that leaves a lot of room for upside.\n\nStorj (STORJ)\n\nAn image of a hand holding a cell phone with several visualizations of digital building blocks floating above it. representing sto platforms\n\nSource: Marko Aliaksandr/ShutterStock.com\n\nStorj (STORJ-USD) is similar to Filecoin (FIL-USD), as it buys data storage from individuals worldwide with its STORJ token and then resells it in bulk to others. This project is overshadowed by the Filecoin project, and especially after the launch of FWS, many wonder why they should buy STORJ.\n\nThe answer here is tokenomics. Unlike Filecoin\u2019s inflationary model (94% supply inflation), Storj does a great job of providing long-term value. The supply inflation here is at just 1% and your holdings won\u2019t be eroded over time while enjoying the tailwinds from the decentralized cloud storage market.\n\nOf course, blockchain cloud storage has a long way to go. But both Filecoin and Storj have better pricing than their traditional counterparts and their customers enjoy the perks of no censorship, decentralization, and better stability.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Starknet moves closer to EVM compatibility with upcoming 'Kakarot' testnet - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Starknet, a zero-knowledge layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, is one step closer to becoming fully Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible, pending an August testnet launch of Kakarot, a new zkEVM.\n\nOn June 3, the Kakarot team announced it had received new backing from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, Ledger co-founder Nicholas Bacca and Starkware.\n\nWe have powered up and entered Super Saiyan mode\u26a1. Kakarot Labs has officially been incorporated and closed a pre-seed round with top-tier investors.\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s unpack our vision, current standing, and the exciting future ahead. pic.twitter.com/VI8QRdPLfw \u2014 Kakarot zkEVM (@KakarotZkEvm) June 2, 2023\n\nIn an interview with Cointelegraph, Kakarot CEO and co-founder Elias Tazartes explained that while Starknet stands as a leading Zero Knowledge roll-up in the Ethereum ecosystem, it\u2019s not EVM compatible, so there\u2019s \u201ckind of a barrier to entry.\u201d\n\nStarknet is used by developers to scale decentralized applications, transactions and computation on Ethereum but uses its own native language, Cairo. According to Starknet, the use of Cairo makes it easier and faster to develop, review and maintain new code.\n\nThe downside is that it isn\u2019t EVM compatible, which could dissuade some developers.\n\n\u201cThe greatest impact that Kakarot can have is to make Starknet EVM compatible.\u201d\n\n\u201cKakarot right now is like a Solidity or any language engine. Eventually you will be able to put that engine within Starknet to make it EVM compatible.\u201d\n\nAt present, Starknet runs its own custom smart contract Virtual Machine, dubbed \u201cCairo VM,\u201d which leverages Cairo. This means that Starknet doesn\u2019t have direct EVM compatibility out of the box, something that could prove to be a significant hurdle for overall rollup adoption.\n\nKakarot co-founder Elias Tazartes.\n\n\u201cSome teams really need to be able to use Solidity. For example, if someone wrote a DEX or an AMM for the Ethereum ecosystem and now has 60,000 lines of code already audited, ready to go, but it\u2019s only on EVM chains.\u201d\n\nIf these developers wanted to start using Starknet, they would have to hire a whole new dev team, write in, audit the code again and maintain two code bases \u2014 which Tazartes describes as \u201cprohibitively expensive.\u201d\n\n\"We believe in \u2018coding pluralism\u2019 \u2014 giving devs as many ways to use it as they welcome. That\u2019s why our exploration team encouraged Kakarot through its building and why we invested in it,\" said Starkware CEO and co-founder Uri Kolodny.\n\nRelated: More TPS, less gas: Ethereum L2 Starknet outlines performance upgrades\n\nAccording to Tazartes, the idea for the zkEVM was first floated during a Starkware conference in July 2022. By October, the development team was able to together for a week during a hacker house event in Lisbon, Portugal, to get cracking on the new zkEVM.\n\nTwo months and 20 days later, in December, the coding for the project was complete, ready to create a fully functional execution layer \u2014 all of which was achieved without any venture funding.\n\nNotably, Tazartes said that Buteirn later invested in Kakarot due to his enthusiasm over a multiple-zkEVM approach to building out the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n\u201cFor Vitalik, the more zkEVMs the better, because as long as you have a wide diversity of architecture and diversity of approaches\u2026then this is really good for the space as a whole.\u201d\n\nTazartes shared that the testnet version of Kakarot will be launched for public use this August.\n\nMagazine: Tornado Cash 2.0 \u2014 The race to build safe and legal coin mixers"

Be it developers or cryptocurrency users, Ethereum has been able to drive impact for varied user groups both as a cryptocurrency and as a technology. Today, it powers blockchain networks, cryptocurrencies, and NFTs. It hit the headlines last year with its decision to switch to the proof-of-stake consensus algorithm from proof-of-work protocol in a massive software upgrade that lasted for months and was called \u2018The Merge\u2019.\n\nHowever, as changing times call for new additions to portfolios, crypto users are now on the lookout for new altcoins which can not only boost their gains but also diversify their portfolios. One of the top favorites currently is InQubeta (QUBE). It\u2019s built on Ethereum and helps startups working with artificial intelligence look for genuine investment opportunities.\n\nNot only startups, but even potential investors have a lot to gain with InQubeta as it helps them access future-ready opportunities that one cannot easily find in the market. Plus, by leveraging pioneering technology like AI, these startups\u2019 projects are an ideal way to become a part of the AI revolution. The following list features four more crypto projects that leverage the power of blockchain technology to offer their users utility-dense assets.\n\n1. InQubeta: Leveraging blockchain for an AI-led startup revolution\n\nInQubeta has been blazing a trail by combining the scope of decentralized finance with AI to create a next-generation platform where both investors and startups seeking funding can access authentic opportunities. What analysts are considering its key USP is that it addresses a structural problem that has been ailing the startup industry for a long time. In the past, many startups have been unable to scale due to paucity of funds. InQubeta has been launched to fix that and empower budding companies to bring their ideas to life.\n\nWhat\u2019s boosting the public\u2019s confidence in the platform is its robust security framework and smart contracts that have been vetted by leading security firms like Block Audit and Hacken.\n\nFor facilitating transactional purposes, the InQubeta team has rolled out a native token that\u2019s called QUBE and it\u2019s built on Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 protocol. The native token is a functional yet versatile asset that you can own by participating in its presale process\n\n\n\nThe latest ico has been divided into nine stages, where the prices will be rising progressively with every phase. The presale is currently in its first stage and the token has already raised over $500,000 in presale funding. That\u2019s quite an achievement for a cryptocurrency ico. Users who buy the tokens will have a lock-in period of 12 weeks and they will be able to access them only after the vestige period ends.\n\nThe QUBE token is deflationary, which means that it has an anti-inflationary mechanism that can prevent market volatility from hampering the token value. Under a deflationary token, the coin supply is adjusted to ensure that it\u2019s always within a certain limit. As the token stock is limited, its price doesn\u2019t fluctuate a lot. To control the supply, all extra QUBE tokens in circulation are destroyed by sending them to a \u2018burn wallet\u2019.\n\nIf a QUBE token holder plans on selling the token, they will have to pay a \u2018sell tax\u2019. While most of the sale proceeds go towards funding marketing campaigns and maintaining the liquidity and rewards pools, a portion of the tokens collected as tax proceeds is also sent to the burn wallet for adjusting the coin supply.\n\nTo get started on InQubeta, startups have to decide on what they\u2019d like to offer a potential investor in exchange for pumping funds into their project. The reward could be an equity share in the company or another reward level. The reward will be represented as an NFT and will be put up on InQubeta\u2019s NFT marketplace where investors will be able to evaluate them.\n\nAnother notable feature of the NFT marketplace is that these digital assets can be fractionalized so that one can buy fractions of the asset. This enables investors to invest in a project even if they are on a budget. If they agree with the terms offered by the startup, they can pay for the NFT using QUBE tokens, and the proceeds are then transferred to the startup. Head over to the presale to get a chance to buy this upcoming innovative cryptocurrency that could potentially provide huge returns in the long term.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\n2. DigiToads: Gaining with a hybrid DeFi model\n\nDigiToads is a multi-purpose meme coin that is built on the Ethereum network. What makes it a good crypto to buy is its hybrid DeFi model that has been designed by merging three cryptocurrencies \u2013 a meme coin, a play-to-earn platform, and a staking portal. Its native token is TOADS and it\u2019s the medium of exchange on the network. DigiToads brings you the ease of accessing multiple options to earn passive income on a single platform. So, you can stake assets, trade tokens, win crypto tokens in Web 3.0 games, and participate in trading competitions.\n\nIts play-to-earn game entails players competing with each other to become one of the top 25% of the scorers of a season and win TOADS tokens. The game seasons are also short \u2013 just a month long. So, one gets multiple chances to play. The participants have to tackle various challenges in a Metaverse swamp. For help, they can buy or trade a special species of virtual creatures called DigToads. These creatures have immense strength and a set of unique traits.\n\nEach DigiToad will have a different set of special characteristics and there is no way of finding out if your competitor\u2019s DigiToad has any advantage over yours. To counter this advantage, you can purchase training equipment, food, or potions for your DigiToads.\n\nBy choosing to buy the TOADS token, you can acquire a digital asset where you will be able to contribute to its growth. DigiToads\u2019 governance structure is based on the decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) model where community members can move proposals that seek important changes in the code architecture. However, to be implemented, these proposals should first be approved by the voting community members. All TOADS token holders get voting rights that they can use to express their opinions about a proposed change.\n\nBuy DigiToads Now\n\n3. Tenet: Amping up the potential of liquidity pools\n\nTenet is a multi-chain automated market maker and connector that equips crypto tokens with a decentralized liquidity tap. A liquidity tap is a growth driver for a liquidity pool. It employs an algorithm that offers the liquidity provider more lucrative and transparent incentives. The platform has been designed as a cross-chain protocol toolkit that allows the demand side to tweak the parameters of a liquidity tap while reaching out to more participants. Its native token is TEN and it\u2019s used for all transactional use cases on the network.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, is that TEN token holders can also earn with yield farming on the Tenet network. It serves as a more convenient mining platform that ensures a transparent allocation of farming rewards. To ensure fair allocation of rewards during yield farming, Tenet optimizes algorithms of LP token polls and initial mining incentives.\n\n4. Polygon: Making scaling on Ethereum fuss-free\n\nPolygon is among the top crypto coins built on the Ethereum network and the network enables developers to add more utility to Etherum-friendly tools, virtual machines, and dApps. Its native token MATIC is one of the most-traded crypto tokens on DeFi exchanges. Polygon\u2019s suite of tools comprises optimistic rollup blockchains, zK chains, standalone blockchains, and many other kinds of DeFi infra that developers usually need while scaling a decentralized service.\n\nWhat\u2019s unique about the Layer 2 scaling solution is that it amalgamates the Plasma framework and the proof-of-stake consensus protocol to pave the way for the seamless execution of smart contracts.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\n5. Cosmos: An interconnected ecosystem of dApps\n\nCosmos is among the leading ERC-20 tokens that have emerged as a top crypto to invest in with their multi-functional and flexible code architecture. It has been designed as an ecosystem of sovereign dApps and decentralized services that are interoperable and can be adopted by the masses. Its native token is ATOM and it\u2019s the main cryptocurrency on the network. It strives to demystify blockchain technology and make building dApps less complex for developers with its modular framework. Being interoperable, Cosmos paves the way for seamless communication between DeFi tools and hence, solves problems like fragmentation.\n\nCosmos\u2019 architecture comprises three layers. The first is the application layer where all transactions are processed. The layer also updates the state of the network. The second one is the networking layer that facilitates communication and transfer of data and assets between chains. The third layer is the consensus later where nodes agree to work on the system\u2019s current state.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\nConclusion\n\nOnce you are well-versed with the features and potential of the above-mentioned cryptocurrencies, chances are you won\u2019t have to worry about deciding which crypto to buy today for the long term. Coming with cutting-edge features and with hard-to-ignore economic opportunities, these cryptocurrencies are capable of triggering a wave of financial inclusion.\n\nWhile these crypto tokens have their strengths, for many crypto analysts InQubeta is the leader of the pack because of its higher growth potential. With an industry-specific use case, InQubeta is being seen as a growth driver for not just the startup industry but for innovation-centric projects in the decentralized finance ecosystem.\n\nIts user-friendly interface and modern-day features are among other reasons why analysts are calling it a top crypto to invest in 2023. Over the next coming months, market experts feel that the QUBE token is likely to perform well and has the potential to grow by 30x.\n\nGiven how cryptocurrencies are a dynamic asset category, it\u2019s always advisable for crypto buyers to research a token before purchasing it. By exploring a token before the purchase, a buyer can acquaint themselves with the potential risks associated with cryptocurrencies and make well-informed decisions.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Ethereum CFD Trading: How to Trade Ethereum CFDs - Admiral Markets",
        "content": "How much do you know about Ethereum trading, specifically, Ethereum CFD trading?\n\nCryptocurrencies are on the rise. Ether (ETH) is one of the most popular offerings and is known as the 'original alt coin'.\n\nAs of 2023, cryptocurrencies are slowly becoming more mainstream and finding their place in the world of finance. Ethereum, given its popularity and ranking, remains a hot topic amongst the crypto community as the technology progresses.\n\nHow to trade Ethereum CFDs? We cover this topic along with other details around Ethereum, Ethereum trading at Admirals and more.\n\nEthereum CFD Trading: How Volatile is Ethereum?\n\nFirst of all, we need to know that cryptocurrency markets are much more illiquid than equity markets, meaning that larger market players can cause larger movements.\n\n'Smart' money usually buys lower and places sell orders when the price is peaking. Thus, traders should avoid buying high. Ethereum is subject to a much wider range of price fluctuations relative to the currency (Forex) market.\n\nGenerally speaking, investors have been pouring capital into the market, betting that consumer demand will propel future growth.\n\nAt this point, all the cryptocurrencies, including the ETH vs USD CFD, are subject to significant speculation, and backed by very little historical data, which makes this asset class very volatile.\n\nIf you want to trade Ether CFDs and other cryptos, you need to get acclimated to volatility. For that reason, you might want to download the demo platform first.\n\nYou should also familiarise yourself with volatility protection settings, which can help you to minimise the volatility risk when trading.\n\nFree Trading Webinars From Admirals\n\nTo always stay up-to-date with cryptocurrency prices, as well as possible movements, and trading opportunities, Admiralsoffers free live webinars hosted by leading professional traders and analysts.

Traders can access the ETH/USD CFD and other crypto pairs using MT4, MT5, and the MTSE plugin.\n\nThe process is simple and as follows:\n\nDownload/open the MetaTrader platform Register a new account or log in; Open up the cryptocurrency chart (ETH/USD)\n\nAlso, all of the additional add-ons for the MetaTrader Supreme Edition are now also available for the latest version of MetaTrader 5 Supreme Edition.\n\nCurrent vs Historical Price: Trending or Ranging?\n\nSource: Admirals, MetaTrader 4, ETH/USD daily chart (from July 2018 to March 2019). Accessed: 12 March 2019. Please Note: Past performance does not indicate future results, nor is it a reliable indicator of future performance.\n\nThe chart above shows the performance of Ether over an eight-month stretch between the summer of 2018 through to spring 2019. The thick red line is a 150-day simple moving average, an indicator that smooths out price fluctuations in order to make it easier to discern the overall trend.\n\nYou can see that there has been a clear downward direction to the price action over this period and the moving average has a negative gradient. Furthermore, the price of Ether has been depressed below this long-term moving average for nearly the whole time shown in the chart. Such an occurrence is often considered by traders to be bearish in nature.\n\nNotice that there is a brief spike above the moving average in late February 2019, but this has not resulted in any reversal in the trend. There are, however, signs of stabilisation if we focus on the price performance since late 2018, which you should be able to see in the four-hour chart below:\n\nSource: Admirals, MetaTrader 4, ETH/USD H4 chart (from November 2018 to March 2019). Accessed: 12 March 2019. Please Note: Past performance does not indicate future results, nor is it a reliable indicator of future performance.\n\nOver this time-frame, the Ether market has demonstrated range-bound characteristics. On 19 November 2018, the price sunk below 160.00, a price level that is marked on the chart with a blue dotted line. With the exception of the brief spike up in February, the price of Ether has remained depressed below that level since then through to the time of writing. Notice how the price pushed up in late December and early January but failed to break above this resistance level.\n\nSupport levels are also marked on the chart with blue dotted lines. One support level is at 100.00. The price rebounded a couple of times in November close to this level. It did then sink below this level for the first half of December, falling to the second support level at 80.55. Since then, though, price has remained bounded above 100.00.\n\nWith the help of the award-winning MetaTrader Supreme Edition plugin (MTSE) for MetaTrader 4 (MT4) and MetaTrader 5 (MT5), traders can trade with the ETH/USD CFD volatility - Click the banner below to download the MetaTrader 5 platform for free with Admirals:\n\nThe World's Premier Multi Asset Platform\n\nDOWNLOAD MT5 FREE\n\nEthereum CFD Trading: Potential Strategies\n\nTechnical trading and proven tools should be applied when trading Ether, which in turn could be the basis for trading the Ether vs Dollar CFD profitably.\n\nDue to its volatility, scalping strategies could be applied if trading intraday. Those who wish to swing-trade ETH/USD need to be prepared for a bit of unstable price action, where steady profits might turn into losses within a split second.\n\nA \"flash crash\" occurred on June 21 2017, when the price dropped from around $320 to 10 cents. It recovered thereafter, but investors and traders definitely took a hit in that period.\n\nMr Adam White, Vice President of GDAX, explained that an investor placed a multi-million dollar Ether \"sell\" order at 12:30 p.m. on a Wednesday. The order size caused the currency price (which was already volatile), to dip.\n\nAs we know, as the price grabs stop loss orders it creates additional momentum, and potentially huge movement in minutes or even seconds. Every close of a buy position is an automatic sell into the market and vice versa.\n\nHow to Day-Trade Ether\n\nOpen your ETH/USD chart. This is how you add indicators to the MetaTrader 4 platform:\n\nSource: MetaTrader 4 - ETH/USD chart - How to add indicators to an MT4 chart - Platform Time: Julne 19, 12:15PM\n\nNow, we will use a scalping strategy that combines the following indicators:\n\nSource: MetaTrader 4 - ETH/USD chart - Data Range: 16 July, 2022 - 19 July, 2022 - Platform Time: July 19, 11:55AM\n\nEnter a long position once the fast black 4 EMA (Exponential Moving Average) has crossed up through the middle Bollinger Band (14 EMA (red)). At the same time, the 'Chaos' and 'Momentum' should be crossing their zero lines, going up. Potential entry zones are shown as red arrows.\n\nSource: MetaTrader 4 - ETH/USD Chart - Data Range: 16 July, 2017 - 18 July, 2017\n\nExit position or TP: Your exit position is executed when the 'Chaos Awesome Oscillator' changes its colour (mostly for high-frequency scalping purposes) or at the Admiral Pivot point. A stop-loss is placed below the recent swing-low.\n\nTrading the Ethereum CFD\n\nProper money management is the holy grail of trading and, if applied correctly in a strong trending environment, it should theoretically make an enormous return of investment (ROI). Due to huge volatility, losses might occur as well, so it is extremely important to use proper money management. Market stability could be reached when the power shifts from investors seeking to profit from price fluctuations, to consumers actually using cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhen that happens, volatility should stabilise. Traders should treat crypto trading the same way they would treat any investment in the early start-up stage. Also, intraday traders should definitely be focused on major trading sessions, as major trading centres provide the highest volatility in ETH/USD. Fortunately enough, the MetaTrader 4 (MT4) platform offers the instrument during major market sessions \u2013 24/5.\n\nMarket Sentiment \u2013 Impact on the Hype in the Media\n\nBack in 2017, Ether was very hot. The diagram below shows just how positive the sentiment towards Ether was back then.\n\nSource: Bitcoin Cash - Q1 2017 Coindesk\n\nNaturally, some of that sentiment has cooled off alongside the decline in the value of the ETH/USD CFD crypto pair since the heady highs of 2017. It is a general truism, however, that sentiment will decline for any previously-frothy market that has suffered a severe correction in value.\n\nThe question with cryptocurrencies and Ether still remains, however, which way will they go? There remain investors that believe that crypto prices will recover. One factor in Ether's favour is the potential of the Ethereum platform and in 2019 we have begun to see signs of institutional adoption of the technology.\n\nBanking giant JP Morgan made headlines in early 2019 when it rolled out its JPM coin, which was touted as the first cryptocurrency backed by a US bank. While many news outlets acknowledged that this new digital token utilises blockchain technology, what many failed to mention was that JPM's proprietary Qurom blackchain is actually an enterprise-level version of Ethereum. Where this will all actually lead to is far from clear, of course, but this kind of concrete example of a real-world use of Ethereum's technology could serve to rekindle confidence in Ether.\n\nThat said, we should stress that the vast majority of cryptocurrency trading, including that of Ether, is pure speculation, and the current utility value to users is close to zero. Not many people use blockchain protocols, as opposed to many people who trade cryptocurrencies. We might also see regulations coming in terms of exchanging, issuing, and holding new coins.\n\nTrading ETH and Other Cryptocurrency CFDs\n\nIn addition to trading CFDs in ETH/USD, Admirals also offers the ability to trade CFDs with ETH/EUR and ETH/BTC.\n\nTo trade these pairs, traders simply need to download the software platform (MetaTrader 4 or MetaTrader 5), which grants access to the market and/or the ability to monitor price action on a chart.\n\nIf you'd like to get started, click the banner below to open a live account and start trading cryptocurrency CFDs today:\n\nTrade CFDs on digital currencies Trade 30+ top digital currency pairs with Admirals TRADE NOW\n\nAbout Admirals\n\nAdmirals is a multi-award winning, globally regulated Forex and CFD broker, offering trading on over 8,000 financial instruments via the world's most popular trading platforms: MetaTrader 4 and MetaTrader 5.

        "content": "Cryptocurrency platform Luno has launched ethereum staking, a way for its customers passively to earn ether, the token associated with the ethereum blockchain.\n\nLuno country manager Christo de Wit said Luno\u2019s staking feature will initially be launched in South Africa with support for ether. Customers open a staking wallet and can earn up to 4%/year in ether tokens by holding their coins.\n\n\u201cThe reward rate can fluctuate depending on the demand on the network as well as the number of active validators. Rewards will be paid weekly, so you can automatically grow your stake and compound your rewards.\u201d\n\nWhile they are staked, customers cannot sell or send their coins elsewhere, but they can \u201cunstake\u201d at any time and remove their coins from their staking wallets. There are no minimum deposits.\n\nWhat is staking?\n\nCryptocurrencies that allow staking use a \u201cconsensus mechanism\u201d called proof-of-stake to securely verify transactions. \u201cYour stake is used to ensure that transactions are not fraudulent \u2013 with penalties if you validate incorrect transactions and rewards when you validate correct transactions,\u201d Luno said.\n\nStaking removes the need for crypto miners to churn through mathematical problems for verification. Instead, transactions are validated by those who stake their tokens.\n\nStaking is also a way to support the long-term health of the ethereum ecosystem, contributing to the security and efficiency of blockchain projects.\n\nApril\u2019s eagerly anticipated Shanghai update concluded the ethereum blockchain\u2019s migration to a full proof-of-stake consensus mechanism by allowing users to unstake their crypto and retrieve rewards for the first time.\n\nEthereum offers an annual percentage yield of up to 4%, though this may vary depending on network conditions.\n\nThere are no minimum deposit or withdrawal amounts. Luno doesn\u2019t charge a fee to stake or unstake a user\u2019s cryptocurrency, but there is a staking service fee that is deducted from the reward customers receive.\n\nLuno said it is partnering with a specialist that operates validation nodes in all the main proof-of-stake networks to enable staking for its customers.\n\nThere are two main risks involved. Firstly, one of the specific requirements in staking is that validators (the people or companies responsible for operating the nodes that verify transactions) must have their computers constantly running for the network to run smoothly, so if there are connectivity issues this could attract penalties.\n\nSecondly, while rewards are earned for validating good transactions, there is a penalty if bad transactions are approved. This is known as \u201cslashing\u201d.\n\n\u201cOur partners have stringent mechanisms in place that mean slashing is incredibly rare. In such an unlikely event, our staking provider will review and remediate slashing penalties where reasonable,\u201d Luno said. \u2013 \u00a9 2023 NewsCentral Media"

        "content": "Blockchain technology is sometimes talked about in a speculative, money-making context in association with digital assets (such as cryptocurrencies) and NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). However, the real value of blockchain lies in its potential to create systems in which information and power are not concentrated in one place, like banks, governments, and large corporations. With blockchain, we can build alternative, secure systems that are neither controlled or dependent on such centralized entities, systems that are owned and governed by their participants.\n\nConceived of in 2013, the general-purpose blockchain platform, Ethereum, made the world aware of the potential of this decentralized technology in the form of smart contracts. One of Ethereum\u2019s defining characteristics is that it is open-source software and its development is undertaken by a community. An organization that has played a key role in coordinating the community is the Ethereum Foundation, a non-profit organization.\n\nAmong the leaders of the Ethereum Foundation is its Executive Director, Aya Miyaguchi. Formerly a high school teacher in Japan, Miyaguchi joined the Foundation after moving to the United States and meeting Ethereum\u2019s founder Vitalik Buterin who was 19 years old at the time.\n\nWhat was the potential Miyaguchi saw in Ethereum? And what does she and the Foundation hope to achieve in the future when decentralized systems are widely adopted?"

        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nTether Holdings Limited, the issuer of the world's largest stablecoin, USDT, has recently frozen an account with over $4.1 million, as shown by on-chain explorers. This once again raises the question of whether centralization, with its concentration of power, is the ideal path forward or if decentralized projects like Tradecurve are essential for the survival of the DeFi ecosystem.\n\n>>BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW<<\n\nNo explanation for $4.1 million freeze of USDT\n\nOn June 19th, Tether froze $4.11 million of USDT without providing any further comment on the action. The analytics platform Etherscan marks the USDT wallet as frozen.\n\nA Reddit user traced the frozen account back to a Huobi user, and on-chain data indicates that the USDT was funneled into the wallet in March 2023. There is ongoing speculation that the owner of the account may be involved in illegal activities, which appears to have prompted Tether to actively freeze the holdings in the address.\n\nTether Holdings Limited acts as a centralized entity and manages over $83.1 billion worth of USDT in circulating supply. Each USDT token on any blockchain is issued and backed 1:1 with cash or cash equivalents.\n\nTether and USDT play an essential role in the cryptocurrency market but face concerns regarding centralization, which are further highlighted by the issuer's ability to freeze assets. This stands in contrast to the core principles of blockchain technology, which is inherently borderless and decentralized.\n\nCritics on social media are raising their voices, pointing out that Tether Holdings Limited behaves like a bank by freezing the address. A Reddit user highlighted the fact that Tether has integrated a \"kill switch\" in the token's code that can potentially be triggered at any point to block an address. This carries a certain risk for the overall market and the financial system.\n\nAs the cryptocurrency industry continues to expand and evolve, it remains to be seen to what extent USDT can achieve decentralization in its final state.\n\nOn the other hand, Tradecurve aims to revolutionize the trading industry by offering a decentralized hybrid exchange.\n\nTradecurve.io: Decentralized trading\n\nTradecurve represents the next step in decentralized trading. By combining the worlds of decentralized and centralized exchanges, it provides access to thousands of financial instruments across multiple international markets. Users can leverage their cryptocurrency to trade commodities, stocks, forex, cryptocurrencies, and more.\n\nTradecurve users enjoy complete anonymity without the need for KYC procedures, making trading accessible to everyone and facilitating easy onboarding to a wide range of markets and instruments. Tradecurve offers various advantages, such as AI-driven algorithmic trading, 500:1 leverage, a VIP account service for whales, copy trading, and a Metaverse Trading Academy, which provides all the necessary materials for self-education.\n\nThe TCRV token is currently priced at $0.018 in the 4th stage of the official presale, and analysts predict a 100x return when the presale ends.\n\nFor more information about $TCRV presale tokens:\n\nWebsite: https://tradecurve.io/\n\nBuy presale: https://app.tradecurve.io/sign-up\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Tradecurveapp\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/tradecurve_official\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Ethereum Rainbow Chart Sets ETH Price Prediction For 2025 - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Ethereum has gained more than 75% year-to-date (YTD) and is currently trading at the $1,900 price level, firmly rejecting the $1,200 lows from the start of the year. With a bullish boost permeating the markets as of late, crypto investors are now hopeful the second-largest cryptocurrency will break the multi-month resistance at $2,000 and possibly climb higher in the second half of the year.\n\nWhile the short-term outlook for Ethereum certainly seems promising, many holders are wondering what to expect in the long term. There are several potential growth catalysts that could help propel the price of Ethereum beyond its current all-time high (ATH), including the 2024 Bitcoin halving and the growing deflationary pressure that started mounting after the leading smart-contract platform transitioned from the Proof-of-Work (PoW) to the energy-efficient Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus system last September.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019re going to examine various Ethereum growth catalysts and consult the Ethereum Rainbow Chart to see what Ethereum\u2019s price might be at the end of 2025.\n\n\u201cHODL!\u201d \u2013 The Ethereum Rainbow Chart predicts the price of ETH will increase in the short term\n\nWhat is Ethereum Rainbow Chart? The Ethereum Rainbow Chart developed by the crypto analytics platform CoinCodex is a graphical representation of Ethereum\u2019s price movements over time, displaying the various price ranges that ETH has historically experienced. It is based on logarithmic price scales and uses a color-coded spectrum to represent different price zones \u2013 at the lower bound, it starts at dark blue, indicating price areas where ETH is severely undervalued, and goes all the way to red, which indicates a price area where ETH is significantly overbought.\n\nThe Rainbow Chart suggests now might be a good time to hold onto ETH or potentially buy some more.\n\nThe chart offers insights into potential price targets for Ethereum based on historical trends. It allows investors to visualize the areas where ETH has historically encountered resistance or support, indicating potential price ceilings and floors.\n\nAt the moment, the Rainbow Chart suggests that Ethereum is in the \u201cHODL!\u201d band (indicated by yellow), which means that now might be a good time to invest in ETH as the price is likely to increase from here.\n\nThe Ethereum Rainbow Chart prediction for 2025\n\nAccording to the Ethereum Rainbow Chart, ETH could reach as high as $28,768 by the end of 2025. Meanwhile, the chart forecasts that the lower bound for ETH in the same time period could be roughly $865.\n\nEthereum\u2019s price could surpass $28,700 by the end of 2025.\n\nAccounting for all seven price bands, the chart predicts an average price of $8,836 for the end of 2025, about 365% above the current price of $1,900 and 156% above the November 2021 ATH of $4,867.\n\nWhat is Ethereum triple halving, and why could it be the main driver behind ETH\u2019s future price growth\n\nDespite the similarity in terms of naming, Ethereum triple halving is nothing like Bitcoin halving, which sees BTC mining rewards cut in half every 210,000 blocks. Instead, Ethereum triple halving is a concept that refers to three key mechanisms that are helping reduce the supply of ETH, and thus drive its value through deflationary pressure.\n\nThe three main parts of the Ethereum triple halving are:\n\nReduced issuance of new ETH under the Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm\n\nThe effect of ETH burning, which was first introduced with the EIP-1559 upgrade in August 2021\n\nThe lower amount of ETH in circulation due to the effects of Ethereum staking\n\nAll three mechanisms listed above play a role in driving the price growth of Ethereum. Ethereum staking \u2013 introduced with the network transition from PoW to PoS last September (an event known as the \u201cThe Merge\u201d) \u2013 allows investors to deposit lock-in their ETH tokens in order to earn validator opportunities that secure the network in exchange for staking rewards.\n\nThe effect of the Ethereum PoS consensus is two-fold. It allows users to stake their ETH in exchange for rewards, which effectively decreases the number of ETH in circulation. Secondly, there is less ETH produced. Under the PoW model, around 13,000 ETH per day were distributed as mining rewards. Meanwhile, under the PoS model, only 1,600 ETH per day is issued to reward stakers \u2013 a reduction of more than 87%.\n\nWhen the reduced issuance of ETH is combined with the effects of Ethereum burning introduced with the EIP-1559, Ethereum turns into a deflationary asset. That\u2019s exactly what we can observe in practice \u2013 since the Merge went live on September 15, 2023, the supply of Ethereum decreased by roughly 282,000 ETH. According to simulations run by Ultra Sound Money, the supply of ETH would have increased by 2,938,900 ETH in the same time period if PoW was still in place.\n\nNote The reduction of supply plays a major role in controlling the price of Ethereum through basic supply and demand mechanics \u2013 the fewer ETH there are, the higher the value of a single ETH (as long as demand is there, obviously).\n\nFor more information about Ethereum triple halving and how the trio of concepts can act as a long-term price catalyst for ETH, check the video below.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "title": "How A Truly Decentralized Ethereum Ensures the Security and Integrity of the Network - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain platform that has gained significant attention and popularity since its launch in 2015. Vitalik Buterin created it to provide a more versatile and programmable blockchain system than Bitcoin. One of the core principles of Ethereum is decentralization, which means it operates without a central authority or governing body controlling the network.\n\nAt the heart of Ethereum\u2019s decentralization is its blockchain technology, a distributed ledger that records all transactions and smart contracts executed on the platform. Instead of relying on a single entity or server to validate and store information, Ethereum utilizes a network of thousands of computer nodes participating in the consensus mechanism.\n\nThe consensus mechanism Ethereum uses is called Proof of Stake (PoS), designed to ensure the security and integrity of the network. In PoS, participants must hold and \u201cstake\u201d a certain amount of Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum, as collateral to validate transactions and create new blocks. Doing this helps eliminate the need for energy-intensive mining, as seen in Bitcoin\u2019s Proof of Work system, making Ethereum more energy-efficient.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum\u2019s decentralization extends beyond its consensus mechanism. It also allows anyone to develop and deploy decentralized applications (dApps) on its platform. Smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with predefined rules and conditions, enable developers to create decentralized applications for various purposes, such as decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and decentralized exchanges (DEXs). These applications run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), a decentralized computing system that executes smart contracts across the network.\n\nEthereum\u2019s decentralized nature is a fundamental characteristic that sets it apart from traditional centralized systems. Its reliance on a distributed network of nodes, PoS consensus mechanism, and support for decentralized application development all contribute to its vision of a trustless, transparent, and censorship-resistant platform.\n\nUnderstanding decentralization Ethereum\n\nDecentralization is a critical concept in cryptocurrencies, and Ethereum is one of the most prominent platforms that embodies this principle. Ethereum is an open-source blockchain-based platform that enables developers to build and deploy decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts.\n\nAt its core, decentralization refers to the distribution of control and decision-making across a network rather than being concentrated in a central authority. In the Ethereum context, the platform operates on a peer-to-peer network where multiple participants, known as nodes, validate and record transactions on the blockchain.\n\nUnlike traditional centralized systems, where a single entity or authority controls the network, Ethereum relies on a consensus mechanism called Proof of Stake to achieve decentralization. In a PoS system, participants, known as validators, are chosen to create new blocks and secure the network based on the number of cryptocurrency tokens they hold, thus willing to \u201cstake\u201d as collateral. This mechanism ensures that no single entity can control the network, as the power to validate transactions and create new blocks remains distributed among multiple validators.\n\nDecentralization on Ethereum extends beyond the validation process. Smart contracts, self-executing contracts with predefined rules encoded on the blockchain, are a fundamental feature of Ethereum.\n\nThese contracts are executed in a decentralized manner, meaning they automatically enforce the agreed-upon terms without the need for intermediaries. It eliminates the need for trust in third parties and opens up many possibilities for applications such as decentralized finance (DeFi), decentralized exchanges (DEXs), and more.\n\nThe decentralized nature of Ethereum provides several advantages. First, it enhances security by eliminating single points of failure. Since the blockchain remains distributed across multiple nodes, it becomes highly resistant to censorship, manipulation, and cyberattacks. Additionally, decentralization promotes transparency, as all transactions and smart contract interactions are recorded on the public blockchain, making them verifiable by anyone.\n\nFurthermore, decentralization fosters innovation and empowers individuals. Anyone can participate in the Ethereum network as a developer, user, or validator, without requiring permission or approval from a central authority. Again, it helps lower entry barriers and encourages a diverse ecosystem of applications and services.\n\nHowever, decentralization also poses challenges. As the number of participants in the network grows, scalability becomes a concern. Ethereum has been upgrading its infrastructure, transitioning from the current proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a more scalable and energy-efficient PoS mechanism, Ethereum 2.0. This upgrade addresses scalability limitations and further enhances the network\u2019s decentralization.\n\nEthereum enables a new paradigm of trustless, permissionless, and innovative applications by distributing control, eliminating intermediaries, and promoting transparency. As the platform continues to evolve, it strives to achieve greater decentralization and scalability, paving the way for a more inclusive and decentralized future.\n\nWhat are the benefits of Ethereum?\n\nEthereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, offers several benefits that have contributed to its popularity and widespread adoption. Here are some of the key benefits of Ethereum:\n\nSmart contracts: Ethereum introduced the concept of smart contracts, which are self-executing agreements with the terms of the agreement directly written into the code. Smart contracts eliminate the need for intermediaries, such as banks or lawyers, and enable automated and trustless execution of transactions.\n\nDecentralization: Ethereum operates on a decentralized network of computers, known as nodes, which are spread across the globe. This decentralization makes Ethereum resistant to censorship, single points of failure, and control by any central authority. It provides a transparent and open platform for building decentralized applications (dApps).\n\nProgrammability: Ethereum\u2019s blockchain is programmable, allowing developers to create and deploy their applications on the network. The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) enables developers to write smart contracts and build decentralized applications using programming languages like Solidity. This programmability fosters innovation and enables a wide range of use cases.\n\nInteroperability: Ethereum\u2019s design allows for interoperability with other blockchain projects and tokens. Through standardized token protocols like ERC-20 (fungible tokens) and ERC-721 (non-fungible tokens), Ethereum has become a hub for creating and exchanging digital assets. This interoperability promotes integrating blockchain-based projects and facilitates liquidity and compatibility between tokens.\n\nTokenization and fundraising: Ethereum has revolutionized fundraising through Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and token sales. These mechanisms allow startups and projects to raise capital by issuing tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Tokenization enables fractional ownership, liquidity, and new models of investment and fundraising, opening up opportunities for innovative projects and democratizing access to investment opportunities.\n\nCommunity and ecosystem: Ethereum has a large and vibrant community of developers, enthusiasts, and contributors. This active community fosters collaboration, knowledge sharing, and the continuous development of the platform. Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem includes various tools, frameworks, and libraries that simplify dApp development, making it easier for developers to build on the forum.\n\nUpgrades and scalability solutions: Ethereum is continuously evolving to address its scalability challenges. Ethereum 2.0, a significant upgrade currently underway, aims to transition the network from a proof-of-work consensus algorithm to a proof-of-stake mechanism, enhancing scalability, security, and energy efficiency. Layer 2 scaling solutions, such as Optimistic Rollups and zk-rollups, provide off-chain scaling while leveraging Ethereum\u2019s security.\n\nEthereum\u2019s governance structure\n\nEthereum\u2019s governance structure was primarily decentralized, with decision-making power distributed among various stakeholders within the Ethereum community. However, it\u2019s important to note that the Ethereum ecosystem is constantly evolving, and there may have been changes or developments in its governance structure since then.\n\nThe core of Ethereum\u2019s governance is the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) process. EIPs are proposals for making changes or improvements to the Ethereum protocol. Anyone can submit an EIP, and the Ethereum community, including developers, miners, and users, can discuss and provide feedback on the proposals.\n\nThe decision-making process for accepting or rejecting an EIP is typically based on rough consensus, meaning that broad agreement and community support are sought before implementing any changes. The Ethereum community achieves harmony through discussions on various platforms, including forums, social media channels, and developer conferences.\n\nAnother critical element in Ethereum\u2019s governance structure is the role of core developers. These individuals or teams are responsible for maintaining and developing the Ethereum software. Core developers have significant influence in the decision-making process as they propose and implement changes to the protocol.\n\nHowever, Ethereum\u2019s governance is not solely reliant on core developers. The Ethereum community, including users and miners, also plays a crucial role in shaping the platform\u2019s direction. Major decisions like upgrades or hard forks often involve community-wide participation and signaling through rough consensus.\n\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that Ethereum has been working towards a more formalized governance structure. The Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, which aims to transition Ethereum from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, includes plans for a dedicated governance mechanism called the Ethereum DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization). The Ethereum DAO is intended to provide a more structured and decentralized governance framework for the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nNode distribution and mining are integral parts of the Ethereum network. Here\u2019s an overview of these concepts:\n\nNode distribution\n\nEthereum relies on a network of nodes to maintain the blockchain and ensure its decentralized nature. Nodes are computers or devices running Ethereum software that participate in the network by validating transactions, executing smart contracts, and storing a copy of the blockchain.\n\nNode distribution in Ethereum can remain categorized into the following types:\n\nFull Nodes: Full nodes store and validate the entire Ethereum blockchain. They participate in the consensus process and perform all necessary computations, making them resource-intensive. Full nodes contribute to the security and integrity of the network.\n\nArchive Nodes: Archive nodes go beyond full nodes by storing the blockchain\u2019s current state and the network\u2019s entire history. These nodes provide access to historical data, enabling developers to explore past transactions and smart contract states.\n\nLight Nodes: Light nodes, known as \u201clight clients,\u201d do not store the entire blockchain. Instead, they rely on full nodes to access specific data when needed. Light nodes offer fewer resource requirements and faster synchronization times but with fewer security guarantees than full nodes.\n\nPruned Nodes: Pruned nodes store a subset of the blockchain, usually limited to recent blocks. They discard older block data, which helps reduce storage requirements while still participating in the network.\n\nStaking\n\nThe concept of Ethereum staking refers to the process of participating in the Ethereum network\u2019s proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. In the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, the network has transitioned from proof-of-work (PoW) model, which relies on mining, to a PoS model, which relies on staking.\n\nStaking involves holding a certain amount of Ether (ETH) in a specialized wallet known as a staking wallet or validator node. Validators are responsible for proposing and validating new blocks in the Ethereum blockchain. By staking ETH, participants contribute to the network\u2019s security and decentralization.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the key elements in Ethereum staking:\n\nValidators: These are participants who lock up a minimum required amount of ETH as a stake to become validators. Validators are chosen to create new blocks and verify transactions based on the amount of ETH they hold.\n\nStaking Rewards: Validators earn staking rewards for their participation in block validation. The rewards are distributed in the form of additional ETH, encouraging validators to act honestly and follow the protocol rules. However, validators may also face penalties for malicious behavior or network rule violations.\n\nSlashing: Slashing is the penalty imposed on validators for violating the network\u2019s rules. It can occur if a validator attempts to manipulate the system or behaves dishonestly. Slashing may result in a partial or complete loss of the validator\u2019s staked ETH.\n\nStaking Pools: Staking pools, also known as staking services or staking providers, allow individuals to participate in staking without needing to run their own validator node. Participants pool their ETH together, and the staking pool operator manages the technical aspects of staking on behalf of the participants. Rewards are distributed proportionally to each participant\u2019s stake in the pool, minus any fees charged by the operator.\n\nChallenges to decentralization in Ethereum\n\nDecentralization is a core principle of the Ethereum blockchain, aiming to distribute power and control among its participants. While Ethereum has made significant progress toward decentralization, several challenges still need to be addressed. Here are some of the critical challenges to decentralization in Ethereum:\n\nScalability: One of the primary challenges for Ethereum is scalability. As the network grows and more users participate, the blockchain faces congestion and slower transaction processing times. This issue is particularly evident during periods of high demand, such as during popular decentralized applications (dApps) or token sales. Scalability solutions like Ethereum 2.0\u2019s implementation of shard chains and the transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism aim to address this challenge.\n\nCentralization of Mining Power: Currently, Ethereum relies on a proof-of-work consensus mechanism, where miners compete to solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions. Centralization of power has led to the concentration of mining power in a few large mining pools, creating centralization concerns. Ethereum\u2019s planned transition to PoS through Ethereum 2.0 aims to address this challenge by allowing token holders to become validators, reducing the reliance on specialized mining hardware.\n\nGovernance and Decision-Making: As Ethereum evolves and grows, making decisions about protocol upgrades, changes, and improvements becomes increasingly challenging. The Ethereum community follows a decentralized governance model, where stakeholders participate in discussions and signaling processes. However, achieving consensus among diverse stakeholders with varying interests can take time and effort. The Ethereum community actively explores various governance models, such as on-chain voting and delegated governance, to improve decision-making processes.\n\nUser Experience: Another challenge to decentralization in Ethereum is the user experience. Interacting with decentralized applications often requires specific technical knowledge and can be daunting for non-technical users. Improving the user experience and creating intuitive interfaces that abstract away the complexities of blockchain technology remains crucial to increasing user adoption and decentralization.\n\nRegulatory Challenges: The decentralized nature of Ethereum can sometimes clash with regulatory requirements and frameworks. Governments and regulatory bodies worldwide are still grappling with addressing decentralized technologies like Ethereum, which can present challenges regarding compliance and legal frameworks. Striking the right balance between regulatory compliance and preserving the decentralized nature of Ethereum is an ongoing challenge.\n\nAddressing these challenges requires a collective effort from the Ethereum community, developers, and stakeholders. Ethereum 2.0\u2019s phased rollout addresses scalability and mining centralization concerns, while ongoing research and development in governance models and user experience improvements can further enhance decentralization. Overcoming these challenges will be crucial for Ethereum to maintain its position as a leading decentralized blockchain platform and foster its long-term sustainability and growth.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum\u2019s decentralized nature is a subject of ongoing debate within the blockchain community. While Ethereum has made significant strides toward decentralization through its governance structure, node distribution, and active community participation, challenges remain.\n\nThe distribution of network nodes and the involvement of individual miners across the globe contribute to Ethereum\u2019s decentralization. However, concerns about the concentration of mining power and the rise of large mining pools pose challenges to maintaining a fully decentralized network.\n\nDespite these challenges, Ethereum\u2019s commitment to ongoing development and the upcoming transition to Ethereum 2.0 demonstrates its dedication to enhancing decentralization. Introducing PoS and other scalability solutions aims to address these challenges and further distribute decision-making power among participants.\n\nWhile Ethereum has its challenges, it remains one of the most decentralized blockchain platforms. Its governance structure, community involvement, and active development efforts illustrate Ethereum\u2019s commitment to maintaining a decentralized network that fosters innovation, transparency, and trust within the cryptocurrency ecosystem."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction by ChatGPT and Promising Tokens That Could Experience Bullish Trends - Inside Bitcoins",
        "content": "Don\u2019t invest unless prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, you shouldn\u2019t expect to be protected if something goes wrong.\n\nJoin Our Telegram channel to stay up to date on breaking news coverage\n\nEthereum\u2019s price movement in the last 7 days has stirred the crypto market, raising several predictions for the crypto by both technical analysts and artificial intelligence, ChatGPT.\n\nOn June 15, 2023, Ethereum\u2019s market price was $1,650.50. However, the strong bullish momentum on its price sent it to $1,716.67 by June 17.\n\nAlthough the crypto had traded within the $1700 level in the last four days, recording $1,727.19 on June 18 and $1,792 on June 21, Ethereum has reached a new price level today, June 23.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $1,878.40, with a 0.77% price difference compared to its last price on the historical data (June 22).\n\nConsidering the recent bullish signals of this cryptocurrency, many crypto enthusiasts may rely on the correlating price prediction of experts and AI tools like ChatGPT, hoping it could reach the $2000 mark before 2023 ends. As such, here\u2019s a price prediction for Ethereum in the short and long-term by ChatGPT.\n\nChatGPT Price Prediction for Ethereum 2023\n\nThe OpenAI product, ChatGPT, is an artificial intelligence model that has experienced an exponential growth level since its release. Its diverse utility includes information research and prediction.\n\nChatGPT is not a 100% prediction tool, especially for digital currencies and some other digital assets. However, its predictions can provide investors and crypto enthusiasts with a higher viewpoint concerning the outlook of crypto.\n\nAccording to Analytics Insight, ChatGPT predicts Ethereum in the bullish market to trade between the values of $16,391 and $18,213 by the end of 2023.\n\nOn the other hand, the bearish outlooks of ChatGPT\u2019s prediction showcased Ethereum to experience potential price dips to $2000 or further to $1,000 also by the end of 2023.\n\nSince ChatGPT\u2019s prediction for Ethereum by the end of the year is not definitive, the technical analysis of the crypto on Tradingview could hint at what to expect in the nearest future.\n\nEthereum Short and Long-Term Price Outlook Based on Technical Indicators\n\nThe technical indicators on the crypto analytics platform, Tradingview, signal bullish trends for Ethereum in the short and long term.\n\nETH\u2019s Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) indicator is above the signal line, confirming the strong bullish momentum of the crypto\u2019s price. Considering the bold green bar on the histogram, ETH is likely to uphold its green candlestick throughout today.\n\nAlso, the 50-Day and 200-Day Simple Moving Averages (SMA) are below Ethereum\u2019s current price, indicating the asset\u2019s short and long-term bullish market.\n\nAs such, ETH is prone to prolong green days in the coming days to weeks, tipping at the possibility of the crypto reaching $1900 in the next few weeks.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator shows a neutral market position of Ethereum, sitting at 59.01. Its slight horizontal movement indicates a competitive market between the buyers and sellers.\n\nIf SELL trades increase more than the BUY trades, the RSI could plummet, projecting an approach toward the oversold zone (below 30) and a trend reversal.\n\nHowever, if BUY trades surpass the SELL trades, Ethereum\u2019s market position could fall into the overbought zone (above 70), making it overvalued in the crypto market.\n\nThis could set Ethereum on a bullish run, thus recording the explosions as predicted by ChatGPT. Besides Ethereum, here are some promising tokens that could experience bullish trends in the future.\n\nLaunchpad XYZ (LPX)\n\nLaunchpad XYZ crypto is a digital currency that helps new blockchain projects raise funds and gain exposure.\n\nIt acts as a platform where investors can participate in token sales and support innovative projects.

        "title": "Who is the Founder of Ethereum? ETH Crypto - Coin Culture",
        "content": "Launched after Bitcoin, Ethereum has retained its place as the second-largest cryptocurrency both in market cap and trading volume. The token remains one of the biggest inventions in the crypto market with unprecedented market impact.\n\nWhile Bitcoin is meant to only work as a cryptocurrency, Ethereum comes with a diverse computing and infrastructural design to work as a cryptocurrency and also support the development of other decentralised applications (Dapps). The effectiveness of Ethereum has made it successful in various use cases like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralised finances (DeFi).\n\nWith the token becoming more integral, it\u2019s only natural to wonder who created Ethereum.\n\nVitalik Buterin and the creation of Ethereum\n\nVitalik Buterin, a Russian-Canadian programmer, 19 years by then, conceived the idea of Ethereum in 2013. He was looking to expand the reach of blockchain technology by developing a platform that supported the development of Dapps. By then, he was working on various Bitcoin projects.\n\nButerin had first heard about Bitcoin in 2017 from his father. He, however, downplayed the possibility of Bitcoin becoming successful. He later had a chance second interaction with the token and understood how it would impact the financial landscape. Having no financial or computing capacity to mine Bitcoin, he opted to work and get paid in the currency. He would contribute to various online Bitcoin sites then get paid in BTC. He later teamed with Mihai Alisie, to create Bitcoin Magazine in 2011.\n\nThe magazine allowed him to gain much information about Bitcoin. He started analysing Bitcoin\u2019s underlying technology while creating various projects on the codebase like Coloured Coins, Mastercoin, and other altcoins. These projects led him to realise how Bitcoin\u2019s scope was limited.\n\nWithin the two years in Bitcoin, Buterin had interacted with several crypto enthusiasts. These excerpts were working on ways to expand the Bitcoin blockchain\u2019s functionality. It, however, became apparent that the only way to have a limitless platform is to create a new network.\n\nThe realisation led to the idea of Ethereum. Buterin started working on the project and within four weeks he had completed the Ethereum whitepaper. He released the document in November 2013 to become the founder of Ethereum. The document detailed a new open-source platform for developing decentralised applications.\n\nThe idea was a hit among various cryptocurrency enthusiasts, with various joining the project. Some of the renowned names that started working on the project include; Mihai Alisie, Anthony Di Lorio, Amir Chetrit, Charles Hoskinson, and Gavin Wood.\n\nEthereum was officially launched in 2014 on the Bitcointalks forums. The Ethereum foundation held the most successful crowd sale at the time, in July 2014 selling over 60 million Ether. 12 million of the tokens were set aside for the platform\u2019s development and marketing. It then released a barebone platform after a year for developers to start utilizing to create decentralised applications.\n\nThe Ethereum network and community have since grown to be an integral part of the crypto market.\n\nWhat is Vitalik Buterin Networth?\n\nGiven the success of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin\u2019s net worth has increased over the years. According to Celebrity Net Worth, Buterin is worth over $1Billion. He holds around 335,000 Ether, whose value changes with the market value of ETH. He also has substantial amounts of SHIB and Rugging, both altcoins."

        "content": "It has become a brutal world for altcoin holders following the SEC\u2019s ruling, and more than $35 billion was wiped off the market cap of the altcoins deemed securities collectively. The general consensus among the community is clear: DeFi is the way forward, and from now on, innovation will take place worldwide instead of in the United States.\n\n\n\nDespite Tron (TRX) being labeled as a security, analysts remain bullish, primarily because Tron (TRX) is now available on Ethereum (ETH), improving its liquidity and general use cases in DeFi. But the ERC-20 altcoin everyone watches is Tradecurve (TCRV) which continues to set new highs.\n\n>>BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW<<\n\nTradecurve (TCRV) Trading-Specialized ERC-20 Altcoin\n\nTradecurve sets new highs and still has plenty of room to grow. Tradecurve employs a hybrid infrastructure model rolling the best of centralized and decentralized services into one fluid platform. The protocol has the ease of use of a CEX but the privacy and custodial elements of a DEX.\n\n\n\nTradecurve opens the door to TradFi primary assets in DeFi, and this revolutionary market access has analysts forecasting $TCRV will 50X before the presale closes. Instead of solely crypto-trading pairs, Tradecurve lets investors trade on bonds, commodities, and forex, all from crypto-to-derivatives pairings.\n\n\n\nThe experience mirrors the order book model found on CEXs with slippage-free and rapid fills. But everything else is entirely DeFi. Transparent on-chain pricing, self-custody, and a real focus on privacy- Tradecurve has no KYC policy!\n\n\n\nAs trading products become harder to access for retail traders, Tradecurve shines a light in the dark and offers true financial inclusion for users worldwide- multiple financial instruments and asset classes from a single platform.\n\n\n\nTradecurve will rapidly become a trading hub, and its current trajectory puts it on a path to overtaking even globally established trading giants like Huobi and OKB. Set to onboard 100,000 traders within the first three months.\n\nThe $TCRV presale may even outshine the legendary $BNB ICO listed in 2017 at an initial price of $0.15.\n\nTron (TRX) Enters the Ethereum Landscape\n\nTron (TRX) lost 10% in the last seven days due to the SEC labeling Tron (TRX) a security, but analysts signal this is short-term noise with their price predictions. They forecast Tron (TRX) trading in a band between $0.13 and $0.15 in 2024, showing a nearly 100% upside in the next twelve months. Although Tron (TRX) cannot even come close to matching $TCRV\u2019s growth potential, these growth predictions remain impressive.\n\n\n\nTron (TRX) has begun to establish itself more globally, with founder Justin Sun pursuing a license for Huobi to operate in Hong Kong. This pivot towards Eastern markets and the capital exposure it will bring, provide an excellent long-term catalyst for Tron (TRX) growth.\n\n\n\nTron (TRX) launching within the Ethereum (ETH) ecosystem provides another major boon, and this layer one continues to grow its TVL (Total value Locked) and utility within the broader DeFi ecosystem.\n\nLearn more about Tradecurve and the TCRV token below:\n\nClick Here For Website\n\nClick Here To Buy TCRV Presale Tokens\n\nFollow Us Twitter\n\nJoin Our Community on Telegram"
