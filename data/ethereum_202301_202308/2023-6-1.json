        "title": "Ethereum Miner Dumped ETH After Merge in Favor of Dogecoin - Blockworks",
        "content": "Crypto miner BIT Mining (BTCM) once made most of its self-mining revenue from Ethereum. After the Merge, it\u2019s increasingly relying on Dogecoin and Litecoin for fresh cash.\n\nThe miner, based in Ohio and listed on the New York Stock Exchange, reported revenue of $72.9 million for last quarter \u2014 a near-20% jump from the previous period but down 75% year on year.\n\nBIT Mining\u2019s revenue comes from three primary business areas: mining crypto itself, mining as part of a pool and hosting services in its datacenters.\n\nThe firm\u2019s mining pool revenue came in at $60 million last quarter, making up 82% of its total inflows, while self-mining and datacenters each brought in about $6 million.\n\nAs noted by analyst Mike Fay (via Seeking Alpha), Ethereum mining contributed more than three-quarters of BIT\u2019s self-mining revenue leading up to the Merge last September.\n\nThe event transitioned Ethereum away from energy-intensive proof of work to proof of stake, eliminating the need for crypto miners as part of consensus.\n\nBIT Mining\u2019s self-mining revenue predictably nosedived after the switch, dropping from $7.1 million in Q3 2022 to $1.9 million in the following period.\n\nThe firm mined $6.2 million crypto in the first quarter of 2023 \u2014 most of it litecoin (LTC) and dogecoin (DOGE) after shutting down certain bitcoin mining rigs.\n\nDogecoin and Litecoin hashrates skyrocketed to all-time highs directly around the Merge, although their hashing algorithms differ from Ethereum\u2019s. Crypto miners are able to direct their rigs at Dogecoin and Litecoin simultaneously through what\u2019s known as \u201cmerge-mining.\u201d\n\nBTCM has drastically underperformed the crypto market, as well as major miners Riot and Marathon\n\nBIT Mining sold ETH over staking it\n\nFay found one move particularly confounding: BIT Mining sold one-third of its ETH holdings between quarters, amounting to 1,602 ETH ($3 million at current prices).\n\nOn the other hand, the firm held 62% more dogecoin quarter on quarter, going from 42.8 million DOGE ($3.1 million) to 69.5 million DOGE ($5 million). Its bitcoin holdings (289 BTC worth $7.8 million) remained unchanged.\n\nThat means BIT Mining\u2019s crypto balance sheet was almost 28% DOGE at the end of Q1 2023. Its total assets were $40.2 million with $39 million liabilities, including lease obligations.\n\n\u201cThe company\u2019s crypto treasury management decisions are odd from where I sit,\u201d Fay wrote in his report. \u201cWhile I\u2019ve made it no secret that I think assets like Dogecoin don\u2019t have much of a future, in my view the more egregious decision is selling the ETH on the balance sheet when the company could be generating rewards by staking it natively on-chain.\u201d\n\nFay continued: \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to understand why management would opt instead for holding meme coins rather than selling all DOGE production and staking Ethereum at virtually no cost. BTCM is still an avoid for me.\u201d Blockworks has reached out to BIT Mining for comment.\n\nThanks to rising ETH prices this year, BIT Mining\u2019s ether stash is worth practically the same\n\nIn any case, BIT Mining has reportedly only managed to generate a positive net income for one quarter between 2016 and 2022 while increasingly diluting its shares as of 2021.\n\nBIT Mining, which commands a $31 million market cap, is up 85% across 2023 so far but down the same amount over the past year.\n\nDavid Canellis contributed reporting.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "3 Cryptos That Are Better Buys Than Bitcoin or Ethereum - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Many crypto investors will likely assert that no cryptos are better buys than Bitcoin (BTC-USD) or Ethereum (ETH-USD). To some extent, when measuring for risk-adjusted returns over the long-term, that argument holds water, as there are several high potential cryptos better than Bitcoin worth considering.\n\nHowever, not all investors are looking at crypto with the same investing time horizon or frame of reference. Over the near-term, a number of other top tokens have performed very well, and may outperform these top two cryptos over time.\n\nAmidst the backdrop of a domestic banking crisis and looming concerns over a U.S. debt default, investors are increasingly considering cryptocurrencies as potential safe haven assets to navigate the economic challenges ahead. This shift in thinking marks a significant departure from just six months ago when the prevailing belief was that the \u201ccrypto winter\u201d would persist well into 2023.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBut, the question arises: Are there any genuinely secure cryptocurrencies to invest in at present? If so, which ones should investors consider adding to their portfolios this month? Here are three cryptos on the top of my list of projects that could potentially outperform Bitcoin and Ethereum over the next 2-3 years.\n\nSymbol Cryptocurrency Price XMR-USD Monero $145.68 AVAX-USD Avalanche $14.44 SOL-USD Solana $20.50\n\nMonero (XMR-USD)\n\nA concept coin for Monero (XMR) has a sparkly gold background\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIntroduced in 2014, Monero (XMR-USD) is a decentralized cryptocurrency and blockchain network that prioritizes privacy. With its advanced features like stealth addresses and ring signatures, Monero ensures user anonymity. Nonetheless, this commitment to privacy has also attracted heightened regulatory attention globally. This makes it one of those high potential cryptos better than Bitcoin.\n\nMonero is a leading privacy coin, offering complete anonymity and untraceability for its blockchain transactions. By employing advanced technology, Monero conceals the sender, recipient, and transaction amount, providing a high level of privacy. Encapsulating its ethos, with its motto \u201csecure, private, untraceable,\u201d Monero has garnered global user appeal. The rising demand for privacy coins has propelled XMR\u2019s price up by 16% over the past six months.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother key point is that despite regulatory and legislative scrutiny due to its potential involvement in illicit activities like international money laundering, Monero remains popular among users who are undeterred by such criticisms. The usage and value of XMR have consistently increased, with a remarkable 76% rise since 2017. Crypto enthusiasts believe that the ongoing regulation of cryptocurrencies will further drive users toward the privacy provided by Monero, indicating promising prospects for continued growth.\n\nMonero relies on Proof-of-Work for decentralized consensus and offers private, secure, and untraceable transactions through an opaque blockchain. With a default privacy setting, Monero utilizes ring confidential transactions, ring signatures, and stealth addresses. As a fungible and secure digital currency, Monero prioritizes user privacy, leading to a promising future ahead.\n\nAvalanche (AVAX-USD)\n\nGraphic of various cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum resting on a United Kingdom Union Jack flag\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/rawf8\n\nAvalanche (AVAX-USD) started May 2023 on a bullish note, trading at $16.66. Despite the bears maintaining a price of $14 since May 18, Avalanche is now edging toward the $15 mark, aiming to regain its positive price trend. The surge in trading volume indicates increased activity on the network.\n\nRecently, Avalanche has established significant support at the $14.29 price level, acting as a pivotal point for the asset. Currently, it is trading above this immediate resistance level. However, the presence of bearish market forces persists, aiming to prevent AVAX from surpassing the next resistance level at $15.21. Despite its bearish nature in the short-term, it\u2019s still one of those high potential cryptos better than Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, the integration of the Ethereum Virtual Machine sets Avalanche apart as a favored platform. Developers can now create decentralized applications on a broader scale while leveraging the advantages of a faster and more economical blockchain. The Avalanche Bridge further enhances convenience and accessibility by facilitating seamless asset transfers across multiple blockchains.\n\nThe bottom line is that Avalanche stands out as a superior choice in terms of security compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum. Its unique feature of subnets allows the creation of both private and public blockchains, adding versatility to its network. With practical applications in the real world, Avalanche exhibits immense potential for value and growth. Despite facing a significant downturn in the 2022 bear market, Avalanche has made a remarkable recovery in 2023, positioning itself as a compelling contender in the realm of decentralized finance.\n\nSolana (SOL-USD)\n\nSolana logo on phone screen stock image. Solana price predictions.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nSolana (SOL-USD) empowers the development of decentralized applications (DApps) through its distinctive hybrid consensus model. By merging proof-of-history (PoH) with underlying proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus, Solana achieves exceptionally fast transaction processing. Furthermore, this speed makes it appealing to individual traders as well as institutional investors seeking efficient blockchain solutions.\n\nSolana, launched by the Solana Foundation in March 2020, stands out as an unconventional cryptocurrency project. It prioritizes functionality and operates on an open-source framework, utilizing blockchain technology to drive decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions. Notably, Solana excels in both transaction speed and cost-efficiency, ensuring scalability and rapid processing. However, the network has faced intermittent outages, impacting its value and ambitions. Some critics also raise concerns about its tokenomics favoring venture capital investors. Nonetheless, Solana remains a significant player in the cryptocurrency realm.\n\nIn summary, Solana has seen a remarkable 100% surge this year, solidifying its position as an innovation powerhouse. In addition to this, their latest breakthrough, the Saga crypto phone, has the potential to revolutionize the crypto landscape. The Saga is an Android-powered mobile device designed to simplify and enhance crypto activities. With its pioneering Seed Vault technology, it streamlines the process of using your phone as a crypto wallet, eliminating common challenges faced by conventional phones. Experience a new level of convenience and efficiency in managing your crypto assets with the Saga crypto phone.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald has a position in ETH, SOL.

        "content": "Naturally, the question of whether Ethereum will overtake Bitcoin by total market cap is very interesting to crypto investors.\n\nAnd there are some pretty strong arguments to be made on both sides, which is why we decided to engage with unbiased AI chatbots.\n\nWill Ethereum Bitcoin Flippening Happen?\n\nBitcoin maxis believe BTC will be the world\u2019s most common reserve currency for international trade. In that scenario, Ethereum would have to be some kind of global computer with incredible levels of user adoption. Only if it achieves world-class network activity on its platform would it stand a chance in such a future.\n\nBut the flippening of Bitcoin by Ethereum is no idle question. The second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, at its peak levels of market dominance, has comprised as much as 25% of the value of all traded cryptos. That was in 2017. For the past couple of years, the percentage has ranged in the mid to high teens.\n\nEarlier this month, we asked OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT if Ethereum can flip Bitcoin in five years. The short version of ChatGPT\u2019s answer? Such an outcome is \u201cuncertain and depends on various factors.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what Google AI\u2019s Bard chatbot had to say in answer to the same question we put to ChatGPT:\n\n\u201cDo you think Ethereum\u2019s price can flip Bitcoin\u2019s price in the next 5 years?\u201d\n\nThe short version of Bard\u2019s answer?\n\n\u201cIt is possible\u2026\u201d\n\nGoogle Bard vs. ChatGPT Showdown:\n\nBard said:\n\n\u201cUltimately, the question of whether Ethereum will flip Bitcoin will depend on a number of factors, including the continued adoption of Ethereum, the success of Ethereum\u2019s planned upgrades, and the overall performance of the cryptocurrency market.\u201d\n\nAdoption rates are the key metrics here that push the cryptocurrencies\u2019 values up or down in the market. Bard agreed with ChatGPT on that:\n\n\u201cEthereum has a broader range of use cases than Bitcoin, including decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and smart contracts. As these use cases continue to grow in popularity, it could lead to increased demand for Ethereum and a higher price.\u201d\n\nGoogle Bard was sure to qualify that although possible, the ETH flippening may not happen:\n\n\u201cOverall, it is possible that Ethereum could flip Bitcoin in the next 5 years. However, there are a number of factors that could prevent this from happening.\u201d\n\nBard said some of those factors include Bitcoin\u2019s first-mover advantage, its \u201cgreater security,\u201d and the overall performance of the cryptocurrency market."

        "content": "Ethereum price started a decent increase above the $1,870 resistance against the US Dollar. ETH could attempt an upside break above the key $1,920 resistance.\n\nEthereum is slowly attempting a recovery wave from the $1,840 support zone.\n\nThe price is trading above $1,870 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance near $1,870 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could start a strong increase if it clears the $1,880 and $1,900 resistance levels.\n\nEthereum Price Holds Support\n\nEthereum\u2019s price managed to stay above the $1,840 support. ETH formed a base and recently started a recovery wave from the $1,838 low, similar to Bitcoin.\n\nThere was a break above the $1,870 resistance level. The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,916 swing high to the $1,838 low. Besides, there was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance near $1,870 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nEther is now trading above $1,870 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There are also chances of a short-term inverse head and shoulders pattern on the same chart. Immediate resistance is near the $1,880 zone. The next major resistance is near the $1,885 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,916 swing high to the $1,838 low.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nA proper move above the $1,880 and $1,885 resistance levels might send Ether toward $1,920. The next resistance sits near $1,940, above which Ethereum could rise toward $2,000. Any more gains above the $2,000 resistance zone might send the price toward the $2,120 resistance.\n\nFresh Decline in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,880 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,870 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThe next major support is near the $1,855 zone. If there is a break below the $1,855 support, the price could decline toward the $1,840 support. Any more losses may perhaps send the price toward the $1,800 level or even $1,740 in the coming sessions.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is above the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,840\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,880\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe Ethereum ecosystem finds itself in the throes of a controversy surrounding the outsized footprint one of its staking pools, Lido Finance (LDO), has on the overall network.\n\n\u201cCentralization concerns around LSD\u2019s are well-founded\u201d began a tweet by founder of The Daily Gwei and independent Ethereum educator, Anthony Sassano. He added: \u201cIf my fellow Ethereans want Lido dominance to go down, then they need to create and promote better liquid staking protocols.\u201d\n\nMany of my fellow Ethereans are going to hate me for this tweet, but it needs to be tweeted. Centralization concerns around LSD's are well-founded and I agree with a lot of them but the solutions presented often leave a lot to be desired (particularly putting too much emphasis\u2026 \u2014 sassal.eth \ud83e\udd87\ud83d\udd0a (@sassal0x) June 1, 2023\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe current controversy surrounding the Ethereum ecosystem refers to liquid staking derivatives, or LSDs, particularly with Lido Finance.\n\nLiquid staking refers to depositing Ethereum in a protocol that then pools it with other user deposits and stakes the ETH on their behalf. In return, users get another token representing their staked position which accumulates its own rewards. In Lido\u2019s case, users receive Staked Ethereum, or stETH.\n\nThe threat at hand is the current market dominance of Lido, which currently accounts for 74% of all LSDs according to DeFi Llama. The pool contains more than 7 million ETH, worth approximately $13 billion dollars\u2014and it has grown by 12% over the past thirty days.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that centralization is easy\u201d, pseudonymous Ethereum Beacon Chain community manager Superphiz told Decrypt. He added that the current situation with Lido is risky because although [a staking provider] \u201ccan not halt the chain or prevent transactions, it is still a critical threat to the social decentralization of the chain.\u201d\n\nAnother concern are the aforementioned LSDs, derivatives which are created on top of the staked ETH. Derivatives, in finance, refer to an instrument that derives its value from another asset. They are used to further speculate on any given asset, in this case ETH.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCall to action on this likely to be when LIDO or big competitor faces gov action and starts censoring to avoid criminal charges. I\u2019ll be very impressed if ethereum community can mitigate the centralizing before that happens. \u2014 Ari Paul \u26d3\ufe0f (@AriDavidPaul) June 1, 2023\n\nAri Paul, founder of BlockTower Capital, said on Twitter the main problem with this degree of centralization is \u201cwhen Lido faces government action and starts censoring to avoid criminal charges.\u201d\n\nHis concerns echo discussion around centralization last year, before the Ethereum merge. At the time, the worry was that centralized entities would block certain transactions, like wallets that had interacted with US-sanctioned Ethereum mixer Tornado Cash.\n\nPaul added that he would be \u201cvery impressed\u201d if the Ethereum community can mitigate this centralization.\n\nBut there are further concerns, written by none other than the Ethereum Foundation itself. In a blog post, The Risks of LSD, the foundation writes that if LSD exceed consensus thresholds, they could create \u201cblock space cartels.\u201d These cartels can achieve outsized profits thanks to their coordinated maximal extractable value (MEV) extraction, block timing manipulation, and censorship.\n\nPut plainly: The bigger any one pooled staking \"cartel\" becomes, the more rewards it earns, and the greater the incentive for users to pool their funds with that provider.\n\nUnfortunately, not staking through a pool carries huge disincentives, according to Ethereum core developer and co-author of EIP-1559, Eric Conner. \"Solo staking experience is a nightmare\u201d he said, adding he doesn\u2019t blame anyone for going straight to LSDs.\n\nEveryone being champions for LSD and client diversity. I\u2019m going to be the champion that bluntly tells everyone solo staking experience is a nightmare and I don\u2019t blame anyone for just saying fuck it and going to LSDs. We have to fix the UX of solo staking! \u2014 eric.eth (@econoar) June 1, 2023\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSolo staking can be a daunting task, which is why many use platforms like Lido.\n\nIt requires 32 ETH, or approximately $60,500 dollars, plus a fair amount of technical knowledge. Maintaining a validator node requires certain pieces of hardware, an understanding of key management, and mitigating the risks of going offline because downtime could mean paying penalties.\n\nHe added that Ethereum needs to fix the UX of solo staking, thanking Dappnode for making it \u201cas easy as 1 click.\u201d The company sells \"no technical knowledge required\" hardware that people can use to set up Ethereum or Bitcoin nodes at home and maintains free open source software for a more DIY approach.\n\nConner singled them out as \u201cthe only one doing something about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to see action\u201d was Sassano\u2019s ending note on Twitter. He added that \u201ceveryone who is building an LSD or part of an LSD community this is a call to action for you - it's time to kick it into high gear and eat Lido's breakfast, lunch, and dinner (and second dinner).\u201d"

Ethereum is the largest DeFi ecosystem, with the total value of assets locked in over 800 protocols at over $80 billion, according to DeFillama data.\n\nMeanwhile, Tron has the second-highest TVL among blockchain networks, with $5.61 billion locked on 22 protocols.\n\nCryptoSlate data shows that TRX is up 1.77% in the last 24 hours, trading at $0.07628 as of press time.\n\nTron\u2019s daily transaction hits new high\n\nOn June 1, Sun tweeted that the Tron blockchain hit a new record high amount of daily transactions as it processed nearly 11 million transactions on May 31.\n\nSun said the milestone indicated the network\u2019s growing popularity and widespread usage by the community. The crypto entrepreneur added that his team had set a new target of doubling this volume within the following year.\n\nSun said:\n\n\u201cThis increase isn\u2019t just a measure of quantity, but also a testament to the quality and efficiency of our network. The growth in transactions is expected to bolster protocol revenue, proving that TRON\u2018s fundamentals remain strong even in a challenging market.\u201d\n\nTron has been involved in several activities to increase its usage since the beginning of the year. On May 7, the network urged meme coin developers to use its ecosystems to develop their tokens while offering up to $1 million in reimbursements for trading gas fees.\n\nEarlier, the blockchain launched a $100 AI development million fund to encourage developers to create applications on its network using tools like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems are steadily gaining popularity, with the advent of ChatGPT leading the way. The AI landscape now welcomes Google\u2019s Bard, the latest addition to this domain.\n\nAlthough still in its experimental phase, Bard showcases impressive language processing capabilities, which have found practical applications in cryptocurrencies. The tool\u2019s unique potential lies in its ability to generate feasible price projections for various digital assets, including Ethereum (ETH).\n\nGiven this context, Finbold utilized Bard on June 1, seeking its predictive insights on Ethereum\u2019s potential price trajectory by the end of 2023.\n\nBard noted there are a number of factors that could influence the price, including the continued growth of the decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) markets, the adoption of the network by mainstream businesses and institutions, as well as any major changes to the Ethereum protocol, all in all, it said if these factors are positive \u201cETH could reach $2,500 or even higher by the end of the year.\u201d\n\nETH end of 2023 price predictions. Source: Google Bard\n\nEthereum price predictions\n\nIn addition, Bard also provided insights into notable price predictions for the end of 2023 from reputable institutions and platforms.\n\nAmong these forecasts, Gov Capital, a financial research firm that uses a combination of technical analysis and fundamental analysis to make cryptocurrency price predictions, projects that Ethereum will reach a price of $2,587 by the end of 2023.\n\nOn the other hand, DigitalCoinPrice offered an average price target of $2,878, while PricePrediction using its own artificial intelligence, suggests Ethereum will reach a maximum price of $3,000 and a minimum price of $1,808 in 2023.\n\nETH end of 2023 price predictions. Source: Google Bard\n\n\n\nETH price analysis\n\nEthereum is trading at $1,861, showing a minor decrease of 0.36% in the past 24 hours. However, it has experienced a positive trend over the last seven days, with a gain of 3.40%.\n\nETH 24-hour price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nThe recent slight decline in price within the last 24 hours could be attributed to various factors, such as investors securing profits or a general downturn in the cryptocurrency market. Nevertheless, the overall trajectory over the past week remains optimistic, indicating sustained bullish sentiment among Ethereum investors.\n\nKey price levels to observe include the support level at $1,784, which corresponds to the 50-day moving average. A drop below this level may suggest a more significant price decline. On the other hand, the resistance level at $1,941 represents the 200-day moving average. A breakthrough above this level could indicate a notable price increase.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice. Investing is speculative.

In a recent update shared with his more than 3.6 million followers on Twitter, the protocol's founder Justin Sun said Tron is live on Ethereum by leveraging the BitTorrent Bridge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#TRON (#TRX) has now expanded its reach by going live on the #Ethereum blockchain by leveraging the #BitTorrent bridge . With the contract address 0x50327c6c5a14dcade707abad2e27eb517df87ab5, #TRX is now fully accessible within the Ethereum ecosystem. \u2014 H.E. Justin Sun \u5b59\u5b87\u6668 (@justinsuntron) June 2, 2023\n\nSun went on to share a public address on the Tron-Ethereum smart contract, reemphasizing the full accessibility of Tron on the pioneering decentralized finance (DeFi) network. The news is a big deal for Tron, whose ecosystem had been relatively close since its inception.\n\nThe bridge to Ethereum implies that TRX can now find direct applications on several Ethereum-based DeFi platforms and dApps. The Ethereum protocol is arguably the biggest and more robust hub for DeFi innovations, with many protocols developing compatibility through the Ethereum Virtual Machine Engine (EVM).\n\nThough Tron is bridging to Ethereum using an entirely different route, the underlying purpose will be to tap into the deep liquidity of the latter blockchain protocol. This move has a huge upside for TRX, whose price has largely lagged behind its peers over the past few years.\n\nAt the time of writing, Tron was changing hands at a price of $0.07647, up by 2.22% over the past 24 hours.\n\nHigh affinity for Ethereum\n\nWhile Justin Sun is not making much fuss about the new interoperability Tron has just achieved with Ethereum, other protocols saw it as a very big deal.\n\nSince the start of the year, protocols like Filecoin and EOS have launched their EVM compatible outfits, as both aimed at capitalizing on the robust ecosystem of Ethereum, to the benefits of their users.\n\nThere are multiple benefits in developing EVM compatibility with Ethereum as the connecting blockchain can also access additional protocols beyond just Ethereum with similar compatibility."

        "title": "Web3 adds semantic layer to Ethereum for a decentralized society - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Focusing too much on the tokenization of assets instead of encoding social relationships of trust was a key complaint regarding the current state of Web3 that found a clear voice in a mid-2022 paper published by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin along with E. Glen Weyl and Puja Ohlhaver. Titled \u201cDecentralized Society: Finding Web3's Soul,\u201d the paper explores soulbound tokens (SBTs), a unique form of nonfungible tokens (NFTs) that represent the credentials of a user.\n\nNontransferable by design, SBTs have the potential to play a key role in building a decentralized society, according to the authors. However, while an SBT verifies an individual\u2019s credentials, affiliations and commitments, it lacks the social context required for a decentralized society \u2014 representing only half the answer by itself.\n\nDecentralized social graphs act as a bridge between SBTs and society by representing each user\u2019s interconnected web of relationships across social networks. Combined with publicly verifiable SBTs, decentralized social graphs present an opportunity to empower users with greater control over their online identities while addressing privacy, security and ownership concerns widespread by centralized social networks.\n\nDecentralized Web3 society\n\nSocial media became a major use case for the internet during the 2010s, with the user base reaching 4.7 billion around the globe, according to reports from 2022. Onboarding even a fraction of the Web2 user base to Web3 would expand the blockchain and crypto ecosystem by a significant margin.\n\nSocial networks can benefit from the openness and decentralization of blockchain technology to give control and sovereignty back to users. However, while it\u2019s relatively easy to integrate blockchain into one social network, people rarely use just one social media platform. In fact, according to research, users spend time on over six different social networks on average. Since blockchain is yet to have something like the HTTP protocol of the web or OAuth for social networks, interoperability comes forth as a major challenge.\n\nWeb3 startups are now racing to find the ideal balance between interoperability, privacy and user-centric data ownership to onboard the next billion people to a decentralized society. To enable users to create an online identity with a social context, Relation Labs, a Hong Kong-based Web3 company backed by the digital asset financial services group HashKey, developed Semantic SBTs, also known as EIP-6239, on Ethereum.\n\nThe \u201csemantic layer\u201d on SBTs enables machines to understand complex actions in a subject/predicate/object manner. When a person follows another on Twitter, the machine can grasp this by defining the follower as the subject, the act of following as the predicate, and the user who gets followed as the object. Coupled with the social connections between people, semantics make it possible for machines or algorithms to map the interconnected relation map of society.\n\nSimilarly, Semantic SBT captures the social information including connections, endorsements or network contributions linked to a person\u2019s wallet address either with or without a profile name to represent an individual\u2019s identity with a social context as an asset. These social assets utilize the core principles of blockchain \u2014 decentralization, immutability and transparency \u2014 to give Web3 users control over their social data and interactions.\n\nHow a decentralized social graph operates across Web3. Source: Relation Labs\n\nUsing the RDF data standard of the World Wide Web Consortium for better interoperability, Relation Labs enable seamless encoding and decoding of social data with other decentralized applications (DApps) and platforms. This helps users interact with their social graph and decentralized identity across different services. The high level of interoperability enables Web3 users to leverage their social connections and identity seamlessly across different applications, with the key to access in the user\u2019s hands.\n\nAI meets decentralized identity\n\nAs a decentralized social graph protocol, Relation Labs lays the foundation of social DApps and communities with a relation-based account system and decentralized data layer. Using the customizable privacy and interoperability features of the Relation protocol as a basis, the Web3 ecosystem can build complex and linked data structures.\n\nTo demonstrate how the integration of decentralized social graphs and social identity would benefit the Web3 space, developers launched Relation ONE, a Web3-native chat plugin. Users can chat with each other in NFT marketplaces, DAOs or communities by only sharing their wallet address, thus making pseudonymous chatting over an NFT for buyers and sellers possible. Relation ONE works with multiple wallets, including Metamask, Binance Wallet and WalletConnect, showcasing the interoperability of the protocol.\n\nRelation leverages artificial intelligence (AI) on top of social graphs and identity data to more efficiently analyze user preferences, behaviors and social connections. AI makes it possible to create more personalized user experiences by utilizing the data from decentralized identities. With smart and automated privacy controls that take a cue from user behavior, AI also enhances data privacy and control. Transactional data also helps AI to patterns and detect potentially fraudulent activity. Using Relation Labs\u2019 AI tools, DApps can build tailored user interfaces, identify reputable users and automate content moderation processes.\n\n\u201cIntegrating the power of social identity, structured social data and AI, we\u2019re revolutionizing the ecosystem,\u201d said Jessica Chang, founder of Relation Labs. \u201cUsers can discover a personalized world where trust is nurtured, content is moderated with precision and recommendations bring serendipitous connections,\u201d she added, calling all Web3 users to join a future \u201cwhere social experiences are intelligent, secure and tailored for each user.\u201d\n\nBy combining social graphs, decentralized identity and AI, Relation attracted over 300,000 registered users, mainly from Asia countries, the United States and Russia, with 40,000 average daily active users. The decentralized social graph protocol supports 17 wallets and over 150 Web3 and NFT communities. Aside from Chang, who is a researcher at the National University of Singapore and Imperial College London, majoring in graph research, Relation Labs has former Amazon architect Yann Ren as chief technology officer.\n\nBy adding a semantic layer to soulbound tokens, Relation Labs aims to shift the paradigm from tokenization to a trust-based, socially-interconnected web of relationships for Web3. Enhanced with AI capabilities, the decentralized social graphs would provide a better understanding of real-life human relations by machines and algorithms, resulting in a pathway forward to the decentrealized society envisioned by Vitalik Buterin and co. in their original SBT paper. The Relation Labs team will continue to develop its social graph protocol to help users authenticate their online presence and engage in social interactions with increased security and privacy.\n\nLearn more about Relation Labs"

        "content": "Ethereum has been consolidating within a narrow price range, tightly bound by the upper limit of the descending flag pattern and the 100-day moving average. However, a breakout is imminent and will determine the subsequent direction of the cryptocurrency.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nExamining the daily chart, Ethereum demonstrated a period of stable price action around the $1790 mark, near the 100-day moving average, before gaining support and embarking on an upward trajectory.\n\nDespite an unsuccessful attempt to breach the flag\u2019s upper boundary at $1.9K, resulting in a minor correction, Ethereum\u2019s price remains confined within a limited range, approximately between the $1791 level of the 100-day moving average and the dynamic resistance offered by the flag\u2019s upper trendline. A breakout from the flag pattern is likely to initiate another rally toward the $2K resistance zone.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nTaking a closer look at the 4-hour chart, three significant price regions present challenges for Ethereum buyers and sellers: the static resistance at $2K, the dynamic resistance from the mid-trendline of the ascending channel, and the dynamic support provided by the channel\u2019s lower threshold.\n\nConsidering the ongoing price action, it might seem more likely that Ethereum will continue its upward trend, aiming to surpass the $2K resistance level. However, given the current market conditions and prevailing uncertainty among market participants, it is more probable that a consolidation phase will occur first between the $2K region and the lower boundary of the channel."

        "content": "In a series of recent tweets, Wietse Wind, a prominent developer and contributor to XRP Ledger, shared his views on the perceived gap between the XRPL and Ethereum or EVM ecosystems when it comes to introducing innovative features and ideas. Wind acknowledged the talent and creativity of XRPL developers but highlighted the challenges they face in implementing core XRPL code and getting ideas approved and integrated by side developers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo address this issue and ensure the XRP Ledger remains competitive in the rapidly evolving world of decentralized technologies, Wind emphasized the significance of Hooks. He believes that Hooks will provide developers with a blank canvas to unleash their ideas and creativity, allowing them to add their own logic to accounts on XRPL protocol chains.\n\nWind also noted that the technology is already available on the Hooks V3 testnet, and a comprehensive security audit has been completed and is set to be released soon.\n\nReaction from XRP community\n\nAddressing concerns from the XRP community, Wind clarified that the side chain would incorporate a representation of XRP, dismissing the idea of issuing a separate token as redundant. He emphasized the importance of genuine utility for any additional tokens.\n\nOther XRPL developers also joined the conversation, with Neil Hartner highlighting the XRPL ecosystem's strength in avoiding smart contract bugs and subsequent thefts that have plagued Ethereum-based ecosystems.\n\nTrue, which is great, until that turns the XRPL into the Nokia of crypto... \u2014 WietseWind (\ud83d\udee0 Xumm @ XRPL Labs) (@WietseWind) June 1, 2023\n\nAnother Ripple developer known by the nickname \"Bias Goose\" welcomed the emergence of a competing standard within the XRPL ecosystem. He expressed optimism about the success of both side chains and pledged his support to foster their growth."

It often signifies a price point at which an influx of supply (sell orders) is strong enough to prevent the price from advancing further.\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, boasts a market cap of approximately $229 billion and a 4% weekly gain. XRP, known for its affiliation with Ripple, has a market cap of around $27 billion, but notably outperforms both Bitcoin (BTC) and ETH with a 12.8% increase over the past seven days, according to data from CoinGecko. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $1,909.17 and XRP at $0.532.\n\nThese figures show bullish momentum, but the looming horizontal resistance levels may soon test the strength of these upward trends.\n\nIn technical analysis, horizontal resistance levels often act as psychological price barriers for traders. These points typically reflect a high level of selling pressure where traders decide to sell off their holdings to capitalize on price peaks.\n\nThe impact of hitting these resistance levels can vary, potentially resulting in a price reversal or consolidation."

There will be no immediate changes to the Arbitrum Bridge, and it will continue to operate normally for bridging USDC to and from Ethereum.\u201d\n\nArbitrum says the benefits of a native USD Coin include institutional on and off-ramps via Circle and upcoming support from a cross-chain transfer protocol to get rid of bridge withdrawal delays. The native USDC will also be fully reserved and always redeemable at a 1:1 ratio for US dollars, according to Circle.\n\nWith a market cap of nearly $29 billion at time of writing, USDC is the second-largest stablecoin, behind Tether USD (USDT). USDC is the fifth-largest digital asset overall.\n\nUSDC briefly lost its peg to the dollar in March following news that Circle had $3.3 billion of its $40 billion cash reserves stuck in the collapsed Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). The stablecoin dropped to a low of $0.877 before quickly jumping back up to the $1.00 range around three days later.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

But fast-forward to 2023 and investors have largely lost interest in the blue-chip tokens like Uniswap and Maker, according to blockchain data firm Glassnode.\n\nGlassnode said in a Wednesday report the downturn was largely due to Ethereum seducing investors with its new staking feature, which can give returns of up to 4% APR.\n\nNow investors can earn returns on the cryptocurrency with less risk and more reward, the firm said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt is highly likely that the lackluster performance of DeFi tokens over the last two years is a factor or the emergence of native ETH staking yield,\u201d the report said, noting that the DeFi market cap stands at just 12% of its all-time high in November 2021.\n\nThe flexibility of the #Ethereum application layer has become a remarkable bedrock for innovation and narrative generation, with the #DeFi sector remaining one of the most prominent use cases. However, investments into DeFi have been complex, recording remarkably poor token\u2026 pic.twitter.com/ZICTzs9NmH \u2014 glassnode (@glassnode) May 31, 2023\n\nDeFi is the catch-all term for crypto projects which aim to replace traditional finance by cutting out middlemen and automating processes like borrowing and lending. Many DeFi projects run on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain.\n\n\u201cBlue-chip\u201d DeFi tokens are the ones with the best reputation, and when the DeFi space exploded in popularity in 2020, investors poured billions of dollars into blue-chip projects like decentralized exchange Uniswap and lending pools like Aave.\n\nBut Glassnode said that the market cap of such projects has shriveled. Why? Because they now need to compete with Ethereum, which can offer steady returns with seemingly low risk.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis is because the blockchain behind the second biggest cryptocurrency by market cap successfully upgraded in April, allowing investors to safely lock-up their ETH and receive returns for the cryptocurrency they pledged to the network.\n\nNow, they can earn better rewards\u2014with less risk. \u201cNot only is downside performance and volatility equivalent to ETH, but the upside performance is measurably less,\u201d Glassnode said.\n\nBlockchain data app Cielo\u2019s head of research, ZoomerAnon, told Decrypt that for \u201cDeFi to remain attractive to users,\u201d they will need to adopt liquid staking\u2014which is available on Ethereum.\n\nLiquid staking allows investors to have quick access to crypto they\u2019ve pledged by providing them with tokens redeemable for staked assets which they can move around elsewhere.\n\n\u201cThe battle to reignite interest in DeFi tokens is likely under way, but given the new hurdle rate set by the ETH token itself, it is unlikely to be an easy one,\u201d Glassnode added."

        "content": "Justin Sun, the founder of the Tron blockchain, has announced that the Tron network\u2019s native asset, TRX, can now be fully accessed on Ethereum (ETH), the largest altcoin network in the cryptocurrency industry. This has been made possible through the BitTorrent Bridge, which allows for seamless interoperability between the two blockchains.\n\nBitTorrent Bridge Paves The Way To Ethereum Integration\n\nInteroperability in the context of blockchain refers to the ability of different blockchains to communicate and exchange information with each other seamlessly. In this case, the BitTorrent Bridge enables Tron\u2019s native asset, TRX, to be transferred and accessed on the Ethereum network, and vice versa.\n\nRelated Reading: Litecoin Breaks $95 As Whale Transactions Spike\n\nThis means that TRX holders can now access the larger Decentralized Finance (DeFi) market and decentralized applications (dapps) available on Ethereum, while Ethereum users can now access TRX and its associated dApps on the Tron network. The BitTorrent Bridge acts as an intermediary between the two blockchains, facilitating the transfer of assets and data in a secure and decentralized manner.\n\nThe move is a significant development for the Tron ecosystem, which is currently the second-largest DeFi ecosystem with over $5.6 billion in total value locked and more than 2.9 million active users, according to DeFiLlama data.\n\nJustin Sun\u2019s tweet regarding the Ethereum expansion via BitTorrent Bridge has already had a positive impact on TRX\u2019s price, with the asset jumping by 2% following the announcement. This further demonstrates the potential for Tron to expand its reach and appeal to a wider audience in the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nWith Tron\u2019s expansion to Ethereum, the cryptocurrency industry continues to see the growing importance of interoperability between different blockchains. As more projects explore the potential of cross-chain functionality, the industry is likely to see further development and innovation in the coming years.\n\nTRON Sets New Daily Transaction Record\n\nDespite the challenges faced by the cryptocurrency industry in recent months, TRON has continued to perform strongly, defying expectations and posting impressive growth. According to a Twitter thread by Justin Sun, the network hit a new record high in daily transactions, processing over 10 million transactions in a single day.\n\nFurthermore, Sun notes that the robust performance of the TRON network is a result of its quality and efficiency, as well as its ability to continuously improve and deliver concrete results.\n\nLooking ahead, TRON has set an ambitious target for the year, aiming to double its transaction volume. Sun emphasizes that this increase is not just a measure of quantity, but also a reflection of the network\u2019s ability to maintain its strong fundamentals and generate revenue even in a challenging market.\n\nMoreover, the growth in TRON\u2019s transaction volume is expected to further bolster protocol revenue and demonstrate the strength of the TRON ecosystem. As the cryptocurrency industry continues to evolve and face new challenges, TRON is positioning itself as a leader in the space by focusing on innovation, efficiency, and delivering results.\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Users can now use rETH token for cheaper on the network and deploy it on other decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms.\n\nRocket Pool is already live on the two leading Ethereum rollups \u2013 Arbitrum and Optimism. Both of them use fraud proofs to scale Ethereum.\n\nRocket Pool is the second-largest Ethereum liquid staking protocol, only behind Lido. According to data from Rocket Pool\u2019s website, currently, 687,456 ETH is being staked with the project.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nzkSync Era is still in beta and is considered centralized.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nHaving established Ethereum projects move to newly launched but promising Layer-2 scaling projects is a welcoming sign. Eventually, all major protocols are expected to move to rollups to increase throughput and decrease costs while preserving Ethereum\u2019s security.\n\nRead more about an OG ETH wallet suddenly waking up:\n\nETH Wallet Dormant Since 2015 Moves 8,000 ETH in Minutes\n\nRead more about the huge OP unlock:\n\nOptimism to Unlock Millions of OP Tokens: What It Means for You"

        "content": "One of Europe\u2019s largest telecommunications companies is using its infrastructure to explore new revenue streams and boost network security as a validator for blockchain protocols.\n\nGermany\u2019s Deutsche Telekom is set to become a validator for Ethereum layer-2 scaling platform Polygon, becoming one of 100 validators providing staking and validation services for the network and Polygon\u2019s Supernets solution.\n\nPolygon is an important layer 2 in the Ethereum ecosystem, offering developers a range of scaling solutions, including zero-knowledge rollups, sidechains and data availability protocols.\n\nRelated: Polygon\u2019s \u2018holy grail\u2019 Ethereum-scaling zkEVM beta hits mainnet\n\nDeutsche Telekom MMS, which provides consulting and software development services, will operate as a Polygon validator for its parent company. This is expected to secure Polygon\u2019s proof-of-stake sidechain and Supernets chain, improving security, governance and decentralization of the protocols.\n\nThe firm will run a full node, produce blocks, validate and participate in the network\u2019s consensus, and commit checkpoints to the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nDirk R\u00f6de, Deutsche Telekom\u2019s Blockchain Solutions Center head, told Cointelegraph supporting the Polygon network as a validator is a big milestone in its aim to be an important player in Web3 infrastructure:\n\n\u201cDeutsche Telekom is not only a renowned infrastructure provider for mobile and internet services but is also making significant commitments to expand its presence and reliability as an infrastructure provider in the Web3 domain.\u201d\n\nDeutsche Telekom is also a validator for Q, Flow, Celo, Chainlink and Ethereum, and R\u00f6de said the company aims to serve institutional clients as a reliable enterprise-grade staking provider.\n\nR\u00f6de added that leveraging the company\u2019s infrastructure as a validator while monetizing the native token of the underlying blockchain network provides Deutsche Telekom with a \u201cdependable, novel and scalable source of income.\u201c\n\nThe potential for more mainstream telecommunications companies moving into Web3 could also catalyze greater decentralization of various proof-of-stake blockchains operated by validators:\n\n\u201cOther telecommunications companies are also exploring opportunities in this domain. In a decentralized ecosystem, it should be the goal to have a diverse and reliable validator set.\u201c\n\nA statement from Polygon Labs CEO Michael Blank reiterated this point, highlighting his belief that the partnership could pave the way for more mainstream businesses to embrace blockchain technology.\n\nPolygon recently announced a multiyear partnership with Google Cloud to drive the development of the Ethereum scaling protocol\u2019s zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine, zero-knowledge proof scaling solution.\n\nMagazine: Here\u2019s how Ethereum\u2019s ZK-rollups can become interoperable"

This is due to Ethereum's new staking feature, which offers returns of up to 4% APR with less risk and more reward. As a result, the DeFi market cap has dropped to 12% of its all-time high."

        "content": "Ethereum and most top altcoins have suffered a substantial loss amidst the latest crypto market\u2019s downfall. The bears are stepping back to pull the price to $1,700 in the next few days. It lost 2.5% overnight.\n\nFollowing last week\u2019s recovery that pushed the price above the $1900 level last weekend, Ethereum\u2019s price broke slightly above the important descending trendline and traded above it for the first two days of the week.\n\nUnfortunately, it lost that level today and rolled back under the trendline due to multiple rejections. Some bulls are already trapped with the fake-out as they could suffer more loss if the price continues to dip.\n\nThe latest reaction shows a strong bearish commitment to price as they gear up to unleash more pressure in the market. However, the wedge\u2019s lower boundary is the sell target to pay attention to in this fresh dip.\n\nIf the bears pull lower in the next few days, ETH may encounter some tough supports around the $1,750 level before dropping further. As shown on the daily chart, the volume indicator is still on the fall with no signs of increase yet.\n\nConsidering more positive action to take place, Ethereum would need to reclaim Monday\u2019s high of $1,926 to bring the bulls back into the market. But with the look of things, the bears appear set to stir the wheel one more time before the bulls can gain control.\n\nETH\u2019s Key Level To Watch\n\nIn the meantime, the potential level for a rebound lies at $1,788. If this price level fails to produce support, the next levels to consider for drops are $1,722.9 and $1,678.9, sitting right on the wedge\u2019s lower boundary.\n\nA recovery above the immediate $1,883 resistance level could pave the way for more push to the $1,948 resistance level, located above the weekly high. After that $2,030 and $2,160 are the next buying targets to watch.\n\nKey Resistance Levels: $1,883, $1,948, $2,030\n\nKey Support Levels: $1,788.4, $1,722.9, $1,678.9\n\nSpot Price: $1,865\n\nTrend: Bearish\n\nVolatility: High\n\nDisclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Also, hopes of a standstill interest rate by the US Federal Reserve pushed the risk sentiments up among the traders.\n\nBitcoin was back in green on Friday as the largest crypto token was slightly up, flirting with the $27,000 mark during the day. Similarly, its largest peer, Ethereum, rose about a per cent as it regained $1,850 levels.

        "title": "Here's how developers aim to store crypto inside NFTs - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Developers have recently published an Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) introducing a new way to use nonfungible tokens (NFTs). With this system, all NFTs can have a smart contract account, allowing them to store other NFTs or crypto tokens.\n\nCointelegraph spoke with Future Primitive\u2019s Jayden Windle and Benny Giang, the authors of EIP-6551, to explain the use cases of the proposal and its implications for the crypto space.\n\nJayden Windle and Benny Giang explain ERC-6551. Source: Cointelegraph\n\nAccording to Windle, while there are a lot of complicated workings behind the feature, the simplest way to explain it is that they are giving NFTs their own crypto wallets. He explained:\n\n\u201cThe real simple idea behind the ERC-6551 is that every NFT has a wallet. So, your NFT has a full wallet that your NFT owns. That means your NFT can own any asset on-chain, and your NFT can do anything on-chain. By giving NFTs wallets, NFTs now become users on Ethereum.\u201d\n\nWhen asked how the idea came to life, the Future Primitive developer explained that the team went down what he described as a \u201crabbit hole of experimental oddities.\u201d He shared that they were working on an NFT project where they wanted to add equipping as a mechanism. The project lets NFTs wear clothes and other accessories, which are also NFTs.\n\n\u201cWhat we realized was nothing really sets the use case that we really wanted to achieve. We really wanted to have NFTs own their own items in kind of a self-sovereign way. We really wanted to be able to do that in a way that would just work with all the existing tooling,\u201d he explained.\n\nMoreover, Windle also shared that they wanted other projects to be able to also take advantage of this new mechanism and build something that could apply to NFTs in general.\n\nPotential use cases for ERC-6551\n\nIn terms of use cases, the developer said that this could be applied to blockchain gaming and take the form of an inventory system. Furthermore, it can be used in decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), where instead of the history of a DAO member being separated by an NFT and a wallet, it can be placed into the NFT itself. Airdropping assets into NFTs can also potentially increase the value of the assets.\n\nRelated: Nike NFTs to make their way into EA Sports games and its millions of fans\n\nAs the new mechanism seemingly has many possibilities, Cointelegraph asked Giang what this could mean for the crypto space. The NFT veteran said that apart from asset ownership, this can also bring social identity to NFTs, adding new functionality to buying, selling or trading NFTs. He explained:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to introduce three new actions you can pursue with the NFT. It\u2019s become, interact and use. You can become your NFT, you can interact with it, and you can use your NFT.\u201d\n\nGiang believes this will make NFTs entirely different from jpegs, becoming new internet identities. Furthermore, the Future Primitive executive explained that if artificial intelligence (AI) is employed, it can turn NFTs into fully on-chain network playable characters in blockchain-based games.\n\nGiang highlighted that ERC-6551 is already live on the Ethereum mainnet. \u201cIt\u2019s not a conceptual idea. It\u2019s not like a testnet thing. It\u2019s real,\u201d he explained, adding that it has already been applied to an NFT collection called Sapienz.\n\nNFT inception: NFTs that own NFTs inside NFTs\n\nCointelegraph asked the developers if there is a limit to how far putting NFTs inside NFTs can go. According to the duo, this can \u201cget crazy really quickly\u201d and go on infinitely. They demonstrated a family tree of NFTs within NFTs.\n\nDemonstration of an NFT family tree with NFTs being used as wallets. Source: Cointelegraph\n\n\u201cYou can build applications around NFTs that own NFTs that own NFTs, and all this is accessible on-chain. You can build on-chain applications that use that hierarchy of NFTs in order to build really cool experiences,\u201d Windle explained.\n\nAI Eye: 25K traders bet on ChatGPT\u2019s stock picks, AI sucks at dice throws, and more"

        "content": "As the cryptocurrency market continues to captivate investors and traders worldwide, June holds promises of exciting developments for various cryptocurrencies. We turned to the innovative AI chatbot, ChatGPT as we explore the price predictions for Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), two prominent crypto tokens, as well as discuss the potential rise of Tradecurve (TCRV), which is an upcoming revolutionary trading platform currently in its presale phase. Let\u2019s begin.\n\nSummary\n\nEthereum (ETH) could see future price increases\n\nSolana (SOL) price analysis\n\nTradecurve (TCRV) may experience a faster price surge\n\n>>BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW<<\n\nEthereum (ETH) remains a leader with its potential for growth\n\nEthereum (ETH) has been making headlines with its innovative smart contract capabilities and vast ecosystem of decentralized applications. In recent times, Ethereum has been experiencing upward price momentum, and many analysts believe this trend may continue into June.\n\nEthereum\u2019s future looks bright, given that Ethereum recently almost surpassed Visa in terms of transaction volume as it reached $3.01 trillion in transactions, while Visa sits at $3.08 trillion.\n\nAt the moment, Ethereum is trading hands at $1,904.93 with a market cap of $229B, a rise of 0.48% in the last day alone. Not only that, but the technical analysis for Ethereum also shows a bullish picture, with all moving averages and technical indicators showing strong buy signals. Although ChatGPT cannot provide precise price predictions, it stated that Ethereum could see green charts due to increased institutional interest in the token.\n\nSolana (SOL) to trade in the green\n\nSolana (SOL), another major blockchain platform, has gained attention for its high throughput and low transaction fees. With its focus on scalability and speed, Solana has positioned itself as a potential competitor to Ethereum.\n\nSolana co-founder Raj Gokal recently stated that this project is the \u201cApple of crypto.\u201d Gokal\u2019s comparison of Solana to Apple is based on the notion that similar to how Apple\u2019s ecosystem mixes many software and hardware, Solana might develop an ecosystem that smoothly integrates various apps and services.\n\nSolana has a value of $21.01 with a market cap of $8.3B, a jump of 1.74% in the past 24 hours. The trading volume of Solana has also increased by 30.57% in that same time and now sits at $340,451,357. With all technical indicators and moving averages for Solana also showing green, this token could see future price hikes when June rolls around.\n\nTradecurve (TCRV) emerges as a potential contender\n\nWhile Ethereum and Solana seem to rule the conversation due to their popularity and past success, Tradecurve (TCRV) is an emerging player in the market that shouldn\u2019t be overlooked. This project, currently in Stage 3 of its presale, brings something new to the table, and as most experienced investors already know, buying in early on these projects is the best way of generating long-term gains.\n\nTradecurve will be a borderless, decentralized trading platform built on the Ethereum blockchain that will allow users from all over the globe to utilize cryptocurrency as collateral and access forex, stocks, commodities, and cryptocurrencies as trading options. The difference between Tradecurve and its peers is that it will not require any sign-up KYC checks, ensuring an utterly private trading environment where users will remain anonymous.\n\nTradecurve will cater to experienced and beginner traders, implementing features such as high leverage (500:1), subscriptions to automated & AI trading bots, a metaverse trading academy, negative balance protection, and more. These features will be powered by the platform\u2019s utility token, TCRV, which has a current resale value of just $0.015.\n\nHowever, the critical factor separating Tradecurve from Solana and Ethereum is its low market cap, which now sits at $27M as the token supply is 1.8B. Compared to the before-mentioned tokens\u2019 market cap, which numbers in the billions, Tradecurve could see substantial price growth way easier as not many new funds are needed.\n\nBecause of this, we can now understand why various market experts forecast a 50x increase for TCRV as the presale advances and a 100x surge when the token gets launched and listed on Uniswap or another major CEX.\n\nWhile its price movement in June is uncertain, Tradecurve\u2019s unique approach could position it as a noteworthy contender in the market, so sign up for its presale below.\n\nFor more information about the Tradecurve presale:\n\nClick Here For Website\n\nClick Here To Buy TCRV Presale Tokens\n\nFollow Us Twitter\n\nJoin Our Community on Telegram\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market has witnessed tremendous growth, with Ethereum (ETH) leading the way as one of the most widely adopted blockchain platforms. Ethereum\u2019s transaction volume has been surging, reaching new heights, and even challenging traditional payment giants like Visa.\n\nMeanwhile, emerging platforms like Tradecurve (TCRV), which is now in its presale run, are positioning themselves to overtake the titans mentioned above regarding transaction volume. Let\u2019s take a close look and find out why.\n\n>>BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW<<\n\nEthereum (ETH) and its surging transaction volume\n\nEthereum (ETH), known for its smart contract capabilities, has become a hub for decentralized applications, NFTs, and finance projects. As the adoption of Ethereum-based applications grows, so does its transaction volume.\n\nAccording to recent figures from Coingraph, Ethereum, for instance, processed $3.01 trillion in transactions, compared to $3.08 trillion for Visa. Additionally, another report stated that in 2021, Ethereum handled 4.5 times as many transactions as Visa. This is a stunning development when we consider that Ethereum and the crypto market, in general, have been in a bear market since mid-2022.\n\nWith this knowledge, Ethereum demonstrates how blockchain technology has advanced to the point where it can compete with established competitors in the payments technology industry. Another benefit over conventional financial layers is that it has developed into a rich and diverse ecosystem with lots of space for future expansion. At the moment, Ethereum is trading hands at $1,906.19 with a market cap of $229B, a rise of 0.27% in the last day alone.\n\nTradecurve (TCRV) shows ambitions to outperform both\n\nIn this dynamic landscape, emerging platforms like Tradecurve (TCRV) aim to carve out their own space and potentially overtake Ethereum and Visa in terms of transaction volume. Tradecurve, which will be a unique, hybrid trading platform has gained attention for its unique features.\n\nTradecurve\u2019s main focus is on privacy, decentralization, and advanced technologies. Unlike traditional platforms such as Robinhood and Kraken, which require a sign-up KYC check, the decentralized platform Tradecurve will not.\n\nThis will provide a fully private trading environment where users may trade stocks, forex, cryptocurrencies, and commodities while utilizing cryptocurrency as collateral. This is a positive development because few popular trading platforms can meet the demands of people concerned about their privacy.\n\nFor those just starting their trading journey, Tradecurve will also establish a metaverse trading academy where individuals can enroll in and connect with trading professionals and learn new strategies. Those who do not have the time to learn may just copy trades from established traders by subscribing to them or even subscribe to automated & AI trading bots which will significantly improve profitability.\n\nThe key to acquiring price cuts on these subscriptions will be holding the platform\u2019s utility token, TCRV, which is now in Stage 3 of its presale and costs only $0.015. Analysts have taken notice of Tradecurve as it will capitalize off many financial markets, including the foreign exchange market, which saw a daily turnover of $7.5T per day in April 2022, according to a Bank for International Settlements report.\n\nBecause of this booming industry backing it and the fact that 40% of the 1.8B token supply is currently available, analysts forecast a 50x increase as the presale advances. At the same time, a 100x surge can be expected after its launch and a Tier-1 CEX listing.\n\nWhile the goal of overtaking Ethereum and Visa is ambitious, Tradecurve\u2019s unique approach and innovative features have the potential to resonate with crypto enthusiasts and traders alike. So follow the links below and become an early investor in what some experts believe could be a top 3 global exchange, leaving players such as Robinhood and OKX in the dust.\n\nFor more information about the Tradecurve presale:\n\nClick Here For Website\n\nClick Here To Buy TCRV Presale Tokens\n\nFollow Us Twitter\n\nJoin Our Community on Telegram\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Coinbase Wallet Review 2024: What It Is And How To Use It - Milk Road",
        "content": "What Is Coinbase Wallet?\n\nLike similar wallets, Coinbase Wallet provides a way to send and receive crypto assets on the blockchain. And because the wallet supports the Ethereum blockchain as well as Ethereum-compatible networks, like Base, Polygon and Optimism, you can use Coinbase Wallet as a DeFi crypto wallet, so you can connect to a growing number of decentralized applications (dApps).\n\nFor example, you can connect to Uniswap, the leading decentralized exchange, or Opensea, the leading NFT marketplace.\n\nCoinbase Wallet also supports self-custody storage for the Bitcoin, Solana, Dogecoin and Litecoin networks.\n\nKey Features\n\nFeature Explanation Buy Connect to your Coinbase exchange account\u2019s payment methods, allowing you to buy several types of cryptocurrency within your wallet or buy crypto via local payment methods in 130+ countries Swap Swap with price checks on over 75 DEXes and the ability to trade thousands of tokens across major chains including Ethereum, Base, Polygon, Solana, and BNB Chain Bridge Lets you transfer supported tokens between blockchains Send/Receive Send to contacts or any address; receive using your address, scannable QR code, .eth address, or your Coinbase Decentralized ID (cb.id). Send USDC on Base, Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum and Avalanche C-chain without any network fees dApp browser (mobile) Connect to decentralized applications to trade, buy NFTs, or explore metaverse worlds Enhanced token detection Coinbase Wallet can automatically detect new tokens added to your wallet. You can also add support for new tokens manually Support for hardware wallets Pair Coinbase Wallet with Ledger devices. Your hardware wallet provides a second signature for transactions Adjustable gas fees Adjust transaction costs with custom slippage tolerance to match the transaction\u2019s priority Safety Coinbase Wallet automatically filters out spam tokens and NFTs. Decodes and simulates transactions, including EIP-712 messages in a clear, user-friendly format. Offers protective warnings against malicious dapps and addresses. Users can easily review and revoke existing token allowance approvals as well\n\nCoinbase Wallet Fees\n\nTransaction Fee Sending USDC on Base, Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum and Avalanche C-chain None Other token and NFT sends Network fee (varies) Token swap variable based on networks and payment methods\n\nFor most transfers, there are the standard network transaction fees. Coinbase Wallet doesn\u2019t add any additional fees.\n\nThere are no fees for sending USDC between wallets on Base, Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum and Avalanche C-chain\n\nIf you connect your Coinbase Wallet to your Coinbase account to trade, expect to pay a fee of between 0.5% and 4.5% on trades depending on the token, volume, and payment method.\n\nYou will pay a flat fee of 1% if you want to swap one token for another in your Coinbase Wallet.\n\nOur Expert Review Of Coinbase Wallet\n\nI took Coinbase Wallet for a test drive, trying out the Chrome Extension and mobile app to give you our Milk Road opinion. Here\u2019s my experience with each.\n\nCoinbase Wallet Browser Extension Review\n\nWhen I sent MATIC from my wallet, Coinbase automatically chose the Polygon network where I had my MATIC tokens stashed. No surprises there and no settings to change.\n\nWhat was surprising is that Coinbase Wallet shows sending amounts in USD as well as the crypto token quantity. MetaMask, the most popular competitor, shows these values in crypto tokens. Score one for Coinbase Wallet; after all, we still think in USD (or our local currency).\n\nTo get the receiving address, you can scan a QR code, copy/paste the address, or use the ENS-compatible name for the wallet described in the how-to later in the article.\n\nCoinbase Wallet lets you adjust the network fee for ETH-compatible network transactions, a feature made possible by EIP-1559, an improvement to the Ethereum network that allows fee adjustments. It also supports Replace-By-Fee (BIP-125) which allows you to speed up BTC transactions.\n\nBuying Crypto\n\nAlthough Coinbase Wallet is a standalone app, you can connect it to your Coinbase (Pay) account to fund purchases. On the Coinbase exchange, you\u2019ll find a wider selection \u2013 but not all are supported by the wallet. You can also buy crypto with local fiat onramps and payment methods in 130+ countries via Coinbase Wallet\u2019s integrations with Transak and Onramper.\n\nMetaMask, which we\u2019ve also reviewed, offers four ways to buy crypto (including Coinbase Pay).\n\nSwaps\n\nI used Coinbase Wallet to swap USDC for MATIC on Polygon. The wallet app compared exchange rates from 21 different sources (liquidity pools) and gave me the best price possible from these markets. Slippage is set to 3% by default, but this can be easily adjusted in the app. They also have a gasless swap feature, where I can choose to pay the network fee with USDC (deducted from my swap) instead of MATIC.\n\nBridge\n\nSometimes, you need to move assets from one blockchain to another, such as when I sent a bunch of MATIC from my Coinbase account over the Ethereum network rather than the Polygon network.\n\nCoinbase Wallet offers a cross-blockchain bridge for these situations with support for bridging assets to and from the Polygon, Base, Arbitrum, and Optimism networks.\n\nThe bridge fee was $6.20 for the transaction due to network traffic. In a few minutes, the MATIC tokens arrived on the Polygon network.\n\nLedger Support\n\nI connected my Ledger to the Coinbase Wallet extension (mobile isn\u2019t supported). One downside to using a Ledger with Coinbase Wallet is that you have to start with a new Coinbase Wallet. With MetaMask, you can connect to an existing wallet (but Ledger adds new accounts).\n\nCommunity\n\nCoinbase\u2019s ENS-compatible name system lets you search for users by their .eth or cb.id name. This makes it easy to send crypto to someone you know \u2013 or just peek at their activity.\n\nVitalik.eth is going bonkers with the BONK token, it seems.\n\nSupport\n\nCoinbase offers chatbot support (Coinbase Assistant) and email support. You can find both on the help page.\n\nI reached out to Coinbase with a setup question but didn\u2019t get far with the chatbot.\n\nI also used the contact form to inquire. Three hours later, I received a cordial reply, but my specific question remained unanswered.\n\nHowever, I did reach a live agent through chat on a separate issue after Coinbase restricted my account for 24 hours. I could buy crypto, but my crypto was trapped on Coinbase.\n\nAfter some friendly discussion, I was told there was no way to override the system and to wait 24 hours for the restriction to be lifted.\n\nCoinbase Wallet Mobile App Review\n\nWallet\n\nCoinbase\u2019s mobile wallet performs sending and receiving tasks well. I sent BTC, ETH, and MATIC to another wallet without any surprises. The mobile wallet uses a built-in QR code scanner to read the receiving address of other wallets quickly.\n\nWhen sending, I was able to adjust the fee for ETH transactions. Lower fees may mean slower transactions, whereas higher fees can speed up transactions. It also supports Replace-By-Fee (BIP-125) which allows you to speed up BTC transactions.\n\nBuying Crypto\n\nThe buy feature in Coinbase Wallet connects to the payment methods you use on the Coinbase exchange. Coinbase uses Plaid to connect to your bank. Users with multi-factor authentication on their bank account might run into trouble, like I did. If you use PayPal with Coinbase, PayPal isn\u2019t available with Coinbase Pay.\n\nOnce you\u2019re connected, you can use a bank account or debit card to buy any cryptocurrency supported by the mobile wallet. Fees for buying crypto through Coinbase Wallet follow Coinbase\u2019s basic fee structure (which is costlier than Coinbase Advanced).\n\nPurchase Amount Coinbase Fee Under $10 $0.99 $10 to $25 $1.49 $25 to $50 $1.99 $50 to $200 $2.99\n\nFees ranges can vary from these figures, however. I was quoted $1.99 for a $24.84 purchase. You\u2019ll also pay about 4% for card-funded purchases. You can preview the transaction cost before finalizing your purchase.\n\nIn this example, my fee is $1.49, plus a $0.17 network fee to transfer the Bitcoin to my wallet.\n\nBalances for mobile-only cryptocurrencies (like Bitcoin) won\u2019t show in the Coinbase Wallet Chrome extension.\n\nSwaps\n\nThe experience for swaps (exchanging one token for another) works just like on the Chrome extension. Swaps execute smoothly and the Coinbase Wallet supports adjusting the slippage allowed.\n\nIn the example below, I was offered the best price from 21 decentralized exchanges. Coinbase doesn\u2019t add any additional fees for swapping tokens, but there is a fee charge which is the sum of expected network fees as well as 0.1% charge from their DEX aggregator.\n\nBridge\n\nCoinbase\u2019s bridge lets you move cryptocurrency across blockchains. Transactions take several minutes.\n\nHere you can see some of the interface issues in which the app doesn\u2019t scale to the device screen properly. In some cases, I wasn\u2019t able to read the blue button at the bottom to preview or execute transactions.\n\ndApp Browser\n\nEthereum and compatible cryptocurrency networks support smart contracts (computer programs that run on the blockchain), making decentralized applications possible. Swap tokens, play games, or shop for NFTs.\n\nCoinbase\u2019s mobile wallet provides a built-in dApp browser featuring popular dApps like Opensea and Quickswap. I visited both and found my Coinbase Wallet was already connected to these dApps. Quickswap warned that I was on the wrong network (Ethereum) and provided an option to switch to Polygon. Uniswap did not connect automatically, however.\n\nThe dApp browser is slow, but for simple DeFi tasks on the go, Coinbase Wallet gets the job done.\n\nWho\u2019s Coinbase Wallet Good For?\n\nExisting Coinbase Users . If you already use Coinbase to trade and need a wallet to store your tokens, the Coinbase Wallet is an ideal solution because it integrates seamlessly with the trading platform. You can also cut trading fees by transferring money easily between your Coinbase Wallet and Coinbase account compared to other wallet apps.\n\n.

Coinbase Wallet makes it discover trending NFTs.\n\nWho\u2019s It Not Good For?\n\nPeople wary of self-custody risks . The Coinbase Wallet is a self-custody wallet that gives users full control over their tokens. However, if you lose your wallet keys and recovery phrase, you won\u2019t be able to recover your tokens.\n\n. The Coinbase Wallet is a self-custody wallet that gives users full control over their tokens. However, if you lose your wallet keys and recovery phrase, you won\u2019t be able to recover your tokens. People who prefer cold storage. Coinbase Wallet is a \u201chot wallet,\u201d meaning it is connected to the internet and vulnerable to hacking attacks. Some people prefer \u201ccold wallets\u201d that are offline to reduce the risks of compromise.\n\nCoinbase Wallet Alternatives\n\nHere\u2019s how Coinbase Wallet compares to other popular wallets.\n\nCoinbase Wallet MetaMask Trust Wallet Platform Chrome extension, iOS & Android mobile app Chrome extension, iOS & Android mobile app Chrome extension, macOS, iOS & Android mobile app Supported cryptocurrencies ERC-20 tokens and Solana (Chrome extension), ERC-20 tokens, Solana, Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Ripple, and more (mobile) ERC-20 tokens ERC-20 tokens, Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Tron, Solana, Stellar, and more Crypto purchase fees $0.99 to $2.99, 3.99% for debit card purchases $1.85 to $3.50, depending on payment processor Up to 4.5% or $3.99, whichever is higher NFT support Yes Yes Yes Swaps supported Yes, ERC-20 tokens Yes, ERC-20 tokens Yes, ERC-20 tokens Bridge Yes, ERC-20 tokens Yes, ERC-20 tokens No, external only Hardware wallet support Ledger (browser extension only) Ledger and Trezor (Chrome extension) Ledger (browser extension only)\n\nCoinbase\u2019s wallet app is available as a Chrome extension or as a mobile wallet (iOS and Android) and can connect to your Coinbase exchange account to buy crypto (but not sell).\n\nHow Does Coinbase Wallet Work?\n\nCoinbase Wallet uses BIP39, the industry standard, to generate a 12-word recovery phrase. This recovery phrase is the key to your wallet. Anyone with the recovery phrase can re-create your wallet and control your crypto assets, so you want to be very careful storing this.\n\nIn the background, the 12-word phrase is linked to a private key (a long string of letters and numbers) that allows you to control your wallet assets on the blockchain.\n\nWallets also use a public key, which creates the wallet address. Coinbase Wallet supports multiple networks (on mobile) and multiple accounts, so you might have several addresses.\n\nAll your Coinbase Wallet assets share the same 12-word recovery phrase.\n\nCoinbase Wallet is a hot wallet, meaning the wallet\u2019s keys were generated and stored on a device connected to the internet. You can connect a Ledger hardware wallet (a cold wallet that generates a private key offline) to a Coinbase Wallet to further secure your assets. However, you need to do this with a new Coinbase Wallet using the Chrome extension. You can find instructions to connect your Ledger here.\n\nWhen you send crypto or connect to a decentralized application, your wallet asks permission to \u201csign\u201d the transaction using your private key. In simple terms, your wallet works as an authenticator.\n\nMulticoin Support\n\nCoinbase Wallet supports several popular Ethereum-compatible blockchains, including Base, Polygon, and Avalanche C-Chain. The wallet also supports Solana, Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Binance Chain, and Litecoin.\n\nHowever, some popular cryptocurrencies, such as Cardano and Polkadot, are not supported by the extension or the mobile app. If you have a diversified portfolio, you may need more than one wallet.\n\nHow To Set Up Your Coinbase Wallet\n\nI set up a new wallet using the Coinbase Wallet Chrome extension. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide.\n\nStep 1: Download And Install The Coinbase Wallet Extension.\n\nVisit Coinbase for the official download link. The link takes you to the Chrome extension installation page. Add the extension to your Chrome or Chromium-based browser.\n\nStep 2: Create A New Wallet.\n\nClick on create new wallet. You can use the second option to install your wallet on additional devices later if needed.\n\nStep 3: Write Down Your Recovery Phrase.\n\nYour wallet will generate a 12-word recovery phrase as well as a hidden private key. Write down the recovery phrase and store it safely. Although Coinbase Wallet offers the option to copy the seed phrase to your clipboard, for security reasons, this isn\u2019t recommended.\n\nStep 4: Verify Your Recovery Phrase And Choose A Password.\n\nChoose the first and last word from your recovery phrase. On the next screen, you\u2019ll also choose a password to protect your wallet while away from your computer.\n\nStep 5: Claim Your Username.\n\nCoinbase Wallet offers a free Ethereum Name Service (ENS) username using this format: yourname.cb.id. Others can send supported crypto tokens directly to your username, which maps to your wallet address. You can also import a .eth name if you have one.\n\nThat\u2019s it. Click on the Buy button to connect to your Coinbase Pay account if needed.\n\nTo Sum It Up\n\nCoinbase Wallet brings some advantages compared to its main competitor, MetaMask, by offering support for Bitcoin, Litecoin, and a number of other cryptocurrencies.\n\nFor basic sending and receiving as well as problem-free swaps, Coinbase Wallet\u2019s mobile app makes a solid choice, while the Chrome and Brave extension provides a reliable way to explore web3 on the desktop.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nIs Coinbase Wallet A Good Wallet? Yes. Coinbase Wallet offers a reliable way to store supported coins and tokens or connect to decentralized applications. Should I Keep My Crypto In Coinbase Wallet? Coinbase Wallet is a hot wallet, meaning the wallet\u2019s private key was generated and stored on a device connected to the internet. You can reduce risk by limiting how much you keep in your wallet or by pairing the Coinbase Wallet Chrome extension with a hardware wallet to enhance security. Can I Transfer Money From My Coinbase Wallet To My Bank Account? No. Coinbase Wallet lets you buy or swap crypto, but there is no way to transfer money to your bank account from your wallet. How Much Are Coinbase Wallet Fees? Coinbase Wallet doesn\u2019t charge a fee to use the wallet, but some actions require a fee. Swaps can cost $6 and up. Buying crypto through Coinbase Wallet comes with fees of up to 3.99%. Why do I Need A Crypto Wallet? A crypto wallet lets you control your crypto assets on the blockchain. A standalone wallet can connect to web3 applications and provide an off-exchange way to manage your cryptocurrency or NFTs. Is Coinbase Wallet Safe? It appears pretty safe. Coinbase Wallet gives you full control over your crypto keys, so no third party can tamper with your funds without permission. If you download the mobile app, you can also control access to it with biometric authentication (fingerprint or Face ID). Keep in mind that it\u2019s impossible to know if this wallet will always be safe in the long run.\n\nStaff Writer Eric Huffman Eric Huffman is a staff writer for MilkRoad.com.

        "title": "Elon Musk's Crypto Warning: Analyzing the Impact on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogetti - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "In the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, recent events have left investors and enthusiasts on edge. Elon Musk, the influential entrepreneur and CEO of companies like Tesla and SpaceX, issued a stark warning about the crypto market after a significant crash in the prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two leading cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis article aims to examine and analyze the similarities and differences between these cryptocurrencies, with a particular focus on Dogetti, a meme coin that operates similarly to a presale, providing insights for readers looking for the next big crypto investment. Our informative and fun approach will provide news, education, and updates on the crypto market.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum \u2013 Pioneers of the Crypto World\n\nBitcoin, the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, was introduced in 2009. It operates on a decentralized blockchain network and serves as a digital store of value and medium of exchange. Ethereum, launched in 2015, expanded on Bitcoin\u2019s capabilities by introducing smart contracts and enabling developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) on its blockchain.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s market dominance and limited supply make it a popular choice for investors seeking a digital alternative to traditional assets. On the other hand, Ethereum\u2019s focus on programmability has led to its adoption as a platform for various decentralized applications, including decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nThe Impact of Elon Musk\u2019s Warning\n\nElon Musk\u2019s influence in the crypto market cannot be overstated. As a prominent figure with a large following, his tweets and public statements have the power to sway market sentiments. Recently, Musk expressed concerns about the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining, which relies on energy-intensive processes. His tweet about Tesla suspending Bitcoin payments caused a significant price drop, highlighting the influence of external factors on cryptocurrency valuations.\n\nWhile Bitcoin and Ethereum experienced significant price declines following Musk\u2019s warning, the impact on Dogetti, a meme coin inspired by Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, was relatively limited. Dogetti, branded as \u201cThe Family,\u201d aims to create a strong and united community of holders who are rewarded through a reflection protocol. Despite its association with meme coins, Dogetti distinguishes itself by focusing on the concept of a family, fostering a unique sense of togetherness among its users and buyers.\n\nExploring Dogetti\u2019s Utility and Potential\n\nDogetti aims to help every member of its community increase their overall net worth through various forms of utility. While meme coins often lack real-world applications, Dogetti sets itself apart by emphasizing its utility functions. These functions could include features such as staking, governance rights, and partnerships with external platforms, ultimately providing value and benefits to the Dogetti family.\n\nThe recent crypto market crash led by Elon Musk\u2019s warning has emphasized the importance of careful consideration when choosing cryptocurrencies. Amidst the fluctuations, Dogetti has proven its resilience whereas Ethereum and Bitcoin faced significant fluctuations.\n\nWith a focus on utility and tangible benefits like staking and governance rights, Dogetti offers long-term growth potential. As investors, it\u2019s crucial to evaluate projects based on their own merits rather than relying solely on external influencers like Elon Musk.\n\nTo explore promising opportunities in the crypto market and join the vibrant Dogetti family, visit our website.\n\nPresale: https://dogetti.io/how-to-buy\n\nWebsite: https://dogetti.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/Dogetti\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_Dogetti_\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

Whether you\u2019re an experienced player or a novice interested in cryptocurrency gambling, this detailed listicle can serve as a valuable resource. Let\u2019s delve into the world of Bitcoin Dice Crypto Casinos to identify the most trusted and profitable platforms of 2023.\n\n1. CryptoGames \u2013 The Ultimate Crypto Casino\n\nPros:\n\nSimple and fast signup process\n\nProvably fair games with low house edge (1% \u2013 2.7%)\n\nSupports a wide range of cryptocurrencies\n\nFast transactions\n\nProgressive jackpots\n\nCold wallets for secure storage of funds\n\nVIP Program\n\nMonthly Wagering Contest\n\nCons:\n\nLimited selection of games\n\nVisual and sound effects could be improved\n\nCryptoGames is the ultimate choice for those seeking a secure, simple, and fun crypto casino experience. Established in 2020, it has quickly become a favorite among crypto enthusiasts.\n\nGame Variety: 5/5\n\nCryptoGames offers ten classic games, including Dice, Dice v2, Roulette, Blackjack, Lottery, Video Poker, Plinko, Keno and Minesweeper. While the selection might seem limited, the games are designed to load quickly and provide a seamless gaming experience. The simplicity of the games ensures that players can jump right in without any unnecessary complications.\n\nBonuses: 5/5\n\nCryptoGames operates on a Faucet Bonus model, allowing players to familiarize themselves with the platform and continue playing even when they run out of money. The Faucet Bonuses increase based on account age, amount wagered, referral commission, chat messages, and other factors. CryptoGames also hosts a monthly wagering contest (with up to $250,000 rewards to grab), with top players earning VIP membership and a host of benefits, including lower house edge on Dice, highest bet priority, birthday bonuses, and more.\n\nDesign: 4.5/5\n\nCryptoGames offers a straightforward interface that makes it easy for players to navigate and enjoy their gaming experience. While the visual appearance of the games and sound effects could be improved, the focus on simplicity and functionality makes up for it.\n\nBanking: 5/5\n\nCryptoGames supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Dogecoin (DOGE), Monero (XMR), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ethereum Classic (ETC), Dash (DASH), Binance Coin (BNB), Solana (SOL) and NeoGas (GAS). It also features a CoinSwitch integration, allowing players to convert many other altcoins into the supported coins. Deposits are fast, and players can choose the speed of their withdrawals by setting the fee lower or higher than the average.\n\nCryptoGames is a user-friendly crypto casino that prioritizes security, transparency, and enjoyment. Its focus on simplicity, coupled with the privacy and security of cryptocurrency, makes it an ideal choice for both new and veteran players.\n\n2. 7Bit Casino \u2013 A Strong Contender in the Crypto Casino Space\n\nPros:\n\nWelcome pack of 5 BTC + 100 free spins\n\nLucrative V.I.P. program\n\nCash prize tournaments\n\nOver 1,200 casino games\n\nImmediate payouts\n\nCons:\n\nHigh wagering requirements\n\nLess ideal for poker enthusiasts\n\n7Bit Casino is known for its rewarding V.I.P. program and exciting tournaments, making it a notable player in the crypto casino market.\n\nGame Variety: 4/5\n\n7Bit Casino\u2019s library has 1,200 games; it may not match CryptoGames\u2019 unique and simple gaming experience, but it still provides a decent variety for crypto gambling enthusiasts. 7Bit stands out with its array of tournaments, where users can compete for significant prize pools. However, CryptoGames\u2019 focus on a streamlined, easy-to-understand gaming experience makes it a more accessible platform for both new and veteran players.\n\nBonuses: 4/5\n\n7Bit offers a welcome bonus of up to 5 BTC, though it provides slightly fewer free spins compared to CryptoGames\u2019 Faucet Bonus model. While 7Bit shines with daily cashback and themed promotions, CryptoGames\u2019 approach of increasing bonuses based on account age, wagered amount, and other factors provides a more dynamic and engaging reward system.\n\nDesign: 4/5\n\n7Bit\u2019s design, reminiscent of 80s arcade nostalgia, appeals to older millennials and younger Gen Xers. However, CryptoGames\u2019 straightforward interface and focus on functionality make it a more user-friendly platform, allowing players to jump right into their gaming experience without any unnecessary complications.\n\nBanking: 3/5\n\n7Bit\u2019s banking options, while accepting fiat currencies, are more limited compared to CryptoGames. CryptoGames supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Dogecoin (DOGE), Monero (XMR), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ethereum Classic (ETC), Dash (DASH), and NeoGas (GAS). This wide array of supported cryptocurrencies, coupled with fast transactions and the ability to choose withdrawal speed, makes CryptoGames a more flexible and convenient platform for crypto-only players.\n\n7Bit Casino offers a range of features and a substantial game library, CryptoGames\u2019 focus on simplicity, security, and a wide range of supported cryptocurrencies makes it a more appealing choice for those seeking a seamless and enjoyable crypto casino experience.\n\n3. Bitstarz \u2013 Premier Bitcoin Casino\n\nPros:\n\nExtensive range of over 4,300 games\n\nVerified fair play games.\n\nExclusive game titles\n\nMultiple award-winning platform\n\nWelcome bonus of 5 BTC + 180 free spins\n\nCons:\n\nLimited options for banking\n\nAbsence of sports betting\n\nBitstarz stands out as the top contender in the crypto casino market, with a rich assortment of over 3,000 games, including exclusive titles, and a decorated history of accolades.\n\nGame Variety: 4/5\n\nWith over 4,600 games on offer, Bitstarz boasts an impressive collection, making it an ideal choice for gaming enthusiasts. Its library includes exclusive titles, providing a unique gaming experience. Top favorites include Wolf Gold, John Hunter and Book of Tut, Cleo\u2019s Gold, Lightning Roulette, and Elvis Frog in Vegas.\n\nBitstarz\u2019s excellence extends beyond our recommendation. The platform has bagged several industry awards, including \u2018best casino\u2019 and \u2018best customer service,\u2019 further affirming its reputation as a top-notch online gaming destination.\n\nBonuses: 4/5\n\nBitstarz\u2019s welcome package stands out, offering up to a 5 BTC bonus plus 180 free spins, providing a generous start for new users. The platform is known for its extravagant promotions, even giving away Tesla sports cars for slot play in the past. While current bonuses might appear less extravagant, expect future promotions to be potentially exciting.\n\nDesign: 4/5\n\nThe user-friendly and visually appealing design of Bitstarz makes it one of the best in online casinos. A dynamic main menu helps display important sections like games and promotions efficiently. However, due to its extensive game variety, the homepage can seem slightly crowded at times.\n\nBanking: 3/5\n\nBitstarz\u2019s banking options, limited to Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Tether, is the platform\u2019s only significant drawback. Considering it\u2019s a crypto-exclusive casino, we hope to see a broader range of cryptocurrencies offered in the future.\u201d\n\n4.
