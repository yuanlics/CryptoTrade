        "content": "The share of Ether held by so-called whale addresses has dropped since Ethereum's Shapella upgrade in mid April, suggesting that large investors may be leaning bearish in the near term.\n\nETH whale population shrinks post-Shapella\n\nThe amount of Ether (ETH) held by addresses with 1,000-10,000 ETH, or \"whales,\" was over 14.033 million ETH on May 1, according to Glassnode data. In comparison, the count was 14.167 million ETH on April 12, when Shapella went live on Ethereum.\n\nEther whale net position change. Source: Glassnode\n\nInterestingly, a week before the Shapella upgrade, the Ether whale cohort held 14.303 million ETH, the highest amount in 2023.\n\n\"Shrimps\" only ones buying ETH since Shapella\n\nEther's price is down over 3.5% since the Shapella upgrade \u2014 suggesting that several whales may have indeed \"sold the news.\"\n\nInterestingly, other address cohorts also showed a decline, including sharks (100-1,000 ETH), fishes (10-100 ETH), crabs (1-10 ETH) and even mega-whales (10,000+ ETH).\n\nOnly shrimps (<1 ETH) accumulated during the period, with their net position slightly increasing from 1.79 million ETH on April 12 to 1.80 million ETH on May 1.\n\nEther shrimp net position change. Source: TradingView\n\nShapella enabled investors to withdraw ETH locked via staking, which some argued would increase selling pressure.\n\nSince the Shapella upgrade, investors have withdrawn over 1.97 million ETH worth around $3.6 billion, according to Beaconcha.in. Nevertheless, no major changes in cryptocurrency exchanges' ETH balances have been seen to date.\n\nEther whales vs. shrimps\n\nHistorically, fewer Ether whales typically means heightened downside risk for the ETH price.\n\nWhale activity typically acts as a leading market indicator. So, rich investors accumulating typically precedes a price rise and vice versa.\n\nThe price-to-whale positive correlation existed until March 2020, as shown in the chart below. Afterward, retail mania took over alongside the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing, and the correlation snapped.\n\nEther whale net position change. Source: Glassnode\n\nNotably, ETH rallied from $110 in March 2020 to over $4,950 in November 2021 despite the declining number of whales. The inverse correlation continued throughout the price downtrend to around $850 in June 2022.\n\nBut since then, whale holdings have risen by nearly 1 million ETH. Meanwhile, ETH's price has more than doubled to around $1,850, hinting at a possible return of the price-to-whale correlation, which would be a bullish sign for Ether.\n\nWhere can the ETH price go next?\n\nThe $2,000 level is an important psychological resistance level for ETH/USD that bulls have been unable to break despite multiple attempts in 2023.\n\nRelated: Ethereum price outlook weakens, but ETH derivatives suggest $1.6K is unlikely\n\nOn the daily chart, ETH/USD holds above the short-term support provided by its 50-day exponential moving average (EMA), near $1,840. A successful rebound from here opens $2,000-$2,125 as the next upside target range in the second quarter.\n\nETH/USD daily price chart, with the 50-day EMA in red and 200-day EMA in blue. Source: TradingView\n\nConversely, a break below the 50-day EMA risks sending ETH toward its 200-day EMA near $1,670, down about 10% from current price levels.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Usage of Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible blockchains hit a new all-time high last week, thanks to consistently high gas fees on Ethereum.\n\nDaily new unique addresses of EVM-compatible blockchains, including BNB Chain, Polygon and Avalanche, peaked at 6.77 million on April 25, according to The Block's Data Dashboard. The previous record was 6.74 million in 2021.\n\n\"Ethereum gas fees are up significantly since the start of the year, leading to growth in EVM-compatible chains,\" said Kevin Peng, research analyst at The Block. \"EVM-compatible chains provide a consistent experience for users and developers familiar with Ethereum. Growth in these chains can be a proxy for interest in an Ethereum-like user experience on-chain.\"\n\nAverage Ethereum transaction fees, known as gas fees, have increased by over 250% since the beginning of the year to around $9 per transaction from about $2.50 per transaction in December, according to The Block's Data Dashboard.\n\nAs The Block reported recently, a surge in memecoins trading has led to increased usage of Ethereum-based decentralized exchanges, adding to the upward pressure on gas fees.\n\nBNB Chain and Polygon leading\n\nEVM-compatible chains have lower transaction costs than Ethereum while benefiting from the security and network effects of the larger Ethereum ecosystem. BNB Chain and Polygon, in particular, saw increased usage last week due to their growing ecosystems, according to The Block's Data Dashboard.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\n\"This surge is driven by new contracts created on BNB Chain. In many cases, projects implement solutions such as gasless, meta transactions, relayer contracts etc., all with the purpose of optimizing gas fees, and sometimes improving the end-user experience. In such a case, we would see new contracts being created specifically for minting, claiming etc. \u2014 and it is these new contracts that have led to this spike,\" Arnaud Bauer, solution architect at BNB Chain, told The Block.\n\n\"Some instances that we saw this time were from 1inch, CyberConnect and XEN-related contracts being the bulk of it,\" Bauer added.\n\nEthereum Layer 2s growing too\n\nEthereum Layer 2 networks, especially Optimism and Arbitrum, have also grown in usage this year. Daily new unique addresses on both optimistic rollups-based chains have increased since the start of the year, according to The Block's Data Dashboard."

        "title": "How to Bridge From Solana to Ethereum - Watcher Guru",
        "content": "Solana has advanced significantly in the DeFi, NFT, and Web3 markets since its launch in April 2019. Hundreds of projects are currently underway in Solana, and more are soon to follow.\n\nAccording to Solana\u2019s website, \u201clow cost, forever\u201d is the company\u2019s main selling proposition. The network is engaged in direct competition with several blockchains, including Ethereum. Even though there is competition between different blockchains, users would want to bridge from Solana to the Ethereum network. Before we dive into the detailed steps on how to bridge, let us understand what is bridging.\n\nBridging in a nutshell\n\nBridging is nothing but the process of transferring tokens or coins from one blockchain to another one. This is essential as there exist multiple blockchains with each one having their native tokens or coins. The bridge helps to move the assets from one blockchain to another, making the process easier. The process exists in general, especially for cryptocurrencies that don\u2019t have cross-chain support. Bridging is possible through cross-chain bridges and sidechains, etc.\n\nInteroperability between Solana and Ethereum is a fascinating breakthrough in the field of blockchains. It allows users to effortlessly transfer assets between the Solana and Ethereum networks.\n\nNow that we have a basic understanding of bridging, let us focus on how to bridge from Solana to Ethereum.\n\nHow to bridge from Solana to Ethereum with Allbridge\n\nThere are a few options to look into while bridging from Solana to Ethereum. Let us look at how to do it with Allbridge. Allbridge helps to connect EVM networks like Polgon, and Ethereum with non-EVM chains like Solana, Fantom, and Near.\n\nFollow the steps below to bridge your tokens from Solana to Ethereum:\n\nGo to Allbridge.\n\nConnect your Solley, Phantom, or Exodus wallet.\n\nChoose the option from Solana to Ethereum.\n\nType in the address, select the number of tokens, and click on send to finalize the transaction.\n\nHow to Bridge From Solana To Ethereum using Portal\n\nPreviously known as Wormhole Bridge, Portal Bridge is another good option to go for to move assets between these blockchains. The portal also has better liquidity for various tokens. Here is how you can bridge tokens using Portal Bridge.\n\nVisit the Portal Bridge website.\n\nConnect your Ethereum and Solana wallets.\n\nChoose the token that you want to bridge from SOL and ETH networks.\n\nType in the number of tokens that you want to transfer.\n\nDouble-check and confirm the transaction.\n\nUsing a CEX\n\nWhile the above two options are available, it is also possible to do bridging using a CEX. But doing so also comes with the security risks of a CEX, which one should be wary of. Follow the steps below to bridge tokens from SOL to the ETH network.\n\nOpen your CEX account.\n\nGo to your wallet and transfer ETH from your wallet.\n\nOnce you receive the assets, convert your crypto to a native token, like SOL.\n\nWithdraw your SOL and then send it to your Solana wallet.\n\nWhile it is always better to use portals like Allbridge and Portal, CEX can also be considered as an option to do so. However, CEXs include the necessity to do KYC and submit personal information."

        "title": "Cardano Founder Charles Hoskinson Responds to Jab by Ethereum Co-Founder - DailyCoin",
        "content": "Charles Hoskinson is once again in another controversy.\n\nThis time, an Ethereum co-founder accuses Hoskinson of contributing nothing to Ethereum.\n\nCrypto Twitter and Hoskinson reacted to the accusations.\n\nCharles Hoskinson is known to take shots at people on the internet with his controversial takes. However, this time the Cardano founder is on the other side of criticism, targeted for his contributions to Ethereum.\n\nFabian Vogelsteller, an Ethereum co-founder, accused Hoskinson of building \u201cliterally nothing for Ethereum.\u201d While the founder supposedly meant no harm, his words garnered quite a reaction on Twitter, even from Hoskinson himself.\n\nCharles Hoskinson Built Nothing?\n\nOn April 29, Fabian Vogelsteller stirred quite the controversy after tweeting a post about Ethereum Foundation members who built their blockchains. The post featured images of Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, Cardano Founder Charles Hoskinson, Polkadot Founder Gavin Woods, and Lukso Founder Fabian Vogelsteller with their net worths.\n\nThe post didn\u2019t sit well with Vogelsteller, who took it upon himself to correct it. He suggested Charles Hoskinson should be removed from the picture because he was never really a founder of Ethereum and was just at the right place at the right time.\n\nTo correct this picture a little bit:@VitalikButerin is the ethereum founder, so he doesn\u2019t count. @IOHK_Charles was never really a founder of ethereum. He built literally nothing for ethereum that I am aware of. He was just early on at the right place, at the time, hanging\u2026 https://t.co/zHFV4zLANR \u2014 Fabian Vogelsteller (@feindura) April 29, 2023\n\nWhile Vogelsteller clarified he meant no offense with his words, he buttressed that he had been involved in Ethereum long before it was formed and knows very well who contributed what and when.\n\nIn response to Vogelsteller\u2019s accusations, many on Crypto Twitter quickly came to Hoskinson\u2019s defense, flooding his post with memes and replies. Some took jabs at the Lukso founder, and others shared proof of the Cardano Founder donning an Ethereum shirt and spreading the word.\n\nAfter things got out of hand, Hoskinson chimed in with his casual sarcasm.\n\nThanks Fabian. Glad to get your opinion on my worth and contributions. I suppose Switzerland just materialized out of the ether. Also given my profound incompetence, I'd love to meet the people behind Cardano. Pretty cool project to just somehow self manifest \u2014 Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) April 30, 2023\n\nThe Cardano founder sarcastically thanked Vogelsteller for his comments while hinting at Switzerland and Cardano. Notably, Hoskinson registered the Ethereum Foundation in Switzerland and served as CEO before leaving to build IOG and Cardano in 2015 and 2017, respectively.\n\nThe rowdy founder left Ethereum when his vision did not align with Buterin.\n\nSoon after Hoskinson\u2019s reply, Vogelsteller again explained he meant no offense to the Cardano Founder\u2019s work or skills. Instead, he meant Hoskinson did nothing based purely on code contributions. He added he didn\u2019t plan to instigate blockchain drama.\n\nTo which the Cardano founder has yet to respond.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nIn March, Hoskinson shared that Crypto Twitter and cryptocurrency media content spread FUD instead of constructive information.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nCardano Founder Charles Hoskinson is one of the most influential figures in the Crypto community. Controversies related to the rowdy founder often reach a considerable audience. Vogelstellar could likely be using the controversy as a marketing ploy to generate interest in his project, Lukso.\n\nFAQs\n\nDid Charles Hoskinson work on Ethereum? Charles Hoskinson joined Ethereum in 2013 as one of the five founders with Vitalik Buterin, Gavin Wood, Anthony Di Iorio, Amir Chetrit, and Jeffrey Wilcke. He served as the CEO for a short period, after which he left in 2014. When did Charles Hoskinson leave Ethereum? Charles Hoskinson left Ethereum in 2014 over a dispute with Vitalik Buterin on whether the project should be for-profit or non-profit. Hoskinson believed Ethereum should take the commercial route and become like Google, whereas Buterin believed the project should be modeled after Mozilla, a non-profit organization. Hoskinson went on to form IOHK and Cardano. Will Cardano ever replace Ethereum? Ethereum is a long-established network and powers a wide range of Layer-2 products, giving it the second-largest market capitalization of $227 billion. In contrast, Cardano has taken an intentionally slow, dev-focused approach to its blockchain. Despite being heralded for its consistency, the project has drawn scrutiny for falling behind, which is evident in the poor growth of its market cap. At $13 billion, Cardano has a long way to go in replacing Ethereum. What is Charles Hoskinson saying about Cardano? Charles Hoskinson believes Cardano still has a lot of building to do and is about 85% complete. He explains that many delays and issues surrounding Cardano can be attributed to focusing on the wrong technology and being too ambitious with its roadmap. Hoskinson plans to expand Cardano\u2019s reach in West Africa, with Ghana as a prime focus.\n\nRead more about Charles Hoskinson\u2019s other controversies:\n\nCharles Hoskinson Calls Competition \u2018Ignorant\u2019 on Cardano Security\n\nMajor auction house Sotheby\u2019s released a new NFT Marketplace:\n\nSotheby\u2019s Launches New NFT Marketplace on Ethereum and Polygon"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nSports Illustrated Tickets (SI Tickets) today announced Box Office, a new NFT ticketing platform built on Polygon, an Ethereum scaling network. The move marks the storied sports media brand's entry into primary ticket sales alongside its SI Tickets secondary marketplace that launched in 2021.\n\nBox Office is now part of SI Tickets, the online marketplace that resells tickets to major events across sports, concerts, and theater. SI Tickets is a division of the overall Sports Illustrated magazine and media brand.\n\nInstead of catering to the biggest events in sports and music, Box Office welcomes ticket listings from smaller community events that typically might otherwise appear on ticketing sites such as Eventbrite or DICE.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe're not here to compete against Ticketmaster, SeatGeek, or AXS. We're going after the self-service event market,\u201d SI Tickets CEO David Lane told Decrypt.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to create the first mass-market adoption of NFT ticketing,\u201d he continued, \u201cso that everyone from a 15-year-old to a 90-year-old can buy their first NFT ticket without having to go through a crypto tutorial on blockchain, or have to get a wallet and understand any aspects of it.\u201d\n\nBox Office was built with Ethereum software studio ConsenSys.\n\nBox Office\u2019s NFT tickets will be found inside the SI Tickets mobile app. In addition to granting entry, event organizers can also equip tickets with content such as photo and video highlights, collectibles, personalized messages, promotional offers, and loyalty rewards to engage with fans. Content can be recorded and uploaded before, during, and after an event.\n\nTickets for an upcoming Texas youth football championship game\u2014set to seat up to 2,000 fans\u2014will be listed on Box Office, for example. In addition to youth sports, Box Office expects to list both free and paid tickets from partnered music venues, nightclubs, business conferences, private parties, fitness and yoga studios, comedy clubs, religious retreats, and charity organizers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAs the global economy continues to recover from the pandemic, we expect that live events, concerts, and sporting events will regain their pre-pandemic popularity,\u201d Johnna Powell, global co-head of ConsenSys NFT, said in a statement to Decrypt. \u201cThe combination of these factors suggests that consumer demand for NFT event ticketing will increase in the coming years.\u201d\n\nLane claims SI\u2019s Box Office has a 20% lower fee structure than Eventbrite. Fans can also transfer their tickets to NFT marketplaces and other secondary ticket platforms such as Vivid Seats, SeatGeek, and Stubhub to resell their Box Office NFT tickets.\n\nSports Illustrated is offering a 50-50 revenue split on resales with event organizers and performers, and will do so by tracking the on-chain data of Box Office transactions.\n\n\u201cYou always get paid when your ticket sells, but you don't participate in the resale of that on the secondary market\u2014but that's what changes here,\u201d Lane said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re splitting 50-50 with our partners. They\u2019re gonna get 50% of the resale revenue,\u201d he added. \u201cFor the events that have resale value, this is one of the great advantages of NFT ticketing. That's why I really do believe that this will become the standard as we go forward.\u201d\n\nUsers who purchase a ticket on Box Office will also receive a $10 bonus for buying tickets to any of the 250,000 major events listed on the SI Tickets secondary marketplace, whose A-list events will appear alongside Box Office events in the same app.\n\n\u201cYour event is going to be listed on our site next to the biggest sports, concerts, and theater events in the area,\u201d Lane said. \u201c[Organizers] are no longer relegated to a hyperlocal Eventbrite-type of landing page. You're literally alongside Taylor Swift, Billy Joel, and the Knicks. It gives great visibility to any event that wants to partner with us.\u201d\n\nThe NFL has offered free virtual commemorative NFT ticket stubs on Ticketmaster since 2021 for fans who purchased traditional tickets to attend games, while MLB\u2019s partnership with Candy Digital also includes commemorative NFT tickets. Ticketmaster introduced an Ethereum NFT token-gating feature in March for artists to give their NFT-holding fans early access to tickets.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201c[Box Office] is really about mass adoption of NFT ticketing\u2014not novelty, niche, limited quantity drops,\u201d Lane said. \u201cThis is something that everybody can use. It's applicable to every type of event. We expect this is going to be the entry point for millions to be able to enter blockchain and get their first NFT ticket.\u201d\n\nEditor's note: This story was updated after publication to clarify that Sports Illustrated Tickets (SI Tickets) is a division of Sports Illustrated."

        "title": "New \u201cEthereum Killer\u201d SUI Launches Today, What You Need To Know - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Today is the day, the long-awaited launch of the next \u201cEthereum killer\u201d SUI is taking place at 8:15 am EST (12:15 UTC). From a purely technical standpoint, SUI does a few things differently compared to Ethereum, and therefore the expectations are high. In addition to the bankrupt exchange FTX, the project has numerous notable backers, including Circle, Binance Labs, and Electric Capital.\n\nThe designated proof-of-stake (dPoS) blockchain has an entirely new architecture that is supposed to outshine even the \u201chigh-speed\u201d blockchain Solana. Many of Sui\u2019s developers previously worked on the Meta (Facebook)-launched project Diem, which was scrapped some time ago due to regulatory headwinds.\n\nThe developers behind Sui, Mysten Labs, are one of two spinoffs from Diem, the second being none other than Aptos, which celebrated its mainnet launch last October. The former Meta employees founded Mysten Labs back in 2021 to develop Sui.\n\nWhy Sui Is Being Hyped\n\nOne of the things that sets the Sui blockchain apart is its tremendous processing speed of data, which no other layer-1 blockchain can match. In testing, Sui already brought it to more than 300,000 transactions per second (tps). This far exceeds even Solana (65,000 TPS). Likewise, Sui has a big speed advantage in transaction confirmation time.\n\nWhile Solana needs around 20 seconds, Sui\u2019s is only 450 milliseconds. In terms of scalability, Mysten Labs says that the system design is designed to allow horizontal scalability, which is not capped.\n\nIn addition to Sui\u2019s high throughput and low latency, the project also touts a third advantage: the ability to process arbitrary amounts of data on chain. To do this, SUI makes use of a storage fund that redistributes fees for past transactions to future validators.\n\nIn other words, users pay upfront fees for both computation and storage. When storage requirements on-chain are high, validators receive additional rewards to offset their costs. Conversely, when storage requirements are low.\n\nThese three benefits are meant to take the use cases of blockchain technology to the next level.\n\nTokenomics\n\nWhile IOUs were already trading on smaller exchanges ahead of the official launch of the blockchain at 8 am EST (2 pm CET), well-known crypto exchanges such as Binance, OKX, KuCoin, and ByBit have announced the listing of the new token as soon as liquidity requirements are met.\n\nBinance, for example, said it expected to begin trading SUI/BTC, SUI/USDT, SUI/TUSD and SUI/BNB at 8:15 am EST.\n\nSUI\u2019s token supply has a cap of 10 billion tokens. As stated by the Sui Foundation, a portion of the total supply is expected to be liquid when the mainnet launches today. The remaining tokens will be transferred or distributed as future reward grants for shares in the coming years.\n\nIn the Sui economy, the token has four purposes. It can be used to participate in the proof-of-stake mechanism. It is the asset required to pay gas fees to conduct transactions and other operations.\n\nFurthermore, the token is an asset that supports the entire economy with its value. Ultimately, the token plays an important role in governance as it serves as the right to participate in voting on-chain.\n\nFeatured image from PixelPlex\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nSolana, one of the largest \u201cEthereum Killers\u201d, has surpassed the latter to become the network with the most transactions.\n\nOn Wednesday, Nansen shared a tweet comparing April\u2019s most active on-chain addresses. According to the firm, Solana came in second after BNB Chain, becoming the network with the most active address by chain at 5.1 million in April.\n\nAnd despite that figure dropping by around 12% from March, the cryptocurrency network still managed to outdo Ethereum, which had 4.9 million active addresses in April.\n\nSolana also surpassed Ethereum by non-vote transactions last month. Non-vote transactions are transactions that do not involve any voting or decision-making by token holders. They typically involve the transfer of cryptocurrency between wallets or accounts and are the most common type of transaction on most blockchain networks due to their simplicity. According to Nansen data, as of April 30, Solana\u2019s total non-vote transactions stood at 24.3 million compared to Ethereum\u2019s 974,972.\n\nSolana\u2019s attractive growth can be attributed to various factors, including a surge in developers and users due to its attractive transaction speeds and costs. Apart from announcing various developments that go into improving the network, including a Chat GPT plugin and a web3 phone, Solana\u2019s ballooning transactions have also been propelled by NFTs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecently, Mad Lads, a new project launched on Solana, became the most traded collection generating $17 million compared with $11 million for Yuga Labs\u2019 Bored Ape Yacht Club collection during the last week of April. This is despite the Solana facing a major setback following the exit of y00ts and DeGods, two of its most popular collections, earlier this year.\n\nLaunched roughly a month ago, Mad Lads is a unique type of NFT that falls in a category called xNFTs. Ideally, xNFTs combine the features of traditional NFTs and executable code, meaning users can use them to conduct other activities such as gaming and chatting.\n\nThat said, Solana\u2019s native token SOL has also performed well, soaring by over 116% since January 1. This is compared to Bitcoin, up 70%, and Ether, up just over 50% year-to-date.\n\nAt press time, SOL was trading at $21.47, down 3.36% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. On the other hand, Ether rose by 1.66% in the same period and was exchanging hands at $1,851."

        "content": "One of the most known names in the industry, and the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Ethereum has long been a vital asset. Moreover, since the arrival of a burn mechanism in 2021, the circulating supply has become an interesting development. Leading us to observe the total amount of Ethereum (ETH) burned.\n\nThe highly anticipated EIP-115 upgrade set in motion a burn mechanism that was critical for the digital asset. Subsequently, decreasing the circulating supply increases the overall value of the cryptocurrency. Since the arrival of the upgrade, the burn rate has rapidly increased, setting the stage for its current total burned supply.\n\nETH Burned\n\nSource: Redot.com\n\nEthereum operates similarly to many digital assets in terms of its circulating supply. Specifically, with every block, ETH increases that very supply. According to Ultrasound. Money, the current supply is more than 120,379,384.\n\nPrior to the burn mechanism, Ethereum projected that more than 600,000 ETH would be put into circulation annually. However, the concern was the growing supply without a diminishing tool. Thus, the EIP-115 upgrade was developed, and integrated.\n\nNow, since the implementation of the EIP-115 upgrade, a total of 3,170,487.19 Ethereum has been burned, according to Ultrasound.Money. Moreover, that number equates to a total of more than $9,411,313,559. The figure presents a massive development in the vital burn rate of the asset and its subsequent value.\n\nThe Importance of The Merge\n\nSource: Kaspersky\n\nThe industry will always note the importance of the merge to the Ethereum ecosystem. Specifically, the event signified the transition of the blockchain network from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake (PoS) one.\n\nSince the Merge event, the same data shows that a total of 547,196 ETH have been burned. Moreover, the collection of the asset equates to a total of $861,639,674. Conversely, the transition to a PoS model has aided the issuance rate of digital assets.\n\nSpecifically, Bitcoinsit reported that prior to its transition, ETH tokens were issued at a rate of 3.66% per year. Alternatively, that figure is quite high when compared to an asset like Bitcoin. Nevertheless, the latter was only issued at a rate of 1.72%. Moreover, proving that the merge has been undoubtedly helpful in increasing the effectiveness of the burn mechanism."

The platform will feature works from 13 artists, including Tyler Hobbs, XCOPY, Diana Sinclair, Pindar van Arman, and others.\n\nOn The Flipside\n\nSotheby\u2019s has announced that it would auction off NFTs from the Grails collection, part of now-defunct hedge fund 3AC\u2019s asset portfolio.\n\nMarketplaces like Blur account for over half of the trading volume generated by NFT traders. This, in turn, has prompted leading NFT marketplaces like OpenSea to follow suit and cut rebates to stay relevant.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nSotheby\u2019s is one of the oldest auction houses in the world. The auction house took a big step when it embraced Web3 in 2021, but this time it took an even more significant step by staying committed to artist royalties when many NFT marketplaces are rolling back on supporting creator royalties.\n\nRead how Jack Dorsey\u2019s ventures are shaking up Web3:\n\nJack Dorsey Goes All In.

        "content": "Curve has deployed crvUSD smart contracts on the Ethereum Sepolia testnet.\n\ncrvUSD will be backed by various crypto assets.\n\nThe new stablecoin will use a novel lending-liquidating AMM algorithm.\n\nThe current bear market in the crypto industry has made multiple companies bankrupt, and stablecoins lose their pegs. These incidents have shown that the perfect stablecoin has yet to be created.\n\nHowever, this might change soon as Curve, a decentralized finance platform, is preparing to launch its own decentralized stablecoin crvUSD.\n\nCurve Tests New Stablecoin crvUSD\n\nCurve, one of the oldest and most battle-tested decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, is about to launch its new stablecoin crvUSD.\n\nThe platform deployed the smart contracts for crvUSD on the Sepolia testnet on Tuesday in preparation for launch on Ethereum mainnet.\n\ncrvUSD is a decentralized stablecoin that will be pegged to the U.S. dollar and overcollateralized by various crypto assets. This approach is almost identical to how DAI, another decentralized stablecoin created by Maker, works.\n\nHowever, there are specific differences between the two. crvUSD will use a lending-liquidating AMM algorithm, or LLAMMA, which works by converting between the provided collateral and the stablecoin, depending on which is higher and which is lower.\n\nFor example, if the price of the collateral in the form of ETH is high, users\u2019 deposits are comprised solely of ETH. If the collateral depreciates, LLAMMA converts some of it to the stablecoin, helping better manage collateralization risks.\n\nCurve is the largest decentralized exchange in terms of total value locked (TVL). It currently has a TVL of $4.29 billion and is deployed on 12 different blockchains, according to data from DefiLlama.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nIt will be tough for crvUSD to outcompete MakerDAO\u2019s DAI, which currently has a market capitalization of $4.71 billion.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nUSDC and USDT, the two dominant centralized stablecoins in the market, have both depegged during the current crypto bear market.

        "content": "The founder of Ethereum, one of the pioneering entities of the entire cryptocurrency industry, is one of the most recognizable names in the digital asset sector. Yet, as the brains behind one of the most used blockchains on the planet, just who is Vitalik Buterin, and what is his net worth?\n\nButerin is a well-respected industry leader and has catapulted his Ethereum network to unprecedented heights. Moreover, understanding the development of Ethereum, his early life, and his impact on the industry provides an interesting context for just how much the co-founder is worth.\n\nWho is Vitalik Buterin?\n\nVitalik Buterin was born on January 31, 1994, in Kolomna, Russia, and migrated to Canada at the age of six. After leaving Russia, Buterin\u2019s early life was set in the province of Ontario, where he gained some notoriety as a programmer during his teenage years.\n\nAt a young age, it was clear that Buterin had a strong passion for digital assets. Specifically, Buterin was taught about the fundamentals of Bitcoin (BTC) by his father when he was 17 years old.\n\nAlthough he was tremendously interested, there was really no way for the young Russian Canadian to obtain the asset. Yet he would eventually begin writing blog posts for Bitcoin as compensation. Subsequently, that work would culminate in 2011, when he co-founded Bitcoin Magazine.\n\nSource: Global Happenings\n\nButerin would study collegiately at the University of Waterloo, taking advanced cryptography courses. Then, he would become a research assistant to former Tor Project board chairman, Ian Goldberg.\n\nIn 2012, Buterin took home bronze in the International Olympiad in Informatics. There, he began to collaborate with some of the brightest young development minds on the planet. Eventually, in 2014, billionaire Peter Theill established the Thierl Fellowship. Subsequently, Buterin was offered a $100,000 grant to focus full-time on Ethereum. Leading the young developer to drop out of college and chase his dream.\n\nThe Birth of Ethereum\n\nSource: Pixabay\n\nMoreover, Buterin created a host of open-source projects until he eventually co-founded Ethereum in 2013. The young developer co-founded the Ethereum network alongside Hoseph Lubin, Charles Hoskinson, Anthony Di Lorio, and Gavin Wood.\n\nEthereum was created to combat certain flaws that Buterin observed in various crypto projects like Bitcoin. Following the publication of the Ethereum technical book, the industry was able to observe how the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) truly functions. Subsequently, presenting the primary technology behind the Ethereum network, and orchestrating its vast potential.\n\nSource: Redot.com\n\nIn 2015, the Ethereum brain trust was able to present the original, fully formed version of the network, Frontier. The arrival followed a rather long crowdfunding campaign and became somewhat of a viral sensation. Following its launch, tech giants like IBM and Microsoft were interested in the capabilities of the project.\n\nThe founder\u2019s group behind Ethereum eventually sold ETH for more than 31,000 BTC, which equates to $18 million. Subsequently, the Ethereum Foundation was born. The foundation was a non-profit based in Switzerland and used to oversee the Ethereum network\u2019s open-source software development.\n\nOverall, the Ethereum network benefited from the principles that it held firm to. Specifically, the design of the network ensures simplicity, modularity, universality, agility, non-discrimination, and non-censorship. All qualities that have drawn in users. Consequently, aspects that have continued to drive its popularity in the industry.\n\nVitalik Buterin Net Worth\n\nSource: Coin News\n\nAll of that exposition sets up the answer to the question of Vitalik Buterin\u2019s net worth. Currently, Data Wallet approximates that the Ethereum co-founder boasts a net worth of around $540 million as of 2023. Specifically noting the significant amount of Ethereum that is held by the creator.\n\nWhat perhaps makes the net worth of Buterin interesting, however, is how he perceives his wealth. The Ethereum co-founder has stated his adherence to decentralization as a principle. Moreover, he shares his desire to use his wealth for philanthropic purposes. Additionally, the estimates are strictly that, as Buterin has assured that he is not exponentially wealthy. Conversely, he states that he ends up donating most of his income.\n\nSource: Cripto Tendencia\n\nThis is a facet that has been seen in the past, as Buterin has been known to donate large amounts of cryptocurrency. Specifically, Buterin had been given more than 50 trillion Shiba Inu (SHIB) in 2021. Subsequently, by the end of May of that year, he had donated almost all of it to the CryptoReleif fund. The total was more than $1.2 billion at the time.\n\nIn 2022, Buterin donated another $9.4 million to the University of Maryland to support the School of Public Health\u2019s research into germicidal ultraviolet light. Subsequently, pointing to the philanthropic nature of the Ethereum founder.\n\nUltimately, Buterin\u2019s net worth is based on various assets that are held in three wallets, according to Data Wallet. Specifically, the wallets 0xab, 0xD0, and 0x22 have all been verified to belong to the founder. Subsequently, those wallets hold a combined $500 million. Alternately, there is an additional estimate of $40 million in off-chain assets held by Buterin."

        "title": "SEC crackdown on crypto staking in the US could boost decentralization - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The Ethereum network underwent the successful Shapella hard fork on April 12, allowing validators to withdraw their long-staked Ether (ETH) from the Beacon Chain after three years. In the first week of withdrawals, more than a million ETH was unstaked by validators.\n\nHowever, from the second week onward, the number of ETH staked was higher than that of ETH withdrawn, indicating that validators are re-staking most of their ETH back into mining pools.\n\nStaking is temporarily locking tokens on a network that uses a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. In a PoS network like Ethereum, users who wish to support the blockchain by validating new transactions and adding new blocks must \u201cstake\u201d a certain amount of cryptocurrency. In return, they receive rewards.\n\nStaking ensures that a blockchain is only updated with valid data and transactions. Participants wanting to increase their chances of validating new transactions offer to stake large amounts of cryptocurrency as insurance.\n\nEther being re-staked is a big positive for the Ethereum network, but its future in the United States remains uncertain. Ethereum staking is getting tricky for many U.S.-based validators as staking service providers, particularly centralized exchanges, are fighting a regulatory battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nIn February, Kraken crypto exchange settled with the SEC for $30 million and closed its staking services for U.S clients. The SEC claimed that the service qualified as a security and that Kraken must obtain the necessary license to operate.\n\nToday we charged Kraken with failing to register the offer and sale of their crypto asset staking-as-a-service program, whereby investors transfer crypto assets to Kraken for staking in exchange for advertised annual investment returns of as much as 21 percent. \u2014 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (@SECGov) February 9, 2023\n\nKraken withdrew its validator nodes for U.S. clients just a day before the Shapella upgrade to comply with SEC orders. The shutdown triggered an industry-wide debate on the future of staking services in the United States. Coinbase \u2014 one of the first crypto exchanges to go public in the U.S. \u2014 also provides staking services and is trying to force the SEC to answer a petition it filed regarding guidance for cryptocurrencies.\n\nCoinbase CEO Brian Armstrong claimed that the SEC\u2019s efforts to curtail staking service providers would prohibit retail staking in the United States. This might force many crypto platforms and staking service providers to move to offshore locations. At a time when the SEC is proactive in its enforcement action against crypto-staking services, the future of ETH staking looks shaky in the United States.\n\nMagazine: Whatever happened to EOS? Community shoots for unlikely comeback\n\nStephenie Lord Eisert, senior director of law enforcement at crypto intelligence firm Merkel Science, told Cointelegraph that cryptocurrencies are a global entity. Thus, a clampdown by one particular jurisdiction would only force service providers to move elsewhere.\n\n\u201cThe proposed ban on crypto staking will not protect investors from fraud or scams. Instead, it will create a regulatory void that will be exploited by bad actors. Rather than banning centralized staking providers, regulators should focus on addressing the lack of guidance around both centralized and decentralized staking options,\u201d she said.\n\nStaking-as-a-service under threat in the U.S.\n\nThe U.S. is home to the majority of node operators on the Ethereum blockchain. Of the 9,849 active nodes, 5,214 are in the U.S., followed by 1,679 in Germany and 277 in Japan. The latest data from Etherscan indicates that node operators in the U.S. declined by 20% in the past week.\n\nETH nodes by country. Source: Etherscan\n\nWilliam Kraus, a partner at FisherBroyles law firm, told Cointelegraph that the SEC\u2019s enforcement against Kraken shows the commission\u2019s position on staking-as-a-service.\n\nHe added that this could prompt U.S. providers to respond in several ways, with some eliminating the service altogether, while others might implement changes to how they provide the service or publicly describe it. Some providers might decide not to change anything. However, the settlement has lessened ambiguity about staking, and providers must carefully consider the SEC\u2019s position going forward, he said, adding:\n\n\u201cThe U.S. certainly has not banned staking-as-a-service. Instead, the Kraken settlement establishes that the SEC considers at least some forms of staking to fall under its jurisdiction. The market response remains to be seen, but we can reasonably expect fewer, and perhaps more limited, offerings of staking-as-a-service to retail consumers in the U.S.\u201d\n\nDanny Talwar, head of tax at Koinly, told Cointelegraph that centralized staking providers account for almost a quarter of all staked ETH, with Coinbase (11.4%), Kraken (6.9%), and Binance (5.2%) leading the way.\n\nTalwar said that if the SEC moves on with its enforcement action, staking service providers will be forced to look outside the U.S. to offer their services.\n\n\u201cIf offshore exchanges with no Know Your Customer or Anti-Money Laundering compliance end up being major beneficiaries of the SEC cracking down on regulated, domestic, centralized exchanges, \u2018consumer protection\u2019 may be the least likely outcome,\u201d he said.\n\nThe rise of decentralized staking\n\nWhile U.S. regulators are clamping down on staking services, crypto proponents are trying to convince regulators that high-yield lending interests offered by centralized entities and staking rewards on the Ethereum blockchain are not the same.\n\nStaking crypto on a blockchain like Ethereum contributes to daily transaction verification. Thus, Ethereum staking differs from lending rewards like those offered by BlockFi and Celsius.\n\nOn the other hand, the SEC is looking to brand all kinds of staking services under a standard banner, Konstantin Boyko-Romanovsky, CEO of staking service provider Allnodes, told Cointelegraph.\n\nBoyko-Romanovsky said prohibiting centralized exchanges from offering staking services would further enhance decentralization. He also noted that the government\u2019s approach might stifle adoption as many newcomers to crypto in the U.S. rely on centralized entities such as Coinbase for staking services.\n\nHe noted that staking pools might become more popular among retail stakers, explaining:\n\n\u201cStaking pools will probably experience an increase in participation from the United States, as the concept of staking pools democratizes access to staking opportunities and associated rewards. However, it is difficult to predict the exact extent of this potential influx, as it will depend on various factors such as mainstream acceptance and adoption, regulatory policies, scalability and ongoing innovation.\u201d\n\nHe added that those interested in staking will likely find alternative means. \u201cThe focus of the regulatory bodies should be on creating precise and clear definitions for new and innovative concepts, such as staking. It would likely benefit customers more than attempting to force crypto instruments into existing fiat currency molds,\u201d he said.\n\nRecent: What the Gensler hearing means for US crypto regulation and policy\n\nThe troubles of centralized staking services might work in favor of decentralized staking services and staking pools. After Kraken\u2019s withdrawal of U.S-based validator nodes, most of these validators moved to Lido Finance, a decentralized staking pool service provider.\n\nAs @krakenfx ETH withdrawals where allowed, most of that went predictably into @LidoFinance. pic.twitter.com/Ud8vuvsvAT \u2014 Seraphim (@MacroMate8) April 26, 2023\n\nWhile it may help decentralization, the SEC\u2019s stance on crypto staking could mean trouble for U.S.-based service providers. However, it remains to be seen whether firms like Coinbase uproot and move abroad, abandon significant market share in the domestic market, or make efforts to comply with SEC guidance and U.S. securities laws."

        "content": "The developers of decentralized exchange Curve Finance deployed smart contracts for decentralized stablecoin crvUSD on the Sepolia testnet today.\n\nSepolia serves as one of the two main testnets employed by Ethereum developers for testing code prior to mainnet deployment. Specifically, this code was deployed for the purpose of testing the token's verification on Ethereum block explorer Etherscan, according to a comment made on GitHub.\n\nCreated in 2020, Curve is the largest decentralized exchange focused on swapping stablecoins with reduced slippage and minimal fees. It has more than $4.2 billion locked on its platform across its markets that run over 12 blockchains. The Sepolia deployment signals that the team is getting closer toward a mainnet release of its platform and stablecoin.\n\nThe stablecoin's design\n\nCurve founder Michael Egorov initially revealed that the team was working on developing a native stablecoin in July 2022. Subsequently, in November 2022, Curve developers published its white paper and initial code.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nThe stablecoin will be pegged to the U.S. dollar and feature a token design akin to that of MakerDAO's DAI stablecoin. That means it will be overcollateralized by supported crypto assets exceeding the value of the crvUSD users wish to mint.\n\nAdditionally, the stablecoin will rely on a new algorithm called Lending-Liquidating AMM (LLAMMA). This continuously liquidates and automatically deposits collateral to manage the risk associated with the stablecoin, while maintaining its peg to the U.S. dollar, according to its whitepaper.\n\nBeing developed by one of the most-widely used DeFi protocols \u2014 one that's heavily focused on stablecoins \u2014 crvUSD has a chance at finding adoption. But it will enter a highly competitive field, currently dominated by centralized stablecoins like USDT and USDC, which account for $81 billion and $30 billion respectively, of the $131.2 billion total stablecoin market. DAI, the closest stablecoin in design to crvUSD, has a $4.7 billion market capitalization."

        "content": "A new Cosmos-based blockchain called \u201cTenet'' will use liquid staking coins from other networks to secure its transactions, potentially allowing the new network to inherit the security of older ones, according to a May 3 announcement from the developers.\n\nThe network is currently available as a testnet and will launch a mainnet version as soon as testing is complete. This comes after liquid staking has recently become the largest decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol category.\n\nLiquid staking protocols such as Lido, Rocket Pool and Ankr allow users to stake their coins with a network of validators and receive rewards without having to run their own nodes. These protocols also provide users with tokens called \u201cliquid staking derivatives,\u201d or LSDs, redeemable for the underlying deposits and rewards.\n\nAccording to the announcement, Tenet will allow users to \u201crestake\u201d these LSDs to earn additional rewards on its network. And it will provide users with tokens that represent the LSDs themselves. The team calls these third-order tokens \u201cliquid liquid staking derivatives,\u201d or LLSDs. LLSDs will be usable in lending apps and decentralized exchanges throughout the Tenet network, the announcement said.\n\nThe team expects there to be two core benefits to using LSDs instead of a native coin to secure the network. First, it \u201censures the long-term security of the Tenet chain by leveraging the joint security of each [layer 1] ecosystem it services.\u201d Second, it should \u201cbring additional liquidity and yield opportunities to LSDs.\u201d\n\nRelated: Ethereum \u2018re-staking\u2019 protocol EigenLayer launches on testnet\n\nAt launch, the protocol is expected to allow liquid staking derivatives of Ether (ETH), BNB (BNB), Cosmos (ATOM), Solana (SOL) and Polygon (MATIC) to be restaked on Tenet.\n\nThe new network is being developed by former executives of Ankr and Blockdaemon and is advised by members of the Lido, Ankr and OpenAI teams.\n\nLiquid staking protocols have existed since 2020 when Lido was first launched. They grew in popularity in 2022 and early 2023 as the Ethereum network implemented a move to proof-of-stake and began to allow staking withdrawals. On May 1, crypto analytics platform DefiLlama announced that liquid staking had become the top category of DeFi apps when measured by total value locked.\n\nSome experts have argued that liquid staking may grow in the future as a result of the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade."

        "title": "A guide on how to bridge from Solana to Ethereum - CNBCTV18",
        "content": "Due to the complex nature of blockchain technology, linking assets across blockchains can get tedious. There is where blockchain bridges come in. They enable the transfer of assets from one blockchain to another, providing users access to a wider range of decentralised applications.\n\nTypically, a cross-chain bridge entails using a smart contract to lock or burn tokens on the source chain and another smart contract to unlock or mint tokens on the destination chain.\n\nFor instance, some cross-chain bridges allow one to transfer assets between Ethereum and Solana. Bridges enable interoperability between two blockchain networks while leveraging their respective benefits, such as exploring unique dApps, trading with lower transaction fees, and increasing investor\u2019s exposure to different assets that otherwise would not have been possible. In this article, we will examine how to bridge assets from Solana to Ethereum. But first, let\u2019s explore how cross-chain bridges operate.\n\nHow do cross-chain bridges work?\n\nAs mentioned earlier, blockchain assets often cannot be directly transferred across different blockchains. To solve this issue, cross-chain bridges create \"wrapped\" versions of the asset that can be transferred to another blockchain.\n\nSuppose you want to send one Solana coin to an Ethereum wallet using a cross-chain bridge. The wallet will receive a \"wrapped\" token that represents the Solana coin in the form of an ERC-20 token, which is supported on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nA quick note here is that there are two main types of bridges: Trusted bridges, which are controlled by a centralised entity, and trustless bridges, which operate on algorithms and smart contracts.\n\nLet us now understand how one can bridge from Solana to Ethereum.\n\nWith Allbridge\n\nOne of the many bridging options available to users is Allbridge. It assists in connecting EVM networks like Polygon and Ethereum with non-EVM chains such as Solana. Since its inception, Allbridge has facilitated over $6.4 million worth of asset transfers across blockchains. The transactions on Allbridge normally settle within 1 to 5 minutes, while the average fee charged for transactions is 0.3 percent.\n\nTo utilise Allbridge, simply navigate to their website, connect the Solana-supported wallet, and select the \"From Solana to Ethereum\" option. Then, input the destination address and enter the amount to bridge. The transaction then needs to be completed by clicking \"send\".\n\nUsing Portal Bridge\n\nPortal Bridge is one of the most popular options for bridging assets between Solana and Ethereum.\n\nThis is how the transfer can be done: First, go to Portal bridge, choose \"Source Solana to Target Ethereum\", and then select an asset you want to transfer. Connect two wallets on Solana and Ethereum. Finally, insert the address and amount, then proceed to approve the transaction by paying the network fees.\n\nOnce the transfer is complete, the bridge will lock your asset on the Solana network and mint equivalent tokens on the Ethereum network. You will get a confirmation once the process is successful. The procedure normally takes 8 to 10 minutes.\n\nWith Centralised Exchanges (CEX)\n\nCentralised exchanges have been a popular way to move assets between blockchains once cross-chain bridge thefts, like the Wormhole exploit, emerged as a security risk for users. Each has pros and cons, but both options can be utilized per individual preference. For instance, decentralized bridges charge more fees than centralized solutions, while CEXs require submitting a KYC and personal details on the platform before transferring funds.\n\nTo get started, open your CEX account, go to your wallet, and transfer ETH from your wallet. After receiving the asset, you then need to convert your funds to SOL. After the conversion, withdraw your SOL and send it back to your Solana wallet.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe two most well-known decentralised finance (DeFi) platforms available to users are Solana and Ethereum, and a number of options have been developed to allow users to transfer assets between these blockchains.\n\nIt is also important to note that cross-chain-related thefts have emerged as a major security risk in recent years, and one must weigh the options before choosing any bridge."

Blockchain is well-known for its ability to transform the world around us. It provides immutability, transparency, and unrivalled security that no other technology\n\nAre you curious about the size of a blockchain? We\u2019ll go through all there is to know about blockchain size, including its limits and if it can cause problems in the future. Blockchain is well-known for its ability to transform the world around us. It provides immutability, transparency, and unrivalled security that no other technology has previously been able to provide. After all, it affects how we define processes, store data, and investigate the security of the network on which the program runs.\n\nHowever, there is one major issue: blockchain block size. Let\u2019s take a look at how the blockchain works to get a better grasp of the issue.\n\nThere is no centralized authority in any blockchain network. The network\u2019s decentralization is aided by peer participation. A copy of the ledger is kept by each peer (where all transactions are stored). This means that if a new transaction occurs, the ledger on each node will be updated. The one-of-a-kind solution enables enterprises to build decentralized networks capable of solving previously unsolvable problems.\n\nThe Size of the Blockchain Ledger Is a Major Issue\n\nHowever, blockchain is not without flaws. Because there are just a few peers linked to the network, the blockchain block size was not as large at first. The bitcoin blockchain, for example, was 614 MB in size in 2012. However, the bitcoin blockchain has already expanded to 250K MB in size. Each peer/node is responsible for around 250 GB of data. This leads to difficulty with the size of the bitcoin blockchain.\n\nThe same issue affects other blockchain networks as well. Ethereum\u2019s blockchain has already surpassed 1 TB in size.\n\n3/Inclusive accountability. Key blockchain idea: a widely shared distributed ledger, achieving \u201cinclusive accountability\u201d Total size of fast new L1\u2019s is 750-2000GB. Cardano is sub 20GB (<1%). Anyone can run a node and verify the chain New L1s struggle with it or don\u2019t care pic.twitter.com/58VdXQfn1m \u2014 ADA whale (@cardano_whale) December 25, 2021\n\nWhat is the limit to the size of a blockchain?\n\nThe bitcoin blockchain ledger has increased from 150 GB to 250 GB in the last two years. That\u2019s nearly 50 gigabytes every year. By 2030, the size of a blockchain ledger might potentially exceed 1 TB. However, not every node needs to download the entire blockchain to become operational. Some people join the blockchain network to make transactions rather than to validate them.\n\nSome nodes are referred to as \u201cfull nodes.\u201d Full nodes are necessary for individuals who want to participate in the ongoing transaction\u2019s validation. This requires them to download the entire 250 GB blockchain data set, which includes block headers and transactions.\n\nFurthermore, the current size limit for bitcoin blockchains is 1 MB. Some of the space inside this limit, however, is unusable. As a result, you\u2019ll have to deal with the bitcoin blockchain size restriction as is. The issue of Ethereum\u2019s blockchain ledger size was more serious than that of bitcoin. A bitcoin investor, Alistair Milne, expressed concern about the scale of the Ethereum ledger compared to bitcoin. Ethereum is expanding at three times the rate of bitcoins, according to a picture he shared.\n\nHowever, this isn\u2019t entirely true, as Ethereum also provides ways to interact with the ledger. Pruning is a notion that allows nodes to work without having to download the entire blockchain data.\n\nDoes the size of a blockchain matter?\n\nYes, the size of a blockchain ledger is important. Blockchain is a relatively new technology that is expected to gain in popularity in the future years. Because Bitcoin is first-generation blockchain technology, it is not without flaws. It has issues with scalability and size. Scalability is becoming a challenge as the blockchain grows in size. It has been one of bitcoin\u2019s most serious problems. To temporarily address the issue, they implemented the SegWit2x hard fork to increase block size (at the granular level) and improve bitcoin\u2019s scalability and performance.\n\nThe size of the ledger is expected to grow significantly, with estimations of 6.5 TB by January 2023. It will necessitate the purchase of larger disk space in order to participate in the network. However, Moore\u2019s law predicts that hard disk storage prices will fall over time, allowing you to purchase less expensive storage. The biggest issue emerges when the rate at which the blockchain grows outpaces the rate at which storage becomes cheaper.\n\nIt will be difficult for enthusiasts to contribute their skills or ideas to the network. Contributors will have to pay thousands of dollars to get their nodes up and operating, which may or may not be worthwhile.\n\nWhat Are the Consequences of a Large Blockchain Size?\n\nWe live in a world where transactions are king. Non-cash payments in the billions are made every day. The rate of growth of transactions is quadratic. However, with cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, Ethereum, NEO, and others, we\u2019re seeing a shift in how non-traditional channels are used to conduct transactions.\n\nCompared to Visa or other forms of transactions, bitcoin does not now have to account for many transactions. However, if bitcoin is utilized for every transaction, each block might consume up to 2.4 terabytes, not to mention the fact that blockchain can generate one block every ten minutes. In other words, 2.4 terabytes of data will be added to the blockchain size every 10 minutes. 350 GB is added daily, and 127 TB is added yearly. This also implies that there is no limit on the number of ledgers.\n\nAlso, read \u2013 Is Blockchain a Hoax For Corporate? Experts Opinion\n\nThe issue limit creates new issues. These figures give cause for alarm. Furthermore, miners will take longer to solve a block because the block size will grow exponentially, leading to slower transactions. On the contrary, cheap hardware is our only hope in the foreseeable future. Terabytes of storage will not be a problem, and computing power will continue to rise rapidly, making transaction validation much easier.\n\nWhat Impact Will It Have on Blockchain-Based Projects?\n\nIs the problem affecting startups that are developing applications on Ethereum and bitcoin? It all relies on how the two blockchain technologies progress over time. Startups should not be concerned with their scale at this time. The Ethereum blockchain already has pruning, which reduces the amount of blockchain data required by a complete node. Bitcoin, on the other hand, does not yet allow pruning. The whole node status will be lost if someone prunes the bitcoin.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe size of the blockchain isn\u2019t the most pressing issue that needs to be addressed. In fact, the main focus right now is on scalability and transaction speed. So, what are your thoughts on the scale of blockchain ledgers, such as bitcoin and Ethereum? There is also a slew of other blockchain projects to conserve space and make it as efficient as possible."

Phantom users will now be able to manage their NFTs and tokens on Ethereum, Polygon, and Solana.\n\n1/ Phantom multichain is rolling out today! \ud83e\udd73\n\n\n\nNow you can use @ethereum, @0xPolygon, and @solana without switching wallets.\n\n\n\nWith support for multiple secret recovery phrases, it\u2019s easy to import all of your wallets in seconds.\n\n\n\nCompatible everywhere with a MetaMask button. pic.twitter.com/wbvwmZ1ZlJ \u2014 Phantom (@phantom) May 1, 2023\n\nThe new upgrade will enable users to use decentralized applications (dApps) across chains seamlessly. Specifically, the wallet will automatically connect to the appropriate network without manual switching.\n\nWith this move, Phantom aims to make itself more versatile and user-friendly for a broader set of crypto traders. The multichain features appeal especially to NFT users, which can now manage their NFTs on multiple chains.\n\nPhantom Adds More Features For NFT Management\n\nIn addition to the multichain functionality, Phantom introduced more features, including better NFT management and enhanced security.\n\nPhantom\u2019s new NFT management features let users search, pin, and manage listings on marketplaces directly within the wallet. The system will also enable users to hide spam NFTs from view.\n\nThe wallet also features a security upgrade, which lets users preview transactions in an easy-to-read format. The wallet will also have an automated blocklist to help prevent malicious transactions.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nPhantom first announced going multichain in November 2022, to capitalize on the diminishing popularity of centralized exchanges. Since the fall of FTX, users have been looking for alternative solutions for crypto custody.\n\nEthereum is by far the largest smart-contract network in the world, both in terms of market cap and total value locked. On the other hand, Polygon is the most popular scaling solution for Ethereum.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nSolana is betting that Phantom\u2019s growing market share among self-custodial wallets will ultimately bring more users to its network.\n\nRead more about Solana\u2019s latest initiative: a Web3 phone:\n\nCan Solana\u2019s Crypto-First \u2018Saga\u2019 Smartphone Succeed Where Others Failed?\n\nRead about Crypto.com\u2019s GPT chatbot:\n\nCrypto.com Launches Amy, an AI Companion for Traders"

        "title": "Altcoins To Invest In As Bitcoin And Ethereum Surge: OKB, Polygon And Big Eyes Coin - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have experienced a surge in trading prices, with BTC rising to $29,035 and ETH just below $1,900. BTC volume also increased by 84.70% in the last 24 hours. Despite concerns over First Republic Bank, Bitcoin has been steadily rising since hitting a low of $27,217 the day before. The global cryptocurrency market cap also rose by 1.18% in the last 24 hours to around $1.20 trillion, with Bitcoin\u2019s market cap standing at $557 billion. While the market movement remains range bound, here are three altcoins to invest in for great returns: OKB, Polygon (MATIC) and Big Eyes Coin (BIG).\n\nOKB: The Utility Token\n\nOKB is an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain that acts as a utility token for OKX exchange users. Traders can receive discounts, access token offerings, and earn interest on their savings depending on the number of OKB tokens held. Additionally, OKB is designed as a deflationary token through the \u201cBuy-Back & Burn\u201d protocol, which burns millions of dollars in OKB tokens every quarter, adding value to holders.\n\nPolygon\u2019s Current Decline A Minor Correction\n\nPolygon (MATIC) is currently below $1 as bears continue to pressure its price. Since April 19th, 2023, it has been on a gradual downtrend to its current price level of $0.966. Although recent price volatility and decline have affected other tokens in the market, MATIC has held onto most of its gains and remains above its January 1st price of $0.76. However, a sweep of previous lows remains possible if the bears maintain their charge, and the crypto market hopes the current decline is a minor correction rather than a downturn similar to the crypto winter of 2022.\n\nBig Eyes Coin To Launch On Top CEX, Uniswap\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG) has raised an impressive $34.5 million in presale and is set to launch on a top-tier CEX on June 15th, after the presale ends on June 3rd. The team has not yet confirmed which exchange it will launch on, but speculations are already circulating within the crypto community. The team has developed a roadmap for the next six months explaining the future plans for one of the most-promising. BIG plans to be listed on several exchanges, including Gate.io, Bitget, BKEX, MEXC, LBank, CoinEx, BIT, BitMart, Deepcoin, XT.COM, BitUBU, Hotbit, and BitForex, as part of its exchange roadmap. The team is dedicated to keeping the community informed and engaged throughout the project\u2019s growth and development.\n\nBig Eyes Coin is gaining recognition not only in the cryptocurrency market but also in the non-fungible tokens (NFTs) space. The project team is currently working on developing its own line of NFTs, known as SushiCrew, featuring the project\u2019s iconic cat characters. Each SushiCrew NFT will be unique, with its own set of characteristics and traits, making them highly collectible. The introduction of these NFTs is expected to strengthen Big Eyes Coin\u2019s brand and provide a new revenue stream for the community. The team believes that the NFT market is growing, and by launching SushiCrew NFTs, Big Eyes Coin is well-positioned to take advantage of this trend and establish itself as a significant player in the crypto industry.\n\nThe Big Eyes team expresses gratitude to the CatCrew for their significant support in the Big Eyes Coin project, which has led to the impressive presale amount. With the end of the presale on June 3rd and the launch on a top-tier CEX set for June 15th, the team is confident that Big Eyes Coin is the project to watch in the crypto space.\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG)\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nOpensea: https://opensea.io/collection/big-eyes-lootbox-cards\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Internet Computer (ICP) is setting its sights on providing native ETH integration to improve communication across blockchains. While this announcement hits the streets, Collateral Network (COLT) is turning heads with 35x returns while still being in public presale. This token is also set to revolutionize the lending and crypto industries with never-before-seen real-world utility.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nInternet Computer (ICP) Hints at Native ETH Integration\n\nIn an attempt to provide a true World Computer and enable a multi-chain environment where smart contracts can communicate across blockchains, Internet Computer (ICP) shares its plans to bring native ETH integration via its official website. Internet Computer (ICP) is already integrated with the Bitcoin Network and is now looking to expand by entering the ETH blockchain.\n\nWith the upcoming integration, Internet Computer (ICP) wants to enable smart contracts on both the Ethereum (ETH) and Internet Computer (ICP) networks to interact with each other, enabling the Internet Computer (ICP) to read balances of ETH or ERC-20 accounts safely. Moreover, this integration will allow Internet Computer (ICP) to sign and submit ETH transactions.\n\nAnd with the recent spikes in ETH transaction fees and other development obstacles, Internet Computer (ICP) could bring a way for new users to enjoy the benefits of ETH fully.\n\nCollateral Network (COLT) Is Getting Ready for 35x Returns\n\nAs Internet Computer (ICP) hints at new developments, Collateral Network (COLT) is already showing excellent results and returns. Even though it is still in public presale, Collateral Network (COLT) is already seeing growth, with experts predicting 35x returns over the next quarter.\n\nThe starting price for Collateral Network was $0.01 and has since risen to $0.014, which is already an increase.\n\nThe project has been receiving positive predictions due to the enormous changes and opportunities it\u2019ll bring to the crypto community. The peer-to-peer lender is unique in that it enables people with physical assets to obtain crypto loans by using them as collateral. The whole process is performed on the blockchain with the use of smart contracts making the transaction seamless, private and transparent for both parties.\n\nFor example, if you need a loan, you can leverage your luxury watch, gold, real estate, fine wines, etc., by sending your asset to Collateral Network. Once the relevant checks are finalized an NFT is minted of the asset and broken down into fractions (fractionalization). This enables multiple people on the platform to contribute to the loans with smaller amounts of capital (crowdlending).\n\nThis unique approach to asset-backed lending has got the industry buzzing as the real-world applications of this lending protocol are infinite industry altering. No mean feat for a market that is estimated to be worth $7 trillion dollars a year.\n\nWhile we\u2019re still waiting to see how successful ICP\u2019s ETH integration is, COLT is proving to be one of the most profitable crypto projects on the market.\n\nExplore the Collateral Network presale here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.collateralnetwork.io/\n\nPresale: https://app.collateralnetwork.io/register\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/collateralnwk\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Collateralnwk\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Celsius founder Alex Mashinsky has filed a motion to dismiss the complaint filed by the Attorney General of New York.\n\nThe lawsuit accused Mashinsky of misleading and defrauding the investors of his crypto lending firm.\n\nThe former CEO has dismissed the allegations made in the lawsuit and called them \u201cbaseless\u201d.\n\nAlex Mashinsky, the man behind the failed crypto lending firm Celsius, has filed a motion in the Supreme Court of New York to dismiss a complaint filed against him by the state of New York in January this year. Mashinsky\u2019s lawyers responded by claiming that the fraud claims made against him by New York Attorney General Letitia James, are baseless and derived from online misinformation.\n\nAlex Mashinsky: Crypto Products Offered By Celsius Were Not Securities\n\nThe lawsuit was filed by the State of New York against Alex Mashinsky for defrauding hundreds of thousands of investors out of billions of dollars worth of crypto assets. The lawsuit alleged that Mashinsky repeatedly made false and misleading statements regarding Celsius\u2019 safety to encourage investors to deposit billions worth of crypto into the crypto lender. Attorney General James further alleged that amid last year\u2019s crypto contagion, Mashinsky misrepresented and concealed the financial health of his company.\n\nAccording to the court filing by the former CEO\u2019s lawyers, the allegations made in the lawsuit \u201cparrot misformation\u201d on the internet about Mashinsky and Celsius. They claimed that the \u201cbaseless\u201d conclusions in the complaint demonstrated a fundamental misunderstanding of the bankrupt crypto lender\u2019s business and the role that the former CEO played in it. In the response, Mashinsky\u2019s lawyers claimed that Celsius\u2019 bankruptcy was blamed on him despite being caused due to external events that were out of his control.\n\nThe Complaint cynically cherry picks fragments of statements and sound bites, without broader context, falsely depicting Celsius\u2019s exceptional transparencies with its users as a deceptive tactic.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the allegation of perpetrating securities fraud by failing to register Celsius as a securities dealer and offering securities through the platform, Alex Mashinsky\u2019s lawyers stated that the Earn Accounts offered to customers were not securities. \u201cThe Complaint fails to plead adequately the existence of securities or commodities in Celsius\u2019s business model,\u201d the lawyers argued. The response also cited several legal precedents to argue that no investment contract exists between the firm and the investor without a predetermined interest rate."

The data indicated that job openings in the US had decreased to 9.6 million in March, falling below the expected 9.775 million and reaching their lowest point since April 2021. Investors might have perceived unfavourable employment data as favourable for the markets. Following the data release, Bitcoin rebounded from its six-day low of $27,600 and quickly rose to $28,500. Investors and traders may also be taking early action ahead of the US Federal Reserve's decision regarding an interest rate hike. In the meantime, Ethereum also saw activity at the $1,850 level, aligning with Bitcoin's movements.\u201d\n\nWazirX Vice President Rajagopal Menon said, \u201cBitcoin (BTC) saw a surge in price on Tuesday as investors showed renewed interest in crypto and other valuable assets amid banking concerns. This was triggered by a drop in shares of two regional banks, PacWest and Western Alliance Bancorp, leading to a BTC price rise from around $28,000. On WazirX, Komodo (KMD) and Stacks (STX) have been the top gainers in the last 24 hours.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin said, \u201cIn the short term, the escalating banking crisis, the US economic outlook, and monetary policy will affect the price of Bitcoin. Currently consolidating in the $27,000-$31,000 range, further US bank collapses may increase safe-haven demand, pushing Bitcoin sustainably towards $30,000. Predicting a new bull market for Bitcoin due to on-chain indicators, historical market cycles, and ongoing macroeconomic issues such as financial stability concerns.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, the CEO of BuyUCoin, said, \u201cThe crypto market remained almost flat ahead of the expected rate hike by US Fed on Wednesday. A rate hike of 25 basis points is expected and it remains to be seen if the Fed will end its hawkish stance and relax monetary policies to boost liquidity in the market. The continued rate hikes have already made borrowing a costly affair and we don\u2019t expect rates to come down from current levels anytime soon. The crypto market momentum will largely depend on the macroeconomic factors surrounding the financial markets.\u201d\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

Well, it\u2019s always a good sign when a token is trending, meaning that it has caught the eye of a lot of people. That\u2019s why, today, we will explore the top five trending crypto tokens in 2023 that are worth buying.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nTrending Cryptocurrencies in 2023\n\nIn our search for the top trending crypto tokens, we have singled out the following five as the best ones that have fantastic growth potential:\n\nCollateral Network \u2013 First Web3 Peer-To-Peer Lending Platform for Real-World Assets on the Blockchain Solana \u2013 Energy-Efficient, High-Performance Blockchain Platform for Smart Contracts Arbitrum \u2013 Affordable, Ethereum-Based Scaling System Ethereum \u2013 One of the Biggest Decentralized Blockchains for Creating and Building DApps and Smart Contracts Optimism \u2013 Scalable, Layer 2 Blockchain on the Ethereum Mainnet\n\nNow, let\u2019s cover our top five picks in more detail and see what each offers.\n\nCollateral Network (COLT)\n\nCollateral Network is the first Web3-based decentralized lending platform that enables people to use their real-world assets as collateral and borrow money against them on the blockchain. Currently, in its presale phase, experts believe that it will revolutionize the crowdlending industry, and investors have had their eyes peeled on the upcoming token.\n\nThe existing lending protocols on the blockchain only lend against digital assets like cryptocurrencies and NFTs, which are highly volatile and risky for lenders and borrowers.\n\nWell, that\u2019s precisely where the Collateral Network steps in, enabling borrowers to obtain crypto loans against tangible assets.\n\nBorrowers can put up their real estate, watches, collectibles, and other valuable assets as collateral and unlock funds they need.\n\nCOLT Is the utility token of the platform and provides holders with many benefits.\n\nBorrowers that are token holders can use the COLT token to get and the more tokens they hold, the lower the interest rate will be.\n\nOn the other hand, lenders that are token holders can use their tokens to get discounts on trading fees in the marketplace.\n\nThe key benefit is the COLT token holders only auctions where the community get the opportunity to buy distressed assets at below market value.\n\nOverall, the Collateral Network\u2019s future looks promising, as experts believe that the token has a 3500% growth potential, expecting its initial price of $0.01 to reach $0.35 during its presale.\n\nThe platform plans on listing on major DEX and CEX, experts say that the token will rise 100x when it lists.\n\nSolana (SOL)\n\nThe Solana blockchain platform was launched in 2020 by Solana Labs. It uses a proof-of-stake mechanism to offer users energy-efficient and scalable smart contract functionality.\n\nIn essence, the goal of the Solana platform is to provide the most censorship-resistant network in the world. The platform\u2019s founder, Anatoly Yakovenko, devised a system called proof-of-history which allows blockchain nodes to validate numerous transactions simultaneously. This makes the platform able to complete transactions much faster.\n\nAdditionally, the Solana platform\u2019s native token is SOL, which investors can also buy in smaller denominations that are called Lamports. Also, investors can stake SOL coins to make the transaction process faster and more efficient. Also, SOL holders can vote on changes that the Solana developers suggest.\n\nExperts praise Solana for its ability to handle high-traffic network volumes, which enterprise-level applications use. Additionally, users can design applications on Solana from the start due to the vast ecosystem of connected services it offers.\n\nThe high scalability of Solana helps keep transaction costs low, which results in lower fees for users.\n\nThere are many things that people can use the Solana network for, including creating DeFis, lending protocols, NFT marketplaces, games, and Web3 apps.\n\nToken Details Name Solana Symbol SOL Network Solana (SOL) Total Supply 539,312,705 Accepted Currencies USDT\n\nArbitrum (ARB)\n\nArbitrum is a layer 2 scaling software that sits on top of the base layer, i.e., the Ethereum blockchain and serves to make Ethereum transactions faster and cheaper.\n\nIt provides the same security as Ethereum and uses its proprietary software stack called Nitro to power its solutions. Additionally, the Nitro next-generation rollup architecture enables Arbitrum to provide 7x more output than Ethereum and lower fees.\n\nThe Abitrum solution announced the launch of its new ARB token on March 23rd, 2023. ARB tokens will allow token holders to vote about important Arbitrum decisions on the Arbitrum DAO (decentralized autonomous organization). Also, token holders will be the ones to elect the Arbitrum Security Council.\n\nIn essence, Arbitrum is designed to enable developers to run unmodified Ethereum Virtual Machine contracts and transactions on a second layer while still getting the excellent security of the Ethereum layer 1.\n\nToken Details Name Arbitrum Symbol ARB Network Ethereum (ETH) Total Supply 10,000,000,000 Accepted Currencies BTC, ETH, DOT, LINK, VET, USDC, CRO\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nEthereum is an open-source, decentralized blockchain that securely runs application code or smart contracts. It is used to build apps, hold assets, perform transactions, and communicate.\n\nEthereum gives its users full ownership and transparency into transaction data. Also, all transactions on Ethereum are paid for using its native token, Ether, which is the second-biggest cryptocurrency on the market, only falling short of Bitcoin.\n\nThe Ethereum network is permissionless and has decentralized governance. Its decentralized payment system is used across many industries, including finance, gaming, web browsing, advertising, and supply chain management.\n\nUsers can create two types of accounts in Ethereum: Externally Owned Accounts (EOA) and Contract Accounts.\n\nEOAs are controlled by a private key and have no associated code. Also, EOA users can send transactions. On the other hand, contract accounts have an associated code that executes when it gets a transaction from EOA.

        "title": "Building the Future: Ethereum's Role in Web3 Development and its Impact on the Crypto Market - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Introduction\n\nEthereum is a decentralized blockchain platform that allows developers to build and deploy decentralized applications (dApps). Its cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), is the second-largest by market capitalization, behind only Bitcoin. Ethereum\u2019s importance lies in its ability to enable complex smart contracts, DeFi applications, and NFTs.\n\nThe price of Ethereum has significant implications for the broader crypto market and developer ecosystem. As a leading platform, Ethereum\u2019s price often reflects market sentiment towards cryptocurrencies. Additionally, a higher ETH price can incentivize more developers to build on the Ethereum platform, leading to increased innovation and adoption. Therefore, understanding the factors that influence Ethereum price today is crucial for developers looking to build on the platform.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Role in Web3 Development\n\nExplanation of Web3 and Its Significance\n\nDefinition Web3, also known as the decentralized web, is the next generation of the internet. Unlike the current web, which relies on centralized servers and corporations, Web3 is based on decentralized blockchain technology. This means that data and applications are stored and run on a distributed network of computers, rather than a central server. Web3 has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with the internet, by enabling more privacy, security, and user control.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Role in Decentralized Applications (dApps)\n\nEthereum is a leading platform for building decentralized applications, or dApps. These applications are built using smart contracts, which are self-executing programs that run on the Ethereum blockchain. Some of the most popular use cases for dApps on Ethereum include:\n\nSmart Contracts and Their Use Cases\n\nSmart contracts allow for complex and automated agreements to be executed without the need for intermediaries. This can enable a wide range of use cases, from simple payment transactions to more complex supply chain management systems.\n\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi)\n\nDeFi applications on Ethereum allow for peer-to-peer financial transactions and services, such as lending, borrowing, and trading. These applications are often more accessible and transparent than traditional financial services, and can enable new forms of financial innovation.\n\nNon-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)\n\nNFTs are unique digital assets that are verified on the Ethereum blockchain. They can represent anything from artwork to collectibles, and are often used in the gaming and entertainment industries. NFTs have exploded in popularity in recent years, with multi-million dollar sales of digital art and other unique assets.\n\nFactors Influencing Ethereum\u2019s Price\n\nSupply and Demand Dynamics\n\nLike any other asset, the price of Ethereum is influenced by basic economic principles. The total supply of Ethereum is limited to 18 million per year to reduce inflation. However, demand for Ethereum can be influenced by various factors, including market sentiment, news events, and the growth of the broader crypto ecosystem.\n\nTechnological Advancements (e.g., Ethereum 2.0, Layer 2 Solutions)\n\nEthereum\u2019s technological advancements impact its price. For example, the upcoming Ethereum 2.0 upgrade is expected to increase scalability and reduce transaction fees. This could lead to higher adoption of Ethereum-based applications and demand for ETH. Additionally, layer 2 scaling solutions, such as Optimism and Arbitrum, could help reduce network congestion and transaction fees.\n\nMarket Sentiment and Speculation\n\nMarket sentiment and speculation can significantly affect Ethereum\u2019s price. Positive news events, such as increased institutional adoption or regulatory clarity, can lead to higher demand and prices. Conversely, negative news events, such as security breaches or regulatory crackdowns, can lead to decreased demand and lower prices.\n\nAdoption and Use Cases\n\nFinally, the adoption and use cases of Ethereum-based applications impact Ethereum\u2019s price. Increased usage of Ethereum-based applications could lead to higher demand for ETH, as users need ETH to pay for transaction fees and interact with smart contracts.\n\nThe Impact of Ethereum\u2019s Future on the Crypto Market\n\nHow Ethereum\u2019s Growth Affects Other Cryptocurrencies\n\nAs a leading blockchain platform, Ethereum\u2019s future growth has significant implications for other cryptocurrencies. Ethereum\u2019s popularity and network effect make it an attractive platform for developers and investors, which can lead to increased innovation and adoption of the broader crypto ecosystem. Additionally, the growth of Ethereum-based DeFi and NFTs has helped to increase interest and demand for other cryptocurrencies, such as stablecoins and privacy-focused coins.\n\nNetwork Effect\n\nEthereum\u2019s network effect is important for its continued success and growth. The established developer ecosystem, range of applications, and large user base all contribute to the strength of the network. As more developers and users interact with Ethereum-based applications, the network effect is likely to continue growing.\n\nChallenges and Competition\n\nHowever, Ethereum faces competition from other blockchain platforms such as Binance Smart Chain, Solana, and Polkadot. These platforms may offer faster transaction speeds and lower fees, attracting developers and users away from Ethereum. Additionally, Ethereum 2.0 must be successfully implemented for Ethereum to remain competitive in the long term.\n\nLong-Term Outlook for Ethereum\n\nOverall, Ethereum has a positive long-term outlook as a leading platform for building decentralized applications. However, the crypto market is constantly evolving, and Ethereum must continue to innovate and adapt to remain competitive. Regulatory and security risks could also impact the growth and adoption of the broader crypto ecosystem.\n\nStaying Ahead as a Developer\n\nDevelopers building on the Ethereum platform should stay up-to-date with the latest developments and upgrades.

        "content": "Introduction\n\nMeme coins have taken over the liquidity of Bitcoins, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nMeme coins are basically the crypto assets that gain popularity through social media trends, influencers and the community of the blockchain they are operating on. Some famous meme coins are Dogecoin and Shiba Inu.\n\nThese coins gain popularity overnight and also lose popularity overnight. Most meme coins become shit coins, that is useless coins. But the ones that are very trending nowadays and are doing incredibly in the last couple of years are Dogecoin and Shiba Inu.\n\nRecently, an anonymous crypto trader, named Crypto Tony alleged that the meme coins are taking away the liquidity of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nHe made this statement via Twitter through a tweet to his 289000 followers saying liquidity is flowing to meme coins from $BTC / $ETH. He also stated that this is the reason for the \u201c Sell in May\u201d phenomenon.\n\n\u201cSell in May and Go away\u201d is a phenomenon where it is believed from the historical performance of stocks, that due to the Halloween craze, the average growth of stocks in the months of November to April is much higher and stocks perform poorly during May to October. It\u2019s a theory put forward by stock trader Almanac.\n\nThe anonymous trader\n\nThe tweet of this trader came during the time when Pepe coin, a famous meme coin is getting a 2300% rally every day. In the last 24 hours, it has surpassed Dogecoin also.\n\nAccording to the Ethereum Blockchain explorer, Pepe coin has about 75000 holders holding a total of $5 million worth of tokens.\n\nEven though the hype for this meme coin is quite high, some traders are backing off. A trader sold out coins worth $2 million bearing up a loss of $350000 because of less liquidity.\n\nHe then revealed in a tweet that he is still waiting for a position entry on Bitcoin, and his best option would be to wait for a long position upon a test of the range low at $26,600. He also suggested that he may even go for a short if they fail to hold this position.\n\nAccording to him, Dogecoin will increase its value soon after the new laws. And Bitcoin will go down to rise up the other Altcoins.\n\nHe is keeping a close eye on Altcoins for the third and fourth quarters in 2023."
