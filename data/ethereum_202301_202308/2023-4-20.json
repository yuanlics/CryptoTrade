        "title": "Ethereum L2s Are a Bug Masquerading as a Feature - Blockworks",
        "content": "The Ethereum community has been raving about \u201clayer-2\u201d or \u201cL2\u201d solutions for quite some time now. These solutions are marketed as a way to make Ethereum faster, cheaper and more scalable.\n\nBut if you look at what is actually being built and why, you will see that the generally accepted L2 narrative isn\u2019t telling the whole story. What layer-2 technology is actually doing is putting a Band-Aid over some specific issues on Ethereum \u2014 but not actually creating solutions that will solve any of Ethereum\u2019s real problems.\n\nIf there\u2019s one belief at the core of crypto, it\u2019s that incentives matter; the motivations, often financial or reputational, that drive individuals or entities to promote or criticize a certain narrative.\n\nWhat are the incentives motivating the people behind L2s?\n\nThey stand to benefit from L2s being perceived as a feature rather than a bug.\n\nIf layer-2s were widely understood to be a Band-Aid, rather than a fix, this would negatively impact anyone even tangentially involved in the Ethereum space \u2014 and certainly anyone behind these solutions, or anyone who intends to leverage these solutions.\n\nA shift in perception that identifies L2s as an insufficient stopgap measure would likely encourage the community to prioritize finding and developing long-term solutions to Ethereum\u2019s challenges, potentially leading to the emergence of more innovative and sustainable technologies.\n\nWhat Ethereum is doing wrong\n\nThe main problem with Ethereum is that it can be simply too expensive for people to use. Vitalik Buterin has freely admitted this.\n\nWe can actually keep this discussion fairly non-technical. L2s are a solution to a PROBLEM. Something is wrong with Ethereum, and that needs to be fixed. That\u2019s just reality and it is FINE.\n\nThe reason why it is too expensive to use Ethereum is because the network charges gas (essentially, ETH) to use its resources. The more people use the network\u2019s resources, the scarcer those resources become and the higher the cost of those resources in ETH. Of course, the price of ETH can go up as this happens, which obviously creates certain financial incentives. Simply put, high usage and high ETH fees benefit people who already hold ETH.\n\nThe problem then with Ethereum is less about the fact that gas fees exist, but instead that gas fees are TOO high. They\u2019re so high that they are limiting the upside for the people who control the chain.\n\nIf gas fees are high because of limited network resources, then the solution is obvious; Increase network resources. L2s accomplish this by giving users a place to send their transactions instead of the main network (main net) where they can be processed. The results of those transactions can then be broadcast down into the main network, Ethereum.\n\nSimply put \u2014 L2s are a way of NOT using Ethereum. Why, then, is the L2 narrative one of the successful solving of Ethereum\u2019s problems, rather than a critical look at this solution\u2019s temporary nature?\n\nThe dominant approach in the crypto space has been to avoid speaking honestly about both the benefits and the limitations of the technologies we are developing.\n\nInstead, we act as though our existing solutions are perfect. Even though we can acknowledge when they need small improvements, it\u2019s normal to see anyone who says anything more intensely critical as an enemy, someone uninformed who doesn\u2019t know what they are talking about, someone just trying to pump their own bag.\n\nIncentives matter\n\nWhenever you see a very one-sided narrative being put forward, especially when there is a lot of money on the line, this is an indication that something isn\u2019t right. There\u2019s almost always two sides to every story, especially when that story is about a solution to a problem. It\u2019s crucial to approach such narratives with a discerning eye and critically evaluate the motivations behind each side of any argument to develop a well-rounded understanding of the issue at hand.\n\nIn the context of Ethereum and layer-2 solutions, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that different parties have their own incentives to either promote or criticize these technologies.\n\nOn the one hand, there are those who have a vested interest in promoting layer-2s as the ultimate solution to Ethereum\u2019s scalability issues; these individuals are likely to be Ethereum proponents or developers involved in creating and maintaining L2 projects. On the other hand, there are those who stand to gain from criticizing Ethereum and its scaling solutions, such as competitors in the blockchain space or individuals who have invested in rival platforms.\n\nIf L2 solutions were seen as temporary workarounds rather than real solutions, users, developers, and investors might become less inclined to participate in or support layer-2 projects.\n\nAnd while this would obviously hinder the growth and development of L2s, this lack of confidence in the real L2 narrative could actually prompt individuals to seek out alternative solutions, including new blockchain platforms, that offer genuine fixes to scalability and other issues faced by the Ethereum network. In other words, acknowledging the truth would be more beneficial long term to Ethereum than denying it.\n\nThe point here is not that L2s and going off of Ethereum to do your transactions are bad ideas. But if no one talks about what L2s do accurately (and that\u2019s obviously because there are no incentives to do so), then real solutions to Ethereum\u2019s issues will not be found \u2014 because no one will even be looking for them.\n\nAndrew Levine is the CEO of Koinos Group, a team of industry veterans accelerating decentralization through accessible blockchain technology.

        "content": "Ethereum price started a major decline below $2,000 against the US Dollar. ETH might extend its decline and revisit the $1,860 support.\n\nEthereum is gaining bearish momentum below the $2,000 support.\n\nThe price is trading below $2,000 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,955 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could decline further if it breaks the $1,930 support zone.\n\nEthereum Price Takes Hit\n\nEthereum\u2019s price struggled to climb further above the $2,125 resistance zone. ETH started a fresh decline below the $2,050 and $2,000 support levels, similar to Bitcoin.\n\nEther gained bearish momentum below the $2,000 support. It tested the $1,930 support. A low is formed near $1,933 and the price is now consolidating losses. It is now trading below $2,000 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nImmediate resistance is near the $1,960 zone. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,955 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,125 swing high to the $1,933 low is also just above the trend line.\n\nAn upside break above the trend line resistance might send Ethereum toward $2,000. The next major resistance is near the $2,025 zone or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,125 swing high to the $1,933 low. A close above the $2,025 resistance zone could start a fresh increase.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nIn the stated case, the price could rise toward the $2,125 resistance. Any more gains could send Ether toward the $2,200 resistance in the near term.\n\nMore Losses in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,960 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,930 level. A downside break below the $1,930 support could spark bearish moves.\n\nThe next major support is near the $1,900 zone, below which ether price might decline toward $1,860. In the stated case, the price could revisit $1,820. Any more losses may perhaps send the price toward $1,780 in the coming days.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is now gaining momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is well below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,930\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,960\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Here's how Ethereum's ZK-rollups can become interoperable - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The past few weeks have seen a wave of zero-knowledge proof project launches, including Polygon\u2019s zkEVM and Matter Lab\u2019s zkSync Era on mainnet, and the Linea zkEVM from ConsenSys on testnet.\n\nThey join StarkWare\u2019s long-running StarkEx solution and its decentralized cousin StarkNet along with a variety of other projects in development from Polygon (Miden, Zero, etc.) and Scroll.\n\nThey all promise faster and cheaper transactions to scale Ethereum using zero-knowledge proofs.\n\nBut is the brutal competition between ZK-rollups a zero-sum game where there can be only one winner? Or are we looking at a future in which lots of different rollups are able to work in harmony and interoperably?\n\nAnthony Rose, head of engineering for zkSync, thinks the latter future is much more likely and predicts that one day, no one will think about which ZK-rollup they are on because it\u2019ll all just be infrastructure.\n\n\u201cI think that if we don\u2019t get to that world, then we\u2019ve probably failed,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the same way as somebody using Snapchat or Facebook doesn\u2019t really have to know about TCP/IP or HTTP \u2014 it\u2019s just the plumbing of the way the internet works.\u201d\n\nBut how do we move from a bunch of competing sovereign rollups to an ecosystem of ZK solutions that are interoperable and composable?\n\nPeople are already starting to think about this question, and all of the ZK projects Magazine spoke to have plans to make their projects interoperable with at least some other rollups \u2014 although the extent to which that can happen likely depends on the development of standards and protocols.\n\nAlso read: Attack of the zkEVMs! Crypto\u2019s 10x moment\n\nZero knowledge about ZK-rollups?\n\nIf you\u2019re unfamiliar with the term \u201czero-knowledge proofs\u201d \u2014 which StarkWare insists should be called \u201cvalidity proofs\u201d \u2014 they\u2019re a way to scale Ethereum using cryptography. Rollups take the computation for tens of thousands of transactions off the main blockchain and write a tiny cryptographic proof back to Ethereum that proves the computation was carried out correctly.\n\n\u201cEvery proof we generate covers roughly 20,000 transactions and fits inside a single block of Ethereum,\u201d explains StarkWare co-founder Eli Ben-Sasson.\n\nDespite this increase in transactions per block, zkSync\u2019s Rose doesn\u2019t think Ethereum can come close to scaling up to become the base layer for everything via a single rollup.\n\n\u201cA ZK-rollup on its own will not scale to the world that we\u2019re talking about,\u201d Rose says. \u201cIf we think that applications with some interactions on the blockchain are providing value to hundreds of millions of people, the scalability problem is still there to be solved.\u201d\n\nScaling is a little like internet bandwidth, in that the more you get, the more you realize you need. Back in 2017, Ethereum planned to scale using \u201cEth2\u201d sharding. This roadmap was then ripped up after ZK-rollups emerged in 2018 and promised vastly greater scaling, but only if Ethereum upgraded the blockchain with a different form of sharding (proto danksharding and then danksharding) to enable the ZK-rollups to achieve higher throughput.\n\nEven then, Rose says it\u2019s likely rollups will need to work in collaboration. \u201cThis is a big active area of research for us,\u201d Rose says of interoperability. \u201cAs the systems mature as well\u2026 I think, naturally, this is kind of the pattern that these systems suggest.\u201d\n\nEthereum scaling is some way off\n\nIt\u2019s the early days yet for scaling, however. Although various solutions claim they can theoretically hit tens of thousands of transactions per second (or even talk about \u201cunlimited\u201d scaling), in practice, they\u2019re hamstrung by data availability on Ethereum.\n\nAt present, between them, the various Ethereum scaling solutions and Ethereum are running at about 25 transactions per second (TPS). Ethereum itself has performed an average of about 12 TPS over the past month, Arbitrum One was at 7.2 TPS, Optimism at 2.65 TPS and zkSync at 1.6 TPS, according to ETHTPS.info.\n\nThese numbers move around a bit and are low mostly due to demand rather than capacity. StarkEx is not covered, but StarkWare tells Magazine it averaged 5 TPS over the past month.\n\nDespite supply outweighing demand so far, interoperability between rollups would already be helpful to ensure that users don\u2019t get stuck in walled gardens. Optimistic Rollup users, for example, have to wait a week to withdraw funds, which rather limits interoperability.\n\nZK-rollups don\u2019t have that limitation and can allow instant withdrawals (but don\u2019t).\n\nAlso read: ZK-rollups are \u2018the endgame\u2019 for scaling blockchains: Polygon Miden founder\n\nInteroperable ZK-rollups are possible, but is it probable?\n\nBobbin Threadbare, founder of Polygon Miden, says interoperability between ZK-rollups is certainly technically possible, but \u201cwhether it will happen in practice is a different question.\u201d\n\nHe explains that withdrawals aren\u2019t instant yet because it\u2019s not financially viable to put proofs on Ethereum that frequently, so transactions are fired off roughly every 10 or 20 minutes. As demand and throughput go up, this delay will become quicker and quicker.\n\n\u201cAnd in that case, you get closer, closer and closer to this instant kind of movement between different places,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThe second thing is that different rollups will have to have some kind of incentives to say, \u2018Okay, let\u2019s figure out how we can seamlessly move things from this to that.\u2019\u201d\n\nThreadbare adds, \u201cVery fast interoperability between ZK-rollups is technically possible, but a) People need to agree on standards, and b) They need to actually implement these standards in their systems.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I think that\u2019s a much, much more complicated thing to do.\u201d\n\nInteroperability is not composability\n\nThere\u2019s a difference between \u201cinteroperability\u201d and \u201ccomposability\u201d \u2014 although people often use them interchangeably.\n\nInteroperability is easier and basically involves being able to move funds from one layer-2 (L2) solution to another. \u201cBy this definition, at least all of the rollups which share an L1 today already are interoperable!\u201d notes Optimism co-founder Ben Jones.\n\nArbitrum\u2019s Patrick McCorry also says that for basic interoperability, you can already send an asset from one rollup to another via Ethereum \u2014 it\u2019s just slow.\n\n\u201cOr you could have some off-chain solution, maybe like Hop protocol, where there\u2019s someone in the middle who you give them the assets from StarkWare and then you take the assets to Scroll, and they provide some way to synchronize. So, there\u2019s ways to do that,\u201d he says.\n\nHop Protocol currently allows users to send funds between Ethereum, Polygon, Gnosis, Optimism and Arbitrum, though ZK-rollups aren\u2019t currently supported. Connext offers a similar service, including BNB. A cross-chain DEX and bridge aggregator called Rango already connects StarkNet to other L2s.\n\n\n\nAlso read: Ethereum is eating the world \u2014 \u2018You only need one internet\u2019\n\nDeclan Fox, product lead for the ConsenSys Linea zkEVM, expects support will be added soon. \u201cMany third-party bridge providers will continue to offer interoperability solutions for ZK-rollups,\u201d he says, adding that bridges have drawbacks around trust and fees.\n\n\u201cAt Linea, we value open systems and interoperability highly. The Linea testnet has already integrated many of the leading bridging solutions for this reason. In the future, Linea will be able to trustlessly interoperate with any of the layer 3 off-chain systems deployed on top of the layer 2 through their validating bridges.\u201d\n\n6/16) The case of two users exchanging value within an L1 is simple\n\n\n\nSimply scan the other user's QR code & press send, as long as they are also using ETH\n\n\n\nIn the case of L2s, this is not so simple, as the user now needs to know what L2 their friend is on & how to bridge between \u2014 Justin Bons (@Justin_Bons) April 10, 2023\n\nMetaMask Snaps might help\n\nAnother possibility for interoperability is via the browser wallet MetaMask. ConsenSys is in the midst of developing new crowdsourced wallet extensions called Snaps that projects can develop that extend the capabilities of MetaMask.\n\nMetaMask senior product manager Alex Jupiter says Snaps are still in the testing phase, \u201cbut if we imagine a future where you know Snaps is stable, developers can extend it in all manner of ways. Of course, the next step is to get these different Snaps talking to each other. So, one ZK-rollup can talk to another ZK-rollup, right? And that\u2019s part of the vision of Snaps, and yeah, we want to make that world possible.\u201d\n\nOne Snap that has been demoed already enables MetaMask users to control Bitcoin via their Ethereum wallet, so getting ZK-rollups talking to each other certainly seems achievable.\n\n\u201cWho knows where bridging is gonna go in the future as well. I\u2019m not an expert on ZK-rollups, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a core technical limitation of that being a problem in the future.\u201d\n\nMessari slide highlighting \u201ccomposable rollup ecosystems with shared infrastructure.\u201d\n\nZK-rollups and composability\n\nComposability is the ability to initiate a transaction that involves operations on more than one different rollup. Jones calls it \u201ca stronger form\u201d of interoperability \u201cwhere chains can do more than just communicate asynchronously with each other but actually have transactions, which are aware of the state of each chain in some more \u2018real-time\u2019 manner (think cross-chain flash loans).\u201d\n\nThis is likely to require the development of new standards and protocols, and Rose says that the sooner this happens the better.\n\n\u201cIt is a strictly better user experience if teams can build through an interface, and we can attempt to have more standardization. I think there is appetite for some of this standardization as well, and I do think we will see more of it as these systems mature.\u201d\n\nFox says that \u201cto get to a point where we have synchronous composability, there will need to be a globally sequenced and ordered set of transactions across the different off-chain systems. This is theoretically possible with ZK-rollups thanks to SNARKs [a type of ZK proof] where, for example, a common sequencer could offer a UX of unified execution and pooled liquidity,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cImagine making a DeFi trade where parts of the trade are executed on different chains for optimal liquidity all within the same transaction.\u201d\n\nBase layer advertisement from Coinbase. (Coinbase)\n\nOptimistic about the Superchain\n\nOne potential coordination method might be Optimism\u2019s Superchain concept, which it announced at the same time Coinbase unveiled its base layer-2 fork of Optimism.\n\nOptimism is an Optimistic Rollup, which is another way to scale Ethereum, though more limited in potential throughput. According to the announcement:\n\n\u201cThe Superchain seeks to integrate otherwise siloed L2s into a single interoperable and composable system.\u201d\n\nJones tells Magazine, \u201cThere is no silver bullet,\u201d but there are a couple of requirements for interoperability and composability the Superchain aims to address:\n\nShared Sequencing: \u201cTo have a system where you can do a cross-chain flash loan, at the very least, at the time when that transaction is being processed, it needs to be included in both of the chains reliably. This requires some notion of sequencers being able to communicate, merge or otherwise network together.\u201d\n\nSeparation of Proving and Execution: \u201cDifferent applications have different security requirements, and those security requirements impose different kinds of restrictions on what interoperability properties can be achieved. By de-coupling the computation of chain state from the proving of cross-chain messages, we can maximize the interoperability of applications without fragmenting them to other chains.\u201d\n\nHe says the Superchain can connect optimistic and ZK-rollups as well as other chains, providing a shared, modular \u201cstandard for all these innovations to happen on.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is going to be far easier to make these chains interoperate when they are built on the same codebase, compared to interoperating chains, which were written separately from the ground up,\u201d he says.\n\nHowever, underscoring Threadbare\u2019s point about political issues being more complicated than technical issues, Arbitrum CEO Steven Goldfeder dismissed the concept out of hand.\n\n\u201cThe notion that we\u2019re going to sort of coalesce on one particular technology stack \u2014 a technology stack that\u2019s not even built out today, that doesn\u2019t have the core features that make it a layer 2 or make it a rollup \u2014 the notion that we do that is, I think, a bit presumptuous,\u201d he told The Defiant.\n\nWhy connect ZK-rollups with Optimism?\n\nAnd Arbitrum is built using Optimistic Rollups. It might be even harder to convince ZK-rollups with their higher potential throughput, to coordinate via Optimism. To some it might seem like connecting fiber optic cables together with copper wire.\n\nAll the L2s make this claim though (Coinbase)\n\nHowever, Optimism is laying the groundwork to incorporate ZK proofs (validity proofs) in its systems with the Bedrock upgrade, and the Superchain will take this idea even further. \u201cCompatibility there is the goal,\u201d says Jones.\n\nOther potential coordination methods are the Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol from Cosmos or \u201cmodular blockchain\u201d Celestia (though the latter seems to be trying to replace Ethereum as the data availability layer).\n\nBut ZK-rollups could also connect directly with each other.\n\nPolygon ZK-rollups will be interoperable\n\nPolygon has a variety of flavors of ZK-rollup possible in development. They include Polygon Miden (similar to StarkNet), the Polygon zkEVM (compatible with existing EVM projects), Zero (recursive scaling) and Nightfall (Optimistic Rollups meet zero-knowledge cryptography).\n\nThreadbare says that coordinating internally to hook up Polygon\u2019s ZK solutions is easier than coordinating with outside projects, and he believes the technical challenges are doable. The team is working on the LX-LY bridge to enable this interoperability already.\n\n\u201cBecause we are all part of the same company, then the technical integration becomes much easier to solve,\u201d he says. \u201cMoving between these rollups will be super, super simple.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe friction, it\u2019s not two separate chains or three separate chains. It doesn\u2019t appear like that. It\u2019s just one Polygon that settles on Ethereum. And moving assets or funds or tokens between these different environments is super, super straightforward and easy. That\u2019s the end game.\u201d\n\nEthereum is eating the world. Metaphorically that is.\n\nStarkEx and StarkNet\n\nStarkWare\u2019s Ben-Sasson says they are building similar interoperability between StarkEx and StarkNet.\n\n\u201cYeah, definitely. We\u2019re gonna be porting the StarkEx systems to be layer 3s over at StarkNet, and, at some point, for them to be solutions on top of StarkNet. That\u2019s definitely the plan,\u201d he says.\n\nBack in 2020, StarkWare released a blog laying out its plans for interoperability, but Ben-Sasson says that has been superseded. StarkWare\u2019s Cairo is a Turing-complete language and virtual machine, which makes it similar in capability to a general-purpose computer.\n\n\u201cA good analogy is to think of a layer 2 or a layer 1 as some computer that is just a bit slower than your laptop, but it has a lot of integrity and safety,\u201d he says. \u201cSo, you can start just connecting these computer programs in various ways. Just like today, computers talk to each other and inter-operate or compose.\u201d\n\nTo get computers to talk to each other over the internet, a set of standards like TCP/IP and HTTP were developed. Ben-Sasson agrees that\u2019s the likely path for connecting validity-proof rollups, too.\n\nCointelegraph explainer on STARKs v SNARKs\n\nPerhaps ZK-rollups can connect direct\n\nStarkNet isn\u2019t working on standards like that at present, but Ben-Sasson suggests there may be other paths to interoperability. He says smart contracts can be written to interpret the different types of incompatible proofs used by different rollups. StarkNet uses STARKs as the name suggests; zkSync uses SNARKs, for example, while Polygon Zero uses recursive SNARKs called PLONKs.\n\n\u201cSomeone already wrote on StarkNet a smart contract that allows you to verify a Groth 16 SNARK,\u201d he says.\n\nZKPs might disrupt the design of the blockchain execution layer. Why bother with specialized languages, when you can just submit a proof of any computation in any language? \u2014 Jake Brukhman (@jbrukh) April 15, 2023\n\nThis means the two rollups can communicate directly.\n\n\u201cAs long as you can, in chain one, verify the proofs of chain two, you can start having interoperability. StarkNet is already able to verify STARKs, and now also Groth 16 SNARKs, and I\u2019m pretty sure that very soon, we\u2019ll have things like, you know, PLONKs and Plonky and other kinds of systems.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, at least in StarkNet, it should be relatively straightforward to be able to prove things happened correctly in other chains, and you can start having interoperability.\u201d\n\nFox tells me separately that Linea\u2019s system \u201cis already using the EVM to verify proofs (Groth16, PlonK, etc.) in a smart contract,\u201d which he says can make it interoperable with L3s.\n\nBen-Sasson says it seems likely that StarkNet would be able to connect to different rollups directly.\n\n\u201cYou can do it directly. You can do it because it\u2019s a general-purpose computer and because of the validity rollup nature, right, that you can just have these systems talking to each other.\u201d\n\nSo, it sounds like the future is interoperable and composable.\n\n\u201cYes, it definitely is interoperable and composable. Yes. Definitely.\u201d"

        "title": "Staking infrastructure firm P2P.org raises $23 million shortly after upgrade to Ethereum - Fortune",
        "content": "P2P.org, a blockchain infrastructure firm, announced on Thursday that it had raised $23 million in a round led by Jump Crypto, Bybit, and Sygnum.\n\nDmitry Argunov, who is based in Cyprus and is P2P.org\u2019s chief product officer, declined to provide the implied valuation of the company, whose parent firm is incorporated in the Cayman Islands. A company spokesperson also declined to make public other participants in the funding round.\n\nP2P.org\u2019s business piggybacks on proof of stake, an increasingly common method blockchains use to secure their network, or prevent bad actors from hijacking a public database to, for example, falsely deduct a user\u2019s funds.\n\nAs opposed to Bitcoin\u2019s proof of work, which requires a large amount of electricity to verify transactions, blockchains like Ethereum require those who\u2019d like to secure the network\u2014the validators\u2014to put in escrow a certain amount of Ether, Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency. For validators, it\u2019s a direct financial incentive to help protect the network.\n\nIn return, validators receive interest on the amount of cryptocurrency they stake, or put into escrow. They also receive rewards for directly validating transactions on the blockchain.\n\nFor a crypto-naive institution that wants to reap the rewards of staking\u2019s high yields, the process can be quite complicated. Anyone who would like to be a validator needs to follow a complicated protocol for depositing cryptocurrency and then offer up a computer to validate the transactions.\n\nThis is where companies like P2P.org come in, which simplify the process for staking on a wide set of protocols, including Ethereum.\n\nInvestors can send companies like P2P.org the amount of cryptocurrency they\u2019d like to stake, and the firm then pools customer funds to stake the cryptocurrency, offering up its own computers to validate transactions. In return, P2P.org takes a cut of the yield.\n\nOriginally proof of work, Ethereum switched to proof of stake in 2022 and recently implemented two upgrades to its staking system in April, separately named Shanghai and Capella.\n\n\u201cThe recent Shanghai upgrade is opening up the possibility for further institutional interest in the direct staking of ETH,\u201d Konstantin Lomashuk, founder of P2P.org, said in a statement.\n\nAs Ethereum, the second-largest blockchain next to Bitcoin, continues to upgrade its proof-of-stake system and the energy-intensive proof-of-work method continues to draw criticism for its environmental impact, companies that facilitate staking, like P2P.org, are positioned to continue attracting both venture and institutional capital.\n\n\u201cThe third iteration of the internet was born with the promise of decentralization and democratization of finance,\u201d Bill Xing, Bybit\u2019s head of financial product, said in a statement. \u201cIt is vital that we fortify the nodes that connect the users of Web3 and harness the power of network effect.\u201d"

        "title": "An Overview of Ethereum Scaling - Unchained - Unchained",
        "content": "Developers have long sought ways to make Ethereum fit for huge numbers of users. Here are the most hopeful scaling solutions.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain can host non-fungible tokens (NFTs), games, decentralized exchanges, and a range of applications. But it doesn\u2019t have the capacity required to simultaneously handle thousands of transactions from all those applications. It\u2019s more comfortable at around 15 transactions per second, far off the pace of, say, credit card networks. Developers have long looked for a way to increase the blockchain\u2019s throughput and reduce network congestion.\n\nThe Problem Realized\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain was designed to be more flexible than Bitcoin. Not only could you send the network\u2019s native currency, ETH, but you could also easily send other stuff, including NFTs.\n\nEthereum\u2019s utility quickly proved problematic, however. In 2017, an early NFT project called CryptoKitties took off. The network struggled to handle all the transactions\u2014it\u2019s not just purchases and trades that get posted on the network, but also smaller transactions such as bids. During high traffic, transaction fees are designed to go up. While some people paid the ballooning levies, many grumbled or were priced out.\n\nEthereum had a clear problem: scalability. If a few thousand people trading digital cats could all but paralyze the blockchain, how was it going to become \u201cthe world\u2019s computer\u201d?\n\nWhat Did Developers Do?\n\nThere were three main courses of action.\n\nFirst, competitors like Solana emerged to develop alternative blockchains that could handle thousands of transactions per second. These blockchains often have their own tradeoffs\u2014Solana, for instance, relied on a small group of \u201cvalidators\u201d to verify transactions, which worked well but at some cost to security\u2014but generally host all the same types of applications as Ethereum.\n\nSecond, Ethereum developers researched network upgrades and scalability solutions. The most promising was sharding, which involves splitting a chain into many smaller chains. Like Bitcoin, Ethereum was originally designed so that every node is responsible for verifying the blockchain\u2019s state. That level of redundancy is hard to scale. Sharding fixes that by removing the requirement that every node participate in validating every transaction. By splitting responsibilities between users, the network can process many more transactions per second.\n\nFinally, many have looked to develop products that could help scale Ethereum by connecting to it.\n\nThe Four Types of Scaling Solutions\n\nThere are four basic categories of scaling solution, each with subcategories:\n\nState channels\n\nOne potential solution is keeping transactions off the main chain via state channels. With state channels, one party puts ether into a sort of escrow account to open the channel, and any transactions are tallied offchain\u2014that is, on a separate network that then submits its results back to the main protocol\u2014before a final transaction closes the channel. Think of it like keeping a restaurant tab where your card is only swiped at the beginning and end. Due to some shortcomings, state channels have fallen out of favor. For one thing, they can require users to commit a lot of capital, decreasing their liquidity.\n\nPlasma\n\nPlasma involves bridging Ethereum via a smart contract to a plasma, or \u201cchild,\u201d chain, where transactions will be executed. While plasma chains can harness some of Ethereum\u2019s underlying security, their setup more or less requires users to trust chain operators not to act maliciously. Though once promising, the idea has also fallen out of favor.\n\nSidechains\n\nThe most popular sidechain is the Polygon proof-of-stake chain. Essentially, you can lock your ETH into place on Ethereum and then mint tokens to represent that value over on Polygon, akin to changing out your dollar bills at the casino in exchange for chips to spend at the blackjack table. While sidechains are like plasma chains, one key difference is that they create their own security. It\u2019s like leaving the safe confines of Ethereum to cross a bridge with a sign that reads: \u201cEnter at your own risk.\u201d\n\nRollups\n\nRollups aren\u2019t to the side of the main blockchain but are instead built right on top of it. Therefore, they are known as layer-2 blockchains. Their main function is to roll up multiple transactions into one, execute them on their chain, and then send back a compressed bit of data to the main chain to show that the transactions have taken place.\n\nThere are two general types of rollups: optimistic rollups and zero-knowledge (zk) rollups. Optimistic rollups save space by assuming transactions are valid. To prevent bad transactions from getting finalized on Ethereum, validators can submit \u201cfraud proofs\u201d that show that the network\u2019s state was incorrectly changed.\n\nZk-rollups, on the other hand, use zero-knowledge cryptography to cut out most of the data that needs to be sent back to the main chain; this reduces the transaction size, abetting scaling. (For more on zero-knowledge proofs, see our explainer on zkEVMs.)\n\nThe Future\n\nSince at least 2021, Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin and others have looked to a combination of network upgrades, sharding, and rollups as a solution to Ethereum\u2019s scaling issues.\n\nEthereum developers are currently reviewing proto-danksharding via EIP-4844. This would allow some \u201cblobs\u201d of information to hitch a ride with blocks, enabling more data to be processed.\n\nMost external interest in scaling is focused on rollups. In March 2023, Polygon, long known for its sidechain, unveiled its zkEVM\u2014a way to make Ethereum more compatible with zk-rollups. In the same month, Coinbase jumped into the layer-2 game by building its own rollup on Optimism\u2019s open-source stack."

The tweet featured lyrics from Liang Jingru\u2019s renowned song, \u201cHappy Breakup,\u201d leaving the community in speculation and intrigue.\n\nVitalik\u2019s love life has always been shrouded in mystery, with speculations of him dating Chinese women and indulging in hot pot dinners at Chinese restaurants. Now, with afrawang.eth, a blockchain professional, in the spotlight, rumors abound about her being Vitalik\u2019s long-rumored Chinese girlfriend.\n\nCurious followers have flooded the tweet with inquiries about their relationship status, fueling the gossip fire.\n\nJustin Sun Jokes About Ethereum Price Drops After Vitalik\u2019s Speculated Breakup\n\nInterestingly, after afrawang.eth published an article on the 18th, the price of Ethereum took a tumble from its lofty height of $2,100. By the 19th, it had dipped below the $2,000 mark, hitting a low of $1,888 before rebounding to its current trading price of $1,902.\n\nWhile some speculate that Vitalik\u2019s supposed breakup may have influenced Ethereum\u2019s price drop, there is no confirmation of the news, leaving it all as mere speculation.\n\nIn a humorous turn of events, Justin Sun, the founder of Tron, couldn\u2019t resist poking fun at the situation. He took to Twitter and jokingly suggested that Vitalik\u2019s breakup was to blame for the crypto market\u2019s slump, offering to play matchmaker and introduce him to a new partner to get the crypto industry back on track.\n\nRumor has it that the crypto market and ETH price are down\ud83d\udcc9 because @VitalikButerin ended things with his girlfriend.\ud83d\udc94 For the sake of the crypto industry, I volunteer to introduce him to a new partner!

        "content": "The Merge represented the Ethereum network\u2019s transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. 218 days later, more than 103,092 ETH has been eliminated from the supply of the world\u2019s largest altcoin.\n\nAt current prices, this amounts to a little over $197 million. Deflation on the network is on the rise as the supply declined by 0.146% per year.\n\nAccording to the latest data from the Ethereum monitoring site \u2018ultrasound.money,\u2019 the current supply of ether stands at nearly 120,416,113 million coins.\n\nThe currency burn rate over the last 30 days was found to be at 1,125k ETH and a supply growth of -0.37%.\n\nAt this pace, the Ethereum supply is expected to reach 118.1 million by the year 2025.\n\nIssuance rewards for stakers, on the other hand, will be at 3.9% per year, while the burn rate for the non-stakers will stand at 1.8% per year.\n\nContrastingly, if Ethereum had not undergone the Merge and instead continued to rely on miners to secure the network, the supply of the token would have increased by more than 2.5 million ETH, which translates to an astonishing $4.9 billion in the current market value.\n\nETH\u2019s supply, for one, would have increased by 3.53% every year.\n\nWhile the Merge was indeed responsible for the reduction in ETH supply by a considerable amount, the aspect of burning ether can be attributed to the Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1559, which was implemented via the London upgrade in August 2021. Its main purpose is to slash inflation on the Ethereum network and exert deflationary pressure on the token\u2019s supply.\n\nMeanwhile, the Shapella upgrade on April 12 enabled stakers to unlock their staked Ether. The exodus of tokens following the event slowed down.\n\nWithin a week, the amount of staked ether trumped the number of ETH being withdrawn for the very first time."

Bitcoin\u2019s price dropped to around $29,000, while Ethereum is trading slightly below $2000.\n\nBulls are attempting to defend these pivotal levels, and it\u2019s important to see how things will pan out and whether there\u2019s another crash incoming.\n\nBitcoin Price Drops Toward $30K\n\nThe market was performing relatively well throughout the past 24 hours as prices were recovering from the most recent declines. Bitcoin had reclaimed $30K.\n\nUnfortunately, the past hour has turned out to be quite negative, as the price tumbled toward $29K in less than 15 minutes. Longs comprised the overwhelming majority of the liquidations, so that could be a classic example of a long squeeze.\n\nThat said, BTC tagged $29K to the cent and is currently trading around $29,300, as seen in the chart above.\n\nAlicia Bakery CMO - A really good agency Did you like this market update?\n\nThis is all you need not to miss any price action in the raging crypto markets.

The price is currently hovering near it, and the bulls are fighting to protect it.\n\nAs seen in the heatmap above, all the major cryptocurrencies were caught off guard by this most recent move, and the market is largely painted in red.\n\nSOL lost quite a bit \u2013 around 8.5% of its price. It\u2019s also fairly evident that Bitcoin is boding well compared to the rest of the market.\n\nFor another day, Radix (XRD) remains the best performer. Despite the turmoil, the cryptocurrency is up 10% in the past 24 hours. It lost 9.4% in the past hour, though. Apart from it, all the other altcoins are trading in the red. Arbitrum\u2019s ARB lost 12.6% and is the worst performer during this period.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting to see how the market will pan out in the next 24 hours and whether or not this is just a temporary correction or the beginning of a deeper one."

ENS allows users to map human-readable names like \u201ccointelegraph.eth\u201d to machine-readable information like cryptocurrency addresses and URLs:\n\n\u201cThis allows us to reach those who are either just entering the space or who are not yet comfortable with transacting and would prefer to use the currency and payment form they understand best.\u201d\n\nThe upgrade of ENS\u2019s platform is also touted to expand its usability beyond a primary use-case of creating human-readable names for wallets to replace numerical addresses typically generated by wallet service providers, platforms and blockchain protocols.\n\nENS users can use names to host censorship-resistant websites, which can be linked to conventional domain name service (DNS) addresses already in use.\n\nRelated: State of play: Decentralized domain services reflect on industry progress\n\nMoonPay\u2019s vice president of partnerships, Bree Blazak, highlighted the integration with ENS as a means to create a simple payment experience for new users looking to obtain digital identities or decentralized domains:\n\n\u201cOur partnership with ENS delivers that by making it possible to buy a .eth name with some of the most familiar payment methods available.\u201d\n\nEthereum Name Service hasseen over 2.3 million names created from more than 550,000 unique addresses. As Cointelegraph previously explored, decentralized domain name registrations have been on the rise over the past two years.\n\nBoth ENS and Unstoppable Domains have become leading platforms onboarding new users to the world of Web3 and decentralized identities. The latter also partnered with MoonPay to incorporate nonfungible token domains in transactions on the platform in July 2022.\n\nMagazine: 2023 is a make-or-break year for blockchain gaming: Play-to-own"

        "title": "Is Ethereum Better Than Bitcoin? - CoinCodex",
        "content": "Ethereum is better than Bitcoin if you want to use decentralized applications like DEXes and NFT marketplaces. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has a larger market capitalization and is usually seen as a better option if you are looking for a long-term digital store of value.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are by far the two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, so it\u2019s not too surprising that there\u2019s a bit of a rivalry between the most fervent supporters of each project.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll compare Bitcoin and Ethereum from multiple perspectives to help you understand the differences between the two cryptocurrencies and their use cases.\n\nBitcoin vs. Ethereum \u2014 Main differences\n\nSo, how is Ethereum different from Bitcoin? Let\u2019s highlight the main differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum to understand how these two leading cryptocurrencies stack up against each other.\n\nConsensus mechanisms\n\nBoth the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks consist of thousands of nodes that are scattered across the globe. Therefore, nodes need a way for thousands of participants scattered across the globe to reach consensus on which transactions are valid and what the state of everyone\u2019s balances is.\n\nBoth Bitcoin and Ethereum use a special type of ledger called a blockchain to record transactions and user balances. A blockchain consists of a series of \u201cblocks\u201d which contain records of transactions and are \u201cchained\u201d together through cryptography to ensure that the information contained in them cannot be changed retroactively after being added to the blockchain.\n\nBitcoin utilizes a Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism. Participants in Proof-of-Work consensus are called \u201cminers\u201d. In order to add the next block to the blockchain, a miner needs to find the correct \u201cnonce\u201d, which is a random string of characters included in each block.\n\nThe nonce is determined by combining the block\u2019s data and a hashing algorithm. Finding the nonce requires a lot of computing power, and the Bitcoin network consumes substantial amounts of energy as a result.\n\nAt launch, Ethereum also used a Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism which was conceptually very similar to Bitcoin. In 2022, Ethereum switched to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. This drastically reduced the amount of energy consumed by the Ethereum network.\n\nIn a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism, users who want to be validators need to stake a certain amount of cryptocurrency. When it\u2019s time to add a new block to the blockchain, the protocol selects an active validator to perform the task. Meanwhile, other validators attest to the proposed block. Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanisms include rules to penalize validators for malicious behavior.\n\nProgrammability\n\nAnother major difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum is programmability. Bitcoin is designed to function as a peer-to-peer digital currency that\u2019s resistant to censorship attempts and avoids the common pitfalls of other digital currency designs, for example double spending. Bitcoin\u2019s programmability consists of limited scripting capabilities.\n\nMeanwhile, the scope of Ethereum is more ambitious. While ETH can be used in a manner very similar to BTC, Ethereum also provides general-purpose smart contract capabilities. For example, Ethereum can be used to issue custom \u201ctokens\u201d that can also be transacted with on the same blockchain.\n\nEthereum\u2019s programmability has unlocked some unique functionality like decentralized exchanges, lending protocols and NFT marketplaces. For example, the Maker protocol allows users to provide their ETH as collateral to mint DAI, which is a \u201cstablecoin\u201d that tracks the value of the US dollar. Another example is the Uniswap protocol, which allows users to swap between different Ethereum-based tokens trustlessly.\n\nCommon features\n\nNow that we\u2019ve gone through the main differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum, let\u2019s quickly highlight some of the main things they have in common.\n\nBoth utilize a blockchain architecture to keep track of transactions and balances\n\nBoth the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains are fully transparent with all information accessible publicly\n\nBoth allow users to send transactions on a 24/7 basis with no geographical or other restrictions\n\nBoth are permissionless\u2014anyone can set up a node and join the network\n\nUsers interact with each other through addresses, not real-world identities\n\nBoth have irreversible transactions\n\nSupply dynamics\n\nThere\u2019s quite a few differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum when it comes to supply dynamics.\n\nThe Bitcoin protocol specifies that no more than 21 million BTC can ever exist. Currently, there\u2019s about 19.35 million BTC in circulation, and new BTC coins will continue entering circulation until the 21 million BTC limit is reached. This is expected to happen sometime in 2140.\n\nBTC coins are created whenever a miner adds the next block to the Bitcoin blockchain. The Bitcoin protocol issues BTC as a \u201cblock reward\u201d in order to reward the miner. The Bitcoin protocol implements a mechanism called the Bitcoin halving, which triggers approximately every four years. When a Bitcoin halving happens, the block reward is reduced in half.\n\nAt the time of writing, the block reward is 6.25 BTC, and it will be reduced to 3.125 BTC when the next halving happens.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ethereum protocol doesn\u2019t specify a limit for how many ETH coins can exist. Approximately 1,600 ETH is issued every day to reward validators in the network\u2019s Proof-of-Stake consensus system.\n\nHowever, ETH coins are also being burned (permanently removed from circulation) with each transaction. This is because of an upgrade called EIP-1559, which introduced a mechanism in which the base ETH fee paid for each transaction is burned.\n\nTherefore, the fluctuation in the supply of ETH is mostly determined by demand for transactions. Higher transaction demand leads to more ETH being burned, which provides deflationary pressure to the ETH supply.\n\nTo learn more about Ethereum\u2019s supply dynamics, check out our article explaining the Ethereum triple halving.\n\nInvesting options\n\nIn terms of investing, both Bitcoin and Ethereum are generally considered as the two most important cryptocurrencies. In other words, it\u2019s difficult to imagine BTC and ETH performing poorly as investments if cryptocurrency as an asset class continues to grow.\n\nBoth Bitcoin and Ethereum are readily accessible to all types of investors, ranging from retail to institutional investors. In addition, most cryptocurrency exchanges have very low minimums, so it\u2019s possible to get started with very small investments. For example, you can easily buy $100 worth of Bitcoin if you wish to do so.\n\nSo far, institutional investors have been more comfortable with investing in Bitcoin than in Ethereum. For example, we\u2019ve seen quite a few publicly-traded companies invest part of their treasuries into Bitcoin.\n\nThis includes the likes of Tesla, Block, MicroStrategy and Nexon. Meanwhile, we have seen much fewer examples of publicly-traded companies buying and holding Ethereum. One of the reasons for this is simply that Bitcoin has a longer track record than Ethereum, as it was launched in early 2009. Meanwhile the Ethereum mainnet went live in July of 2015.\n\nIn the United States, investors have access to Bitcoin futures ETFs, which makes investing in Bitcoin easily accessible to traditional investors that prefer well-established products like ETFs. There\u2019s currently no Ethereum ETFs in the United States.\n\nIn other markets, for example Europe, it is also possible to find exchange-traded products that provide exposure to Ethereum. For example, CoinShares offers the CoinShares Physical Ethereum ETP, and 21Shares offers the 21Shares Ethereum Staking ETP.\n\nDecentralization\n\nBoth Bitcoin and Ethereum are permissionless, which means that anyone is able to join the networks and help process transactions without requiring any special permissions.\n\nAccording to Bitcoin node data aggregator Bitnodes, there\u2019s about 17,100 active nodes on the Bitcoin network at the time of writing. The location of 61% of nodes is unknown. Among the nodes with known locations, the United States comes in first with a share of about 10%. Germany (7.9%) and France (2.9%) are in second and third place, respectively.\n\nAccording to the Ethereum blockchain tracker Etherscan, there\u2019s about 9,200 active nodes on the Ethereum network at the time of writing this article. 49.3% of active Ethereum nodes are located in the United States, with Germany coming second with a 17.7% share and Japan ranking third with a 2.7% share.\n\nGenerally, both Bitcoin and Ethereum are considered as strongly decentralized networks that are resilient to attempts of censorship and manipulation. However, there\u2019s also a few concerns that are worth highlighting.\n\nThe main criticism regarding Bitcoin\u2019s decentralization is related to the amount of hashrate controlled by the biggest Bitcoin mining pools.\n\nAt the time of writing, the Foundry USA mining pool controls 33.6% of the Bitcoin hashrate, while AntPool controls 22.1%. The third largest pool, F2Pool, has a 14.6% share of the hashrate. So, the three largest Bitcoin mining pools combine for around 70% of the Bitcoin network\u2019s hashrate.\n\nDistribution of Bitcoin hashrate. Image source: BTC.com\n\nAs for Ethereum, the main concern regarding its decentralization has been RPC (Remote Procedure Call) providers, which are typically centralized companies. RPC services allow decentralized applications to access data from the blockchain.\n\nIf many decentralized applications use the same RPC provider, issues with the provider can make it difficult for regular users to access them. For example, the Ethereum ecosystem has been the subject of criticism for its alleged over-reliance on the RPC service provider Infura.\n\nTransaction fees\n\nIn terms of transaction fees, both Bitcoin and Ethereum are not exactly cheap to use. However, Ethereum transaction fees have largely been higher than Bitcoin transaction fees in the past few years.\n\nThis is because Ethereum has been seeing more demand for transactions than Bitcoin. One of the main reasons for this is that there\u2019s simply more to do on Ethereum. While Bitcoin only enables simple peer-to-peer transactions, Ethereum also supports smart contracts and more complex uses like decentralized exchanges and NFTs. The Ethereum network is also used to transact with tokens other than ETH.\n\nSo far in 2023, the typical range for the number of daily transactions on the Ethereum network has been 850,000 on the low end and close to 1.2 million on the high end. In the same period, the Bitcoin network has been processing roughly 230,000 daily transactions on the low end and 420,000 daily transactions on the high end.\n\nBitcoin is currently better than Ethereum in terms of transaction fees, but neither of them are especially impressive in this area. If you want to regularly use Bitcoin or Ethereum but want to pay less in transaction fees, consider exploring the following solutions:\n\nBitcoin: The Lightning Network layer 2 solution provides much cheaper and faster BTC transactions\n\nEthereum: Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism enable much more efficient transactions\n\nLegal status\n\nIn the United States, Bitcoin has the advantage of almost universally being treated as a commodity. This simplifies the process of investing in Bitcoin and selling it in a compliant manner.\n\nEthereum has also generally been viewed as a commodity in the United States, although its designation is not quite as clear as Bitcoin\u2019s. This is because Ethereum was launched through an initial coin offering (ICO) where investors provided funds for Ethereum\u2019s development in exchange for a future allocation of ETH before the Ethereum network itself was released.\n\nSo, there is some controversy about whether Ethereum should be treated as a commodity or as a security. If Ethereum were to be legally designated as a security, it would likely become more complicated to invest in it and offer Ethereum trading services in a compliant manner.\n\nMeanwhile, Satoshi Nakamoto released the Bitcoin software in 2009, and anyone was free to download it and earn BTC coins through crypto mining. Since there was nothing in the process of the release of Bitcoin that could be considered an investment contract, almost nobody views Bitcoin as a security and it is instead considered a commodity.\n\nStill, Bitcoin could be subject to regulatory pressure from another perspective, as the Proof-of-Work system used by the Bitcoin network is often criticized for its high energy consumption.\n\nThe bottom line \u2014 Both Bitcoin and Ethereum are great choices for crypto investors\n\nHopefully, our comparison of Ethereum vs. Bitcoin has helped you understand the differences between the two largest cryptocurrencies. Ethereum is more flexible than Bitcoin when it comes to the use cases it can support, while Bitcoin is more valuable overall and generally seen as a \u201csafer\u201d long-term bet due to its relative simplicity, predictable supply dynamics and longer track record.\n\nIf you are looking to invest in cryptocurrency, both Bitcoin and Ethereum are very solid options. In fact, it\u2019s quite common for crypto investors to have both BTC and ETH in their portfolio."

        "title": "Pepe & Other Memecoin Hype Sends Ethereum Gas Fees Through The Roof - Blockonomi",
        "content": "Ethereum gas fees soared in the past few days due to the frenzy surrounding meme-inspired cryptocurrencies. The popularity of these coins has led to the growing demand for transactions on the Ethereum network, resulting in higher fees.\n\nMemecoins made a remarkable comeback, with Pepe The Frog leading the way. Recently deployed memecoins, including $TROLL, $APED, and $BOBO, took over top gas-burning altcoins, per market analysis platform Sentiment.\n\nMemecoins go Crazy\n\nData indicates that Ethereum\u2019s average gas price for transactions on April 20 has spiked to 81.94 gwei (gwei serves as a unit of measurement for Ether \u2013 1 gwei equals 10-9 ETH). It marks a significant increase from 60.82 gwei on April 19 and 44.42 gwei during the same period last year.\n\nEthereum educator Anthony Sassano highlighted the staggering surge in daily fee revenue on the Ethereum network in his recent post. According to Sassano, the remarkable success of Ethereum\u2019s layer-2 platforms, notably Arbitrum, outperformed the BTC network.\n\nThe revenue surge has been attributed mainly to the ongoing meme frenzy gripping cryptocurrency markets. The observations also highlighted the growing dominance of Ethereum in the ever-evolving crypto landscape.\n\nDespite the high fees, users persist in utilizing these networks. This suggests that these networks\u2019 benefits and opportunities outweigh the financial costs.\n\nA Small Market\n\nWhile some analysts view this as an indicator of its growing usability, critics have raised concerns, pointing out that the extensive usage being touted is primarily limited to a few thousand users gambling on memecoins.\n\nAnother factor is the increased activity of a Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) trading bot known as \u201cjaredfromsubway.eth\u201d. This bot has been front-running memecoin trades significantly, spending a remarkable 455 ETH (equivalent to $885,000) and utilizing 7% of the total gas on the network in the past 24 hours.\n\nEthereum gas fees have been the topic of discussion within the Ethereum community. High gas fees can make using the network expensive for certain activities, such as small transactions or interacting with low-value smart contracts.\n\nOngoing efforts are to improve Ethereum\u2019s scalability and reduce gas fees, including Layer-2 scaling solutions and other optimization techniques to make the network more efficient and cost-effective for users.\n\nZk-Rollups Making Waves\n\nButerin highlighted during the ETHSeoul event last year that the fundamental advantages of Zero-knowledge Rollup technology are expected to position them as the superior choice for Ethereum layer 2 scaling solutions.\n\nLayer 2 scaling solutions for Ethereum have been experiencing impressive growth recently. These solutions are essential for increasing transaction processing capacity, reducing network congestion, and improving the user experience on Ethereum.\n\nBundling multiple transactions into one transaction through layer 2 solutions can significantly reduce gas fees, making it more accessible for users to interact with the network.\n\nThe combined growth of Zk-rollups and the maturity of Ethereum has the potential to create a robust future.\n\nHowever, after successfully completing the Shanghai upgrade, Ethereum now faces an uncertain short-term future as ETH stakers seek alternative avenues to deploy their recently withdrawn holdings, which raises concerns about the potential detrimental impact on the price of ETH.\n\nNevertheless, Ethereum remains the top secure and decentralized ecosystem in the blockchain space, with over 3500 different decentralized applications (DApps) and a vibrant and creative developer community, making it a favored choice for developing high-quality projects.\n\nEthereum has also outlined several upcoming upgrades and improvements in its roadmap, with the next major hard fork being sharding.\n\nSharding aims to increase the network\u2019s throughput directly without relying on layer 2 solutions and is expected to be a significant milestone in the evolution of Ethereum. It will enable the network to handle much larger transactions than it currently can, further enhancing its scalability and potential for future growth.\n\nThe future for Ethereum looks great \u2013 memecoins, on the other hand, are a very murky market."

However, this could potentially lead to large pullback risks, according to McGlone.\n\nMcGlone tweeted: \u201cBitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 may be running into a wall of resistance at the key round number levels of $30,000 and $2,000. Our bias is bullish in the long term for the top cryptos, but an overwhelming force of the stock market going down with the Fed tightening into a recession has the potential to lower the tide for all risk assets, and Bitcoin and Ethereum are among the riskiest.\u201d\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are among high-risk assets. Source: Mike McGlone\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum\n\nThe future of Bitcoin and Ethereum is closely tied to technological advancements and increasing adoption. Many experts believe that these cryptocurrencies will continue to gain mainstream acceptance as more businesses and individuals recognize the benefits of decentralized financial systems.\n\nSince the turn of the year, Bitcoin has experienced a notable increase of approximately 70%, while Ethereum has climbed just above 60%. Interestingly, a recent historical pattern has emerged as the value of Bitcoin has again reached 15 ETH after six years.\n\nDespite the impressive performance of these digital assets and surpassing key price levels of $30,000 and $2,000 in April, both have experienced significant pullbacks in the last week. At present, Bitcoin is trading at $28,077, down 1.88% on the day and 8.91% over the previous week. Meanwhile, Ethereum, the second-largest asset by market cap, is currently trading at $1,908, down 1.75% in the last 24 hours and 9.86% in the last week.\n\nWhile Bitcoin and Ethereum\u2019s recent pullbacks may cause temporary concern, their overall upward trend and potential for long-term growth remain. Investors should remain vigilant of potential downside risks, especially in light of broader market conditions.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "Staked Ether levels have dropped by $1.3 billion over the past week after the blockchain\u2019s upgrade dubbed Shapella enabled withdrawals.\n\nInvestors withdrew 1.36 million Ether valued at around $2.6 billion and deposited only 714,290 Ether worth $1.4 billion in the week after Shapella went live \u2014 a net outflow of 647,050 coins, according to data from TokenUnlocks.\n\nWhile some analysts had anticipated the upgrade would trigger a sell-off after the upgrade led to more tokens in the market, its price has remained relatively stable.\n\nSince the commencement of withdrawals last week, the second-largest cryptocurrency has seen a moderate price increase of approximately 1.5%, currently trading around $1,970.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\n\u201cETH often has more than $10 billion of trading volume on a single day,\u201d Patrick Scott, a crypto analyst, told DL News. \u201cThe outflows are likely less consequential than normal crypto market volatility.\u201d\n\nREAD NOW: Fallen crypto king Do Kwon slapped with fake passport charge in Montenegro\n\nThe withdrawals from Ethereum\u2019s staking contract are likely far from over.\n\nIn order to keep Ethereum secure, the network limits the number of withdrawals that can take place concurrently. This means those who wish to withdraw their Ether must enter a withdrawal queue.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nBased on the amount of Ether currently in line for full withdrawals, those entering the queue now will need to wait over two weeks before receiving their Ether.\n\nData from crypto analytics platform Nansen shows that 741,750 Ether, worth approximately $1.4 billion, is currently queued for full withdrawal. Of this amount, 68% of withdrawals are due to come from Coinbase, Binance and Kraken \u2014 the top three centralised exchanges that stake Ether on behalf of their customers.\n\nAlthough stakers are in the process of withdrawing billions of Ether, the outflows may not be leaving the market altogether.

Staking tokens often trade close to the price of Ether, but they aren\u2019t pegged \u2013 fixed to the price of Ether \u2013 by design.\n\nLido, the leading liquid staking derivative provider, has experienced a surge in the amount of Ether staked via its protocol, with a notable 2.2% increase over the past week. This uptick is equivalent to roughly 120,000 additional Ether worth about $236 million, demonstrating a significant shift in investor sentiment towards liquid staking services.\n\nElsewhere Rocket Pool, the third-biggest liquid staking token provider, registered an inflow of about 7%. Two smaller liquid staking protocols \u2014 ether.fi and Frax Ether \u2014 have also seen gains of about 21% and 14%, respectively, in the same period.\n\nHowever, cbETH, or Coinbase Wrapped Staked ETH, the only liquid staking token issued by a centralised exchange, saw its supply decrease 2.7% in the same period.\n\nIn recent months, liquid staking services have garnered significant popularity, largely due to their ability to allow stakers to employ their staking tokens \u2013 and consequently, the staked Ether by extension \u2013 across various other DeFi protocols.\n\nSeveral DeFi lending protocols including Aave accept these tokens as collateral to issue cryptocurrency loans."

        "title": "NFT Blockchains Abound. Here's a Guide to Web3's Best. - nft now",
        "content": "When it comes to NFTs, the Ethereum blockchain is king. Considered by many to be the one-stop shop for NFTs, over the past year, it has quickly become the most talked about \u2014 and at times the most trafficked \u2014 blockchain in existence.\n\nYet, numerous other blockchains have grown in popularity within the NFT space. Considering the high transaction costs and environmental impact that the Ethereum blockchain presents, crypto-artists and NFT enthusiasts have continued to seek out new places to mint and trade NFTs.\n\nBut there are several crucial factors to consider when choosing what blockchain to mint on. Some of the most important points are network size, creator costs, consumer spending habits, security, and community input. So to provide a bit of clarity to the widespread and fast-paced world of Web3 tech, we\u2019ve created a high-level summary of blockchains for NFTs.\n\nWhich blockchains support NFTs\n\nEthereum\n\nDespite mounting competition, Ethereum remains the most popular NFT blockchain. The reasons are abundant: as a highly decentralized blockchain, it provides all the financial and legal services one typically needs for transactions without requiring intermediaries. It also houses some of the most popular NFT marketplaces (OpenSea), NFT projects (CryptoPunks and the Bored Ape Yacht Club), and NFT artists (Pak and Beeple).\n\nCredit: Dennis Diatel Photography/istock\n\nUntil recently, Ethereum required an exorbitant amount of energy to operate since it relied on a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism. Consensus mechanisms are the systems that allow a blockchain to operate in a decentralized manner, but in light of PoW\u2019s notoriously energy-intensive operations, it uses cryptographic computations to validate transactions in the network. That\u2019s one of the reasons why, on September 15, 2022, Ethereum switched to a consensus mechanism known as proof-of-stake (PoS) in an event called the merge. The blockchain\u2019s energy needs plummeted by 99.5 percent as a result, and it now consumes less energy than even a simple Web2 platform like PayPal.\n\nWhile some debate remains about how secure the new PoS system is compared to PoW, Ethereum is still considered a safe blockchain to use, with the merge opening the door for future upgrades that the Ethereum Foundation claims will further increase its security. Considering its popularity, security, decentralization, and ease of use, you should consider this blockchain first when deciding where to mint.\n\nSolana\n\nFounded in 2017 by Anatoly Yakovenko, Solana was built to solve the high costs and slow transaction speeds common in blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin. When it arrived on the scene, blockchains were severely limited in their processing capabilities and could only handle roughly 15 transactions per second (TPS).\n\nSolana\u2019s TPS now surpasses that of Visa, and even rivals Mastercard\u2019s, earning it a firm spot as an industry leader regarding speed and scalability. The blockchain\u2019s transaction fees are also quite low, making the network increasingly popular and one of the fastest-growing ecosystems in crypto. As of writing, SOL\u2019s market cap was more than $10 billion.\n\nSolana is also one of the fastest programmable blockchains in the crypto space. Its unique combination of proof-of-history (PoH) and proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms remove the need for the complex cryptographic puzzles that power PoW mechanisms. PoH is a computational process that can cryptographically verify the passing of time between two events in the blockchain, which reduces validation times and fees. In terms of the Solana blockchain, it\u2019s used to ensure that transactions are in the right order and found by the correct leader (validator).\n\nLike Ethereum, Solana\u2019s PoS system enables users to stake an amount of cryptocurrency for the chance to be randomly chosen as a block validator. Validators earn crypto (in this case, Solana\u2019s native token, SOL) when they are selected. This incentivizes users to become stakers and rewards them for doing so. Thanks to Solana\u2019s PoS and PoH mechanisms, its transaction fees and times are about as low as possible. However, while some major NFT marketplaces like Magic Eden operate on Solana, the chain isn\u2019t as widely used as Ethereum, meaning there are both fewer marketplaces and people trading on the blockchain.\n\nTezos\n\nFounded in 2017 by Kathleen and Arthur Breitman, Tezos is an open-source platform for assets and applications. Like other blockchains, it enables the creation of smart contracts and the building of decentralized applications (dApps). Tezos\u2019 native token is XTZ. While the chain is popular with regard to NFTs, its crypto ranks around 40th in terms of market cap. But Tezos\u2019 selling point has always been innovation, not market dominance.\n\nCredit: Rodion-Kutsaev\n\nOne of the things that makes the Tezos blockchain unique is its ability to self-amend. This means it can improve itself over time via a formalized protocol upgrade process. Coupled with the fact that Tezos has long incentivized developers to build dApps on the platform, the chain is seen as a major leader in operability.\n\nSimilar to Solana and Ethereum, Tezos uses a PoS consensus mechanism to help reduce the computational work needed to verify blocks and transactions on the blockchain. Additionally, its transaction fees are lower than Ethereum\u2019s (but more than Solana\u2019s).\n\nOne of the first marketplaces on the blockchain, Hic et Nunc, was heralded as an economic alternative to Ethereum-centric marketplaces \u2014 until the platform shut down on November 14, 2021.\n\nTezos is a great place to start for those looking to mint batches of NFTs or large-scale collections. Currently, Objkt is the largest and most popular marketplace on the Tezos chain.\n\nFlow\n\nFlow is a high-performance blockchain designed specifically for creating NFTs, games, and decentralized apps (dApps). In stark contrast to general-purpose blockchains like Ethereum, Flow is built with scalability in mind, meaning billions of people could potentially interact with NFTs on the blockchain.\n\nOriginally launched in 2019, Flow quickly rose to prominence as the blockchain partner of the NBA. A product of Dapper Labs (the team behind legacy project CryptoKitties), Flow facilitated the launch and is the host of NBA Top Shot, making the blockchain an integral component in the popularization of non-fungible tokens.\n\nLike Tezos, Flow uses a solely PoS consensus mechanism to verify transactions. Because of this, the blockchain can handle a higher amount of TPS than Ethereum, with Flow developers stating that the chain has sustainably allowed for \u201ca throughput of significantly more than 100 TPS,\u201d though they don\u2019t specify an exact number.\n\nAside from Blocktobay (a popular Flow-native NFT marketplace), Flow NFTs are tradeable via OpenSea, Rarible, Foundation, and many other platforms. Flow has become a popular place for sporting NFTs, as organizations like the NBA, NFL, UFC, and more have launched their own marketplaces on the blockchain. Yet, similar to Solana, Flow isn\u2019t as widely used as Ethereum, resulting in fewer NFT marketplaces and fewer people trading on the blockchain.\n\nWorldwide Asset Exchange (WAX)\n\nThe Worldwide Asset Exchange (WAX) has become a network of choice for digital collectibles and virtual items. As historic NFT sales and viral collections on Ethereum, Tezos, and Solana made headlines over the years, WAX has built a reputation for being a home for Web3 gaming.\n\nCredit: WAX\n\nWAX was founded in 2017 by crypto pioneers William Quigley and Jonathan Yantis. The chain is based in the Cayman Islands and aims to embody a mission of global accessibility. WAX gives its users access to thousands of dApps and a range of NFT marketplaces. WAX is also home to several top blockchain games, including Alien Worlds, Farmer\u2019s World, and Prospectors. Its prominence in blockchain gaming means the biggest projects on the chain hail from the play-to-earn sector.\n\nSimilar to other high-efficiency blockchains, Wax employs a PoS mechanism but also creates carbon offset NFTs and partners with Climate Care as part of a mission for sustainability. Similar to Flow, transaction fees are significantly low, and as a unique incentive to collectors, network fees on WAX are redistributed to the WAX community.\n\nWAX marketplaces also play host to a broad variety of influential brands, including baseball collectibles company Topps, racing giant NASCAR, toy company Hot Wheels, and even a few cult classic film franchises like Godzilla, The Princess Bride, and Spiderman.\n\nBinance Chain (BNB)\n\nFormerly two separate chains \u2014 Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Binance Chain \u2014 Binance rebranded to BNB Chain in February 2022 to foster innovation in the network and move toward greater decentralization.\n\nOne of the more highly centralized chains, with several of the chain\u2019s PoS validators reportedly holding direct ties to the Binance Crypto Exchange, the network is still a good balance between low fees and high-speed transactions. One of the reasons for this is that BNB Chain uses a consensus model called Proof-of-Staked-Authority (PoSA), which can support a short block time and low fees. Yet, the validators running transactions take turns to produce blocks \u2014 with the 21 validators needed to run the exchange switching out every 24 hours. According to some reports, 11 validators of the 21 control the Binance Chain and are all directly connected to the Binance Crypto Exchange.\n\nWhile centralization is a turn-off to many within the crypto and NFT ecosystem, the BSC NFT market did begin to pick up some speed towards the end of 2021. While centralization is a turn-off to many within the crypto and NFT ecosystem (its team recently paused the entire network after a $100-million hack, for example), the chain hosts some increasingly popular NFT marketplaces like Element, Mobox, and PancakeSwap, although the ecosystem is undoubtedly not even close to being as robust as Ethereum\u2019s.\n\nBitcoin\n\nThat\u2019s right; the Bitcoin blockchain hosts NFTs now. While Bitcoin was famous for its singular focus on hosting transactions for its eponymous cryptocurrency (and for its decidedly anti-NFT community), that all changed on January 21, 2023. That\u2019s when software engineer Casey Rodarmor launched the Bitcoin Ordinals protocol. This upgrade has caused a massive uproar amongst Bitcoin diehards (also known as Bitcoin \u201cmaxis\u201d) and in the broader NFT ecosystem.\n\nOrdinals are made possible because Bitcoins are composed of tiny units called satoshis (sats). Rodarmor\u2019s new protocol allowed Bitcoin node operators to inscribe those units with data, even visual data, creating something that is effectively a fully on-chain NFT.\n\nCredit: istock\n\nBecause of the nature of the protocol, these Inscriptions come chronologically numbered. As word of Bitcoin NFTs spread throughout the Web3 community, Ordinals with lower Inscription numbers (and thus higher historical significance) became more valuable and sought after. Ordinals regularly change hands for prices in the 40-50 BTC ($1 million) range.\n\nBecause Bitcoin isn\u2019t set up to easily conduct NFT transactions, however, interested buyers have had to go through a rather cumbersome, obtuse, and over-the-counter process to obtain them. This is slowly changing, however, with Web3 builders releasing Bitcoin Ordinals wallets in the weeks and months following the protocol\u2019s release.\n\nThe entire development has stirred up the Web3 ecosystem in big ways, and the rush to inscribe and obtain Ordinals continues. The number of Ordinals Inscriptions recently passed the one million mark, and even Yuga Labs, the creators of Bored Ape Yacht Club, have gotten in on the action, minting a 300-piece collection on the blockchain on March 5, 2023.\n\nIf you\u2019re new to NFTs, Bitcoin probably isn\u2019t the best place to start learning (for the time being). However, if you\u2019re interested in being at the frontier of NFT development, it could be just the place for you. Just make sure you do your research and know the risks before engaging with anything. Bitcoin is another proof-of-work blockchain, meaning its environmental impact does leave something to be desired."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) gas fees jumped to a 10-month high \u2014 prompted by a surge in meme coin mania.\n\nPer Glassnode, the median Ethereum gas price over a seven-day moving average (7DMA) reached 43.641 gwei \u2014 a price last seen on June 30, 2022.\n\nGwei is a denomination of ETH \u2014 with 1,000,000,000 gwei equaling 1 ETH, or 1 gwei equaling 0.000000001 ETH.\n\nOver the past year, the median gas price over a 7DMA peaked at 150 gwei in May 2022 but dropped sharply by July 2022. It then gradually stabilized around the 20 gwei mark going into September 2022, when the Merge rolled out.\n\nEthereum gas fees\n\nThe cost of using Ethereum has been a point of contention since the \u201cDeFi Summer\u201d of 2020 \u2014 when the average gas price reached as high as 700 gwei.\n\nThis period saw network activity surge as yield protocols, such as Curve, Compound, and Yearn, began taking off \u2014 triggering mania from the demand to farm unreal gains.\n\nEthereum\u2019s architecture is such that high gas fees come about when network traffic and the demand for transaction verification is high.\n\nWhile some assumed the Merge and the switch to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus would tackle this problem, it was confirmed that gas fees remain primarily driven by the demand for blocks and the network\u2019s capacity to meet that demand \u2014 not the consensus mechanism used.\n\nRecently, Ethereum network activity has skyrocketed with a wave of newly released meme coins \u2014 some of which netted early investors gains in the thousands of percent.\n\nMeme coins are back\n\nPEPE is one such meme coin, which has risen to become the sixth largest by market cap at $89.1 million in a few days.\n\nPEPE reached a local top of $0.000000391704 on April 20 and has been trending downwards since.\n\nThe success of PEPE has spurred social media chatter on which meme coin is next to spike.

        "content": "Image: Shutterstock\n\nUsers and proponents of the blockchain space are in for an improved experience when registering for domain names in the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) protocol. A range of options, including Google Pay, Apple Pay, and other debit and credit cards, can be used now for .eth domains. The process used to require payments through Ethereum earlier. Many users then considered it a barrier, as they had to use their crypto wallets for the registrations.The web3 payment gateway, MoonPay, would be used from now on by users for payments while it has been integrated with the Ethereum Name Service website. On top of this, ENS has also launched version 3 of its user interface for a better experience while signing up on the platform. Users had to go through multiple transaction approvals before while using crypto wallets.Nick Johnson, the founder of Ethereum Name Service, has said the move could simplify blockchain for beginners and make it easier for them to obtain digital identities. He stated, \u201cThis allows us to reach those who are either just entering the space or who are not yet comfortable with transacting and would prefer to use the currency and payment form they understand best.\u201dBree Blazak, Vice President at MoonPay, also welcomed the initiative and claimed how the partnership with Ethereum Name Service could make registrations simple with common payment methods. The payment experience for beginners to the domain would, thus, be made simple.The platform upgrade of ENS is likely going to uplift the status of ENS as a provider of readable names for crypto wallets in place of complex numeric numbers, which are created by wallets, blockchain protocols and platforms. Users of ENS can also host censorship-resistant websites through names that can be linked to in-use common domain name services (DNS).With decentralized domain name service registrations increasing in the last couple of years, Ethereum Name Service has witnessed over 2.3 million names created through 550,000 unique addresses.Unstoppable Domains and Ethereum Name Service are two leaders in the crypto space who have been responsible for inducting users into the web3 world through decentralized identities."

        "title": "Lower BTC vs ETH correlation - Coinbase",
        "content": "Market View\n\nThe correlation between bitcoin and ether returns has been falling since mid-to-late March, around the time BTC started outperforming peers in earnest (against the backdrop of the US banking turmoil and the increased regulatory scrutiny of non-bitcoin digital assets). But the decline of that relationship has become more pronounced in the days following the Shanghai (Shapella) fork, reminiscent of a similar trend observed in September 2022 during the Merge (when Ethereum changed its consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake).\n\nBased on a 40-day rolling window (significant to a 85-90% confidence level), the correlation coefficient between daily bitcoin and ether returns dropped from 0.95 thirty days ago to 0.82 as of April 20, below a 12-month average of 0.90 and the January low of 0.85. (In January, the relationship between these assets was affected by the change in market conditions and technical supply constraints .) Note that the performances between these two digital assets have otherwise maintained a fairly stable and high correlation through 2022 into 2023 outside of the idiosyncratic deviations witnessed in September and January (see chart 1).\n\nChart 1. Correlations between BTC and ETH daily returns across 40d, 60d and 180d rolling windows\n\nThe relevance of this falling correlation for institutional investors is that it can affect quantitative strategies that rely on cross hedging one asset for the other (or using ETH as a hedge for less liquid altcoins). On the other hand, from a fundamental perspective, it supports diversification arguments in favor of holding both BTC and ETH. Following the Merge, a decrease in the observed correlation coefficient between ETH and BTC returns (from 0.95 to 0.75) lasted for around 47-50 days. Comparatively, the current period of attenuation has lasted for around 30 days, and we think it could continue for another two weeks given that the initial phase of ETH withdrawals is still ongoing.\n\nAs of April 20, we project that an additional 73k ETH could be unlocked in partial withdrawals and 822k ETH could be unlocked in full withdrawals (based on what is currently in the exit queue according to Nansen ). This could take around 15 days to process. Given that full withdrawals will begin to dominate the withdrawals queue imminently, the remaining variable is how much of these fully unstaked ETH could make their way back to the deposit queue. For now, we do not have enough data to make a reliable estimate. So far, the ratio of withdrawn principal and rewards to deposits has been 2:1 since the upgrade was activated."

        "content": "An anonymous Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) bot operator has cashed in well over $1 million this week by executing \u201csandwich attacks\u201d against buyers and sellers of two new meme coins.\n\nThe wallet address, linked to the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) domain \u201cjaredfromsubway.eth,\u201d made $950,000 from the sandwich attacks on April 18 and profited about $300,000 and $400,000 on April 17 and 19, respectively, according to an April 19 tweet from nonfungible token data platform Sealaunch.\n\nAfter closing the day of yesterday with a profit close to $1M, jaredfromsubway.eth MEV bot is already profiting close to $400K today pic.twitter.com/VxouxAc59s \u2014 sealaunch.xyz (@SeaLaunch_) April 19, 2023\n\nThe bot\u2019s ENS domain is a likely tongue-in-cheek nod to the popular sandwich chain and its disgraced former spokesperson Jared Fogle.\n\nOver a 24-hour period between April 18 to 19, 7% of all Ethereum gas fees were spent by the MEV bot, Sealaunch explained in a separate post.\n\nA large proportion of the profits came from attacks on trading activity relating to two new meme coins, Pepe (PEPE) and Wojak (WOJAK), which has helped propel jaredfromsubway.eth to the become the largest gas guzzler over the last day and week, crypto researcher Matt Willemsen explained:\n\nWondering why gas is so damn high? \u200d\n\n\n\njaredfromsubway.eth (lmao) is absolutely cleaning up by sandwich-attacking $PEPE and $WOJAK trading activity. They are #1 gas spender over the past day and week.\n\n\n\nMEV sandwich bots on Ethereum have made $100M+ since the weekend. https://t.co/qhxyxlac20 \u2014 Matt Willemsen (@matt_willemsen) April 19, 2023\n\nA sandwich attack occurs when an attacker \u201csandwiches\u201d a victim\u2019s transaction between their own two transactions in order to manipulate the price and profit from the user.\n\nThis is possible because the victim\u2019s transaction is first sent to the mempool where it waits to be added to the next block. In the meantime, the attacker sets one transaction with a high gas fee \u2014 to ensure it is accepted first \u2014 and another transaction with a lower gas fee to ensure it is accepted after the victim's transaction.\n\nThe attacker profits by buying the victim\u2019s token at a price cheaper than market value, then sells it within the same block \u2014 taking in the difference between the revenue from the transaction minus the gas fees.\n\nThe large profits pocketed by jaredfromsubway.eth came from nearly $1.2 million being spent on gas fees between April 18 and 19, according to data shared by Thomas Mattimore, head of platform at the Reserve Protocol.\n\nThe MEV bot operator has spent over $7 million in gas fees across 180,000 transactions, according to Sealaunch.\n\nWhile some are finding the humor in the MEV bot\u2019s domain name and actions, not all are happy.\n\nRelated: Tether blacklists validator address that drained MEV bots for $25M\n\nOne analyst for on-chain analytics firm Glassnode questioned the \u201cvalue\u201d of the work jaredfromsubway.eth is providing to the world.\n\nOther Twitter users went one step further, expressing their hatred and frustration toward the MEV bot operator.\n\nwhen i see jaredfromsubway.eth on the shitcoin i just aped my entire networth into pic.twitter.com/heK4bnbikf \u2014 DRT (@pepeDRT) April 19, 2023\n\nAccording to MEV Blocker, MEV bots have extracted more than $1.38 billion from Ethereum users attempting to trade, provide liquidity and mint NFTs.\n\nSeveral MEV Block projects have been launched in recent months to help protect Ethereum users from sandwich attacks.\n\nMagazine: Magazine: \u2018Account abstraction\u2019 supercharges Ethereum wallets: Dummies guide"

        "title": "'Worst code I've ever seen': Euro stablecoin faces centralization criticism - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Criticism has been leveled at a new euro-pegged stablecoin released in France due to a decision to restrict peer-to-peer transactions.\n\nFrench bank Societe Generale-Forge (SGF) released the Ethereum-based stablecoin called EUR CoinVertible (EURCV) on April 20, which is available to only qualified institutional clients.\n\nAccording to observers who reviewed its smart contract code, itsERC-20 transfers need to first be approved by a centralized registrar \u2014 presumably one controlled by the bank \u2014 before the transaction is processed.\n\nIn an April 20 tweet, pseudonymous smart contract engineer \u201calephv.eth\u201d explained:\n\n\u201cThey coded it so they have to whitelist all users, process all user transfers, and even process your ERC20 approvals before they process your 'transferFrom' lmao.\u201d\n\nShe further mocked the code in a separate post, stating it was a \"radical commitment to inefficiency in the name of regulation.\"\n\nNonfungible token project founder \u201cfoobar\u201d tweeted to his over 127,000 followers on April 20 that it\u2019s \u201cthe worst code I\u2019ve ever seen\u201d and described the stablecoin as a \u201claughing stock.\u201d\n\nFrance launched a stablecoin on Ethereum and it's the worst code I've ever seen\n\n\n\nEvery ERC20 single transfer has to be approved in a separate eth tx submitted by a centralized registrar\n\n\n\nWhat a laughingstock, is this your CBDC?https://t.co/hKkHiQTCyN pic.twitter.com/S6tRfh54wz \u2014 foobar (@0xfoobar) April 20, 2023\n\nCrypto researcher Mason Versluis tweeted that the code was \u201cabsolutely horrible\u201d and suggested the French bank \u201cstop trying to weasel\u201d into crypto.\n\nBREAKING: France launches stablecoin on #Ethereum, but every single transfer has to be approved in a separate ETH transaction submitted by a centralized registrar!\n\n\n\nAbsolutely horrible. Keep your centralized bullshit over there, stop trying to weasel it into crypto.\n\n\n\nNews Via:\u2026 pic.twitter.com/mcg9fvUoSp \u2014 MASON VERSLUIS (@MasonVersluis) April 20, 2023\n\nPlenty of others chipped in on the criticism, but Ether (ETH) investor Ryan Berckman provided a more neutral analysis.\n\nHe explained that many traditional financial firms like SGF will take \u201cbaby steps\u201d as they move into blockchain and digital assets:\n\n\u201cObviously, non-compliant, non-composable, allowlist-style stables are going to be uncompetitive in the market. Baby steps, they are coming from tradfi, they\u2019ll see it soon enough and switch to a USDC-style denylist.\u201d\n\nBerckman explained SGF may also be incorrect in its claim to be the first bank to launch an institutional stablecoin on a public blockchain. He pointed to the AUDN stablecoin minted on Ethereum in March by National Australia Bank (NAB), which claimed to be the second bank to launch a stablecoin.\n\nRegardless, Berckman expects more banks to follow suit in the months to come, stating that he is \u201ccertain\u201d SGF won\u2019t be the last bank to launch a stablecoin on a public network.\n\nRelated: Israel\u2019s central bank says CBDC could be issued if stablecoin use increases\n\nSGF\u2019s stablecoin isn\u2019t intended for public use \u2014 at least to begin with.\n\nEURCV is only strictly available to institutional clients onboarded by the bank through its Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures, according to the bank\u2019s April 20 announcement.\n\nThe stablecoin is designed to bridge the gap between assets in traditional capital markets and the digital assets ecosystem.\n\nA total of 10 million EURCV tokens were minted on Ethereum on April , according to Ethereum explorer Etherscan. All 10 million tokens are held by one wallet address.\n\nThe stablecoin was launched on the back of growing demand for a new settlement asset to process on-chain transactions.\n\nMagazine: Unstablecoins: Depegging, bank runs and other risks loom"

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s prices have been on a decline of late and the number of put options has increased.\n\nMEV and bot activity on the Ethereum network went uphill.\n\nEthereum\u2019s [ETH] prices started to decline massively over the past few days. A lot of optimism was observed before Ethereum\u2019s Shapella Upgrade, which allowed addresses to unstake their ETH from the beacon chain. However, as time passed, the sentiment around ETH started to change.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nOver the last 24 hours, the value of ETH declined by 5.94% according to CoinMarketCap\u2018s data. The decline in prices was complimented by bearish sentiment from traders.\n\nThis was indicated by the fact that a large sum of OTM (Out of the money) block puts, which expire at the end of the month, made up 15% of daily trader volume.\n\nFor context, OTM block puts are option contracts with a strike price that is below the current market price of the underlying asset. These options would only be profitable if the price of the asset was to decrease significantly before the option expires.\n\nHence, the spike in block puts implied that traders were expecting ETH prices to fall further.\n\nBots and Sandwiches\n\nOn the Ethereum network, it was observed that there was a lot of bot activity going on. According to EigenPhi\u2019s data, over the past month, MEV bots on Ethereum set a new record by earning $1.035 million in profits through 11,640 transactions. This included $940,000 in profits from sandwich attacks.\n\nA sandwich attack is a type of front-running attack used by MEV (miner extractable value) bots in which they place two trades around a target trade to exploit the price difference for profit.\n\nThe high number of MEV bots and sandwich attacks can cause Ethereum\u2019s network to slow down due to increased congestion and transaction fees. This can lead to a negative impact on the network\u2019s overall efficiency and user experience.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC terms\n\nThe Ethereum network was also impacted in terms of gas fees. Santiment\u2019s data indicated that Ethereum lost its spot with respect to fee distribution. New assets such as APED and BOBO have taken the lead in this area.\n\nHowever, the interest in NFT trading on Ethereum remained unaffected. For the third consecutive month, Ethereum NFTs saw a trading volume of over $1 billion, according to Delphi Digital\u2019s data."

        "title": "How to stake Polygon (MATIC) - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The Polygon network, formerly the Matic network, is an Ethereum-scaling protocol that reduces cost and embeds high security. In a short span, Polygon has gained a high level of traction.\n\nA string of solutions on a single network sets Polygon apart from other Ethereum scaling projects. It empowers developers to zero in on a scaling solution that works best with their applications. Polygon Labs has been consistently working to develop scaling solutions based on plasma sidechains, a blockchain bridge, different types of zero-knowledge proofs and Optimistic Rollups.\n\nProcessing bundles of transactions on the Polygon proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain drastically reduces the burden on the Ethereum main chain, making transactions faster. The throughput rate in the Ethereum base layer is roughly 14 transactions per second, while Polygon has the potential to handle exponentially higher transactions per second.\n\nAnyone wanting to participate in the network by updating transactional data on the system must stake Polygon (MATIC). In the Polygon network, a validator\u2019s job is to ensure the network\u2019s security and add transactions to blocks. Validators stake, allowing users to delegate tokens in exchange for rewards net of any commissions charged by validators.\n\nStaking of MATIC, explained\n\nAnyone looking to stake MATIC has to delegate tokens to a validator. Stakers can earn rewards against the staked funds. For now, there are no minimum staking requirements though validators can decide the minimum acceptable limit for staking. Validators might charge fees or commissions for these services. Staked MATIC tokens have an unlocking period of 80 checkpoints, approximately three to four days. Stakers wanting to exit just need to send an unbound request.\n\nIt helps to factor in validators\u2019 credibility before delegating funds to any of them. One can hop to the Polygon staking dashboard to get information about validators, viewing metrics such as active validators, their uptime, commission and the amount required to stake. These metrics are valuable tools to help select reliable validator(s):\n\nUptime refers to the number of blocks signed in a specific time period. A validator\u2019s uptime should be close to 100%. Otherwise, it indicates the validator is unreliable, as reflected in their public performance metrics.\n\nCommission rate is the percentage of one\u2019s rewards the validator receives for their services.\n\nThe stake amount indicates the total number of tokens delegated to a validator.\n\nHow to stake MATIC on MetaMask\n\nMetaMask is a decentralized, noncustodial cryptocurrency wallet that interacts with the Ethereum blockchain. The wallet is accessible as a mobile app and browser extension on Google Chrome, Brave, Firefox, Opera and Edge.\n\nHere are the steps to stake MATIC on MetaMask:\n\nStep 1: Add MetaMask as a browser extension.\n\nTo stake MATIC on MetaMask, users need to visit the MetaMask website and set it up as a browser extension. Go to \u201cDownload.\u201d One can choose between the currently used browser and iOS or Android. Select the download option for the browser to add MetaMask.\n\nStep 2: Connect MetaMask to the Polygon blockchain.\n\nMetaMask is compatible with different blockchains. To connect MetaMask to Polygon, go to \u201cNetworks\u201d and \u201cAdd network.\u201d In the window that appears, users must populate relevant data regarding the Polygon blockchain.\n\nStep 3: Transfer MATIC tokens to MetaMask.\n\nTo transfer MATIC tokens to the MetaMask wallet, copy the address from the wallet and feed it in as the destination address on the exchange or another wallet. Now, transfer MATIC tokens to MetaMask.\n\nStep 4: Connect MetaMask to the Polygon Wallet.\n\nOn the following link, click \u201cMetaMask\u201d to connect MetaMask to the Polygon wallet. https://wallet.polygon.technology/\n\nStep 5: Stake MATIC via MetaMask.\n\nOnce the connection is established, staking is enabled.\n\nStep 6: Delegate MATIC.\n\nSelect a validator to which tokens will be delegated.\n\nOne needs to use the control panel for staking. Click on the button \u201cApps\u201d and then select \u201cStaking.\u201d Put the validator\u2019s name in the search bar and click \u201cDelegate.\u201d All relevant information, such as the number of tokens staked, uptime and commission amount, is visible next to the validator\u2019s name.\n\nFeed in the MATIC amount for staking and click \u201cContinue.\u201d In the pop-up extension window, click \u201cConfirm.\u201d The transaction might take a few minutes to complete, depending on traffic.\n\nTo execute a transaction, stake MATIC and begin receiving rewards, users must buy a voucher and pay for gas. Click \u201cBuy Voucher.\u201d Specify details like the gas limit and price, and re-confirm the transaction.\n\nDelegation is now complete. Users can \u201cStake more\u201d or withdraw the rewards using the control panel. However, note that all transactions on the Ethereum network are paid in Ether (ETH). Therefore, the delegator must have enough ETH in the wallet to pay for the transactions.\n\nHow to stake MATIC on Coinbase Wallet\n\nTo stake MATIC on Coinbase, users need to use a wallet, as they don\u2019t provide a staking feature on the exchange. If users have funds on the exchange but not in the wallet, they will need to move funds to the wallet. Even though Coinbase Wallet doesn\u2019t have a built-in staking feature, there is a way to do it.\n\nHere are the steps leading to staking MATIC on Coinbase Wallet.\n\nStep 1: Install Coinbase wallet.\n\nInstall Coinbase Wallet on your smartphone. If it is an iPhone, go to the Apple App Store; visit the Play Store for Android.\n\nThe process includes creating a new wallet, agreeing to the terms of service, picking a username, setting privacy preferences, creating a passcode and backing up the wallet with a recovery phrase to help access the account in case users forget the passcode.\n\nStep 2: Move funds to the wallet.\n\nOpen the wallet and go down to the bottom right. Tap there and scroll down the screen that appears. The link \u201cConnect to Coinbase\u201d will be visible. Hit the link, and it will ask for authorization. Once done, the wallet will establish the user\u2019s connection to their wallet.\n\nHit \u201cBuy or transfer.\u201d When the exchange prompts you to select a coin, select \u201cMATIC wallet.\u201d Now, users can feed in the number of coins they want to transfer. The wallet will ask for a verification code. Once successfully deposited, funds will be transferred. MATIC tokens on Coinbase exchange are ERC-20 tokens, meaning they run on top of the Ethereum network.\n\nStep 3: Stake MATIC.\n\nVisit the Polygon website. On the top menu, click \u201cUse Polygon\u201d and \u201cStaking.\u201d On the next page, click \u201cBecome a delegator.\u201d\n\nThe user is taken to a page displaying a list of validators and their relevant details. One can sort the list in line with four parameters: performance, commission, stake and random, by clicking a drop-down list on the right of the page. The user can view the validators as a grid or a list. They can also search for a specific validator using a search box on the left.\n\nWhen users click any of the validators, they are taken to the page displaying further details of the relevant validator, such as MATIC staked, the commission asked, checkpoints signed and health status. Users can go through the list and click any validator.\n\nA different page displays further details of the validator. This includes the amount of MATIC their Ethereum wallet balance holds and its value in dollars, their stake, heimdall fee, rewards earned, performance index, checkpoints signed and more. Heimdall fees refer to the fees the validator has to pay using the Polygon network to submit checkpoints.\n\nThe user must log in by clicking the button at the top-right using their credentials. Users without an account on Polygon must create one and click the \u201cBecome a Delegator\u201d button.\n\nUsers need to populate the number of MATIC coins they intend to delegate and tap \u201cContinue.\u201d When the user clicks \u201cContinue,\u201d a pop-up appears. The user must tap the \u201cDelegate\u201d button to complete the process.\n\nHow to stake MATIC on Trust Wallet\n\nTrust Wallet is a decentralized, noncustodial mobile app wallet for storing, exchanging and transferring crypto assets. Here is the process to stake MATIC on Trust Wallet:\n\nStep 1: Set up a Trust Wallet.\n\nSet up a Trust Wallet on your mobile phone. Select the preferred operating system (iOS or Android) and install the app.\n\nIf users have already been using Trust Wallet, they must import the wallet. Otherwise, they have to set up a new wallet. To import an existing wallet, click the \u201cI already have a wallet\u201d button and confirm a six-digit passcode.\n\nIf a user is uninitiated with the wallet, they must read and agree to the privacy policy and terms of service, create and confirm a six-digit passcode and back up the wallet with a recovery phrase.\n\nTrust Wallet allows a wallet for several coins, but a multicoin wallet is usually the most suitable. As MATIC staking occurs on Ethereum, one requires an adequate amount of ETH and MATIC on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nStep 2: Connect Trust Wallet to Polygon.\n\nLog in to the Polygon staking dashboard and click \u201cBecome a Delegator.\u201d From the list of wallets, select \u201cWalletConnect\u201d to connect to Trust Wallet on Polygon. A QR code will appear on the screen.\n\nReturn to the Trust Wallet app, go to the settings and choose WalletConnect. Click the \u201cNew Connection\u201d button. Scan the QR code on the Polygon staking dashboard. Click \u201cConfirm\u201d to establish the connection.\n\nStep 3: Delegate and approve transaction.\n\nSelect the validator and click \u201cDelegate.\u201d Feed the number of MATIC coins to be staked and click \u201cContinue.\u201d To approve the transaction, confirm the smart contract call in the Trust Wallet app.\n\nGet back to the Polygon staking dashboard and click \u201cDelegate.\u201d Confirm yet another smart contract call in the Trust Wallet app. Delegation is active and users can begin accruing rewards.\n\nHow to stake using Ledger\n\nLedger is a popular device for storing cryptocurrencies. Before staking MATIC with Ledger, one needs to prepare for it.\n\nStep 1: Prepare for staking.\n\nThe process starts with updating Ledger Live to the latest version using the link: https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live/download\n\nConnect the Ledger device to \u201cMy Ledger\u201d and install the latest version of the ETH app on the Ledger device. Enable blind signing in the ETH app settings. When the preparation process is completed, Close Ledger Live or problems might arise when working with MetaMask.\n\nUsers also need to ensure MATIC is stored in the Ledger Ethereum account and not in the Polygon account, as MATIC staking happens on the Ethereum network.\n\nStep 2: Connect Ledger ETH account to MetaMask.\n\nConnect the Ledger device to the desktop and open the ETH app within. Now, link the Ledger ETH account to MetaMask.\n\nOnce the connection is established, go to the Polygon Wallet app.\n\nConnect your Ledger Ether account to MetaMask by following these steps.\n\nOnce done, go to the Polygon Web Wallet app, select \u201cConnect to a Wallet\u201d and then MetaMask.\n\nWhen MetaMask opens in the browser, select the Ledger account, click \u201cNext\u201d and then \u201cConnect.\u201d Ledger displays \u201cSign message.\u201d Select \u201cSign message\u201d and simultaneously press both buttons to confirm. Now, MetaMask is connected to the Polygon Wallet app.\n\nStep 3: Select a validator.\n\nSelect \u201cPolygon Staking.\u201d In the app\u2019s top-right corner, click the \u201cLogin\u201d button and select MetaMask again.\n\nChoose a validator from the list that appears. Users need to consider two parameters: a high score for \u201cCheckpoint signed\u201d and a low \u201cCommission.\u201d\n\nStep 4: Delegate.\n\nClick the \u201cDelegate\u201d button, fill in the amount of MATIC to be staked and click \u201cContinue.\u201d MetaMask displays \u201cGive permission to access your MATIC?\u201d\n\nReview the fee amount; if it looks satisfactory, click \u201cConfirm.\u201d Ledger now displays \u201cReview transaction.\u201d\n\nSelect \u201cAccept and send\u201d and press both buttons simultaneously to \u201csign the transaction.\u201d Ledger now displays \u201cApplication is ready.\u201d\n\nReturn to the Polygon Web Wallet App, select a validator and click \u201cDelegate.\u201d\n\nReview and confirm the transaction through MetaMask and Ledger devices. When the Ethereum network confirms the transaction, the screen will display \u201cDelegation Completed.\u201d\n\nHow to stake MATIC using ZenGo wallet\n\nZenGo is a self-compatible wallet. It\u2019s compatible with WalletConnect, with no seed phrase vulnerability. Let\u2019s go through how users can stake MATIC using a ZenGo wallet.\n\nStep 1: Install the ZenGo wallet on your mobile phone.\n\nVisit the ZenGo website, select an operating system (iOS or Android) and install the app on the mobile phone. To accelerate the search, one can scan the QR code.\n\nOpen the ZenGo app, enter an email address and tap \u201cContinue.\u201d ZenGo requires the user to confirm their email address. For confirmation, reach the inbox by tapping \u201cOpen My Email\u201d in the ZenGo app, then tap \u201cTap to Confirm\u201d in the email received. After email address verification, enable biometrics to make the app even more secure.\n\nCreate a Recovery Kit for the safety of funds and easy access when changing devices. As a noncustodial wallet, ZenGo shares an encrypted secret key share. Part of the key stored on the device helps unlock the wallet and use it with a face scan. Once the Recovery Kit is created, tap \u201cDone.\u201d\n\nStep 2: Connect ZenGo wallet to Polygon.\n\nUsers need to connect the ZenGo wallet to Polygon. Open the link https://staking.polygon.technology/\n\nGo to the Polygon staking dashboard. In the upper right part of the screen, tap \u201cLogin.\u201d\n\nTap WalletConnect from the list of available connections. WalletConnect protocol enables one to connect ZenGo to Polygon. The QR code will appear.\n\nGo to the ZenGo wallet homepage and tap the \u201cConnect to Apps\u201d button in the upper right corner. Scan the QR code.\n\nStep 3: Select a validator and delegate MATIC.\n\nNow begins the process of delegating MATIC. Make sure to have MATIC in ERC-20 and 0.05\u20130.1 ETH for fees, as the delegation happens on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nOn the Polygon staking dashboard, scroll down to find information such as the network\u2019s overview, active validators, their amount of stake, uptime, commission, amount of stake and health metrics.\n\nSelect a validator after considering the metrics and tap \u201cDelegate\u201d at the bottom-right of the screen.\n\nIn the pop-up box that appears, users need to enter the amount of MATIC to be staked and tap \u201cContinue.\u201d You can stake with an amount as low as 1 MATIC. To confirm the transaction, return to the ZenGo app and approve the transaction in the pop-up window.\n\nRevisit the Polygon staking dashboard and tap \u201cDelegate.\u201d In the ZenGo wallet, confirm the transaction and wait for approval.\n\nOnce delegation is active, the user will begin receiving rewards. At each checkpoint, rewards get accrued.\n\nRewards are received in the \u201cMy Account\u201d section of the Polygon staking dashboard. Users can also unstake, stake to multiple validators or restake funds. To withdraw the rewards accrued, users must have a minimum of 2 MATIC in their account.\n\nThe road ahead\n\nAs a prominent layer-2 network, the Polygon protocol is a solution that helps Ethereum expand in size, security, efficiency and use cases. As the unit of payment and settlement in the network, MATIC helps power the system. The Matic network went live in 2020, rebranded to Polygon in February 2021, and is being used by developers to build Ethereum-compatible decentralized applications.\n\nThe Polygon protocol has been instrumental in making Ethereum usable and pulling it out of the mess the blockchain found itself in after rapid growth. Transactions were stuck for hours over a lack of scalability, with the cost of executing transactions often more than the transaction amount itself. The Polygon protocol has effectively transformed Ethereum into a full-fledged multichain system with the advantages of Ethereum\u2019s decentralization and vibrancy.\n\nMATIC token is here to stay and keeps playing an increasingly important role in retaining the functionality of Ethereum ecosystem. Staking, meanwhile, will serve as a mechanism to ensure proper governance and security of the network."

        "content": "Today Societe Generale Forge (SocGen Forge) unveiled the EURCV stablecoin (EUR CoinVertible), which is initially being issued on the Ethereum public blockchain with plans for other blockchains as well. This is the first public blockchain stablecoin issued by a subsidiary of a global systemically important bank (G-SIB).\n\nSocGen Forge has been at the cutting edge of blockchain for some time, providing the infrastructure for the first blockchain bond issued by the European Investment Bank (EIB) on Ethereum. Like that bond, the stablecoin uses Forge\u2019s CAST framework for tokenization. It was also the first major commercial bank to launch a public blockchain bond back in 2019.\n\nThe motivation for the issuance includes using it as a robust settlement asset for on-chain transactions. The DLT Pilot Regime is now in force, although no major projects have yet been unveiled. Other client needs that SocGen Forge is targeting include corporate treasury, on-chain liquidity funding and an asset for margin calls.\n\nIn terms of jurisdiction, it is a French regulated digital asset and the company received its digital asset license last year. On the one hand, it has many of the features you\u2019d expect from a conservative regulated institution. Access to the stablecoin is restricted to investors that have been through SocGen KYC and AML procedures. And the backing assets are fully segregated. If SocGen doesn\u2019t want to buy the stablecoins from the holders, they can be redeemed or converted into collateral.\n\nHowever, the collateral is of a lesser quality than the reserves of the USDC or Paxos dollar stablecoins. Collateral supporting the EURCV is cash at a bank with at least the credit rating of SocGen and short term securities with an unsecured credit rating equivalent to SocGen or better. In contrast, USDC and Paxos only invest in bank deposits and Treasuries or Treasury repo.\n\nSocGen Forge plans to have the stablecoin listed on digital asset exchanges.\n\n\u201cDigital assets with stabilisation mechanisms \u2013 i.e. stablecoins \u2013 built under a robust banking-grade structure will be a key element to increase trust and confidence in the native crypto ecosystem,\u201d said Jean-Marc Stenger, CEO of SG-FORGE. \u201cThis issuance is a major step in Societe Generale\u2013FORGE\u2019s roadmap to deliver innovative solutions to its clients, either real-money institutions and corporates or entities of the crypto industry, and to facilitate the emergence of new market infrastructures based on blockchain technology.\u201d\n\nWhite & Case was the legal advisor, Equitis Gestion is the fiduciary, and PwC audited the smart contract.\n\nEarlier this month, Brazilian investment bank BTG Pactual launched a dollar stablecoin."

        "title": "Ethereum's Recent Pump is Good News for Cryptos Like Deelance - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Like many cryptos, Ethereum (Ether) sure is happy that it\u2019s 2023. After a long, cold crypto winter that saw Ethereum drop in value by 36.22% over the last year, it\u2019s truly turned the corner in 2023. Year-to-date as of April 19, Ethereum has gained 65.14% and stands at $1,981.50. It\u2019s been on a solid pump recently, too, bumping up in value by 11.08% in the last month, as it has 2k in its sight yet again.\n\nThe big boost that Ethereum has experienced in 2023 has also had a trickle-down effect on other cryptos that are based on the blockchain. One of those is a new Upwork replacement that\u2019s set to hit $300,000 in the near future.\n\nIt\u2019s called Deelance (DLANCE), a first-of-its-kind freelancing and recruitment platform based on the blockchain that\u2019s revolutionizing how freelancers connect with potential employers. The platform has raised just shy of $300,000 in presale thus far, as investors are gobbling up the available $DLANCE tokens \u2013 just as you should now.\n\nBelow, we\u2019ll dive more into Deelance to figure out why it\u2019s such an amazing new crypto project, and reveal how Ethereum\u2019s price pump adds more credence to the project.\n\n>>>Buy Deelance Now<<<\n\nEther\u2019s Success Leads to the Same for Others on the Blockchain\n\nIt hasn\u2019t always been true that Ethereum has to be successful in order for the other crypto projects that are based on it to be successful. For instance, while Ethereum struggled for much of 2022, there were certainly smaller alt coins that are based on the Ethereum blockchain that fared just fine.\n\nThat being said, it certainly doesn\u2019t hurt when Ethereum does well. In fact, when Ether performs well, it usually follows that the solid projects with good underlying fundamentals on the world\u2019s second-largest blockchain do well, too. That\u2019s because investors start to do more research and take notice of the projects based on Ethereum.\n\nDeelance is one of those, and it\u2019s definitely benefitting from the bounceback success that Ethereum has experienced this year. In a short amount of time in presale, Deelance has been able to raise more than $294,000. It\u2019s blowing through pressale stages, with investors who wait, missing out on the lower prices that are available. That\u2019s because there\u2019s a price increase that occurs with each new presale stage. This is why it\u2019s essential that you act now so you can get the biggest potential return on your investment.\n\n>>>Buy Deelance Now<<<\n\nDeelance is a Viable Replacement for Upwork\n\nUpwork has established itself as a leading freelancing platform based on Web2. It has a market capitalization of $1.37 billion. That being said, there are some major issues that the platform has, and it shows in its stock price. In the last year, Upwork\u2019s stock has dropped 51.18% in value, though it\u2019s leveled off a bit with \u201conly\u201d a 4.22% drop in 2023 year-to-date.\n\nDeelance provides a lot of advantages over a platform like Upwork \u2013 and others such as Freelancer and Fiverr \u2013 because it\u2019s a Web3 platform. It offers significantly lower fees for both freelancers and clients than all those other platforms, and it offers instant withdrawals with no fees since it can be done in cryptocurrency.\n\nWhile having a large number of freelancers make the switch from Web2 to Web3 would have seemed unlikely maybe even a year or two ago, more and more people are comfortable with the move today. Part of the reason for that is the recent success of Ethereum, which is drawing more positive attention to projects such as Deelance.\n\n>>>Buy Deelance Now<<<\n\nDeelance is a New Way to Work\n\nDeelance is more than just another freelancing platform. It\u2019s providing freelancers with a new way to work.\n\nUsers on the platform can create their own professional identity on the Deelance Metaverse. There, they can socialize with other people, buy commercial land or office space, put up billboard advertisements to increase their own brand awareness, get exclusive access to a Metaverse VIP experience, and even gain access to unique tools and services. Since all of this uses the $DLANCE token, too, it provides a great use case for why it\u2019ll increase in value.\n\n>>>Buy Deelance Now<<<\n\nWhile working in the Metaverse, Deelance users will be able to interact with buyers in an office space. There, they can discuss potential projects, or progress on projects, which allows them to connect in a way that really wasn\u2019t possible before now. Buyers and sellers can interact directly with each other, which increases the chances that connections will be made.\n\nAnd speaking of connections, freelancers can build their own network of colleagues in the Metaverse lobby arena. This is great, as freelancers often are out all on their own. This networking capability allows them to connect with others to learn and potentially build up their own business, too.\n\nThis aspect of Deelance is what\u2019s setting it apart from all of the competition in its industry. Plus, it aligns quite well with Ethereum and the forward-thinking approach. After all, Ethereum did just go through The Merge last fall, which significantly upgraded how the blockchain works, which resulted in significant gains for the project.\n\n>>>Buy Deelance Now<<<\n\nBuy Deelance Now to Get the Biggest Return on Your Investment\n\nDeelance, a new Web3 freelancing and recruitment platform, is benefitting from two major developments \u2013 the shift in work culture to freelancing and the gig economy, and the recent pump of the Ethereum blockchain that it\u2019s based on.\n\nThe fact that Ethereum is approaching $2,000 again is bringing a lot of great positive attention to cryptos based on the blockchain, which Deelance is. Yet, the real reason Deelance has been so successful in presale thus far is its own approach and design. It\u2019s positioned itself as a great replacement for Upwork, Freelancer and Fivrr, and investors are taking notice, pumping almost $300,000 into the presale thus far.\n\nIf you want to get in on the ground level of this great opportunity, you better act quick. There\u2019s a price increase with each new presale stage, and the current stage ends in about four days. So, buy Deelance now before you miss out.\n\n>>>Buy Deelance Now<<<\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

You need lots of money \u2014 or, in Texas, lots of crypto.\n\nAccording to The Dallas Morning News, a Zillow-like website has been launched by MyEListing, a startup located in Cedar Park, close to Austin. The platform enables individuals to list both commercial and residential properties for sale and offers the option to use either cash or cryptocurrency as payment.\n\nThe company's ASAP (Accelerated Sale and Purchase) program enables sellers to complete transactions in a single business day on the marketplace. Coinbase Commerce will facilitate the conversion of buyers' cryptocurrency to cash, while Millennial Title and Championship Title will manage the title work.\n\n\u201cWe pre-clear the title, the seller pre-signs the sales contract, and we list the property to the seller's liking,\u201d a statement from the company reads. \u201cAll parties involved then sign closing documentation via an online Zoom call, buyers have 30 minutes to send the full purchase price after clicking the \u2018Buy Now\u2019 button featured on the listing, and the process is finished.\u201d\n\nMyEListing doesn\u2019t charge listing fees for properties, communication with other agents, or access exclusive market intelligence. Instead, the company aims to \u201cempower real estate professionals from every corner of the industry with as many free resources as possible.\u201d\n\nSome homes in North Texas are available on the new site, including one in Grapevine. The site features a three-quarter acre home site along Hughes Road. The property is being offered for $499,000 in cash, or alternatively, 17.5 Bitcoin or 256 Ethereum.\n\nTwo additional commercial properties in D-FW have been listed on the platform.

        "content": "Bitcoin price in India and international markets dropped on Friday, after days of seeing its value rise. Industry experts say that at present, the selling pressure on investors has increased, triggering a period of volatility for crypto assets. On Friday, the world's most popular cryptocurrency opened with a loss of 2.22 percent to trade at $28,245 (roughly Rs. 23.2 lakh). While it remains the most expensive cryptocurrency, BTC is currently trading at a similar price on both national as well as international exchanges. In the last 24 hours, the value of Bitcoin has dropped by $613 (roughly Rs. 50,370).\n\n\u201cBitcoin dropped for the second consecutive session due to an increased selling pressure,\u201d Edul Patel, CEO of crypto investment platform Mudrex told Gadgets 360. Selling pressure garners heat when majority of the traders begin selling, indicating that the majority is betting on the market price to decrease. \u201cThis resulted in the loss of the rally and wiped out the weekly gains of Bitcoin. Despite this, there is still substantial support down to the late-March lows of $26,500 (roughly Rs. 21 lakh) and Bitcoin has seen a 40 percent increase over the past six weeks.\u201d\n\nEthereum followed Bitcoin in a conventional market movement and reflected a loss of 0.10 percent at the time of publishing. The value of Ether is hovering around the mark of $1,940 (roughly Rs. 1.60 lakh) after having fallen by $157 (roughly Rs. 12,899) in the last three days.\n\nOn Friday, most cryptocurrencies saw their prices fall alongside Bitcoin and Ether. These included altcoins like Tether, Binance Coin, USD Coin, Ripple, and Cardano as well as Dogecoin, Polygon, Solana, and Polkadot.\n\nShiba Inu, Avalanche, and Tron also saw their values drop on Friday.\n\n\u201cMarket performance has been sideways with a downward bias in the last 24 hours. The two-day continuous drop could be triggered by a $400 million (roughly Rs. 3,268 crore) sell order on Binance. On the regulatory front, the US seems to be lagging as market liquidity seems to be moving away from the country. Greed seems to be on a decline, as the crypto fear and greed index stands at 50, down two points in the last 24 hours and lowest since March 15,\u201d Parth Chaturvedi, Crypto Ecosystem Lead, CoinSwitch told Gadgets 360.\n\nThe overall crypto market valuation dipped by 1.45 percent over the last 24 hours. As of Friday, the crypto market cap stood at $1.20 trillion (roughly Rs. 98,26,980 crore), showed the data by CoinMarketCap. In the otherwise top-to-bottom loss-ridden price chart, LEO and Bitcoin SV managed to record miniscule price hikes.\n\nWhile there are several factors that could have led to the crypto market hitting a speed breaker after rallying for days, it could also be due to the possibility of stricter oversight that could make it risky for miscreants to engage with the sector. The European Parliament on Thursday overwhelmingly backed the European Union's (EU) first set of rules to regulate the cryptoasset markets.\n\nCalled MiCA \u2014 or Markets in Crypto Assets \u2014 these rules largely revolve around consumer protection and prevention of market manipulation and financial crimes in the crypto sector. The MiCA bill is aimed at preventing insider dealing, unlawful disclosure of inside information, and market manipulation of crypto-assets.\n\n\u201cThe crypto market faces headwinds, but long-term tailwinds for Bitcoin are highlighted in 3iQ's 2023 Outlook. Key market indicators showed a \u2018Sell' sentiment amidst prices of BTC and ETH decreasing after a good run in the past few days. Investors must proceed with caution,\u201d Rajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX told Gadgets 360.\n\nGaana, JioSaavn, Google Podcasts, Apple Podcasts,\n\nApple is opening its first stores in India, one in Mumbai and the other in Delhi.

        "content": "zkSync Era\u2019s integration would allow better provision of liquidity for 1inch users.\n\nAlas, development activity on the network remained very low.\n\nOn 20 April, the 1inch Network [1INCH] announced that it has adopted the Zero-Knowlege (ZK) scaling solution through its expansion to zkSync Era. Known to be connected with the cutting-edge ZK rollup technology, zkSync Era is an Ethereum [ETH] layer two (L2) whose purpose is to provide more cost-effective and faster transactions.\n\nRead 1inch Network\u2019s [1INCH] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nFirst of its kind\n\nAccording to the announcement, the expansion would allow users on the DEX aggregator to enjoy the benefits of the ZK system. This includes lower fees, better access to liquidity, and higher transaction speeds.\n\nAlthough zkSync Era was only launched in March 2023, it has proven to be one of the best projects with real utility. Hence, the reason there is so much hype behind it, and its Total Value Locked (TVL) has been soaring.\n\nFor context, the TVL hike means that enough liquidity has been entering into chains under the protocol.\n\nReacting to the integration, 1inch\u2019s co-founder Sergej Kunz mentioned that the project was excited to be the first to be implemented on the zkSync network. He affirmed that:\n\n\u201cAs zkSync Era gains steam, 1inch users will benefit from faster and cheaper transactions.\u201d\n\nIn response, the CEO, and co-founder of Matter Labs, the firm behind the zkSync idea, Alex Gluchowski did not hide his eagerness to see the outcome of the collaboration. Like Kunz, Gluchowski said:\n\n\u201cAs the largest DEX aggregator by on-chain volume, 1inch will provide deeper liquidity to zkSync Era while offering DeFi users greater transparency and empowering them to execute faster trades at better rates and with less slippage on their transactions.\u201d\n\nEcstasy in the land amid restraints in development\n\nAccording to Santiment, the network\u2019s social volume rose to 41. The metric takes into consideration the search texts for an asset.\n\nAn increase, as seen at press time, implied that participants have a high precedence for 1INCH.\n\nSimilarly, its social dominance also increased to 0.464%. When this metric spike, it shows that the asset has ascended into one of the top assets being discussed among the top 100 in market capitalization.\n\nDespite the update, the 1inch Network development activity remained clustered at a low point. At the time of writing, it was 1.12.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 INCHs worth today?\n\nThis means that there has been a continued downturn in public contribution on GitHub. However, there was a chance that the expansion could impact the metric positively considering the hype around zkSync Era.\n\nAdditionally, 1inch also pointed out that several protocols were immediately available via the network on zkSync Era. Some of these include SyncSwap, Mute, and SpaceFi."

        "content": "In the crypto space, projects are not created equal. PolkaDot (DOT), Ethereum (ETH), and Uwerx will lead the next bull market cycle. A unique value proposition drives each, and analysts expect all three to post excellent returns in 2023.\n\nPolkadot (DOT)\n\nPolkadot (DOT) was created by Gavin Wood, one of the core developers of Ethereum (ETH). Polkadot (DOT) presents the solution for blockchains\u2019 core problem: their natural isolation. Polkadot (DOT) creates a foundational layer, or layer zero, allowing for the free flow of assets and information between all the Polkadot (DOT) chains. Polkadot\u2019s (DOT) core blockchain is the Relay chain that provides security and relays information and assets, as the name suggests. Polkadot\u2019s (DOT) other chains are called parachains, and these purpose-specific chains can hyper-specialize, allowing for an enormous ecosystem. Polkadot\u2019s (DOT) elegant solution to interoperability will drive its growth in 2023.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nEthereum (ETH) is the oldest smart contract-capable blockchain. Ethereum (ETH) launched in 2015, and the developers at Ethereum (ETH) have been shipping upgrades to the network ever since. The most recent upgrade saw Ethereum (ETH) transition to proof of stake, and the coming Ethereum (ETH) hard fork, the Shanghai hark ford, will enable staking withdrawals. Making analysts expect that once Ethereum (ETH) can be withdrawn, investors will rush to buy Ethereum (ETH) so they can stake the Ethereum (ETH) token and earn passive income from validator rewards.\n\nUwerx (WERX)\n\nUwerx has analysts and experts buzzing. This relatively unknown microcap crypto project has outrageous upside potential in 2023. Uwerx will release a decentralized blockchain based freelance platform that will set a new standard for the freelancing industry. Until now, centralized platforms have choked innovation through high platform fees and unnecessarily heavy bureaucratic systems. Uwerx provides a blockchain-driven solution and replaces intermediaries with smart contracts. InterFi Network and SolidProof have both already audited the protocol, and liquidity will be locked for twenty-five years after launch.\n\nUwerx flags all the indicators of a hidden gem, and this project could become a blue chip as early as 2024. With millions of freelancers ready to migrate to a better alternative and Uwerx providing one, the growth potential remains obscene. Analysts have predicted WERX can rally by up to 9,000% in 2023 alone, and Uwerx is an opportunity to buy a potential blue chip crypto project at a lucrative price.\n\nParabolic Year For Uwerx\n\nWhen Uwerx breaks into the mainstream, its disruptive nature will do the rest. With lower platform fees and better security, Uwerx will offer a fundamentally superior service to those currently available on the market. 2023 belongs to freelancers and Uwerx holders.

        "title": "Shanghai's Blockchain Advancements: Will They Ignite A Surge In Ethereum, Bitcoin, And Big Eyes Coin? - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The upcoming Shanghai upgrade of the Ethereum network, marking the end of a two-year shift to proof of stake, has been a topic of interest in recent news. The transition to proof of stake will allow access to approximately $34 billion worth of over 18 million Ethereum (ETH), causing investors to feel uncertain about the potential effects on the value of ETH, Bitcoin (BTC), and Big Eyes Coin (BIG).\n\nBelow, we will delve into this subject to examine the potential implications for ETH, BTC, and BIG.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Optimistic Future: A Positive Outlook for the Cryptocurrency\n\nThe upcoming Ethereum Shanghai upgrade is set to bring about technical improvements to the network and enable staking withdrawals, completing the transition to proof of stake that has been ongoing for two years. However, the distribution of approximately 18 million ETH, valued at $34 billion, to validators after the upgrade has sparked investor concerns regarding the impact on the market value of the second-largest cryptocurrency.\n\nAlthough the withdrawal queue restricts the number of daily requests, analysts predict that the short-term pricing impact will not be as severe as initially anticipated. Moreover, traders have already had access to staked ETH via liquid staking services like Lido even before the Shanghai upgrade. Consequently, some experts believe that Ethereum\u2019s long-term prospects will become more optimistic, given that the market has already priced in the upgrade\u2019s potential effects.\n\nOn the day of its debut, Ethereum\u2019s price increased by 2.95%, reaching a trading price of $1,985.98 and a market capitalization of $239.22 billion. Additionally, the rising competition in cryptocurrency custody is expected to lead to more ETH being locked up, attracting the attention of significant institutions like JPMorgan Chase and Standard Chartered, and potentially leading to a long-term price increase.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Halving Cycle Shows Familiar Trends from Previous Cycles\n\nNew data suggests that the progress of the current Bitcoin halving cycle is similar to that of previous cycles, with BTC price fluctuations following a comparable pattern. On Thursday, BTC saw a 0.72% increase, which may be partially attributed to the Shapella upgrade. However, analysts are already discussing the potential impact of the block subsidy halving slated for next year, which is expected to reduce the number of BTC miners can create per block.\n\nBTC/USD has risen by nearly 70% in 2023, and the upcoming halving is anticipated to act as a catalyst for Bitcoin\u2019s price to reach all-time highs, similar to what occurred in previous cycles.\n\nBig Eyes Coin Sees Major Victories\n\nBig Eyes Coin, a cryptocurrency inspired by felines, has raised an impressive $33.6 million in presale during the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade. The Big Eyes Coin platform offers several exciting features, including the BIG COMP, a contest that awarded two winners $100K. The platform also boasts the Big Eyes Excali-Paw Chest, which could grant users up to $1 million in $BIG, as well as the BIG Loot and Mintable trading cards available on OpenSea. Moreover, investors can take advantage of the recently launched Stage 13, which is another exciting feature.\n\nBig Eyes Coin is a unique cryptocurrency that places a high value on its investors, providing them with exclusive experiences. Despite its current price of $BIG 1891.89, token holders believe that the asset has enormous potential and are optimistic that its value will increase significantly once it hits the blockchain.\n\nNavigating the Current Market Trends for Cryptocurrencies\n\nIn the current market climate of cryptocurrency, having a well-diversified portfolio of assets is essential. Although Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are already considered commodities, it won\u2019t be long before Big Eyes Coin (BIG) becomes recognized as a valuable asset with the potential for substantial returns.\n\nJoin the BIG Space!\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Cryptocurrency investors are always looking for new opportunities to invest in digital currency. With the recent rise in the popularity of presale platforms, it\u2019s important to stay up to date on market trends. In this article, we\u2019ll closely analyze the April 2023 forecast for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the new presale coin Dogetti (DETI) and explore the key factors shaping the cryptocurrency market.\n\nBitcoin Climbing Back Bit By Bit\n\nBitcoin (BTC), as the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation, has been a strong performer so far in 2023, with prices up 68.4% year-to-date. There are several factors that contribute to this, including increased institutional adoption and a shift in Federal Reserve policy, which has helped to boost investor confidence in the digital currency.\n\nLooking at the positive price performance in March, we can see the potential for a bullish pattern to continue in April. Bitcoin reached $29,000 briefly in late March, but dipped back down to $28,477 at the end of the month, still clocking in a 19.2% monthly gain.\n\nEthereal Economics: The Rising Value of Ethereum\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation, has also seen gains in 2023, with prices up 49.2% year-to-date. One key factor driving this growth is the rise of Web3, the next generation of the internet, using decentralisation as a key part of the network. Web3 has the potential to revolutionise the way we use the internet, and Ethereum\u2019s position as a key player in this space makes it an attractive investment opportunity for those interested in the future of digital technology.\n\nEthereum also is looking to perform strongly in April, as Ethereum shot up by 9.7% over the month of March, and finished strongly at a price of $1829.\n\nDogetti: The Rise of a New Meme Coin Kingpin\n\nDogetti (DETI) is a new presale coin that is set to launch in just two months and is attracting a lot of attention from many cryptocurrency investors. The coin\u2019s purpose is to create a strong community where holders are regularly rewarded thanks to a 2% reflection protocol, which means that 2% of every transaction is distributed to all wallets.\n\nDogetti also has a unique feature in the form of DogettiSwap, a decentralised exchange built on the Ethereum blockchain where users can trade ERC20 tokens with a 6% tax fee, which is broken down into 2% redistributed to all wallets, 2% to a charity wallet, and 2% for liquidity.\n\nPredicting the future price of any asset is a daunting task, and cryptocurrencies are no exception. Bitcoin and Ethereum have all experienced significant price fluctuations in the past. These digital assets have proven their potential to disrupt traditional finance and create new opportunities for investors and entrepreneurs.\n\nOverall, the April 2023 cryptocurrency market forecast looks promising for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogetti, with each offering unique opportunities for investors.\n\nPresale: https://dogetti.io/how-to-buy\n\nWebsite: https://dogetti.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/Dogetti\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_Dogetti_\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Israel's Central Bank Launches Digital Currency; Bitcoin, Ethereum, Signuptoken.com Can Capitalize - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "In recent years, cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), have gained significant attention as widely used digital currencies. However, alongside these established players, newer cryptocurrencies like Signuptoken.com (SUT) have also emerged as potential contenders in the evolving crypto landscape.\n\nAmidst this changing payment landscape, Israel\u2019s Central Bank is reportedly considering the development of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), which refers to a digital form of fiat currency issued and regulated by a country\u2019s central bank.\n\nIsrael\u2019s Digital Shekel Or SHAKED?\n\nThe Steering Committee on the Potential Issuance of a Digital Shekel, or \u201cSHAKED,\u201d is in charge of the Bank of Israel\u2019s investigation into the feasibility of releasing a digital shekel. They have identified a number of scenarios that could influence the creation and use of a central bank digital currency (CBDC), including things like CBDC issuances by other nations, a decline in the use of cash in transactions, the adoption of stablecoins or other private payment methods, competition within the domestic payment system, and technological developments in the payments industry.\n\nThe Bank of Israel acknowledges the necessity to proactively address these issues and maintain control over the nation\u2019s payment system as the landscape of digital currencies continues to change. As a viable means of navigating these adjustments and ensuring that Israel stays at the forefront of financial innovation, CBDC is being taken into consideration. Although negotiations over the creation of \u201cSHAKED\u201d are ongoing, no official decision has been made.\n\nWhy Does Signuptoken.com Gain Attention\n\nSignuptoken.com (SUT) has unveiled groundbreaking features poised to revolutionize the crypto world, positioning it as a valuable asset comparable to gold.\n\nSUT, an ERC-20-based cryptocurrency, is committed to generating financial growth for its members. Despite being a relatively new player in the crypto space, Signuptoken.com has ambitious plans to launch on the Uniswap blockchain once it reaches one million sign-ups.\n\nWhat sets Signuptoken.com apart from other altcoins is its unique approach to fundraising. Unlike traditional initial coin offerings (ICOs) or presale programs, Signuptoken.com only collects email addresses, ensuring equal opportunity for all to increase their financial assets. By joining the exclusive Millionaires Club email list, members may even become eligible for early retirement.\n\nPoised to be a safe asset, Signuptoken.com (SUT) has responded to the clamor from its esteemed Millionaires Club members by introducing a highly anticipated referral system. Also, SUT ensures the security of its funds by taking measures to instill confidence in its platform. It acquired audits and secured listings on established crypto platforms such as CoinSniper and Solidity Finance.\n\nBitcoin And Ether \u2014 Likened To Gold\n\nAccording to CoinTelegraph, ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood believes that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether are similar to safe-haven investments like gold in that they offer stability during macroeconomic turbulence. She cites their endurance over the most recent banking crisis, outperforming other asset classes, as proof of their widespread acceptance and adoption, pointing to a potential upheaval of the established order of things.\n\nAs cryptocurrencies gain popularity and come under regulatory pressure from the US government, Wood anticipates that they will play a significant role in the upcoming election. But only some people are as enthusiastic about this idea as she is. The world\u2019s largest hedge fund\u2019s founder, Ray Dalio, is skeptical of Bitcoin due to its volatility and central banks\u2019 unwillingness to accept it as a legitimate form of payment. After the US dollar and the euro, gold continues to be a substantial reserve held by central banks, according to Dalio.\n\nThe emergence of cryptocurrencies and the growing interest in CBDC by Israel\u2019s Central Bank reflect the changing landscape of digital assets. With \u201cgold\u201d cryptos like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and SUT establishing their existence in the crypto world and CBDC being considered a potential digital currency by central banks, the future of payments and financial systems is likely to be shaped by the continued evolution of digital assets.\n\nProvide Your Email on the Signuptoken.com Roster\n\nWebsite: https://www.signuptoken.com\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_SignUpToken_\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/SignUpToken\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Does the Zilliqa coin have a future? - Times of Malta",
        "content": "Zilliqa (ZIL) is one of the most talked about and ranked high among currencies that entered the crypto market in recent months. Xinshu Dong, the Chief Executive Officer of Zilliqa, and his team came up with this brilliant idea in 2017. It was his team of dedicated consultants and blockchain algorithm experts who brought Zilliqa to life.\n\nHere's an analysis of Zilliqa's current details and a future prediction of the Zilliqa price.\n\nLet us begin with a quick overview of Zilliqa.\n\nCryptocurrency Zilliqa Ticker symbol ZIL Price $0.02478 Price change 24h +9.52% Price change 7d -7.55% Market cap $393,441,947 Circulating supply 15,867,699,447 ZIL Trading volume $38,448,228 All-time high $0.2563 All-time low $0.002477 Zilliqa ROI +546.14%\n\nInteresting facts you would want to know about Zilliqa\n\nZilliqa is a blockchain network based on Ethereum founded by Prateek Saxena, Amrit Kumar, and Max Kantelia. It is a platform with many decentralized applications and was initially based on Ethereum before it adopted its protocol. Since ZIL was a new entrant into the investment market around 2018, trading it initially needed to be more stable.\n\nAs the blockchain network grows, Zilliqa coin allows you to trade rates, leading to an exponential increase in miners. Zilliqa is the first public blockchain based on sharding technology. Programming languages such as Scilla implement practical Byzantine fault tolerance, and Sharding can solve the scalability problem arising from its platform's active scaling method. Several transactions can be processed simultaneously with Zilliqa, which makes it a good choice for enterprises.\n\nZIL has added a hybrid consensus mechanism backed by a public blockchain platform with high bandwidth to address accessibility issues. There can be no node operation without Proof of Work (PoS) hashing. A unique feature of Zilliqa is its ability to detect fraudulent or spurious transactions by peers, which allows confirmation blocks to trace previous blocks.\n\nWe use cryptographic techniques based on zero-disclosure evidence and mathematical consistency to cross-check this blockchain-enabled transaction without disclosing any personal information about either party. Therefore, security obstacles should be addressed first. There is no doubt that Zilliqa's Zyro protocol is at the heart of the entire decentralized finance ecosystem, which is about to undergo another launch.\n\nZIL (Zilliqa): Its unique features\n\nThis protocol is known for its liquidity and lightning-fast transaction speeds, which makes it different from other Ethereum-based Decentralised Finance protocols and opens up many mining opportunities. According to their website, they're transforming digital infrastructure across various communities.\n\nTherefore, Zilliqa tokens can be used to implement smart contracts and transfer funds. The company has also developed its smart contract language called Scilla, which developers can use to write safe smart contracts. Many shards make it easy to process many transactions cost-effectively, and silicon-smoothly.\n\nZilliqa price prediction 2023\n\nIt is forecast that Zilliqa's price will trade in the range of $0.0195 in 2023. In the near term, ZIL is expected to reach a high of $0.02 and a low of $0.014. By the end of the year, Zilliqa's price is forecast to be approximately $0.016.\n\nZilliqa coin price prediction 2024\n\nAccording to projections, ZIL will have an average price of $0.025 in 2024. There are expectations that ZIL will reach a high of $0.029 and a low of $0.024. A long-term investment in Zilliqa makes sense for investors who plan to hold the company for the long haul. Investing in dips will enable you to make more than 100% over the next two to three years.\n\nZilliqa price prediction 2025\n\nIn the world of cryptocurrency, there may be miracles and short-term magic. Zilliqa's price is estimated to reach $0.05 by 2025, reflecting its rapid growth. Therefore, it is expected to reach a value of $0.057 by 2025. Cryptocurrencies are always viewed as long-term investments by experts.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile various experts have predicted that Zilliqa (ZIL) will outperform its competitors, Zilliqa has continued to outperform them. Although Zilliqa has set higher benchmarks for itself, the community continues to develop new ones. ZIL's market share in the cryptocurrency market will exceed this platform's expectations since investors have found it to be extremely interactive and intuitive. Zilliqa's token exchange will soon unveil another important launch, supported by a wide range of exchanges. There is no need to exaggerate Zilliqa's rise to $0.0361, even if the same cannot be described as quite buoyant and overstated.\n\nDisclaimer: The information, view and opinions provided in this article are being provided solely for promotional and informational purposes and should not be construed as investment, tax or legal advice."

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Gas Fees Hit New Highs During Meme Season - Here's Why - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "The hype around meme-inspired cryptocurrency has caused a spike in the price of Ethereum gas in recent days. The rising demand for transactions on the Ethereum network is a direct effect of the rising value of these tokens.\n\nThere was a 10-month spike in Ethereum\u2019s gas prices. According to data provided by Glassnode, the median price of ETH gas on a seven-day moving average has risen to 43.641 gwei, a level not seen since June 30 last year.\n\nThe network utilizes a measurement system based on the gwei. To perform a transaction or launch a smart contract on the Ethereum network, a certain amount of gas is required.\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 #Ethereum $ETH Median Gas Price (7d MA) just reached a 10-month high of 43.641 GWEI Previous 10-month high of 43.620 GWEI was observed on 30 June 2022 View metric:https://t.co/6QGDfZoULY pic.twitter.com/n9qDcd6NqD \u2014 glassnode alerts (@glassnodealerts) April 21, 2023\n\nGas is a unit of computing effort that is used on the Ethereum network to carry out a certain operation. Gwei is the currency used to denote the cost of the gas needed to perform an action on the network.\n\nOne Gwei is equal to 0.000000001 Ether (ETH), which means that if the gas price is 20 Gwei, it would cost 0.00000002 ETH to execute the operation. The price of gas can vary depending on network congestion and demand.\n\nSince miners are driven by higher gas prices to include transactions with higher gas costs in the blocks they mine, higher gas prices usually result in faster transaction processing times.\n\nETH market cap at $229.8 billion on the daily chart at TradingView.com\n\nEthereum Gas Fees Up 35%\n\nThe median gas price across a 7DMA peaked at 150 gwei in May 2022 and has since decreased significantly to the low-to-mid-teens. Then, beginning in March 2022, it began to settle at roughly 20 gwei, where it remained until the Merge went live in September of that year.\n\nAs of April 20, 2023, the average gas price for Ethereum transactions was 81.94 gwei, up from 60.82 gwei on April 19 and 44.42 gwei in 2022, representing a rise of 34.74% and 84.46%, respectively.\n\nMemecoins are the buzz of the town right now, and Pepe The Frog is spearheading the charge. According to market analysis platform Santiment, recently deployed memecoins such as $TROLL, $APED, and $BOBO have surpassed the top gas-burning altcoins.\n\nIn particular, PEPE\u2019s market cap has increased to little over $89 million in just a few days, making it the sixth largest memecoin.\n\nEthereum Edges Bitcoin In Daily Fees\n\nMeanwhile, independent Ethereum educator Anthony Sassano stated that the second-largest blockchain, Ethereum, had generated 28 times the revenue of Bitcoin through its daily fee structure.\n\nAdditionally, he mentioned layer-2 Ethereum platforms that have exceeded the BTC network in terms of daily revenue, such as Arbitrum One.\n\nImage shows the daily and weekly revenue of various blockchains. Source: Twitter\n\nThe findings also showed Ethereum\u2019s rising prominence in the dynamic cryptocurrency market.\n\nWithin the Ethereum community, gas fees have been a topic of conversation. Certain activities, such as small transactions or interacting with smart contracts of low value, can become prohibitively costly due to the network\u2019s high gas fees.\n\n-Featured image from Zipmex"

        "content": "Meet the Ethereum-Shibarium Bridge, an upcoming solution that promises to enhance the Shiba Inu ecosystem by providing seamless, secure cross-chain transactions for SHIB users.\n\nThe Shiba Inu ($SHIB) project, a decentralized cryptocurrency initiative, was inspired by the widely-known Shiba Inu dog breed meme and developed as an Ethereum blockchain-based alternative to Dogecoin. The Shiba Inu (SHIB) ecosystem features three distinct tokens, each designed for a specific function.\n\nSHIB, the primary token, serves as a decentralized, community-driven currency that is accessible to millions of users around the world. Launched in late 2020 on the Ethereum blockchain, SHIB has gained international attention and can be used for payments at various locations, either directly or via third-party intermediaries.\n\nBONE, the governance token of the ecosystem, has a total supply of 250 million tokens and allows the Shib Army to engage in decision-making by voting on proposals through the Doggy DAO. BONE also underpins the ecosystem\u2019s proprietary Layer 2 network, Shibarium.\n\nLEASH, with a total supply of 107,646 tokens, rewards the ecosystem\u2019s dedicated supporters by offering exclusive perks and access. LEASH holders have previously enjoyed incentivized BONE rewards for providing liquidity on ShibaSwap, exclusive Shiboshi NFT minting access, and early land sale opportunities in the Shib: The Metaverse project.\n\nShibarium is a Layer 2 blockchain developed to address the limitations of the SHIB token\u2019s host chain, Ethereum, particularly its low speed and high transaction costs.\n\nSHIB influencer Lucie Sasnikova recently explained the workings of the Ethereum-Shibarium Bridge. According to her, the bridge between the two major blockchain networks requires a secure and robust cross-chain solution. Shibarium achieves this through the use of Plasma and PoS security, creating a trustless and bi-directional transaction environment between Shibarium and Ethereum.\n\nThis bridge allows users to transfer tokens between networks without third-party risks or liquidity impacts. It is designed to be fast, cost-effective, and versatile while also serving as a scaling solution. The bridge leverages a dual consensus architecture (Plasma + PoS platform) to prioritize speed and decentralization and enables arbitrary state transitions on sidechains with EVM support.\n\nAs tokens cross the bridge, their circulating supply remains unchanged. When a token leaves the Ethereum network, Shibarium mints an equal number of pegged tokens (1:1). To transfer tokens back to the Ethereum network, they are burned on Shibarium and unlocked on Ethereum during the process.\n\nThe beta test network for Shibarium is named PUPPYNET. As per the blockchain explorer BlockScout, currently (i.e., as of 5:40 p.m. UTC on April 20, the beta version of Shibarium has successfully executed 4,290,709 transactions. Data from this PUPPYNET explorer indicates that the number of wallet addresses utilizing Shibarium beta has reached 13,993,009. Presently, the gas fees are 1.51 Gwei, which is virtually cost-free."

This step takes between one hour and two days, depending on the exchange.\n\nStep 3: Fund Your Account\n\nWhen your account passes the KYC verification process, you are allowed to deposit currency into your account. The advantage of cryptocurrency exchange platforms is that they don\u2019t have a high minimum investment. Most exchanges have fees per trade.\n\nStep 4: Buy Ethereum\n\nThe next step is to start trading Ethereum.

        "content": "Page Summary\n\nWhich altcoins are going to have a good 2023? And what will the future bring? Even in 2023, you cannot ignore Bitcoin, but in this article, we look at altcoins. Read on to find out what the best altcoins to buy in the UAE in 2023 are.\n\nBest Altcoins to Buy in UAE in Overview:\n\nLuckyBlock\n\nOur recommended altcoin to buy this year is LuckyBlock. The team behind this project wants to launch a blockchain lottery, which is more transparent than traditional lotteries. LuckyBlock has a great following on Telegram which consists of over 24,500 followers. LuckyBlock is still in presale at the moment. You can be one of the early investors in LuckyBlock by buying it via PancakeSwap.\n\nEthereum\n\nEthereum is an open-source blockchain network that supports decentralized applications. It also supports other cryptocurrency platforms active in the DeFi industry, such as Aave (AAVE) and Uniswap (UNI). The popularity of DeFi has risen to great heights in recent times. This is due to the fact that it wants to decentralize the world of loans, insurance, and savings programs. Ethereum\u2019s vision is to make these institutions independent from centralized financial institutions and banks. The popularity of DeFi contributes to Ethereum\u2019s strong position in the crypto world. There seems to be no end to that for the time being, which makes Ethereum a very good investment for the coming years.\n\nBuy Ethereum on eToro\n\nSolana\n\nSolana is one of the fastest-growing blockchains and networks. The protocol is able to resolve over 70,000 transactions per second and is better scalable than other blockchain technologies. There is also the possibility to deploy smart contracts on Solana, which makes it a direct competitor of Ethereum in the DeFi space. The biggest reason for investors to invest in Solana is that it doesn\u2019t have the scalability issues Ethereum has.\n\nBuy Solana on eToro\n\nBinance Coin\n\nBinance Coin is the native token of Binance. The more Binance Coins traders have, the fewer transaction fees they have to pay. Binance \u2018burns\u2019 these tokens every quarter, so they become more valuable over time. Binance Coins are like shares in Binance. Apart from this, Binance has its own blockchain, called the BEP-20 Smart Chain. New cryptocurrencies can be launched on this blockchain. This increases the value of Binance\u2019s BNB tokens as they are the only bridging currency. Analysts expect that BNB coins will continue to rise in price for the time being. For this reason, we recommend investing in Binance Coins.\n\nBuy Binance Coin on eToro\n\nPolkadot\n\nMore and more companies, institutions, and projects are choosing Polkadot. This is one of the reasons it\u2019s going to be a huge success in the coming years. Another reason is the interoperability of the platform. Polkadot uses chains called \u201cparachains\u201d. These chains communicate with the main chain called the \u2018Relay Chain\u2019. A special feature of this technology is that these chains connect to chains of other cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. This is possible thanks to so-called \u2018bridges\u2019. Polkadot\u2019s technology is groundbreaking and holds great promise for the future. None of this would have been possible without the \u2018Substrate\u2019 framework. This makes it possible to develop your own blockchain using advanced technology. All blockchains designed using Substrate can be active on the Polkadot network.\n\nBuy Polkadot on eToro\n\nPolygon\n\nPolygon is another protocol that tries to solve Ethereum\u2019s scalability issue. It tries to do this by using Ethereum-compatible blockchains called para chains. If Polygon succeeds in doing so, it will raise a lot in price, like Ethereum. Polygon Studios is somewhat of a side project of Polygon that focuses on the entertainment and media industry. Polygon Studios has partnered up with eDAO to explore the likes of web3 and NFTs.\n\nBuy Polygon on eToro\n\nCosmos\n\nCosmos is an open-source blockchain project that aims to increase the scalability of other blockchains. It tries to do this whilst staying decentralized. Interoperability is the key to the success of this project and if it succeeds in doing so, investors will be rewarded. Users can deploy dApps on Archway, which is Cosmos\u2019 alternative to Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts.\n\nBuy Cosmos on eToro\n\nFantom\n\nThe Fantom Foundation is building a platform that includes fast, scalable, and distributed DAG-based registers that use aBFT principles to achieve consensus. They are also developing a compiler that can authenticate a virtual machine to run the smart contract. It does this with the Lachesis protocol. Fantom is still quite cheap, so early investors can pick up a lot of coins now at bargain prices.\n\nBuy Fantom on eToro\n\nCardano\n\nCardano is an excellent cryptocurrency investment right now for several reasons. First of all, the Cardano blockchain is very secure due to its decentralized nature. The layered architecture meanwhile ensures enough scalability. This gives Cardano enormous potential for the future. Moreover, the project was only launched after extensive peer-reviewed research. So it has a good scientific basis. Finally, the blockchain is stable and very sustainable, as Cardano is unminable. In short: we have high expectations of Cardano. In the coming years, we will see if this crypto lives up to its potential.\n\nBuy Cardano on eToro\n\nDecentraland\n\nVirtual worlds are on the rise. New inventions such as VR glasses contribute to this. You may have heard of Second Life, an online world where you can role-play the life of your in-game character. Decentraland is the virtual world on the blockchain. In this world, users pay with MANA. With this MANA they can buy digital land ownership and services. If you want to invest in the metaverse, Decentraland\u2019s MANA might be your best bet.\n\nBuy Decentraland on eToro\n\nHow to buy altcoins and new cryptos?\n\nYou buy altcoins and new cryptos on cryptocurrency exchanges like eToro.
