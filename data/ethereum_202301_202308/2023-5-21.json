        "title": "Vitalik Buterin urges caution when it comes to re-staking on Ethereum - The Block",
        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin expressed concerns about overcomplicating the Ethereum consensus mechanism beyond its original design, specifically in terms of re-staking.\n\nIn a new blog post, Buterin voiced reservations about initiatives that could unnecessarily introduce risks into the ecosystem and complicate the roles of Ethereum validators beyond their primary duty of verifying the core protocol rules. Buterin was concerned about re-staking, a mechanism being developed by Eigen Layer, among others, which broadens the responsibilities of Ethereum validators to include securing external chains. He was worried that re-staking might introduce risks that could affect the safety of the network.\n\n\u201cWe should tread lightly when application-layer projects aim to extend the \u2018scope\u2019 of blockchain consensus beyond the validation of essential Ethereum protocol rules,\u201d Buterin stated in the post.\n\nIn Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake model, validators are selected based on the number of ether they hold and are willing to stake. The network has the largest validator set among all proof-of-stake chains, both in terms of the number of validator entities and the total value of staked ether, some 18 million ETH (~$34 billion). This considerable size has prompted the development of systems to leverage this network security to secure third-party chains. However, Buterin advocated for a cautious approach.\n\nThe risk of re-staking\n\nButerin noted that while re-staking can be used for low-risk purposes, there are situations where it could compromise the mainnet\u2019s security, such as when Ethereum validators face slashing on third-party chains. Slashing is a punitive measure for validators who engage in undesirable activities, like improperly maintaining their stake or incorrectly processing transactions.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\n\u201cWe should instead preserve the chain\u2019s minimalism and support uses of re-staking that do not seem like slippery slopes towards extending the role of Ethereum consensus,\u201d Buterin suggested.\n\nButerin\u2019s comments elicited responses from Sreeram Kannan, co-founder of Eigen Layer. Kannan agreed with Buterin\u2019s analysis and acknowledged that Eigen Layer should avoid building complex financial primitives with the help of re-staking, as they \u201ccan spiral out of control.\u201d Nevertheless, he stated that re-staking can be used for \u201clow-risk\u201d scenarios.\n\nKannan agreed that Eigen Layer can extend the functionality of validators beyond Ethereum but said these should be developed without the need for \u201cslashing,\u201d which would introduce unnecessary complexity. He further emphasized that Eigen Layer is cautious about not impacting Ethereum\u2019s security in any way, aligning with Buterin\u2019s blog post.\n\nButerin discussed a 2015 proposal from Martin K\u00f6ppelmann, the co-founder of Gnosis, for an \u201cultimate oracle,\u201d deriving security from ETH stake. In the context of smart contracts, oracles are vital as they supply off-chain data. However, Buterin said that if the security of these data feeds were intertwined with Ethereum\u2019s stake, it might contribute to increased complexity.\n\nButerin suggested that such expanded roles or \u201cduties\u201d added to Ethereum\u2019s consensus mechanism could magnify the challenges and risks involved in operating as a validator. He emphasized, \u201cValidators are required to exert significant human effort in terms of monitoring, running, and updating additional software to ensure their adherence to any newly implemented protocols.\u201d"

Additionally, staked Ethereum has only just been released for withdrawal with the Shapella upgrade on April 12.

        "content": "A leaked document distributed to Democratic House Financial Services Committee members has revealed the \u201ckey messages\u201d legislators were advised to keep to, which might result in practically all cryptocurrencies being classified as securities.\n\nAs governments and regulatory agencies impose more robust controls on cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, investors and enthusiasts are left worrying about the potential repercussions.\n\nOne fascinating issue arises: if the price of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) tumbles, will meme currencies become more popular? Will DogeMiyagi ($MIYAGI) become the meme market leader?\n\nFurthermore, would cryptocurrencies in presale garner greater interest because they are untouched by the current market trend?\n\nThe Great Crypto Cliffhanger: Bitcoin\u2019s Precarious Position and Ethereum\u2019s Fate in the Balance\n\nAs the crypto world holds its breath, Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price is perched precariously on a stable support level, making it a compelling opportunity for eager buyers to accumulate. After several failed attempts to break free and soar to new heights, BTC is back at the notorious $27,000 barrier, like a stubborn explorer refusing to surrender to the depths.\n\nOh, the drama! After seven days of relentless selling, Bitcoin\u2019s price has finally taken a break from the madness, settling down for a cosy consolidation around the familiar $27,000 support level. It\u2019s like the calm after a stormy affair, where BTC is catching its breath, unsure of its following path.\n\nWill it sweep Monday\u2019s low at $26,694, teasing us with a swift recovery and reclaiming its support level throne? Or will it succumb to the temptation of becoming a resistance barrier, shattering our bullish dreams and potentially triggering a merciless correction to $25,290 and $23,905 levels? The plot thickens.\n\nMeanwhile, our beloved Ethereum (ETH) has been busy cooking up some technical mischief. Picture this: a bearish divergence sells signal on the daily chart, unfolding its treacherous formation between January 14 and May 13, leaving unsuspecting investors in disbelief.\n\nStory continues\n\nLike a magician revealing their trickery, this wicked move sent ETH on a 17% freefall, leaving it gasping for air at the measly $1,735 mark. But fear not! Hope lies in the mystical realm of critical support floors, and ETH\u2019s saviour awaits at the sacred $1,705 level. If it can summon the strength to bounce back from this abyss, a glimmer of light might shine through, guiding it on a heroic journey towards the superb $2,028 destination.\n\nBut patience, dear investors, patience! Remember, the tale of Ethereum\u2019s fate is yet to be written, and it eagerly awaits Bitcoin\u2019s proclamation of direction. In this mesmerising world of cryptocurrencies, where fortunes rise and fall with the flicker of a digital heartbeat, one thing remains clear: the intricate dance of Bitcoin sets the stage for its companion, Ethereum.\n\nThe Rise of Meme Coins: Exploring the Allure and Potential of DogeMiyagi in the Crypto Market\n\nThe general public is drawn to meme coins because of the possibility of rapid returns and the entertaining and dynamic communities surrounding them. While meme currencies lack the technological complexity and use cases of Bitcoin and Ethereum, their popularity stems from their ease of usage, low cost, and viral growth potential. The current crackdown on mainstream cryptocurrencies may have created a void that meme coins might fill, luring buyers looking for new investment possibilities.\n\nThe presale of meme coins is another important factor in their success.\n\nDuring a market downturn, presale cryptocurrencies provide a unique opportunity for investors. These new currencies are introduced through presales or initial coin offers (ICOs), which allow investors to purchase tokens before they are available on the general market. Because market trends do not yet influence presale coins, they enable investors to enter the market at an early stage.\n\nOverall, coins, let us welcome its highness DogeMiyagi to the meme market podium!\n\nMIYAGI is one of the most recent meme currencies, and it has the potential to become the market leader.\n\nThrough thorough audits, DogeMiyagi proudly emphasises its dedication to identity verification and risk assessment. Its commitment to maintaining a safe environment has won the prestigious Know Your Coin (KYC) accreditation, indicating its commitment to fostering community trust.\n\nDogeMiyagi understands the importance of community involvement and aims to establish an environment that values and benefits all members. DogeMiyagi aspires to stand out in the ever-changing world of cryptocurrencies with its unique features, attention to security and compliance, and commitment to community trust.\n\nDogeMiyagi:\n\nWebsite: https://dogemiyagi.com\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_Dogemiyagi_\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/dogemiyagi"

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin warned in a blog post today that Ethereum\u2019s consensus is fragile and should be used \u201csparingly\u201d because of the high risk of forks in the chain.\n\nButerin wrote:\n\n\u201cThere is a natural urge to try to extend the blockchain\u2019s core with more and more functionality, because the blockchain\u2019s core has the largest economic weight and the largest community watching it, but each such extention makes the core itself more fragile.\u201d\n\nButerin added that we should be wary of projects that seek to increase the \u201cscope\u201d of blockchain consensus to anything other than verifying the core Ethereum protocol rules as this could lead to more \u201cmandates\u201d over time and an increased risk of forking the chain.\n\nEthereum (ETH) has over half a million validators securing the network that have collectively staked 18.5 million ETH, worth more than $34 billion. These validators finalize blocks every 6.4 minutes on the Ethereum network. The process is secured and sophisticated so that the chain recovers to the correct state even if a bug hits or a 51% attack occurs.\n\nStretching the consensus system for other purposes can introduce \u201chigh systemic risks to the ecosystem and should be discouraged and resisted,\u201d Buterin wrote. He added:\n\n\u201cDual-use of validator staked ETH, while it has some risks, is fundamentally fine, but attempting to \u201crecruit\u201d Ethereum social consensus for your application\u2019s own purposes is not.\u201d\n\nButerin further explained that so long as a protocol kept its losses contained to the validators and users in case of a complete collapse, it is \u201clow-risk.\u201d But, if the protocol is designed in a way that the original Ethereum chain has to fork or reorganize to solve its problems, then it is \u201chigh-risk, and I argue that we should strongly resist all attempts to create such expectations,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThere could be a middle ground, Buterin suggested, if protocols in the low-risk category incentivize participants to slide into the higher-risk category. He also suggested using SchellingCoin-style techniques, a consensus mechanism where participants are asked to guess the average value of a certain parameter, like price, and those whose guesses are closest to the average are rewarded.\n\nWhat are the risks of extending Ethereum\u2019s consensus?\n\nAccording to Buterin:\n\n\u201cAs soon as a blockchain tries to \u201chook in\u201d to the outside world, the outside world\u2019s conflicts start to impact on the blockchain too.\u201d\n\nIn other words, if Ethereum validators start voting on things like price oracles that include the currency of a country in the middle of a political crisis, it could lead to a split of the Ethereum chain.\n\nButerin added:\n\n\u201c\u2026once a blockchain starts incorporating real-world price indices as a layer-1 protocol feature, it could easily succumb to interpreting more and more real-world information.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, introducing Layer 1 price indices could change blockchains from neutral technical platforms to explicitly financial tools. This, in turn, could attract legal trouble for blockchains, Buterin said.\n\nFurthermore, it is not just price indices that pose a risk. Buterin wrote:"

        "content": "Over the past week, Ethereum (ETH) has demonstrated remarkable stability in its price movements, in contrast to Bitcoin (BTC), which has experienced a decline and fell below the $27,000 mark. However, it is crucial to note that Ethereum, as the second-largest market capitalization asset, has displayed resilience and exhibited signs of strength during this period.\n\nThis stability in Ethereum\u2019s price suggests a certain level of confidence and investor trust in the asset. It signifies that despite the overall market fluctuations, Ethereum has managed to hold its ground, attracting potential investors and maintaining a relatively steady value.\n\nWith this in mind, Finbold has consulted the machine learning algorithms over at the cryptocurrency analytics and prediction platform Price Predictions, which set the price of ETH at $1,792 on June 1, 2023, according to the latest data accessed on May 22.\n\nETH 30-day price forecast. Source: PricePredictions\n\nThe algorithms, which rely on technical analysis (TA) indicators, such as moving average (MA), relative strength index (RSI), moving average convergence divergence (MACD), average true range (ATR), and Bollinger Bands (BB), predict a decline of -1.3% to Ethereum price at press time, which is price expected to continue gradually decline over the end of the month.\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nCurrently, Ethereum is trading at $1,816, reflecting a slight increase of 0.06% for the day. However, over the course of the week, ETH has experienced a decline of 0.56%. These price movements indicate a relatively stable performance with some downward pressure in recent days.\n\nETH 1-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nAnalyzing the support and resistance levels, we find that $1,720 acts as a crucial support level for Ethereum, indicating a price point where buying interest is expected to be strong and potential downward movements may be limited. On the other hand, $1,894 represents the resistance level, serving as a price point where selling pressure may intensify, potentially limiting upward movements unless surpassed.\n\nIn terms of market capitalization, Ethereum boasts a total market cap of $218.5 billion, highlighting its significant position within the cryptocurrency market.\n\nMeanwhile, the technical analysis over at TradingView suggests a largely bearish sentiment around ETH. Indeed, according to the analysis, the one-day gauges indicate a \u2018sell\u2019 at 10, which is the summary of oscillators in the \u2018sell\u2019 zone at 2, and moving averages with a \u2018sell\u2019 at 8.\n\nETH technical analysis. Source: TradingView\n\nWhether the machine algorithm-based projections come true or ETH manages to turn the tide will depend on its further developments in the space and how long Ethereum can continue to show strength as Bitcoin struggles to break resistance at $27,600.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

The Ethereum co-founder, however, warned against such a notion and explained,\n\n\u201cIt is natural for application-layer projects to attempt such a strategy, and indeed such ideas are often simply conceived without an appreciation of the risks, but its result can easily become very misaligned with the goals of the community as a whole.\u201d\n\nIn the latest blog post titled, \u2018Don\u2019t overload Ethereum\u2019s consensus,\u2019 Buterin offered some potential solutions to address risks such as price oracles, either \u201cnot-quite-cryptoeconomic decentralized oracles\u201d or validator-voting-based oracles that explicitly commit to their emergency recovery strategies being something other than appealing to L1 consensus.\n\nButerin also pointed out that more complex truth oracles could be counted as a solution as the focus would be on reporting facts more subjective than price. He added that it would be \u201csome kind of decentralized court system\u201d built on a not-quite-cryptoeconomic DAO.\n\nMinimizing reliance on cross-chain bridges is also important since these protocols have become an attractive target for malicious entities.\n\nMinimalism\n\nButerin said that any expansion of the \u201cduties\u201d of Ethereum\u2019s consensus triggers an increase in costs, complexities as well as risks of running a validator.

Although these proposals were made in good faith, Buterin warns that this could bring significant systemic risks.\n\nWhile dual use of validator-staked ETH might be fine, he believes that overloading Ethereum's consensus could be dangerous.\n\nButerin cited a series of examples to illustrate his argument, explaining that low-risk scenarios might involve using the status of Ethereum validators for things like social network verification or proving wealth.\n\nHigh-risk scenarios, however, could involve plans to coerce the broader Ethereum community to make changes to solve problems with specific projects. Ultimately, he argues that such high-risk ventures should be strongly resisted.\n\nIn simpler terms, Buterin is cautioning against putting too much pressure on Ethereum's security system, fearing it could buckle under the strain, leading to splits within the community and damaging the very heart of Ethereum.\n\nHe encourages maintaining the blockchain's simplicity, focusing on its core functions, and assisting developers in finding alternative strategies to reach their security goals."

Though both are still down about 3.5% over the period, data from Blockworks Research shows.\n\nStill, BTC is now just 10% ahead of ETH on a year-to-date basis after the former\u2019s decline narrowed the gap with the latter by around 5% in May.\n\nEyeing the value of both assets relative to one another, observers may be drawn to the fact that ether has continued to increase when denominated in bitcoin over the last seven years.\n\nTwo primary factors are likely contributing to Ether\u2019s surge: staking yield and fee burns.\n\nData from Staking Rewards shows the yield from staking, linked to Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism, has resulted in an 8% annual return for staked ETH over the last year.\n\nBitcoin does not provide the same level of rewards as Ethereum, due to its reliance on the proof-of-work consensus mechanism. This mechanism primarily benefits miners, making it arguably less accessible for individuals to participate in.\n\nHaving a PoS yield, a shrinking ETH supply and a smaller \u201ctradable float\u201d due to many ETH being locked and staked are all \u201cextremely bullish properties,\u201d Greg Magadini, head of derivatives at Amberdata told Blockworks.\n\n\u201cWe can see that EIP-1559 and the PoS Merge in September 2022 triggered the highest option open interest ever on Deribit,\u201d Magadini said.\n\nFee burns, enacted via Ethereum\u2019s EIP-1559 update, have also removed more than 3.3 million ETH from circulation since August 2021. Data from Ultrasound Money indicates that this has further driven up the asset\u2019s value.\n\nStill, Ethereum\u2019s new PoS network will need to be tested \u201cin time,\u201d Strahinja Savic, head of data and analytics at capital markets and advisory platform FRNT told Blockworks.\n\nThe budding network will also need to survive many stress tests before new, previously uninvolved, investors begin to become interested in staking, Savic said.\n\n\u201cEthereum has done a great job at capturing the imagination of crypto traders. However, Ethereum faces considerable headwinds right now. Namely, the macro environment is challenging for traditional risk assets,\u201d Savic added.\n\nEven so, Ethereum, which launched six years after bitcoin, is still in a significant growth phase, Danny Chong, CEO of Binance Chain and Ethereum-based DeFi protocol Tranchess told Blockworks.\n\nPointing to ETH\u2019s solid growth, Chong cites its success over other cryptos in recent years as well as its \u201cquick-paced development\u201d and high demand, which sets it up for wider adoption.\n\n\u201cPost Shanghai, with the increase in liquidity and institutional players coming in, Ethereum is showing positive signs of growth,\u201d Chong said.\n\n\u201cDevelopers continue to build on Ethereum, demonstrating confidence that it\u2019s a viable ecosystem for new protocols,\u201d the CEO added. That could lead to the metaverse emerging as a supporting narrative for the continuous development of Ethereum, he noted.\n\nMarket sentiment forecasts an additional 2.5% growth potential for the asset over the next month, while bitcoin\u2019s bull run returns are diminishing, having fallen to 60% since the last run when measured from October 2020 to a peak of over 500% a year later.\n\nChong also foresees market diversification, with Binance Smart Chain as a potential competitor, albeit currently trailing ETH, which leads the DeFi market with a whopping 74% share.\n\n\u201cBinance\u2019s chain still has a lot of catching up to do,\u201d Chong said. \u201cI think that, in the future, people will be looking for diversity and the opportunity to explore other options,\u201d he added. \u201cSo far, the most advanced one we can see is Ethereum.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest digital asset in the cryptocurrency sector, is currently captivating traders\u2019 attention as volatility gauges indicate an intriguing shift in market dynamics.\n\nContrary to the customary pattern, these indicators are suggesting that Ether may experience relatively smaller near-term price fluctuations compared to Bitcoin, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThis unexpected reversal has injected a fresh element of anticipation and curiosity among investors, who are now closely monitoring the evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe Bitcoin Volatility Index. Source: T3 Index.\n\nNarrowing Gap Between Ethereum And Bitcoin Volatility\n\nThe T3 Ether Volatility Index, an innovative tool, lies at the core of this phenomenon. It has emerged as an indispensable barometer for assessing and foreseeing price volatility in the Ether market.\n\nThe data compiled by Bloomberg reveals that the difference in volatility between Ether and Bitcoin, as measured by the 180-day realized or historical volatility, is currently at its smallest since 2020. Furthermore, this difference is only marginally positive, indicating a remarkably close alignment between the volatility of Ether and Bitcoin.\n\nThe Ether Volatility Index. Source: T3 Index.\n\nCaroline Mauron, co-founder of crypto derivatives platform OrBit Markets, told the publication:\n\n\u201cLower volatility typically helps institutional investors to allocate more capital to crypto, as it becomes cheaper to buy protection and manage exposures\u2026 the volatility spread compression may drive more exposure to Ether from long-term investors.\u201d\n\nImplications Of Ethereum Price Fluctuation\n\nThe changing flux of Ether\u2019s volatility behavior have significant implications. Notably, the Bitcoin and Ether implied volatility indexes, which rely on options pricing, have experienced declines after reaching recent highs in March.\n\nHowever, Ether\u2019s implied volatility has decreased at a faster pace. Additionally, a broader measurement of cross-asset fluctuations in global markets has also witnessed a decline.\n\nThe implications of Ether\u2019s changing volatility behavior are multifaceted. The faster decline in Ether\u2019s implied volatility suggests that market participants have become less uncertain or less anxious about the future price movements of Ether compared to Bitcoin. This could be influenced by various factors such as regulatory developments, market maturity, or growing investor confidence in Ether\u2019s long-term potential.\n\nETHUSD trading at $1,812. Chart: TradingView.com\n\nFurthermore, the broader decrease in cross-asset swings indicates a potential reduction in risk aversion among investors, as they perceive a more stable and predictable market environment. This could impact investment decisions and trading strategies, as market participants may adjust their risk management approaches and allocation of resources based on the evolving volatility landscape.\n\nThe changing volatility of Ether, as reflected in the Bitcoin and Ether implied volatility indexes and the broader measure of cross-asset swings, highlight the evolving nature of the cryptocurrency market.\n\n-Featured image from Coinnounce\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Don't Overload Ethereum's Consensus - Delphi Digital",
        "content": "Vitalik released a new blog post yesterday with the title: Don\u2019t overload Ethereum\u2019s consensus. The central point of the article was to highlight that Ethereum cannot allow these re-staking applications to get so big that any sort of exploit or attack would require the Ethereum base chain to fork. I agree with this framing here, but this risk is not just limited to re-staking, there comes a point where any application that uses ETH crosses a barrier where it becomes \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d. But what\u2019s that level?\n\nLSTs: Is stETH too big to fail? stETH accounts for 77% of LSTs on Ethereum and ~31.2% of total stake. Compared to ETH\u2019s circulating market cap, it\u2019s 5.5% of total supply. If stETH were to get exploited (say by a minting bug) would Ethereum hard-fork? What about in a year or two, when stETH is potentially 10%, 15% or even more of Ethereum\u2019s total stake? It\u2019s not just the impact on ETH\u2019s consensus that a stETH attack would have, but the dominoes of being so intertwined in DeFi protocols and could render a large part of Ethereum DeFi insolvent. If stETH becomes TBTF this gives it a structural advantage over other LST options. Would a smaller LST get a bailout? Probably not. What\u2019s the usecase for an index LST if stETH would be bailed out anyways and has the most liquidity? You would be taking on the risk of other LSTs but unchanged if anything happened to stETH. Rollups: Is there a point where a single rollup becomes TBTF? Every rollup has some % of ETH\u2019s total supply in their bridge. Today that\u2019s ~1% of ETH for both Arbitrum and Optimism. At what point would an exploit to their SC bridge require a fork? The DAO forked at ~14% of ETH, so is this the limit? If Arbitrum was exploited, how would the L1 feel, and how would competitors like Optimism feel? Whether you like it or not, you have already seen a social divergence between rollups like Arbitrum and Optimism; they do not share Ethereum\u2019s social consensus, and are often looked at as distinct ecosystems and competitors. I have argued for this reason that you want many rollups on Ethereum in order to mitigate this risk, because at some point they become a liability.\n\nWith more and more off-chain applications relying on Ethereum\u2019s consensus this will become a bigger and bigger topic over the coming years. Vitalik is trying to get ahead of this issue before an actual exploit occurs, but I am not so sure any form of consensus will be determined on these matters until one actually happens. Until then, it is up to everyone using ETH to self-regulate."

        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin price shows some life as the new week kickstarts, suggesting a potential short-term move to the upside.\n\nEthereum price will follow Bitcoin\u2019s footsteps and is likely to revisit the $1,703 and subsequent support levels.\n\nRipple price looks like a rebel but investors should exercise caution considering the uncertain outlook of the market.\n\nBitcoin price is at a stage where if history repeats, it could catch investors off guard. Bulls are likely being set up for a trap, which will cause massive liquidations for holders of Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP) and other altcoins.\n\nAlso read: Ordinals sends LTC and DOGE network activity surging for three straight weeks\n\nBitcoin price action could turn into a fractal\n\nBitcoin price action over the last two months is reminiscent of the moves that occurred between January 20 and March 1. The repeating pattern is termed fractal and can be seen even in the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Awesome Oscillator (AO) momentum indicators.\n\nIf history does repeat, then investors can first expect Bitcoin price to trigger a minor recovery rally to $28,051. This move is \u2018scenario one\u2019 and will push BTC to collect the buy-stop liquidity before, as seen in the chart below. After this liquidity run, sellers are likely to take control and catalyze a steep correction, trapping early and greedy bulls on the wrong side.\n\nThe RSI and AO indicators are perfectly positioned below their respective mean levels for a rejection followed by a pullback. The second leg of scenario one includes Bitcoin price sliding down to tag the support levels at $25,175 and $23,062.\n\nBTC/USD 12-hour chart\n\nThe bullish thesis, or scenario 2 for Bitcoin price, will include BTC invalidating the fractal outlook and flipping the $28,051 hurdle into a support floor. Doing so will pave the way for BTC to tag $30,287.\n\nEthereum price fails to take control\n\nEthereum price has been struggling to move above a critical hurdle at $1,817 for nearly ten days now. Starting this week, investors can expect a minor rally that sweeps the aforementioned level to collect buy-stop liquidity.\n\nThis move is likely to trigger a buying spree from greedy bulls, who are likely to get trapped if Ethereum price suddenly reverses. A subsequent spike in selling pressure could push ETH down to the $1,703 support level. This move would constitute a 6.4% descent.\n\nBut if the selling pressure continues to build, Ethereum price could shatter the $1,703 barrier and visit the support zone, extending from $1,563 to $1,478.\n\nETH/USD 12-hour chart\n\nInvalidation of the bearish outlook for Ethereum price will require a bullish ascent in Bitcoin price in which ETH could flip the $1,817 hurdle into a support floor. In such a case, ETH could attempt to tag the $2,028 resistance level.\n\nRipple price pushes higher for now\n\nRipple price faced rejection at $0.469 after multiple attempts in May. The failure to overcome this blockade has knocked XRP price lower, where it currently trades at $0.463. Going forward, investors can expect the remittance token to sweep the $0.469 hurdle for buy-stop liquidity, but if Bitcoin price collapses midway, the altcoin might also follow suit.\n\nIn such a case, market participants need to focus on Ripple price revisiting the $0.439 and $0.432 levels, which are critical to stopping the downswing. From the current position, this move would constitute a 6.4% descent.\n\nXRP/USD 4-hour chart\n\nWhile the outlook for Ripple price is bearish due to the uncertainty of Bitcoin price, investors need to note that a decisive flip of the $0.469 hurdle will invalidate the bearish thesis. In such a case, XRP price might attempt a retest of the $0.500 psychological level."

        "title": "Is the Ethereum Network Too Slow for it to Surpass Bitcoin? - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "In the world of cryptocurrencies, Ethereum and Bitcoin stand out as the two biggest players and rightly so. With Bitcoin establishing itself as the main player for many in the cryptocurrency space, some commentators are giving their full backing to Ethereum to take the Bitcoin crown as Ethereum, with its smart contract capabilities and expansive ecosystem, has gained significant traction. However, concerns have been raised about scalability and transaction speed, raising the question of whether the Ethereum network is too slow to surpass Bitcoin and reach that top spot. With major developments on the horizon for the Ethereum network the signs are positive for the future, but will they make the difference that is needed? In this article we look at some of the facts in the Ethereum vs Bitcoin debate and let you make up your own mind.\n\nIs the Ethereum Network Really Slow?\n\nOne of the biggest pointers against Ethereum\u2019s speed is its ability to handle large amounts of traffic on the network. As Ethereum gained popularity at the same time as all of the crypto space did, its network became increasingly clogged. And without the right infrastructure in place, this led to higher transaction fees and longer confirmation times slowing down processes for users. During peak periods, such as when popular applications are hammered by heavy usage or during token launches or sales, network congestion can significantly impact transaction speed. This can happen with new token sales or when a certain coin or token experiences a surge in price \u2013 either up or down. Users can keep an eye on coin prices like the Loopring Price to understand these movements and also keep an eye on gas fees and all the latest news in the crypto space to make an educated decision on how to invest or which network to use.\n\nSome lay the blame for the drag on speed at the feet of Ethereum\u2019s current consensus mechanism, otherwise called the Proof of Work, which requires substantial computational resources, leading to slower block validation times. If we look at Bitcoin in comparison, Bitcoin\u2019s Proof of Work algorithm is optimized for security and has a longer average block time, making it less prone to network congestion during high transaction periods. Gas fees can be high and unpredictable, which is a significant issue for Ethereum users. Network congestion can also slow down the network and increase gas fees.\n\nThe good news however is that Ethereum is actively working on ways to improve scalability. The biggest development is clearly the introduction of Ethereum 2.0 and Layer 2 solutions like the Lightning Network. Additionally, Ethereum switched from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake, which, due to the practicalities of the practice, takes far less energy from technology or man. Warehouses full of servers were retired and as a result, the Ethereum coin is gaining speed.\n\nThese developments are still in progress though and until these solutions are fully implemented, Ethereum\u2019s transaction speed may continue to be dragged down. Ethereum 2.0 is being released in phases and while there are still some questions on the effectiveness of the upgrade, many point to this watershed moment as the reason for Ethereum\u2019s potential to surpass Bitcoin. The Ethereum 2.0 upgrade will change the consensus mechanism for Ethereum from a Proof-of-Work to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism with the goal of reducing the amount of computational resources. Shard chains are one of the biggest changes to the 2.0 upgrade that will hopefully have the biggest impact on the network overall.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Growing Ecosystem Drives Innovation\n\nOne of Ethereum\u2019s main strengths is its fantastic ecosystem of applications and smart contracts. This highly developed ecosystem attracts developers and users, fostering innovation and driving adoption. As Ethereum continues to evolve, the demand for its network may increase, spurring the development of scalability solutions and potentially enhancing transaction speeds. With such an active development initiative, the Ethereum community has a vibrant and active developer base constantly working towards improving the network\u2019s performance in the race to beat Bitcoin. This community of developers are dedicated to optimizing the Ethereum blockchain, creating layer 2 solutions, and exploring innovative scaling techniques. Their ongoing efforts indicate a commitment to overcoming the network\u2019s current limitations and enhancing transaction speed.\n\nFlexible for The Future\n\nAlthough there are issues, the good news is that Ethereum\u2019s design allows for easier upgrades compared to Bitcoin. This flexibility for future development provides the potential to bring on new ways of working and as the network evolves, upgrades can be implemented, which of course have the potential to improve Ethereum\u2019s transaction speed. Align this to the dedication and passion of the development community to improve the Ethereum network and the signs are good for the future. Ethereum 2.0, when it arrives, will usher in a brave new world for crypto and blockchain networks, but will it be enough to let Ethereum take over Bitcoin? That remains to be seen but as the popularity of cryptocurrencies continues to grow it will be important for Ethereum to work on its current issues if it is to stand any chance of success.\n\nIn the world of cryptocurrencies, Ethereum and Bitcoin stand out as the two biggest players and rightly so. With Bitcoin establishing itself as the main player for many in the cryptocurrency space, some commentators are giving their full backing to Ethereum to take the Bitcoin crown as Ethereum, with its smart contract capabilities and expansive ecosystem, has gained significant traction. However, concerns have been raised about scalability and transaction speed, raising the question of whether the Ethereum network is too slow to surpass Bitcoin and reach that top spot.

BTC has faced difficulty surpassing the $30,000 mark, while ETH has consistently struggled to exceed $2,000. Surprisingly, holders exhibited stronger convictions than selling off and held onto their assets more firmly.\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum struggle to\u2026\n\nBitcoin breached the $30,000 price zone on the daily timeframe chart around 11 April, but struggled to sustain this level for an extended period. Subsequently, it dropped below $30,000. At press time, it was trading at approximately $26,900, reflecting a small gain.\n\nThe price range tool indicated that BTC has experienced a decline of over 10% since testing the $30,000 mark.\n\nFurthermore, taking a closer look at Ethereum on the daily timeframe showed that it reached the $2,000 milestone in April. Unfortunately, the upward momentum was short-lived, lasting less than six days.\n\nSince then, ETH has been unable to surpass and maintain that price range. As of this writing, it was trading at approximately $1,800, reflecting a minor gain of less than 1%.\n\nSelf-custody on the rise\n\nAs the prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to fluctuate, an increasing number of holders are opting to secure their assets. Recent data from Santiment revealed a decline in the supply of BTC and ETH on exchanges.\n\nThe chart indicated that the current percentage of BTC supply on exchanges was at its lowest since December 2017. Similarly, the percentage of ETH supply on exchanges was the lowest since 2015.\n\nAs of this writing, BTC\u2019s supply on exchanges was approximately 10%, while ETH\u2019s supply was around 5%. This decline in supply on exchanges could signal an anticipated price uptrend and future bull run for both cryptocurrencies.\n\nCurrent Netflow and Funding Rate\n\nAnalyzing the Netflow data of Ethereum on CryptoQuant showed that there has yet to be a substantial flow in recent days. However, there were more outflows than inflows during this period. The Netflow was negative at the time of writing, indicating an outflow of over 14,000 ETH.\n\nOn the other hand, Bitcoin has experienced a more notable flow in recent days, but similar to Ethereum, the dominant trend has been outflows per CryptoQuant. As of this writing, the Netflow for Bitcoin was negative, although there had been minor positive flows on previous days.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nInvestors have maintained a bullish sentiment even with the notable movement of ETH and BTC off exchanges. Data from Coinglass revealed that funding rates for BTC and ETH have consistently been positive across various exchanges.\n\nThis suggested that most investors were placing bets on a future price increase for both cryptocurrencies."

Subsequently, this may encourage players to use TOADS to access the game that\u2019s based on feeding, nurturing, strengthening, and competing with digital toads.\n\nSince TOADS is a deflationary token, DigiToads\u2019 roadmap suggests that the overall supply will gradually decline as more tokens are burnt. This strategy could support TOADS prices over time thereby appealing to investors willing to accumulate and HODL.\n\nIn addition, DigiToads hosts a monthly trade competition called \u201cToad vs. Toad.\u201d These trading competitions will help the DigiToads team find good traders who will contribute to the DigiToads decentralized exchange (DEX), The Trading Post. The DEX will launch soon after the project builds a vibrant community of ToadVestors.\n\nWinners of the monthly trading contest will receive Platinum TOADS. By the end of the year, 12 winners will have been selected.\n\nPlatinum TOADS owners can access one-twelfth of the TOADS treasury and 10% of all profits made on each trade.\n\n>> Buy DigiToads Now <<\n\nEthereum price action\n\nEthereum was trading at $1,797.20 on May 14, 2023, a more than 50% drop from the $4,400 recorded at some point in 2021.\n\nLosses were even deeper in 2022 due to the crypto winter.\n\nHowever, prices has since recovered, bottoming up, catalyzed by the collapse of FTX in November 2022; an event that lifted other top coins, including bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH).\n\nConclusion\n\nAs ETH prices slowly recover, trends show that investors, including retailers and whales, are gravitating towards potential projects that can post big returns in 2023. The surging demand for TOADS even before its official listing, as a result, has grabbed the attention of investors.\n\nThe early success of DigiToads and growing market demand for its native token in the presale phase has made crypto experts believe this project can outperform top coins, including ETH, in the weeks and months to come.\n\nFor more information on DigiToads, visit the website, join the presale, or join the community for regular updates.\n\nDisclosure: This content is provided by a third party. crypto.news does not endorse any product mentioned on this page.

        "title": "What is MetaMask? A Guide to the Most Popular NFT Wallet - NFTevening.com",
        "content": "Welcome to the world of MetaMask, the leading Ethereum wallet that provides you with unparalleled access to the exciting Web3 ecosystem! Whether you\u2019re new to the world of cryptocurrencies or an experienced user, MetaMask empowers you with complete control over your digital assets. Additionally, it serves as a gateway to a multitude of decentralized applications, or dapps.\n\nIn this guide, we will talk through the ins and outs of MetaMask, it\u2019s functionality, and the setup process. Let\u2019s dive into it!\n\nWhat is MetaMask?\n\nMetaMask is a browser plugin that functions as an Ethereum wallet. Significantly, it is seamlessly integrated into your browser like any other plugin. Once installed, MetaMask empowers users to securely store their Ethereum, ERC-20 tokens, and NFTs, enabling hassle-free transactions with any Ethereum address.\n\nWhat Type of Wallet is MetaMask?\n\nMetaMask is a non-custodial Ethereum wallet, which means that it provides users with full control over their funds and private keys. As a browser extension or mobile app, MetaMask allows users to securely store, send, and receive ETH and other Ethereum-based tokens or NFTs. In essence, it acts as a bridge between the user\u2019s web browser and the Ethereum blockchain, enabling seamless interaction with decentralized applications and the broader Web3 ecosystem.\n\nWhat is MetaMask Used For?\n\nMetaMask is primarily used as an Ethereum wallet and a gateway to the decentralized web. However, beyond its role as a wallet, MetaMask serves as a crucial tool for interacting with decentralized applications built on the Ethereum blockchain. By connecting your MetaMask wallet to compatible dapps, you can seamlessly engage in a wide range of activities. You can participate in decentralized finance protocols, such as lending, borrowing, yield farming, staking, and decentralized exchanges. MetaMask also facilitates token sales, enabling users to invest in new projects.\n\nWhat Network is MetaMask On?\n\nMetaMask primarily operates on the Ethereum network. In fact, it is specifically designed to interact with the Ethereum blockchain, enabling users to manage their ETH and other Ethereum-based tokens. Essentially, MetaMask connects users to the Ethereum network, allowing them to access and interact with various decentralized applications and smart contracts built on Ethereum.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that MetaMask also supports other networks and blockchain protocols. Users can switch between different networks within MetaMask to connect with alternative blockchain ecosystems. Additionally, MetaMask has expanded its support for some other blockchain networks, like Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, and more.\n\nHow to Get Started With MetaMask\n\nSetting up MetaMask is a quick and easy process. To get started, make sure you have either Chrome, a Chromium-based browser like Brave, or Firefox, installed on your computer. Then, follow these steps:\n\nDownload and install the official MetaMask extension for your chosen browser. You can find it in the browser\u2019s extension store. The setup is similar for all browsers. Once installed, click the \u2018Get Started\u2019 button, then click \u2018Create a Wallet\u2019. You\u2019ll be asked if you want to help improve MetaMask. Choose \u2018No Thanks\u2019 or \u2018I agree\u2019 based on your preference. Then, set a password for your wallet. Make sure to choose a strong, unique password containing a mix of upper and lowercase letters, symbols, and numbers. Read and accept the Terms of Use, and click \u2018Create\u2019 to proceed. MetaMask will display a 12-word backup phrase. Write down this phrase carefully, in the same order as shown on the screen. It\u2019s crucial to keep this backup phrase safe and secure as it can be used to recover your wallet. Anyone with access to the backup phrase can access your funds, so store it in a secure place. After noting down the backup phrase, click \u2018Next\u2019. On the following screen, enter the words of the backup phrase in the same order as before to confirm. Click \u2018Confirm\u2019 when finished. Then, click \u2018All Done\u2019 on the final page, and you\u2019ll be automatically logged into MetaMask.\n\nWith these steps, you\u2019ve successfully set up MetaMask and can now use it to manage your Ethereum wallet and interact with decentralized applications.\n\nWhat is My MetaMask Secret Recovery Phrase?\n\nKeep your secret recovery phrase private and secure as it plays a vital role in your MetaMask wallet. It serves as a unique identifier for your account and enables you to regain access in case of a lost device or account recovery. Safeguarding your recovery phrase is of utmost importance to ensure the security and integrity of your wallet.\n\nPlease note that you should never, ever share your secret recovery phrase with anyone or enter it on any website or application other than the official MetaMask interface. Keeping your recovery phrase safe and confidential is essential to maintaining the security of your funds.\n\nWhat is My MetaMask Wallet Address?\n\nYour MetaMask wallet address is unique to your wallet and serves as a public identifier for receiving cryptocurrency transactions. It is a long string of alphanumeric characters starting with \u201c0x\u201d.\n\nTo find your MetaMask wallet address, you can open your MetaMask extension or application and navigate to the account or wallet section. There, you should see your wallet address displayed. If you are using the MetaMask extension, you can typically find it by clicking on the MetaMask icon in your browser toolbar and then clicking on your account name or avatar.\n\nHow do I Transfer Crypto and NFTs on MetaMask?\n\nTo transfer crypto and NFTs on MetaMask, follow these steps:\n\nOpen your wallet by clicking on the MetaMask extension or application icon in your browser toolbar. Click on the \u201cSend\u201d button to initiate a transfer. Enter the recipient\u2019s wallet address in the designated field. Double-check the address to ensure it is correct, as transactions on the blockchain are irreversible. Specify the amount of crypto or the NFT you want to transfer. Ensure you have sufficient balance or ownership of the NFT for the transfer. If you\u2019re transferring cryptocurrency, you may need to adjust the gas fee or transaction fee. You can set it manually or use the suggested fee provided by MetaMask. Review the transaction details, including the recipient\u2019s address, the amount, and the transaction fee. Make sure everything is accurate before proceeding. Click the \u201cConfirm\u201d or \u201cNext\u201d button to finalize the transfer. MetaMask will display a summary of the transaction, including the transaction hash (TxHash) that you can use to track the status on the blockchain. Once the transaction is confirmed, the crypto or NFT will be transferred to the recipient\u2019s wallet.\n\nPlease note, it\u2019s important to exercise caution when transferring crypto or NFTs and double-check all details before confirming the transaction. Additionally, be mindful of gas fees and ensure you have enough balance to cover the transaction and fee.\n\nIs MetaMask Safe?\n\nMany consider MetaMask to be safe when used properly and with appropriate security measures in place. Significantly, it provides you with direct control over your private keys and enhances the security of your funds. Additionally, it encrypts your private keys with a password known only to you, adding an extra layer of protection.\n\nWhat Happens if I Get Scammed on MetaMask?\n\nIf you find yourself scammed, it\u2019s crucial to act promptly to minimize potential losses. Take immediate action by halting any further transactions and reporting the incident to MetaMask support and any other platform involved. Secure your account by changing your password and enabling two-factor authentication. You can also review your transaction history to identify any unauthorized activity and report it to the relevant authorities. While recovering stolen funds can be challenging, taking these steps and staying vigilant can help protect yourself from scams in the future.\n\nIs There a MetaMask Airdrop?\n\nActually, no. Although airdrops and snapshots are common in Web3, MetaMask took to Twitter to debunk the rumors. In fact, the company emphasized that these rumors are not only untrue but also dangerous. They create opportunities for scammers and phishers to trick unsuspecting users into revealing their private keys or other sensitive information. It\u2019s crucial to be aware of these deceptive tactics and exercise caution to protect yourself.\n\nAlternatives to MetaMask\n\nThere are several alternative wallets that you can consider for managing your crypto assets. Firstly, renowned crypto exchange Coinbase, developed the Coinbase Wallet. It offers a secure way to store and manage your digital currencies. Another option is the Brave Wallet. Crypto-powered browser Brave developed this wallet and seamlessly integrated into the browser itself. It provides a convenient and user-friendly experience for managing your crypto holdings. MyEtherWallet is also a popular choice, offering an online wallet that allows you to store and transact with Ethereum coins and ERC-20 tokens. It offers a range of features and functionality to enhance your crypto experience. Exploring these alternatives can help you find the wallet that best suits your needs and preferences.\n\nTo sum up, MetaMask is a powerful Ethereum wallet and gateway to the decentralized web. It provides users with full control over their digital assets, seamless interaction with decentralized applications, and secure storage for Ethereum, ERC-20 tokens, and NFTs. With MetaMask, you can confidently explore the world of cryptocurrencies and take advantage of the numerous opportunities offered by the Web3 ecosystem."

        "title": "Bitcoin, Ethereum bears are back in control, 2 derivatives metrics suggest - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "A bearish market structure has been pressuring cryptocurrencies\u2019 prices for the past six weeks, driving the total market capitalization to its lowest level in two months at $1.13 trillion. According to two derivatives metrics, crypto bulls will have a hard time to break the downtrend, even though analyzing a shorter timeframe provides a neutral view, with Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and BNB, on average, gaining 0.3% between May 12 and May 19.\n\nTotal crypto market cap in USD, 12-hour. Source: TradingView\n\nNotice that the descending wedge formation initiated in mid-April could last until July, indicating that an eventual break to the upside would require an extra effort from the bulls.\n\nFurthermore, there\u2019s the impending U.S. debt ceiling standoff, as the U.S. Treasury is quickly running out of cash.\n\nEven if the majority of investors believe that the Biden administration will be able to strike a deal before the effective default of its debt, no one can exclude the possibility of a government shutdown and subsequent default.\n\nGold or stablecoins as a safe haven?\n\nNot even gold, which used to be considered the world\u2019s safest asset class, has been immune to the recent correction, as the precious metal traded down from $2,050 on May 4 to the present $1,980 level.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin, gold and the debt ceiling \u2014 Does something have to give?\n\nCircle, the company behind the USDC stablecoin, has ditched $8.7 billion in Treasurys maturing in longer than 30 days for short-term bonds and collateralized loans at banking giants such as Goldman Sachs and Royal Bank of Canada.\n\nAccording to Markets Insider, a Circle representative stated that:\n\n\u201cThe inclusion of these highly liquid assets also provides additional protection for the USDC reserve in the unlikely event of a U.S. debt default.\u201d\n\nThe stablecoin DAI, managed by the decentralized organization MakerDAO, approved in March an increase to its portfolio holdings of the U.S. Treasurys to $1.25 billion to \u201ctake advantage of the current yield environment and generate further revenue.\u201d\n\nDerivatives markets show no signs of bearishness\n\nPerpetual contracts, also known as inverse swaps, have an embedded rate that is usually charged every eight hours.\n\nA positive funding rate indicates that longs (buyers) demand more leverage. Still, the opposite situation occurs when shorts (sellers) require additional leverage, causing the funding rate to turn negative.\n\nPerpetual futures accumulated 7-day funding rate on May 19. Source: Coinglass\n\nThe seven-day funding rate for BTC and ETH was neutral, indicating balanced demand from leveraged longs (buyers) and shorts (sellers) using perpetual futures contracts. Curiously, even Litecoin (LTC) displayed no excessive long demand after a 14.5% weekly rally.\n\nTo exclude externalities that might have solely impacted futures markets, traders can gauge the market\u2019s sentiment by measuring whether more activity is going through call (buy) options or put (sell) options.\n\nBTC options volume put-to-call ratio. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe expiration of options can add volatility to Bitcoin\u2019s price, which resulted in an $80-million advantage for bears in the latest May 19 expiry.\n\nA 0.70 put-to-call ratio indicates that put option open interest lags the more bullish calls and is, therefore, bullish. In contrast, a 1.40 indicator favors put options, which can be deemed bearish.\n\nThe put-to-call ratio for Bitcoin options volume has been below 1.0 for the past couple of weeks, indicating a higher preference for neutral-to-bullish call options. More importantly, even as Bitcoin briefly corrected down to $26,800 on May 12, there was no significant surge in demand for the protective put options.\n\nGlass half full, or investors prepping for the worst?\n\nThe options market shows whales and market makers unwilling to take protective puts even after Bitcoin crashed 8.3% between May 10 and May 12.\n\nHowever, given the balanced demand on futures markets, traders seem hesitant to place additional bets until there\u2019s more clarity on the U.S. debt standoff.\n\nLess than two weeks remain until June 1, when the U.S. Treasury Department has warned that the federal government could be unable to pay its debts.\n\nRelated: U.S. debt ceiling crisis: bullish or bearish for Bitcoin?\n\nIt is unclear whether the total market capitalization will be able to break from the descending wedge formation. From an optimistic perspective, professional traders are not using derivatives to bet on a catastrophic scenario.\n\nOn the other hand, there seems to be no rationale for the bulls to jump the gun and place bets on a speedy crypto market recovery, given the uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment. So, ultimately, bears are in a comfortable place according to derivatives metrics.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations. Every investment and trading move involves risk, and readers should conduct their own research when making a decision."

        "title": "After Prolonged Consolidation for ETH, is $2.1K Still Possible? (Ethereum Price Analysis) - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Ethereum has been struggling with the 100-day moving average, which stands at $1772, for an extended period. However, the price action at this crucial level has not yet clearly indicated any upcoming direction. A breakout, on the other hand, has the potential to trigger an immediate cascade.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nFollowing a short-term consolidation phase, the price experienced a decline toward the 100-day moving average of $1.7K. The recent PA of Ethereum has failed to deliver a definite direction, with the price consolidating and printing very small green and red candles. This has left the market in extreme uncertainty.\n\nNonetheless, the cryptocurrency faces two critical support levels: the 100-day moving average at $1772 and the substantial support region at $1.7K. Therefore, if $1.7K prevents a further decline, there is potential for a rally aiming for the resistance area at $2.1K.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nOn the 4-hour timeframe, the price has continued its bearish trend towards the support region at $1.7K. However, after reaching this level, it formed a slight bounce and entered a consolidation state characterized by very small candles.\n\nMeanwhile, a descending wedge pattern can be observed in the 4-hour timeframe, with the price currently consolidating within the narrow range. The wedge\u2019s lower trendline coincides with the significant support region at $1.7K, making it a powerful level.\n\nUltimately, a downward break of the support zone at $1.7K and the lower boundary of the descending wedge could trigger a cascade as long positions get liquidated and selling pressure soars. Conversely, if the price finds support, it could potentially aim for the mid-boundary of the channel and even the resistance region at $2.1K."

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of the Ethereum blockchain platform, is the latest casualty in the dramatic collapse of crypto fortunes.\n\n\u201cI'm not a billionaire anymore,\u201d Buterin, 28, wrote Friday in a Twitter post.\n\nButerin created Ethereum in 2014 and is the owner of a digital wallet that as recently as November contained holdings worth about $1.5 billion. Since then, the price of the Ether token that's associated with the blockchain has fallen by 55%.\n\nButerin has previously suggested he'd welcome lower prices of digital coins, telling Bloomberg News in February: \u201cThe people who are deep into crypto, and especially building things, a lot of them welcome a bear market.\u201d\n\nCrypto holdings have been pummeled by a steep drop in prices of digital currencies and the turmoil engulfing the algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD and its Luna token. Changpeng Zhao, founder of the crypto exchange Binance, has seen more than $80 billion -- or 84% of his wealth -- evaporate this year, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nSome ultra-wealthy crypto backers have professed humility amid the upheaval. Michael Novogratz, founder of crypto merchant bank Galaxy Inc., acknowledged that TerraUSD was \u201ca big idea that failed.\u201d Others, including the Winklevoss twins, have insisted that their investments are long-term.\n\n\u201cIt's all about perspective and HODLing for the long game,\u201d Cameron Winklevoss tweeted on May 12, using an acronym for \u201chold on for dear life.\n\nAs the pandemic raged through India last year, Buterin donated more than 50 trillion Shiba Inu coins to a Covid-19 relief fund in that country. The coins, which are a meta joke about the dog-themed digital coin Dogecoin, would have been worth more than $1 billion at the time.\n\nButerin's donation represented more than 5% of the total Shiba Inu coins in circulation and sent prices tumbling about 50%.\n\nIn a separate tweet Friday, Buterin talked about the tradeoffs between \u201copen-mindedness\u201d and \u201cpassion,\u201d while expressing support for the blockchain he helped create.\n\n\u201cNote to trolls: no, ethereum was not a mistake,\u201d he wrote."

CTO Paolo Ardoino added that the integration will ensure greater financial inclusion as Strike recently expanded to 65 additional countries.\n\nThe Strike mobile payments app was only available in a handful of countries like the U.S. and El Salvador.\n\nBy combining the stability and utility of Tether\u2019s digital currency with Strike\u2019s innovative payment solutions, users will experience a new era of secure and efficient transactions. This collaboration signifies a significant leap toward mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies, as it addresses several key challenges faced by the industry.\n\nTether\u2019s Bitcoin Bag\n\nThe Strike integration comes on the back of the company\u2019s Bitcoin accumulation strategy for its stablecoin reserves. At the end of Q1 2023 in March, Tether\u2019s quarterly attestation revealed that the company held a massive $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin, along with other assets like Gold and short-term treasury bills.\n\nIn addition, Tether said it would start buying more Bitcoin starting in May. The company will allocate 15% of net realized operating profits toward strengthening its BTC reserve. The extra Bitcoin will serve as an extra cushion to USDT\u2019s reserves that the payments company claims are 100% backed."

        "content": "Buyers showcased their skills in the battle with sellers last week, achieving a positive weekly closing with a modest gain of 0.29%. However, it\u2019s worth noting that Ethereum (ETH) frequently encounters a barrier at the $1,840 resistance level, which limits further upward movement.\n\nLast week, bulls observed an inside candlestick formation, resulting in insubstantial gains. It still outperformed Bitcoin\u2019s bearish weekend, establishing Ethereum (ETH) as a reliable digital asset in the current market scenario.\n\nPresently, the Ethereum price remains positioned below the 100-week simple moving average but above the 20, 50, and 200 SMAs. The 20-SMA (black line) serves as an immediate support level for long-term prospects, while buyers can also find support close to the $1,740 mark. Conversely, the Money Flow Index (MFI) reached 53 zones during the decline, indicating a consistent outflow of funds from the market.\n\nSource: Santiment\n\nBased on Sentiment Statistics, speculators witnessed the lowest volume of the month on May 20, which amounted to $2.92 billion. However, there has been a gradual increase in volume since then. In fact, the trading volume has already risen by 19.9% overnight, reaching $3.78 billion.\n\nA Closer Look at The Current Market Landscape\n\nAs of now, Ethereum is being traded at $1,810 and has been confined to a narrow trading range. However, the ascending support trendline is poised to provide a boost to the bullish trend if buyers manage to break through the current sideways zone.\n\nThe current price of ETH, may cross the resistance trendline, as bulls are exhibiting strong resilience using the critical support level of the 100-day SMA. Once the bullish hurdle at $1,840 is surpassed, the next potential target on the trend is the significant psychological level of $2,000.\n\nWhen analyzing the daily price chart, we can observe that the MFI is gradually approaching a declining trend line. Simultaneously, the RSI is on the cusp of surpassing the immediate resistance level.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the RSI is exhibiting a bullish divergence, indicating a potentially positive signal. As the MFI is yet to shift in favor of the bulls, traders should exercise a cautious stance in the market."

        "content": "In the past, major precious metals have been viewed by investors as safe-haven assets during the development of financial crises. However, the rise of digital financial technology has given rise to a new type of digital gold: Bitcoin. This was highlighted by a recent analytical review by Bitcoinist experts who compared the dynamics of gold, Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nWhile gold prices are up 9 percent this year, bitcoin is up more than 70 percent, according to the analysis. Despite the U.S. banking crisis, Bitcoin has continued to gain momentum, rising 30% in the past week alone, from $19,000 to $28,500.\n\nEthereum, on the other hand, has lagged behind, with prices up just 13% over the past seven days.\n\nExperts from Bitcoinist point out that more and more investors are considering investing in the cryptocurrency space these days.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s rise as digital gold is due to its scarcity, decentralization, and security. These factors, along with a growing number of institutional investors, have contributed to the incredible growth in the value of cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhile cryptocurrencies and their mining are certainly risky, the potential rewards are enormous. With the right knowledge and resources, it is possible to generate substantial profits and benefit from the growth of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nIf you want to try Bitcoin mining \u2013 it would be wise to focus on accumulating affordable mining hashrate before the price starts to rise. You can now choose your bitcoin mining contract in Idmining.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how the dynamics of gold, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies evolve over time as the world continues to embrace digital financial technologies. Invest in Bitcoin while it is still cheap to get into Bitcoin mining and avoid future regrets for missed opportunities.\n\nWhat are the main advantages of investing in cloud mining contracts:\n\nWhen investing in BTC, you need to understand fundamental analysis to know when is the best time to buy or sell cryptocurrency. Cloud mining all but eliminates this need for investors. When buying a cloud contract, the revenue becomes passive: the company takes over the maintenance, repair and tuning of the mining machine, while the client simply withdraws the profit; Miners can hedge risk by selling BTC during growth and buying new contracts when the price drops (and becomes cheaper), or simply store the cryptocurrency in a secure wallet until growth resumes; Also, under the current blockchain hash rate conditions, when you buy a mining contract, it turns out that the BTC price will be lower than the price you buy on a crypto exchange. If you invest $2,000, you can only buy 0.13 BTC for this amount. But you can mine twice that amount \u2013 0.3 BTC for the same amount of money.\n\nTherefore, investing in cloud mining is more flexible, profitable and secure, especially in the long-term.\n\nA legitimate cloud mining business was established in the UK in 2016 under the name IDMining. Like any legitimate hash provider, IDMining has commercial properties with a sizable tech park of specialized Bitcoin mining equipment.Brazil & Windhoek & Kazakhstan all have data center locations. Nowadays, IDMining pays out cryptocurrencies to more than 4,90K users from around the world.\n\nFeatures:\n\nSign up to get $5 immediately.\n\nAutomated daily payouts.\n\nNo overhead or electricity fees.\n\nAn affiliate program with 3% lifetime rewards.\n\nDifferent Crypto contracts to choose from.\n\nDDos and SSL protect the system.\n\n24-hour online support.\n\nNew Crypto Mining Plans\n\nContract Price Contract Terms Fixed Return $100 1 Day $100+$2 $300 3 Days $300+$20.7 $800 7 Days $800+$140 $1300 15 Days $1300+$546 $8200 40 Days $8200+$10496 $15800 60 Days $15800+$29388\n\nFor more IDMining details, please visit https://idmining.com/\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "ERC-20 Tokens are Going to Rule the Cryptocurrency Market? - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "ERC-20 tokens have multi-chain capabilities and can be utilized with several wallets\n\nERC-20 tokens are going to rule the cryptocurrency market: When Ethereum was launched back in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin and his team, it hardly gathered any attention. Over the years, the Ethereum network has become a formidable force in the global cryptocurrency market that powers other cryptocurrencies, virtual machines, dApps, and other decentralized services. Its protocol ERC-20 is known to have powered several leading crypto tokens like Shiba Inu and Tether.\n\nThe ERC-20 protocol is popular among developers because of the ease with which it can be customized and managed. Next, as Ethereum is compatible with multiple blockchains, ERC-20 has multi-chain capabilities and can be used with several wallets. It allows developers to create smart-contract-enabled tokens that can be used with other products and services. These tokens are a representation of an asset, right, ownership, access, cryptocurrency, or anything else that is not unique in and of itself but can be transferred.\n\nWhat is ERC-20?\n\nERC-20 is the standard protocol for fungible tokens made with the Ethereum blockchain. A token that can be swapped with another token is said to be \u201cfungible.\u201d ERC-20 enables the exchange of various smart-contract-enabled tokens. Tokens are a way to represent an asset, cryptocurrency, or anything else that isn\u2019t unique but can be transferred from one entity to another.\n\nHere are the top 5 ERC-20 tokens that are going to rule the cryptocurrency market:\n\nTether (USDT)\n\nIn the world of cryptocurrencies, Tether was launched in 2014 as a platform that issues blockchain assets linked to the value of government monies. Consequently, it created USDT, the first and still most widely used stablecoin. Since then, others have been added, and Tether currently supports the Chinese Yuan (CNHT), the Euro (EURT), a stablecoin linked to an ounce of gold (XAUT), and the USDT token.\n\nIt should be noted that Tether\u2019s value has occasionally fluctuated away from the currency it is pegged to, but its popularity should reassure investors that this doesn\u2019t happen often. In times of volatility, such as now, a Tether token is a recommended addition to a portfolio.\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB)\n\nShiba Inu is a decentralized cryptocurrency named after a breed of Japanese dog. It was launched in 2020 by an anonymous developer called Ryoshi and was designed to see what would happen if a cryptocurrency was entirely run by a community.\n\nLike other meme coins, SHIB tokens are prone to volatility. A tweet from a celebrity can significantly impact price. However, the community is large and engaged, the price has risen considerably since launch, and the ecosystem benefits from being on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe Sandbox (SAND)\n\nThe Sandbox is a decentralized \u2018gaming metaverse\u2019 built on the Ethereum blockchain where users buy virtual plots of land and then create experiences and games on them that can be shared with others. The platform lets users create games \u2013 which they can monetize \u2013 and build structures, items, and even 3D creatures, all of which they own and can trade or sell through the use of NFTs.\n\nThe platform uses three core elements. The first is the Voxel Editor, which lets people build models and animate them. Then there is the Marketplace, where people can trade in-game tokenized NFT ASSETS that they or others have made. Finally, there\u2019s the Game Maker, where users can build 3D games on their land using ASSETS.\n\nAave (AAVE)\n\nThe Aave platform directly connects crypto borrowers and lenders without needing an intermediary. It does this by using a system of smart contracts that automatically execute transactions based on software.\n\nThe advantage of using liquidity pools is that users can borrow different cryptocurrencies. For example, someone could add ETH to a pool and borrow an equivalent value of MANA or DAI. Similarly, lenders can add a variety of assets to a liquidity pool and earn interest.\n\nWrapped Bitcoin (wBTC)\n\nWrapped Bitcoin was developed to act as a bridge and facilitate transactions between Bitcoin and Ethereum. It allows Bitcoin users to access the growing Ethereum ecosystem of decentralized finance applications. It also provides more liquidity for Ethereum-based dApps.\n\nUntil the Wrapped Bitcoin project was established, there weren\u2019t many bridges linking Ethereum and Bitcoin, the two largest cryptocurrencies. The price of wBTC is backed by BTC at a 1:1 ratio, so it is directly affected by fluctuations in Bitcoin price.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "EDCON 2023 is here, and time and time again, Ethereum has showcased its importance to the crypto industry and the DeFi ecosystem at large \u2013 to be more than a cryptocurrency. The ongoing EDCON 2023 in the beautiful city of Podgorica, Montenegro, is in high focus on the possibilities Ethereum has to offer to the general crypto market and beyond.\n\nAs one of the largest gatherings of the Ethereum and blockchain communities, the EDCON 2023 (Community Ethereum Development Conference) started on May 19 and ends on May 23, 2023.\n\nEDCON 2023 \u2013 what is happening?\n\nEDCON is a non-profit annual global Ethereum conference held in various countries. 2017\u2019s EDCON was held in Paris, 2018\u2019s in Toronto, 2019\u2019s in Sydney, Australia, 2020-2021\u2019s online, and 2022\u2019s at the Chase Center in San Francisco. EDCON is dedicated to servicing the Ethereum ecosystem by enhancing the global communication and interaction of Ethereum communities.\n\nSource; Ethereum \u2013 EDCON 2023\n\nEDCON 2023 features keynote addresses, technical seminars, and panel discussions on Blockchain Regulation, Layer 3, Decentralized Society, Decentralized Governance, and the Network State, amongst others.\n\nEDCON 2023 has assembled the brightest minds of the Ethereum community, including Vitalik Buterin (co-founder of Ethereum), Balaji Srinivasan (author of the Network State), Scott Moore (co-founder of Gitcoin), Primavera De Filippi (Blockchain researcher at CNRS and the Berkman Klein Center at Harvard University), Tim Beiko (Ethereum Foundation), Barry Whitehat (Ethereum Foundation), Cy Li (Director of De University of Ethereum), among others.\n\nIn addition, the conference will feature an Ethereum Quorum day, a Community Event day, and a Super Demo competition, affording ample opportunities for collaboration and discussion.\n\nENS Layer 2 and offchain data support\n\nEDCON 2023 has taken a keen interest in Layer 2 solutions and how they impact the overall financial market. And as information would have it, with the proliferation of layer 2 solutions for Ethereum that are starting to mature, it\u2019s important that ENS provides resolution services across the ecosystem and allow ENS users to take advantage of layer 2 solutions\u2019 efficiencies.\n\nThe ENS team and the wider ENS and L2 community have been developing a general-purpose \u201cLayer 2 bridge\u201d that enables cross-platform interoperability between ENS and other applications that require the ability to retrieve data from a variety of offchain sources (any data that resides outside of the Ethereum Mainnet, also known as layer 1/L1).\n\nThis includes both proprietary database and layer 2/L2 solutions (e.g., Optimism, Arbitrum, Starkware, ZKSync, etc.) developed in a trustless manner and produced standards.\n\nThis definition is broader than what most people would consider \u201cLayer 2\u201d; it also includes other methods of reducing onchain data storage, such as airdrops that use merkle trees of account balances and tokens that emit events but do not store account balances onchain.\n\nIn a world with a plethora of different, incompatible layer 2 solutions, the key problem for ENS and many other applications is how to retrieve data from one of these systems in a way that is trust-minimized \u2014 that is, it does not introduce any new trust assumptions \u2014 without the application having to act as a client of each layer 2 solution that could potentially store data of interest to it.\n\nThe EIP 3668 \u2013 allows for transparent offchain (including Layer 2/L2) data lookups and allows contract authors to implement whatever validation is required; in many cases, this can be provided without any additional trust assumptions beyond those required if data is stored onchain.\n\nThe ENSIP 10 \u2013 is a general method for resolving wildcards (for example, *.foo.eth) on L1. Issuing subdomains and resolving the parent name offchain allows dApps to create subdomains offchain while still making them available via L1.\n\nThe ENSIP 10 \u2013 is a general method for resolving wildcards (e.g., *.foo.eth) on L1. Issuing subdomains and resolving the parent name offchain enables dApps to create subdomains offchain while still making them available via L1.\n\nBenefits of ENS L2 Offchain\n\nENS is a decentralized naming system built on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to associate human-readable names with Ethereum addresses and other decentralized resources.\n\nENS L2 Off-Chain support enables developers to interact with ENS records and perform various operations without directly accessing the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nBy leveraging Layer 2 solutions, developers can significantly reduce transaction costs, enhance the user experience by improving transaction speed, and alleviate network congestion on the Ethereum mainnet. ENS L2 Offchain also offers compatibility with existing ENS functionality, allowing seamless integration with DApps built on Layer 2."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2018s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, has issued a warning to the Ethereum community regarding potential threats to the network\u2019s consensus.\n\nEthereum\u2019s crypto-economic consensus is robustly fortified, with a staggering $34 billion worth of ETH actively validating blocks every 6.4 minutes. Buterin cautions, however, against the misuse of the consensus system, especially in scenarios where its stability could be jeopardized.\n\nVitalik Buterin on misusing the Ethereum consensus system\n\nProposals have been advanced over time suggesting alternative uses for Ethereum\u2019s validator set and social consensus.\n\nSome of these concepts include \u2018ultimate oracle\u2019, a voting system based on ETH where the majority gets rewarded with the minority\u2019s share; and \u2018re-staking\u2019, a system allowing Ethereum stakers to use their stake as a deposit in another protocol.\n\nButerin, however, cautions against certain techniques he sees as potentially hazardous to Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem. The co-founder firmly warns against \u201crecruiting\u201d Ethereum\u2019s social consensus for individual applications\u2019 purposes.\n\nMisuse of social consensus in this way, he argues, may lead to systemic risks and jeopardize the integrity of the entire ecosystem. Therefore, he suggests the community should be cautious about these actions and actively discourage them.\n\nHighlighting different examples, Buterin makes a clear distinction between harmless re-use of validators and potentially dangerous overloading of social consensus. In one example, he describes a low-risk scenario where a Web3 social network verifies its users by requiring proof that they control an Ethereum validator\u2019s key.\n\nConversely, he highlights a high-risk situation where project leaders for a similar protocol expect the Ethereum community to hard-fork and delete malicious validators. In this case, the broader Ethereum ecosystem is roped into solving the problems of one application, which Buterin considers a high-risk strategy.\n\nThe dangers of stretching Ethereum consensus\n\nButerin further illustrates the pitfalls of stretching Ethereum\u2019s consensus with a hypothetical situation set in 2025. A new ETH/USD price oracle is introduced, with validators voting on the price hourly.\n\nTo incentivize active participation, the system heavily penalizes votes that deviate significantly from the median retrospective vote.\n\nIn this scenario, despite initial resilience and stability, a political crisis in Brazil in 2034 creates a split in the consensus due to differing perspectives on the legitimacy of two opposing political factions.\n\nAs a result, Ethereum, designed as a refuge from geopolitical issues, finds itself at the mercy of a single nation\u2019s internal issues.\n\nButerin argues that a blockchain\u2018s \u201cpurity\u201d is a significant advantage. As soon as a blockchain tries to incorporate real-world factors, it opens itself up to the conflicts and instabilities of the external world.\n\nThe co-founder stresses that the Ethereum community should resist attempts to incorporate real-world indices into the blockchain\u2019s protocol.\n\nThe best way to counter these problems, according to Buterin, is through case-by-case solutions. For example, price oracles could either be non-cryptoeconomic decentralized oracles or validator-voting-based oracles that have predefined recovery strategies.\n\nMoreover, he suggests Layer 2 protocols should rely on multiple proving systems, while cross-chain bridges should be minimized as much as possible. Buterin also proposes a move away from independent chains entirely, in favor of validiums anchored into Ethereum.\n\nThe warning from Buterin is timely and provides the Ethereum community a chance to address these potential risks and ensure the stability and integrity of the Ethereum network.\n\nWith his insights, Ethereum\u2019s stakeholders are better equipped to safeguard the network and its consensus system against manipulation and misuse.\n\n**You can read Vitalik\u2019s blog post here."

        "title": "Ethereum Client Nimbus Releases Pruning Update Following Vitalik Buterin's Roadmap Revision - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "Ethereum consensus layer client Nimbus has announced the release of the v23.5.1 update, mainly focusing on improving compatibility and introducing support for incremental pruning in response to the recent changes made to the Ethereum Roadmap by co-founder Vitalik Buterin. This medium-urgency update targets validators, clients, and node operators, aiming to enhance the overall performance of the ETH network.\n\nPruning is a process that involves erasing older data to optimize disk space utilization. By implementing incremental pruning, Ethereum clients can efficiently manage their storage needs while still maintaining the necessary historical data required for network operations. Although the \u2013history: prune option is not enabled by default in the current release, Nimbus encourages users to test it in non-production environments, as it will be enabled by default in the subsequent update.\n\nThe release of this update follows recent finality issues experienced by the Ethereum network, which were attributed to the lack of comprehensive pruning measures. These issues prompted ETH clients to swiftly release critical updates to mitigate resource usage challenges faced by Beacon Chain nodes during turbulent times.\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s Pruning Addition to the Ethereum Roadmap\n\nIn 2022, Ethereum co-founder and developer Vitalik Buterin introduced the concept of pruning to the Ethereum Roadmap. Buterin emphasized the importance of pruning for scalability, decentralization, and the ease of running nodes on the Ethereum network. By implementing pruning, nodes no longer need to store vast amounts of historical data, thereby promoting network sustainability.\n\nPruning also allows clients to remove unnecessary code that processes historical blocks, further optimizing performance. With the upcoming updates, ETH client releases will enable pruning functions by default, reinforcing the network\u2019s commitment to improving scalability and resource management.\n\nNimbus, a validator client for ETH, has also implemented an additional feature that actually prevents under-specified beacon node URLs without a port number or protocol scheme from being accepted. This enhancement aims to ensure the security and stability of the Ethereum network by enforcing stricter validation criteria.\n\nOther Improvements and Market Overview\n\nIn addition to incremental pruning and improved compatibility, the v23.5.1 update for Nimbus brings several enhancements. These include the introduction of withdrawal addresses as the default for fee recipient addresses and support for the upcoming Capella hard fork in the Gnosis network. These improvements demonstrate the ongoing efforts to enhance the functionality and user experience of Ethereum clients.\n\nIn terms of market performance, the price of ETH currently hovers around $1814, displaying a sideways trend over the past 24 hours. The trading range for the same period reflects a 24-hour low of $1,812 and a high of $1,829. Weekly price movement has also remained stagnant due to market uncertainty, reflecting the cautious sentiment among investors.\n\nAs Ethereum continues to evolve in line with the ETH Roadmap, client updates such as the one released by Nimbus contribute to the network\u2019s overall performance, scalability, and decentralization. The inclusion of pruning measures and other improvements ensures a more sustainable and efficient Ethereum ecosystem for users and developers alike.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe release of the v23.5.1 update by Ethereum client Nimbus marks an important milestone in the ongoing development and improvement of the Ethereum network. With the addition of incremental pruning and enhanced compatibility, Nimbus aims to address the challenges faced by the network, particularly in terms of scalability and resource management."

        "content": "Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin shared concerns regarding restaking\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\nVitalik Buterin shared his views on the risks that come with restaking.\n\nThe Ethereum founder also shared concerns about overcomplicating the network\u2019s consensus mechanism.\n\nNEW DELHI (CoinChapter.com) \u2014 Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin believes restaking and other such ventures might overcomplicate the platform\u2019s consensus mechanism. In particular, Buterin expressed concerns about ETH restaking.\n\nRestaking allows users to stake assets they receive in exchange for staking ETH on platforms like Lido. In a blog post, the Ethereum founder shared his concerns, highlighting several use cases that could risk the Ethereum network, including restaking.\n\nButerin clarified that he was fine with the \u201cdual-use of validator staked ETH,\u201d but to use Ethereum\u2019s social consensus for another application might invite trouble.\n\nVitalik Buterin warned that restaking could overload Ethereum\u2019s consensus mechanism.\n\nFor example, Buterin noted a scenario where eCash switched to proof of stake and allowed users to duel stake. However, the protocol expects Ethereum to undergo a hard fork if validators decide to harm the protocol.\n\nWhile it might sound good, Ethereum has multiple L2 blockchains running on top of it. As a result, if a number of them face problems, the Ethereum ecosystem would be split into multiple chains due to the hard forks.\n\nFurthermore, Buterin highlighted that global political events could also force a hard fork in the chain. The Ethereum founder cited a possible scenario where political interest in Brazil led to the creation of two CBDCs on different chains.\n\nAs soon as a blockchain tries to \u201chook in\u201d to the outside world, the outside world\u2019s conflicts start to impact on the blockchain too Buterin noted\n\nMoreover, re-staking, even in low-risk situations, might culminate in a situation that compromises the Ethereum main net\u2019s security.\n\nIncidentally, restaking protocol Eigen Layer\u2019s founder Sreeram Kannan welcomed Buterin\u2019s thoughts, calling the post an \u201cexcellent analysis of the different kinds of risks\u201d involved in restaking.\n\nETH Price Continues To Consolidate\n\nMeanwhile, ETH price has been consolidating above $1,800 as bulls aggressively defend the 100-day EMA (blue wave) support level near $1,770. Moreover, the lack of volatility in Ethereum\u2019s price action indicates indecision amongst market participants.\n\nETH price faces trouble breaking above the 20-day EMA (red wave) and 50-day EMA (purple wave) resistance confluence. However, needling above the confluence resistance might help the Ethereum token price rally to $1,870.\n\nETHUSD daily chart with RSI. Source: Tradingview.com\n\nBreaking and consolidating above the immediate resistance level could see ETH price challenge resistance near $1,970 before downside corrections pare gains.\n\nConversely, a breakdown from the consolidation level might result in the ETH price dropping to its 100-day EMA support level. Breaching the immediate support level could result in the Ethereum token price testing support near $1,680 before recovering.\n\nThe RSI for ETH remained neutral, clocking at 45.69 on the daily charts."
