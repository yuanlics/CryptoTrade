        "title": "What's a Better Buy: Ethereum or Solana? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Since Ethereum (ETH -0.11%) was created in 2015 it has radically altered the cryptocurrency landscape. Thanks to an innovation known as smart contracts, developers could create blockchain-based applications that automatically run and transfer value when certain criteria are met.\n\nInitially, Ethereum was the only smart-contract-capable blockchain, but in recent years this has changed. New blockchains have come into existence that not only offer smart contract functionality, but also a slew of other features hoping to build off of Ethereum.\n\nOne of those blockchains is Solana (SOL -2.87%), a blazingly fast smart contract blockchain that has a considerable user base and is the 10th most valuable cryptocurrency by market cap. Many believe Solana could eventually outdo Ethereum as the premier smart contract blockchain, but those hopes might be greatly inflated.\n\nA looming problem\n\nFirst, let's address the elephant in the room: Solana's multiple outages. Over the past year, Solana has experienced at least six network outages, including the most recent one in February where the blockchain was down for more than 18 hours, disrupting a number of exchanges and apps running on the network.\n\nIn contrast, Ethereum has a proven track record of stability and reliability. Ethereum's network has been operating smoothly for years, even with the increasing demand for decentralized applications and smart contracts.\n\nThe undisputed DeFi champ\n\nAnother key factor to consider when comparing Ethereum and Solana is the total value locked (TVL) metric. TVL is an important measure of the adoption and usage of a blockchain in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi). Since DeFi functionality is one of the primary use cases for both Ethereum and Solana, evaluating TVL can be an easy way to compare the two.\n\nEthereum utterly dominates the decentralized finance (DeFi) market with a TVL of more than $31 billion, compared to Solana's TVL of just over $292 million. That means Ethereum supports 100 times more value in DeFi than Solana. Clearly, the competition isn't even close and demonstrates the greater adoption and usage of Ethereum's network in the DeFi market. From this perspective, Ethereum is a much more attractive investment option for those looking to tap into the growing DeFi niche.\n\nSpeed isn't everything\n\nFans of Solana often say that it has some of the fastest transaction speeds. While this is true, it distorts the purpose of a blockchain. One of the primary reasons blockchain technology is so profound is because it allows users to transfer value in a decentralized and secure fashion. While Solana prioritizes speed, it sacrifices higher levels of decentralization and security found in Ethereum.\n\nAlthough many are quick to point out that Ethereum moves at a snail's pace compared to Solana, they also fail to realize that there is serious progress being made to narrow this gap thanks to new solutions known as Layer 2s.\n\nThrough the use of Layer 2 solutions such as Optimism, Polygon, and Arbitrum, Ethereum is transformed into a lightning-fast network, while also maintaining its decentralized and secure nature. As these solutions continue to be developed and adopted, Ethereum's competitive advantage over Solana will likely become even more apparent.\n\nThe big picture\n\nSo, what does this mean for investors looking to pick between Solana and Ethereum? Although Solana may seem like a tempting option with its impressive speed, the lack of value it supports in DeFi and the sacrifices in decentralization and security make it a riskier investment, especially considering it still remains down more than 90% from its all time high.\n\nEthereum, on the other hand, has a proven track record and a solid foundation in the decentralized finance market. Its market dominance, along with the development of Layer 2 solutions, makes it a safer and more promising investment for those looking for long-term growth."

        "content": "Ether, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, has been the subject of much discussion recently. While its status appeared to be settled by the SEC\u2019s staff some time ago, the recent transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism has apparently given the current SEC Chair, Gary Gensler, an opportunity to re-examine the token.\n\nGensler is adamant that the crypto industry has been given perfect clarity on such matters, and has repeatedly declared that the rules for what constitutes a security are absolutely clear, transparent, and not open to interpretation.\n\nSo, is Ether, or ETH, a security, a commodity, or something else?\n\nLuckily we have gathered together all the experts who\u2019ve clearly answered this thorny question, in Blockworks\u2019 Ultimate Guide to Regulatory Clarity.\u2122\n\nWilliam Hinman, Director of the Division of Corporate Finance at the SEC, June 2018:\n\n\u201cBased on my understanding of the present state of Ether, the Ethereum network and its decentralized structure, current offers and sales of Ether are not securities transactions.\u201d\n\nLetitia James, New York Attorney General, March 2023:\n\n\u201cThe Tokens [including ETH] are securities because they each involve investments of money into a common enterprise with the expectation of profits due to the managerial efforts of the Tokens\u2019 respective founders, developers, and management teams.\u201d\n\nAlso Letitia James, New York Attorney General, March 2023:\n\n\u201cUnder both state and federal authority, ETH, LUNA, and UST are commodities.\u201d\n\nJay Clayton, Chair of the SEC, March 2019 (reinforcing Hinman, above):\n\n\u201cA digital asset may be offered and sold initially as a security because it meets the definition of an investment contract, but that designation may change over time if the digital asset later is offered and sold in such a way that it will no longer meet that definition.\u201d\n\nRostin Behnam, Chair of the CFTC, May 2022:\n\n\u201cI can say for sure Bitcoin, which is the largest of the coins and has always been the largest regardless of the total market cap of the entire digital asset market capitalization, is a commodity. Ether as well. I have argued this before, my predecessors as well said it is a commodity.\u201d\n\nGary Gensler, Chair of the SEC, April 2023 (refusing to answer the actual question):\n\n\u201cUmmm, I\u2026 I\u2026 it\u2019s\u2026 actually all securities are commodities under the Commodity and Exchange Act, it\u2019s that we\u2019re excluded commodities, but I would agree that a security cannot also be an excluded commodity and an included commodity.\u201d\n\nNow it\u2019s time for your multiple choice test. Based on the statements above, select one answer.\n\nEther is not a security Ether is a security Ether is both a security and a commodity Ether was a security, but now it isn\u2019t Ether is a commodity Gary Gensler is making it up as he goes along All of the above\n\nClear enough for you?\n\nThanks to Planet Crypto for this week\u2019s illustration.\n\nA version of this op-ed first appeared in Blockworks\u2019 newsletter: Subscribe below.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Shibarium: Shiba Inu's Blockchain - DailyCoin",
        "content": "The upcoming Shibarium launch marks a critical turning point for Shiba Inu (SHIB). It signifies a long-awaited moment for the SHIB Army, when their beloved cryptocurrency evolves from a canine meme coin into a fully-fledged blockchain.\n\nShibarium promises to be the Shiba Inu community\u2019s home in the Web3 world. It represents the fulfillment of Ryoshi\u2019s vision and solidifies the Shiba Inu ecosystem. Led by Shytoshi Kusama, the Shib Army will finally leave Ethereum (ETH) forever and forge its own destiny with lower fees and newfound scalability.\n\nWhat exactly is Shibarium? What does this historic launch mean for SHIB holders, and what awaits the Shiba Inu community in this brave new world?\n\nWhat Is Shibarium?\n\nShibarium is a Layer-2 solution built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. Since Shiba Inu was first created back in 2020, the growth of its ecosystem has been restricted by Ethereum\u2019s scalability issues.\n\nHigh gas fees and slow network transactions on Ethereum have made dApps like ShibaSwap challenging to use, discouraging crypto newcomers from exploring Shiba Inu\u2019s potential.\n\nWith Shibarium, this is all set to change. By launching its own network, the Shiba Inu community will be able to grow its flourishing ecosystem without being inhibited by Ethereum\u2019s limitations.\n\nThe Shibarium blockchain will be faster and cheaper than Ethereum while still enjoying the base network\u2019s security.\n\nHow Does Shibarium Work?\n\nThe Shibarium blockchain uses a new consensus mechanism called Proof-of-Participation. In a PoP network, validator nodes are selected for verifying transactions and securing the network based on the number of BONE tokens they hold. This makes it far more energy efficient than Proof-of-Work chains like Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nLike most Ethereum Layer 2 networks, Shibarium will also operate an EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine), allowing developers to easily deploy Ethereum-based smart contracts and dApps on the new network.\n\nMoreover, Shibarium developers intend to create a permissionless bridge between the two networks, making it easy to migrate Shiba Inu tokens from Ethereum to Shibarium.\n\nShibarium History: The Story So Far\n\nRyoshi, the founder of the Shiba Inu, teased the idea of an entire blockchain dedicated to the community as far back as May 2021. In the now-deleted blog post, Ryoshi envisioned a network where developers and users could create and explore applications that would expand the Shiba Inu ecosystem.\n\nShytoshi Kusama, the lead developer, has kept information about the development of Shibarium behind closed doors. The blockchain has been in the works for years, with the secrecy and mystique only adding to anticipation and excitement.\n\nThat all changed in March 2023 with the release of the Shibarium beta testnet. Nicknamed Puppynet, the test network is open to the public. This allows every member of the Shib Army to test dApps and products and deploy smart contracts in a risk-free environment.\n\nThe Shibarium puppynet is expected to be the final step in the development process before the official mainnet launch of the Shibarium blockchain.\n\nThe Shibarium Launch\n\nOn August 16, 2023, it finally happened. Shytoshi Kusama, the Shibarium development team, and the SHIB Army had poured years of blood, sweat, and tears into the iconic network. While Shibarium went live as expected, the architects behind Shiba Inu\u2019s blockchain underestimated the demand.\n\nAmidst the excitement of Shibarium\u2019s launch, extreme demand sent the network into a fail-safe \u2018pause\u2019 state, effectively halting the network. As expected, this outage caused fear, uncertainty, and doubt throughout the Shiba Inu community. Who\u2019d have thought that after months of testing, Shibarium wouldn\u2019t be able to handle the influx of users on launch day?\n\nShytoshi Kusama wasted no time in running community damage control, announcing in a blog post that there were no inherent technical issues with Shibarium or the bridge to the network. The outage was a simple security feature designed to protect users if the network was overwhelmed.\n\nWhile the Shibarium development team had expected a surge of users on launch day, the reality was that they simply didn\u2019t purchase enough monthly compute units from Alchemy, their blockchain architecture provider.\n\nBased on testing, Shibarium is expected to need no more than 400 million monthly compute units. When the Shibarium launch expended over 160 million compute units in just half an hour, it became evident that Shibarium might be on track to become one of the most popular and active Layer 2 networks in the industry.\n\nThe Shibarium Bridge \u2013 Locked Funds\n\nEven after the halted network and ripples of FUD throughout the Shiba Inu community, the launch day drama was far from over. Wanting to be among the first to use Shibarium, hundreds of SHIB Army warriors attempted to bridge their funds to the network as quickly as possible.\n\nEager users were left wanting after the technical difficulties caused funds to be stuck in the Shibarium bridging contract with no means of escape until the network resumed. Over 1,000 ETH and 600,000 BONE were locked away and inaccessible, waiting for Shibarium to restart.\n\nIn typical Shytoshi fashion, the lead developer quickly put the community\u2019s mind at ease. He guaranteed the SHIB Army that there were no faults in the bridging contract and insured all locked funds if there are ongoing difficulties after Shibarium kicks into action.\n\nWhat Can I Do On Shibarium?\n\nIf you\u2019re familiar with Ethereum and any other Layer 2 networks built on top of it, like Arbitrum, Shibarium will offer a very similar experience. In the true spirit of a decentralized and permissionless blockchain, everyone will have complete freedom to create an application that they believe will bring value to the Shiba Inu community and ecosystem.\n\nDeFi\n\nDecentralized Finance on Shibarium will likely begin with ShibaSwap, Shiba Inu\u2019s native DEX. Users can trade cryptocurrencies through on-chain liquidity pools, taking advantage of Shibarium\u2019s high network speeds and low transaction fees.\n\nOther DeFi apps, like lending platforms, will bring greater liquidity to all tokens in the Shiba Inu ecosystem, like BONE, LEASH, and TREAT. The creativity of developers within the Shib Army only limits the potential for DeFi growth on Shibarium.\n\nShibarium NFTs\n\nThe Shibarium blockchain will provide a native home for all Shiba Inu ecosystem non-fungible tokens. NFT collectors will be able to buy and sell their favorite pieces without paying the prohibitive gas fees typical on Ethereum.\n\nThis isn\u2019t limited to current collections like Shiboshis and SHIB Metaverse Land Plots. Shibarium allows the Shiba Inu community to launch their own NFT collections and contribute to the ecosystem.\n\nShibarium MetaVerse\n\nSHIB: The Metaverse is an immersive virtual world where the Shib Army can gather to play and create Shiba Inu-inspired games, build digital businesses and show off their digital identity. It aims to create a digital environment that the SHIB community will call home.\n\nDeveloped using Unreal Engine 5.1, SHIB: The Metaverse is visually stunning. The virtual landscape features various Hubs and allows every user to create dynamic, customizable Avatars to explore the space.\n\nThere are 100,595 land plots in the SHIB metaverse, with each plot having various development and characterization options. Owners can do whatever they please with their virtual real estate, like opening digital stores or hosting events.\n\nShiba Inu Tokens\n\nThe Shiba Inu ecosystem is home to a range of digital assets, each serving a different purpose. Let\u2019s break down the role and utility of all the cryptocurrencies underneath the Shiba Inu umbrella.\n\nSHIB \u2013 The OG itself, SHIB, is the cornerstone of the Shiba Inu ecosystem.\n\nBONE \u2013 BONE plays a crucial role in the Shibarium network. It\u2019s the native gas token of the network, meaning it\u2019s needed to pay transaction fees on the Shibarium blockchain and can be staked to validator nodes to secure the network and create new blocks.\n\nLEASH \u2013 LEASH is a rewards token previously used to incentivize liquidity provision on ShibaSwap and give holders early access to SHIB Land Sales.\n\nTREAT \u2013 Still unreleased, TREAT is another rewards token to be distributed to BONE stakers and validators once they reach certain milestones.\n\nSHI \u2013 The native stablecoin of the Shibarium blockchain, SHI will be pegged to $1 and by a hedge against crypto market volatility.\n\nWhat Does Shibarium Mean for SHIB?\n\nThe launch of Shibarium is expected to be a positive catalyst for the growth of Shiba Inu. The network brings a wealth of utility to the entire ecosystem and gives the Shib Army a place to call home.\n\nPerhaps the biggest impact that Shibarium will have on the SHIB token will be felt through its unique burn mechanism.\n\nThe SHIB Burn\n\nSHIB has the largest token supply of any cryptocurrency on the market, with a total supply of one quadrillion tokens. While more than half of these tokens have already been burned, the Shibarium blockchain will introduce a creative new burn mechanic to permanently remove SHIB tokens from circulation and increase their scarcity.\n\nWhen transactions are processed on the Shibarium blockchain, 70% of every transaction base fee will be collected and stored in a locked contract. These fees are collected in BONE, the gas token of the network.\n\nOnce $25,000 worth of BONE has been accumulated, the Shiba Inu community can open the Burn Portal and initiate the token burn process. BONE is sent to the Ethereum Mainnet, which automatically trades to buy SHIB tokens, providing additional buy pressure. The smart contract then sends all the purchased SHIB to a burn address, making SHIB a deflationary asset in perpetuity.\n\nShibarium Pros & Cons\n\nThe Shibarium launch is arguably the most significant event in Shiba Inu\u2019s history, apart from perhaps the disappearance of Ryoshi. Its success or failure will have an enormous impact on the future of SHIB. Let\u2019s take a quick look at the benefits and drawbacks of the Shibarium network.\n\nPros\n\nScalability \u2013 Shibarium will be significantly faster and cheaper than Ethereum, making it far more accessible for most users.\n\nCompatibility \u2013 The network will be EVM compatible, making it easy for developers to port over Ethereum-based contracts and build a rich ecosystem of dApps quickly.\n\nBrings new utility to Shiba Ecosystem tokens \u2013 All Shiba Inu digital assets, including NFTs, will gain exciting new cases.\n\nSHIB Burn \u2013 The SHIB burn rate is expected to positively impact SHIB tokenomics, reducing the token supply and providing constant buy pressure to SHIB.\n\nSeparates SHIB from other meme coins \u2013 The launch of Shibarium gives SHIB new use cases and a far richer ecosystem than alternative meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE).\n\nCons\n\nLayer-2 competition \u2013 Between Arbitrum, Polygon zkEVM, and zkSync, the Ethereum Layer-2 race is brutal. From what we know of Shibarium before its launch, there is nothing to indicate it has superior technology than its better-resourced competitors.\n\nUncertainty around performance \u2013 Key metrics when analyzing the performance and capabilities of a network, like transaction throughput and finality, are still unclear.\n\nLack of incentives \u2013 Other new networks with more resources offer ecosystem grants to encourage developers to build dApps on their chain. Shibarium is yet to offer any funding for developers, meaning we might not see a great range of applications when the network eventually launches.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nOne thing that cannot be overlooked is the strength and tenacity of the Shib Army. Their enormous social media presence and community spirit have previously overcome all kinds of fear, uncertainty, and doubt.\n\nEven if Shibarium falls short of expectations and is technically inferior to alternative Layer 2s, Shiba Inu\u2019s resilient community will probably still use it. It\u2019s an extension of their culture and story, which, for the Shib Army, might be a stronger pull factor than blockchain performance.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nThe Shibarium launch is a massive milestone for Shiba Inu and its community. Shiba Inu is one of the largest cryptocurrencies in the space in terms of market cap, and the success or failure of Shibarium will likely have a domino effect of similar coins in the market.\n\nFAQs"

        "content": "Leading stablecoin issuer Tether minted 1 billion USDT tokens on the Ethereum network earlier today as Bitcoin dropped below $28,000. Confirming the new mint in a tweet, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, Paolo Ardoino, stated that it was done for inventory replenishment.\n\nArdoino further noted that the replenishment was authorized but not issued. He explained that the minted USDT would be used as inventory for the \u201cnext period issuance request and chain swaps.\u201d\n\nTether\u2019s USDT stands as the biggest stablecoin in the crypto world, as it has maintained a level of stability in recent times amidst the banking system uncertainty that affected Circle\u2019s USDC. USDC depegged from its 1:1 dollar valuation last month following exposure to Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s liquidation.\n\nTether Shows Ethereum Dominance\n\nUSDT has dominated every stablecoin on the Ethereum network, owning a majority of US-pegged tokens on the blockchain. With over 35 billion tokens on Ethereum, USDT is miles away from its counterparts on the network.\n\nTether\u2019s closest competitor in terms of presence in the Ethereum network is USDC, which has nearly 30 billion minted in the blockchain. Paxos-issued BUSD, which has stopped minting, has less than seven billion tokens on the Ethereum network.\n\nTether\u2019s dominance in the market translated to its balance sheet as the stablecoin posted a $700 million profit in the first quarter of this year, matching the figures it posted in the last quarter of 2022. Ardoino claimed USDT is the safest asset in the world to hold, an ego boasted by the consistency of Tether for some time now.\n\nNot Just on Ethereum\n\nThe dominance of Tether is not just tied to the Ethereum network but to multiple chains in the crypto industry. USDT constitutes over 81.5 billion dollar-pegged tokens, the biggest by a huge margin. Second to USDT is Circle\u2019s USDC, which does not have up to 30 billion dollar-pegged tokens.\n\nAn interesting report from BDC Consulting also shows that Tether\u2019s supply correlates with Bitcoin\u2019s price. According to the report, if Tether were to depeg, Bitcoin and other crypto assets would come crashing down.\n\nYour crypto deserves the best security. Get a Ledger hardware wallet for just $79!"

        "title": "Bitcoin and Ethereum won't make you a millionaire, but AI crypto certainly can - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "As the popularity of cryptocurrency continues to grow, many people are wondering if they should invest in Bitcoin or Ethereum. While these two cryptocurrencies have been around for some time and have seen significant growth, they may not be the best investment options for those looking to make a quick profit. However, a new type of cryptocurrency known as AI crypto is rapidly gaining attention as a potentially lucrative investment opportunity. In this article, I will explore the world of cryptocurrency, examine Bitcoin and Ethereum, and discuss the potential of AI crypto investment.\n\nIntroduction to Cryptocurrency\n\nCryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security. It operates independently of a central bank and can be used to buy goods and services or traded for other currencies. The first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, was created in 2009 by an unknown person or group under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Since then, thousands of other cryptocurrencies have emerged, including Ethereum, Litecoin, and Ripple.\n\nUnderstanding Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are two of the most well-known cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is the first and most popular cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization of over $1 trillion. It is a decentralized currency that operates on a peer-to-peer network and is created through a process called mining. Ethereum, on the other hand, is a decentralized platform that enables the creation of smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps) through its native cryptocurrency, Ether.\n\nWhile both Bitcoin and Ethereum have seen significant growth over the years, they may not be the best investment options for those looking to make a quick profit. The volatility of the cryptocurrency market means that prices can fluctuate wildly in a short amount of time, making it a risky investment for those without a high tolerance for risk.\n\nIs Bitcoin a Good Investment?\n\nBitcoin has been around for over a decade and has seen significant growth in its value. However, whether or not it is a good investment depends on a variety of factors. While some investors believe that Bitcoin is a safe investment due to its limited supply and increasing demand, others argue that it is too volatile and risky.\n\nOne of the main drawbacks of investing in Bitcoin is its volatility. The value of Bitcoin can fluctuate wildly in a short amount of time, making it difficult to predict its future value. Additionally, Bitcoin is not backed by any government or financial institution, which means that it is not subject to the same regulations and protections as traditional investments.\n\nHow to Mine Ethereum\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, Ethereum cannot be mined using traditional mining methods. Instead, it uses a process called proof-of-stake (PoS) to create new Ether tokens. PoS is a more energy-efficient and cost-effective method of creating new tokens compared to proof-of-work (PoW), which is used by Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nTo mine Ethereum, you need to join a mining pool or set up your own mining rig. A mining pool is a group of miners who combine their computing power to increase their chances of earning Ether. Setting up your own mining rig can be expensive and time-consuming, but it gives you more control over the mining process.\n\nWhat is AI Crypto?\n\nSome AI crypto uses algorithms to analyze market data and make predictions about future market trends. Avorak AI is one of these projects. They allow investors to make more informed decisions about when to buy and sell their investments. Additionally, AI crypto is designed to be more resistant to market manipulation and fraud, making it a potentially safer investment option.\n\nInvesting in AI Crypto\n\nAvorak provides heavy incentives for holding AVRK. The revenue model, which gives 49% of all revenue back to holders, creates a truly passive income. Unlike the \u2018passive income\u2019 tokens of the past couple of years that simply minted the token into the ground pretending to be yield, the revenue comes from the product itself, meaning there is no inflation to the token.\n\nConclusion: The Future of Cryptocurrency\n\nCryptocurrency is still a relatively new and rapidly evolving technology. While Bitcoin and Ethereum have seen significant growth over the years, they may not be the best investment options for those looking to make a quick profit. However, AI crypto is rapidly gaining attention as a potentially lucrative investment opportunity.\n\nInvesting in AI crypto could bring the kind of gains buying early into Bitcoin and Ethereum gave. Avorak bringing new technologies to blockchain makes it a prime target for investors, and they are raising capital fast. Getting in before the launch will guarantee lower prices and help investors on the ladder to be ready for the climb to the top.\n\nWant to learn more about Avorak AI?\n\n\n\nWebsite: https://avorak.ai\n\nBuy AVRK: https://invest.avorak.ai/register\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Best Crypto For Maximum Gains - 1 BTC or 32 ETH?? - Altcoin Buzz",
        "content": "The heavyweight showdown. The top 2 projects. Bitcoin and Ethereum. Which do you prefer? Which would you rather hold? That\u2019s our topic today. 1 BTC or 32 ETH.\n\nMost of us can\u2019t hold both as the cost is over $90,000. So most of us have to make a choice. Who do you think will win, bitcoin or ethereum? Let\u2019s find out.\n\nAdvantages of Buying 32 ETH\n\nThis argument starts with the fact we cover altcoins here.\n\nKing of Alts\n\nWe aren\u2019t called Bitcoin Buzz, but Altcoin Buzz. So, 32 ETH is the amount you need if you want to run your own validator. That would increase your returns too.\n\nCost/Value\n\nNext, 32 ETH costs more than 1 BTC. Right now, at $1865, 32 ETH costs $59,680. Bitcoin\u2019s current price is $27,625. This means 32 ETH costs twice as much as 1 Bitcoin. Does that mean ETH is more valuable? Or more scarce? Not necessarily.\n\nEthereum has almost 227 million unique addresses. The circulating supply is 120.4 million. That means the average holding per address is 0.52 ETH. And like many projects, they are top-heavy. ETH is more top-heavy than most.\n\nThe top 100 holders hold 39% of all the ETH. That means many of these 227 million holders hold very small amounts of ETH.\n\n10/ In the previous quarter, @Binance consolidated its wallets, which led to a spike in the number of active wallets. As a result, the average number of daily active addresses on #Ethereum saw a decline of 4% to 425K. pic.twitter.com/suMZSTlv61 \u2014 Messari (@MessariCrypto) April 21, 2023\n\nEcosystem\n\nOn the ecosystem, Ethereum wins hands down. Way more apps, protocols, volume, and fees than Bitcoin\u2019s ecosystem. Does this high concentration of ETH ownership concern you? Or not? Let us know in the comments below.\n\nDisadvantages of Buying 32 ETH\n\nNow for the anti-Ethereum side. Despite being #2 overall and the clear leader in DeFi and NFTs, Ethereum still sucks to use. And I am DEFINITELY NOT exaggerating when saying that. It could very easily lose its #2 position:\n\nCosmos has better-integrated apps and protocols.\n\nBNB Smart Chain is faster with lower fees.\n\nBitcoin is more secure.\n\nSolana is gaining ground fast on NFTs.\n\nPolygon\u2019s user experience exceeds Ethereum in every way.\n\nETH has near total reliance on L2s for using apps.\n\nEthereum\u2019s place as the silver to Bitcoin\u2019s gold is far from secure. Do you know what else never happens on Bitcoin? This. Last week, it was this $25 million exploit by someone attacking MEV bots. Ethereum is full of hacks, exploits, and security leaks.\n\nThat is the reality. And that NEVER happens with Bitcoin or its ecosystem. Never has. Extremely difficult to do with such high hash rates. Ethereum leads now but it has LOTS of competition.\n\nPolygon, which has its own sidechain and L2 solutions for ETH, just passed Ethereum in a number of daily active addresses for the first time. Ethereum is far more centralized than people want to admit.\n\nDaily Active Addresses within Ethereum's L2s Abritrum 24%\n\nOptimism 2.6%\n\nzkEVM 1.3%\n\nzkSync 71% pic.twitter.com/WKlv6CwdmD \u2014 Emperor Osmo\ud83e\uddea (@Flowslikeosmo) April 20, 2023\n\nFirst, we have a high concentration of ownership as mentioned earlier. Then there is the 70% premine that took place at its creation. Lastly, we\u2019ve already seen that the ETH Network can censor transactions at the US Government\u2019s request. It is definitely not a censorship-resistant network. Governments don\u2019t fear Ethereum. They collaborate with them.\n\nAdvantages of Buying 1 BTC\n\nMost of us at Altcoin Buzz use some Ethereum or EVM app on a daily basis. We bet most of you do too.\n\n\u2013 ETH is the Decentralized King\n\nBut you know what? Governments don\u2019t fear Ethereum. They don\u2019t work to ban Ethereum. Only Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the biggest threat to government-issued money. And that should tell you something about its value, too. And how powerful it is.\n\nBitcoin is the King. It\u2019s the most decentralized project and the only threat to government-issued money.\n\nLess Concentrated Ownership\n\nBitcoin\u2019s ownership is in way more hands than Ethereum. There are 45.7 million holders of the 19.3 million Bitcoin in circulation. That means the average holder has 0.42 BTC. That\u2019s more per average holder than Ethereum. And unlike Ethereum\u2019s 39%, the top 100 Bitcoin holders only own 13.6%. That\u2019s a huge difference.\n\nAll ownership and decentralization metrics are stronger and less concentrated for Bitcoin.\n\n#EconWatch: As #ElSalvador adopts #Bitcoin, 5 other Latin American countries are considering similar initiatives. Like El Salvador, all of these countries score extremely poorly on global corruption indices. #BTC is highly correlated with high levels of corruption. pic.twitter.com/EGToWp2bPk \u2014 Steve Hanke (@steve_hanke) June 26, 2021\n\nInstitutions Prefer Bitcoin\n\nLast fall leading into The Merge, Ethereum got much more institutional interest than usual. Especially since they can stake it easily on Coinbase or Binance and earn a rate like Treasuries on it.\n\nBut overall, institutions much prefer Bitcoin. To be fair, many are bullish on both. That said, there is more trading activity for Bitcoin. More companies have Bitcoin on their balance sheet. More than just Microstrategy\u2019s 140,000 BTC.\n\nLegendary VC investor and Bitcoin bull Tim Draper are telling his portfolio companies and making the general recommendation to hold at least 2 payrolls worth of cash in Bitcoin. That\u2019s in the wake of US bank closures and systemic problems now coming to the surface. For the average American company, that\u2019s equal to 1 month of all employee salaries.\n\nDisadvantages of Buying 1 BTC\n\nNow, the anti-BTC argument. While Layer 2 solutions like Stacks and Lightning Network are growing and adding more services, the biggest knock on Bitcoin is that its best utility is to HODL. Its opponents say that just holding and hoping it goes up is not a high utility for crypto.\n\nFirst bridging #USDT from Eth to Stacks was a great experience and very smooth \ud83e\udd17 Huge S/O to the whole @ALEXLabBTC Team for this amazing feature added to the ecosystem \ud83e\udee1 pic.twitter.com/YGa3Q1af04 \u2014 Algorithm.btc (@godfred_xcuz) April 21, 2023\n\nThere\u2019s no question that because its ecosystem is larger and everyone pays ETH for gas Ethereum has more general day-to-day utility right now. This map we are looking at is almost 2 yrs old and look how huge it is. It\u2019s only larger now.\n\nAnd if your favorite part of crypto is DeFi or NFTs or Games or Metaverse, then you probably favor ETH more than Bitcoin. Although Ordinals look like the real deal for Bitcoin.\n\nThe Decision\n\nBoth are getting more scarce. Bitcoin\u2019s inflation is 1.67%. The next halving is ~12 months away. Ethereum\u2019s inflation post \u2013 Merge is 0.88%.\n\nOn the other hand, Bitcoin is the most monetary, and money-like. Ethereum has the most protocols using it. So in the end, my own personal preference is that I would prefer to have.\n\nI know what I choose.

        "title": "Bitcoin and Ethereum Creating a Bull Market for New Projects like Big Eyes Coin - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "After breaking the landmark height of $30,000 earlier in the week, Bitcoin has remained stable and continued to grow, offering a promising prospect of a bull run in the crypto market in the coming weeks.\n\nThis is only further cemented by Ethereum (ETH) breaking $2,000 after their \u201cShanghai\u201d update yesterday. As many experts are claiming that we are now in a bull market, investors are looking towards alternative investment opportunities still in their infancy to achieve maximum returns, such as Big Eyes Coin (BIG).\n\nBig Eyes, Bigger Possibilities\n\nBig Eyes Coin is rapidly approaching the end of its presale period, which ends on the 3rd of June, and the excitement surrounding the launch is palpable. BIG, having raised an impressive \u00a333.73 million so far, has captured the attention of many crypto enthusiasts, and publications are recognizing it as having the potential to become the world\u2019s next most significant meme coin.\n\nAs many other currencies have been experiencing exciting gains over the past week, it is natural that investors are scouring the market for upcoming projects that have the potential to match the growth that we have seen with currencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). The proof of stake system will enable BIG to offer a sustainable and innovative approach that is in line with future progressions within the crypto market.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Leap of Faith\n\nEthereum (ETH) is another currency that has adopted the proof of stake system with their recent \u201cShanghai\u201d update, moving entirely away from the controversial proof of work system used by many others, like Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nETH\u2019s update has caused a rift in the market, and this gamble has paid off as ETH is looking to continue climbing as it has risen above the $2,000 point. This clearly suggests that we have well and truly entered a bull market.\n\nThe Influence of Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin (BTC) continues to skyrocket, although it remains a long way off its peak of $69,044. As the entire crypto market often follows the trajectory that BTC takes, this shows other currencies, such as Ethereum (ETH) and Big Eyes Coin (BIG), will follow this rise and grow in value in tandem.\n\nBTC has been adopted by many gigantic institutions such as Tesla, Block, and Coinbase, all buying millions of dollars worth of BTC. This has driven up the price of BTC and continues to grow the influence of crypto in the broader economic market.\n\nAs the crypto market continues to gain momentum during this bull run, investors are both continuing to pay attention to innovations by Ethereum and Bitcoin and consider how this will influence the market for new projects like Big Eyes Coin to launch in the near future. Now more than ever, enthusiasts are excited about investing in promising new projects to profit as much as possible from this bull market.\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG)\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nOpensea: https://opensea.io/collection/big-eyes-lootbox-cards\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "As Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) dominance fades, many analysts of the crypto market are suggesting that we are entering an alt season, where altcoins take a larger share of the market, leading to a rally in prices. Three altcoins to watch this coming season are Dogetti (DETI), Ethereum (ETH), and Dogecoin (DOGE), which all look to make incredible gains.\n\nDogetti off to a Brilliant Start\n\nDogetti (DETI) is a newcomer to the market, which is currently in its presale stage, showing promising gains as more and more investors are purchasing tokens while it is still at a low price. DETI offers a unique blend of a cryptocurrency that pledges to donate to user-chosen charities whilst redistributing a percentage of each transaction amongst its token holders. Operating on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain, DETI will be due to benefit from ETH\u2019s recent gains and after the presale ends on the 20th of June, DETI will be set onto a successful blockchain with exciting prospects. DETI uses a proof of stake mechanism, which will increase demand for the coin and protect it against any restrictions that may come into place against the proof of work mining system.\n\nEthereum Accelerating with the Shanghai Upgrade\n\nEthereum (ETH) has permanently moved to a proof of stake system from proof of work, with its recent much-hyped Shanghai upgrade. Following this upgrade, ETH saw a spike in price as interest caused the value to rise above the $2k threshold, and as Bitcoin (BTC) looks to enter a decline many suspect that ETH could take its place. ETH has long been BTC\u2019s biggest competitor but has yet to reach the dizzying heights that BTC has done in the past. This, however, could all change if we enter an alt season as we are predicted to do, and the reign of BTC could be brought to a dramatic end.\n\nDogecoin Turning Heads\n\nThe final altcoin that offers a tempting alternative to the mainstream crypto of Bitcoin (BTC) is Dogecoin (DOGE). DOGE has seen admirable gains over the past month, and looks to continue its rise, in what one trader, CrediBULL Crypto (@CredibleCrypto) has predicted could be \u201cthe mother of all alt seasons\u201d. DOGE currently operates on its own blockchain under a proof of work system, and while we have been seeing the rise of proof of stake, DOGE\u2019s similarity in this sense to BTC could be an advantage to the coin nearing the top of the market. DOGE may have begun as a joke, but it seems to have succeeded in its aims to threaten the concept of an ever-serious approach to crypto by its predecessors.\n\nAs 2023\u2019s altcoin season rapidly approaches, investors are gearing up to find the currencies on the market, or due to be released imminently, that have the potential for the biggest rewards. Dogetti (DETI), Ethereum (ETH), and Dogecoin (DOGE) are three such coins, and as they gain traction and receive more attention, they stand to become some of the biggest players this season.\n\nDogetti (DETI)\n\nPresale: https://dogetti.io/how-to-buy\n\nWebsite: https://dogetti.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/Dogetti\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_Dogetti_\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"
