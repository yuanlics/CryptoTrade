        "title": "If You Invested $100 in Ethereum, Here's How Much You'd Have Now - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "It's no secret that crypto has been struggling over the last couple of years. And after a whirlwind surge in 2023, prices are falling yet again.\n\nHowever, many cryptocurrencies have still proven to be incredibly lucrative long-term investments. For example, while the price of Ethereum (ETH 0.59%) has fallen by around 11% over the last month, it's still up more than 300% over the last three years -- and that's despite the brutal crypto winter throughout 2022.\n\nIf crypto prices rebound, we could see similar gains over time. And while past performance doesn't predict future returns, it can sometimes be encouraging to look at how much you could have earned if you'd invested years ago.\n\nHow far could Ethereum have taken you?\n\nEthereum is one of the biggest success stories to come out of the crypto market. Despite extreme volatility, it remains the second most popular name in the industry. It currently has a market cap of around $198 billion, making up around 20% of the entire crypto sector.\n\nWhile it certainly hasn't been immune to volatility, it's also fared better than many of its competitors. Its price is currently down by around 65% from its peak in late 2021, while Cardano has fallen by a staggering 87% in that time, and Solana has plummeted by around 91%.\n\nFor long-term investors who stuck it out through the rough patches, Ethereum has been a lucrative investment. Here's how much $100 of Ethereum would be worth today, depending on when you'd invested:\n\nDate Invested Ethereum Returns as of Today How Much $100 Would Be Worth Today Aug. 1, 2021 -30% $70 Aug. 1, 2020 333% $433 Aug. 1, 2019 671% $771\n\nThe short term can be rocky for crypto, and if you'd invested in late 2021 right before prices plummeted, your investment would have declined in value. But if you'd invested just four years ago and held through all the ups and downs, you'd have nearly 8 times your initial investment by today.\n\nIs Ethereum a good investment right now?\n\nAgain, past performance doesn't predict future returns. There are never any guarantees when investing, and this is especially true with crypto due to its speculative nature. No one can say, then, whether Ethereum will continue on its track of explosive long-term returns.\n\nThat said, Ethereum is one of the strongest players in the crypto space, and it has a slew of advantages. Its sheer size is one of them, as it's far and away the most popular network for decentralized applications -- such as NFT marketplaces, DeFi projects, and metaverse apps.\n\nEthereum's developers are also committed to consistently upgrading the blockchain to make it stronger and more useful. Last year, they successfully pulled off The Merge -- a landmark upgrade that moved Ethereum from the energy-intensive proof-of-work system to the far more efficient proof-of-stake model.\n\nThe Surge is one of the next eagerly awaited updates, and it aims to improve the network's speed and reduce transaction fees. These have long been two major pain points for Ethereum, and if developers are able to successfully pull off this update, it could be a game-changer.\n\nDownsides to consider before you buy\n\nWhile Ethereum has plenty of advantages, it won't be right for every portfolio.\n\nLike the crypto industry in general, Ethereum is still a speculative investment. Although it does have a fair amount of utility (especially compared to many of its competitors), its primary uses are also somewhat speculative right now. If NFTs, DeFi, or the metaverse become more mainstream, for instance, Ethereum could thrive. But if they never catch on, it could spell trouble.\n\nMuch of Ethereum's future success also hinges on its upcoming upgrades. If those updates take longer than expected to complete or there are significant hiccups during the rollouts, that could shake users' confidence -- and provide an opportunity for competitors to swoop in and grab market share.\n\nIn short, Ethereum is still speculative, but it's also one of the strongest investments in the crypto space right now. If you're willing to take on more risk for the chance to earn potentially lucrative returns over the long run, it may be a smart addition to your portfolio."

        "title": "Another Exchange to Stop Ethereum Staking for US Customers - Blockonomi",
        "content": "Ethereum staking will no longer be valid for Bitstamp US customers starting in September. It\u2019s becoming more difficult for exchanges to offer staking services to American investors\n\nBitstamp to Stop Ethereum Staking\n\nBitstamp, one of the world\u2019s most established cryptocurrency exchanges, announced it would halt Ethereum staking on the exchange. The service will officially be suspended on September 25.\n\nSpeaking of the news, CEO of Bitstamp USA, Bobby Zagotta, stated: \u201cCustomers will continue earning staking rewards up until September 25, 2023, and after that, all staked assets will be unstaked. Rewards, along with the principal, will be credited to users\u2019 main Bitstamp account balances.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Bitstamp said that the staking rewards and the initial deposit amount would be distributed to the customer\u2019s main account balance. It\u2019s noteworthy that the process might take a few days and could be affected by the Internet connection.\n\nBitstamp\u2019s move came amid intensified scrutiny by regulators on the crypto market. Major crypto exchanges with operations in the US have made specific actions to comply with the current regulatory landscape. Some of the most popular acts are to halt staking services and remove some trading pairs.\n\nCoinbase recently decided to delist six tokens from its exchange due to its failure to meet its standards. These tokens, including BarnBridge (BOND), DerivaDAO (DDX), Jupiter (JUP), Multichain (MULTI), Ooki (OOKI), and Voyager (VGX), will no longer be available for trading starting on September 6. Furthermore, Coinbase Pro, Coinbase Exchange, and Coinbase Prime services for these tokens will also be discontinued.\n\nMeanwhile, Binance also announced a series of delistings. In August, the exchange removed Sonm (SNM), Serum (SRM), and DFI.Money (YFII) from its platform earlier this week. The move affected the following trading pairs: SNM/BTC, SNM/BUSD, SRM/BUSD, and YFII/USDT\n\nEarlier this month, Bitstsamp also halted trading for seven tokens in the US. All of these tokens are on the SEC\u2019s list of unregistered securities, including Polygon (MATIC), Solana (SOL), and Near Protocol (NEAR). This action was taken to steer clear of any potential legal complications.\n\nCrypto Staking Targeted\n\nBitstamp is not the only exchange that has to stop the staking service in the US under mounting regulatory pressure. In February, California-based exchange Kraken announced the suspension of its staking service in the US as part of the settlement with the SEC.\n\nThis move raised questions about whether the SEC plans to crack down on crypto staking more broadly.\n\nCoinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said in February that there were speculations about the SEC\u2019s possible ban on the crypto staking for retail customers in the US. Armstrong\u2019s statement, however, lacked clarification regarding his assertion that the SEC\u2019s ban only targets retail investors.\n\nArmstrong additionally highlighted the advantages of staking in blockchain technology. Staking involves using assets to safeguard and maintain the blockchain while preserving its decentralized nature.\n\nThe CEO also argued that crypto staking is a vital part of blockchain technology and should not be banned. He has warned that banning crypto staking would harm the US\u2019s technological leadership and could lead to exchanges moving their operations overseas.\n\nThe SEC has not yet taken any concrete action against crypto staking. However, the SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, since September 2022, has indicated that staking can be considered a form of security.\n\nConsequently, staking operations must register with the SEC to offer services to American investors. The SEC Chairman previously asserted that most cryptocurrencies, excluding BItcoin, are securities.\n\nGensler\u2019s remarks coincided with Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency network globally, successfully implementing its major upgrade known as the Merge to support ETH staking. The Ethereum community is awaiting the next major event \u2013 the Dencun upgrade, which is expected to launch within the year."

        "content": "OnlyFans, the UK-based adult content subscription platform, is diving deep into cryptocurrency. As part of its capital ventures, the company has invested in Ethereum, the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency, per an Evening Standard report. This move comes as the firm celebrates a milestone, with revenues surpassing $1 billion for the first time in 2022.\n\nEthereum and the Future of Digital Investments\n\nEthereum price is currently trading at $1,643.71 and boasting a 24-hour trading volume of $2,693,591,545, remains an attractive investment for many businesses, with OnlyFans being the latest to explore its potential.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe capital infusion into Ethereum suggests a forward-thinking strategy on OnlyFans\u2019 part, indicating a shift towards diversifying assets and possibly integrating blockchain technology or cryptocurrency-based models into its operations. With a circulating supply of 120,216,173 ETH coins and the max supply undisclosed, Ethereum presents promising returns for early adopters.\n\nGrowth Amidst Controversy\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that OnlyFans has witnessed remarkable growth in the past year. According to the Evening Standard, the platform reported a 17% increase in sales, settling at $1.1 billion, and an impressive jump of 21% in pre-tax profits, which stands at $525 million. Over 50 million new users, accompanied by 1 million fresh content creators, flocked to the platform, cumulatively spending $5.5 billion on the site.\n\nHowever, the firm hasn\u2019t been without its challenges. A BBC News investigation last year uncovered incidents of underage individuals selling and appearing in videos on the platform, sparking safety concerns. In response to these allegations, OnlyFans defended its safety protocols, stating in its accounts that the company \u201cgoes above and beyond the legal requirements\u201d to ensure a safe and controlled environment for its community."

        "content": "Crypto blockchains are designed to be fully decentralized so that no single person or group has control. However, new data has shown that the top 10 Ethereum addresses control over 35% of the total ETH supply. For a network that was designed to be decentralized, this has sparked some serious concerns over how centralized ETH has become.\n\nThe 10 Largest Ethereum Addresses Hold Over 35% Of The Available Supply\n\nWhile sharing the metric on social media platform X, crypto market intelligence platform Santiment showed how holdings of the 10 largest Ethereum addresses have now climbed to 35% of the total supply.\n\nThis indicates that while small traders have been trying to offload their supply during the recent price crash, many ETH whales are taking the chance to buy the dip.\n\n\ud83d\udc33 The 10 largest addresses on the #Ethereum network are now holding over 35% of the available supply. By no means does this mean the #2 asset in #crypto is suddenly #centralized, but it shows the capitulation of smaller traders showing #FUD from this dip. https://t.co/G3wIeBzelb pic.twitter.com/TXkKjSwwmn \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) August 25, 2023\n\nOver the past 5 years, the top 10 largest Ethereum addresses have seen their share of the total ETH supply grow substantially. Data shows that these addresses held only 11.2% of the total supply in August 2018, and then rose to 24% in August 2022. The current level means these 10 largest holders have accumulated 11% more in the past year.\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 #Ethereum has been seeing its top 10 addresses expand and accumulate more and more of the total available coin supply. In 5 years, the top 10 largest addresses have gone from owning 11.2% to now 34.6% of $ETH. The 27.86M $ETH added is worth $51.6B. \ud83d\ude2e https://t.co/utI8W6DkRX pic.twitter.com/klgb7pus7K \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) August 9, 2023\n\nEtherscan, an Ethereum block explorer, shows the top account balances in ETH, with the largest address alone (Beacon Deposit Contract) controlling over 24% of all supply. Next comes in Wrapped Ether at 2.7%.\n\nHowever, most of the largest ETH holders are cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance and Kraken. One of Binance\u2019s wallets (Binance 7) holds over 1.66%, while the exchange also holds large ETH amounts in other wallets, making it the largest of any single entity.\n\nIn comparison, the top 10 addresses of Bitcoin, the largest crypto in the world, own only 5.35% of the total supply. This, of course, does not take into account Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s Bitcoin cache.\n\nETH price struggles amid centralization concerns | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nETH Centralization Concerns?\n\nWhales are known to have considerable control over the price movement of cryptocurrencies in the crypto market and large selloffs by these holders can lead to an increase in selling pressure from smaller investors, causing a dump in the price of ETH.\n\nHowever, considering the largest holder is the Ethereum is the Beacon Deposit Contract used for staking ETH, an increase in the contract spells positive news. More deposits into the contract signal that more investors are depositing to become validators in ETH 2.0.\n\nInterestingly, the number of wallets holding between 10 and 10,000 ETH has risen to 355,000, and 1,788 more 10-10,000 ETH wallets have been added since the beginning of June. Whale transactions in the past week alone have also crossed 23,073 ETH, the highest since May.\n\nAs for ETH\u2019s price, the token is currently trading at around $1,600, down 11% in the past month.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Discover SCENE\n\nIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nThis week markets appeared grateful for the dearth of news\u2014\"no news is good news,\" as the saying goes. Most leading cryptocurrencies recovered their losses over the week after last Thursday's flash crash sank virtually all leading cryptocurrencies by double-digit percentages.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) currently holds the fort at $26,015, about 0.4% cheaper than it was this time last week. A lot of Bitcoin mining machinery came online this week, as evinced by the fact that the network on Wednesday hit a new all-time high for mining difficulty alongside a corresponding spike in hash rate, or computational power.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, matched Bitcoin\u2019s pace. At its current price of $1,647, it is down 1.6% from last week.\n\nBroadly speaking, most top thirty cryptocurrencies retained their value. The only notable depreciation over the last seven days fell upon holders of Uniswap (UNI) and Avalanche (AVAX). AVAX fell 7.2% to $10.02, while UNI crashed 7.9% to $4.58.\n\nMeme coin PEPE is still in freefall. On Monday it posted intraweek losses of over 20% as it slid from 71st to 84th place. It now enters the weekend at $0.000000865154\u2014the 98th biggest cryptocurrency by market cap\u2014or about 23.3% lower than it was a week ago.\n\nAdding to its generally poor performance, the PepeCoin team\u2019s multi-sig Ethereum address transferred 16.045 trillion PEPE\u2014worth $16.85 million at the time\u2014to four exchanges: Binance, OKX, KuCoin, and Bybit, on Thursday.\n\nThe lack of communication from the team about these transfers contributed to some heated panic selling.\n\nCapital cities were silent about crypto this week. There were only a few stories of any note.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn the news...\n\nThe Kenyan government on Monday established a committee to inquire into OpenAI CEO Sam Altman\u2019s crypto project Worldcoin\u2014a controversial project which offers people around the world free crypto if they visit their nearest \u201cOrb\u201d and supply it with biometric data (a snapshot of their eyeballs). Kenya\u2019s move came three weeks after the country suspended Worldcoin\u2019s activities within its borders.\n\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. Department of Justice arrested Tornado Cash founder Roman Storm and charged him with crimes related to money laundering. Co-founder Roman Semenov, who was also named in the indictment, remains at large in Dubai.\n\nLast year, the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) banned Americans from using privacy mixer Tornado Cash, claiming that criminals had used it to launder money\u2014specifically naming the North Korean state-sponsored hacker organization Lazarus Group.\n\nEarlier this week, the legislative body of the Central African Republic (CAR) granted approval for the tokenization of land and natural resources to help the government position the country as an up-and-coming business destination in Africa.\n\nThe project launched last year with resource tokenization in mind; it is meant to facilitate investment in CAR through Sango Coin, a state-issued token\u2014though not a Central Bank Digital Currency\u2014backed by Bitcoin on a sidechain network. However, initial responses to Sango Coin\u2019s launch were lukewarm."

The creator of the Ethereum-alternative believes the token is likely to beat competitors Bitcoin and Ethereum, in terms of market capitalization, through its mass adoption.\n\nHoskinson\u2019s statements have failed to catalyze a recovery in the altcoin, and ADA price is at support at $0.2589, at the time of writing.\n\nAlso read: XRP price makes comeback above $0.50 as pro-XRP lawyer urges former SEC officials\u2019 testimony\n\nCharles Hoskinson believes Cardano can beat competitors\n\nCardano\u2019s competitors Bitcoin and Ethereum have the largest market capitalization in the crypto ecosystem. Hoskinson gave a talk at blockchain convention Rare Evo 2023, and shared his views of the recent developments in Cardano.\n\nDuring his speech, Hoskinson explained that Cardano is probably going to become the biggest cryptocurrency in the world.

Cardano\u2019s utility and potential market reach are therefore drivers that can beat Bitcoin, Ethereum and other projects in the ecosystem.\n\nAt the time of writing, ADA price is in a downward trend and exchanging hands at $0.2589. The altcoin is below its three long-term Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) at 10,50 and 200-day at $0.2665, $0.2890 and $0.3344.\n\nHoskinson\u2019s commentary did not act as a bullish catalyst for ADA price and it remains to be seen whether the altcoin will begin its recovery from the downward trend."

Contrastingly, Solana\u2019s mobile venture, the Saga phone, has resorted to a major price adjustment this month, decreasing its cost by 40%.\n\nWhat is ethOS?\n\nThe ethOS mobile device is an innovative adaptation of the Google Pixel 7a, embedded with the Ethereum-specific mobile OS, ethOS. With the ability to function as a lightweight Ethereum client, the phone can autonomously verify blocks and sync with the Ethereum network, eliminating the need for intermediary services such as Infura or Alchemy.\n\nSecurity and Compatibility Features\n\nThis groundbreaking phone comes with an in-built wallet and ensures effortless integration with various other wallet services. Although the Pixel 7a doesn\u2019t classify as a hardware wallet, it is equipped with a unique security component \u2013 a secure enclave \u2013 which specializes in encrypting and securely storing private keys.\n\nHow to Buy Ethereum Phone?\n\nA mere 50 devices were accessible during the pre-order phase, requiring potential buyers to mint and subsequently burn an ethOS NFT to reserve their phone. These exclusive NFTs have now found their way onto the NFT trading platform, OpenSea, with a few exchanging hands for as much as 3 ETH or approximately $5,000. This is astonishing, especially when juxtaposed against the standard Google Pixel 7A\u2019s U.S. market price of $499.\n\nIs Ethereum Phone Better than Solana Phone?\n\nDespite the ethOS phone\u2019s initial success wave, the Solana Saga phone appears to have grappled with slower sales. Since its debut in April 2023, data from FlipsideCrypto suggests a sale of just 2,120 units. To rejuvenate its sales trajectory, Solana Mobile has strategically reduced the Saga phone\u2019s price tag from $1,000 to a more enticing $599.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might also like\n\nMore from Altcoin"

At the time of writing this line, Cardano is ranked as the eighth-biggest cryptocurrency, with a market valuation of $9.05 billion.\n\nConversely, Bitcoin and Ethereum sit as the first and second largest cryptocurrencies, with market caps worth $506.21 billion and $198.07 billion, respectively.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nHoskinson Highlights Bitcoin & Ethereum Downsides\n\nAlthough Cardano is far behind Bitcoin and Ethereum in terms of valuation, Hoskinson still thinks ADA will eventually become the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency.\n\nPer Hoskinson, the inefficient governance models of the market leaders- Bitcoin and Ethereum- could help Cardano overtake them in the long term.\n\nHoskinson pointed out that Bitcoin\u2019s weakness could come from its static design. Notably, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency has not changed its design for 13 years.\n\nAdditionally, he said Ethereum\u2019s dismissal of on-chain governance could also become a long-term liability for the crypto project, especially as it accumulates millions of users.\n\nHoskinson Makes Other Predictions\n\nFurthermore, Hoskinson also made other predictions, including the fact that Cardano might eventually become more than just a cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s [Cardano is] going to become the backbone of a new digital nation, a new society\u2014a place where we can finally begin to trust each other again, where we move from \u2018don\u2019t be evil\u2019 to \u2018can\u2019t be evil,'\u201d he added.\n\nADA Down 1.6% In 24 Hours\n\nMeanwhile, Cardano\u2019s native token ADA is trading at $0.25, down 1.6% over the past 24 hours. The crypto asset has been recording consistent declines since May 2023.\n\nAs reported earlier, ADA could register further dips, as a recent chart shows the coin is replicating its 2019 price movements."

        "title": "OnlyFans bought $20 million worth of Ethereum, records show - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "United Kingdom-based subscription platform for adult content, OnlyFans, has entered into the cryptocurrency space coinciding with a period in which the company has registered significant growth.\n\nAccording to the company\u2019s financial filing, OnlyFans had purchased $19.889 million worth of Ethereum (ETH). However, the value of the purchased Ethereum has decreased, leading to an impairment loss of $8.455 million by November 30, 2022.\n\nAdult content subscription service Onlyfans\u2019 financial report shows that it invested part of its working capital into Ethereum.\n\n\n\nOnlyfans purchased $19.889 million worth of ETH. The purchased ETH has a Impairmnent loss of $8.455m as of November 30, 2022, with a Carrying amount\u2026 pic.twitter.com/dW1sYQfIkp \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) August 27, 2023\n\nAs a result, the remaining value of Ethereum, known as the carrying amount, stands at $11.434 million. This impairment loss indicates that the initial investment in Ethereum has declined in value, aligning with the recent price movements in the general cryptocurrency market.\n\nAccording to the filings, investing in cryptocurrency is part of putting money into intangible assets with an \u2018indefinite useful life. OnlyFans\u2019 venture into cryptocurrencies could have several implications, pointing towards a deliberate move towards diversification and embracing blockchain technology.\n\nThis move coincides with Ethereum being increasingly considered an attractive asset for its potential as a viable store of value. Its growing integration into mainstream financial establishments further enhances the asset\u2019s allure as a sustainable investment option.\n\nAdditionally, the investment might be linked to Ethereum\u2019s capability to serve as an inflation-resistant asset, potentially allowing it to remain less affected by the fluctuations of conventional financial markets.\n\nApart from its cryptocurrency investments, OnlyFans has previously expanded its financial portfolio through ventures in non-fungible tokens (NFT). In February 2022, OnlyFans introduced a feature enabling users to showcase verified NFTs as profile images. The adult platform only allowed NFTs minted on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nOnlyFans strong financial postings\n\nFor the 12 months ending on November 30, 2022, the company posted strong financial results, reaching a revenue milestone of over $1 billion. Simultaneously, the platform attracted over 50 million new users, and more than 1 million new content creators joined its ranks. Collectively, users spent a substantial $5.5 billion on the site.\n\nThe filings indicated that Leonid Radvinsky, a Ukrainian based in the US who acquired the company in 2018, accumulated approximately $485 million in dividends since the beginning of the previous year as demands for OnlyFans grew.\n\nIt is worth noting that OnlyFans\u2019 revenue model involves the company keeping around \u00a31 out of every \u00a34 earned by its content creators. This approach has been highly profitable for numerous adult content creators, leading to significant earnings for some individuals on the platform."

        "content": "ETH\u2019s MVRV ratio slipped below its 180-day small moving average.\n\nThis is a bearish signal, and it indicated a further price decline might be imminent.\n\nLeading altcoin Ethereum [ETH] is at risk of further decline, as its daily Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio has fallen below its 180-day small moving average (SMA), Twitter crypto analyst Ali_Charts found.\n\n#Ethereum MVRV Ratio, compared to the 180-day SMA, offers insights into market trends! When MVRV surpasses the 180-day SMA, it indicates macro uptrends; when below, downtrends are suggested. Notably, after the recent #ETH price decline, MVRV fell beneath the 180-day SMA,\u2026 pic.twitter.com/ITvA586HBf \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) August 25, 2023\n\nThe MVRV ratio tracks the ratio between an asset\u2019s current market price and the average price of every coin or token of that asset acquired. A positive MVRV ratio above one signals that an asset is overvalued.\n\nAccording to Santiment, the more this ratio increases, the more likely traders have historically demonstrated their willingness to sell.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nConversely, a negative MVRV value shows that the asset in question is undervalued, as if holders sold at the asset\u2019s current price, they would realize losses.\n\nAs noted by Ali_Charts, when an asset\u2019s MVRV ratio rests above the 180-day SMA, the market capitalization is greater than the total amount of profit realized, which suggests that the market is in an uptrend.\n\nOn the other hand, when the MVRV ratio is below the 180-day SMA, the market capitalization is less than the total amount of realized profit, which suggests that the market is in a downtrend.\n\nRegarding ETH, its MVRV ratio recently fell below the 180-day SMA, suggesting that its recent price decline may not be over.\n\nETH traders continue to dawdle\n\nWith many uncertain of the coin\u2019s next direction, the recent market deleveraging event has caused ETH holders to stay their hands from accumulating the altcoin. Since 17 August, when the market suffered a huge liquidity exit, key momentum indicators have plummeted, suggesting a drop in buying pressure.\n\nBelow their respective center lines at press time, ETH\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) and its Money Flow Index (MFI) were 30.44 and 18.54.\n\nLikewise, as of this writing, the alt\u2019s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) returned a negative value of -0.08, a position it has occupied since the capital exodus. Generally, a CMF value below the zero line is a sign of weakness in the market.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nOutside the spot market, reduced ETH trading was also observed in the futures market. Across cryptocurrency exchanges, the total amount of ETH\u2019s Open Interest valued in dollars has trended downwards since 17 August. In the last seven days alone, this has declined by 4%.\n\nAlso, on leading exchanges Binance and dYdX, ETH\u2019s funding rates have been predominantly negative for the past two weeks. This signaled where market sentiment lies, showing investors preferred to bet against the alt\u2019s price."

        "title": "Why blockchain will change our lives (and revolutionize the economy in the process) - EL PA\u00cdS USA",
        "content": "Blockchain is a silent technology. Its practical applications aren\u2019t as easy for ordinary citizens to visualize, when compared to the metaverse or artificial intelligence. And yet, it\u2019s the foundation of a major economic revolution.\n\nBefore discussing blockchain\u2019s potential, it\u2019s best to define what exactly we\u2019re talking about.\n\nIts beginnings are linked to cryptocurrencies \u2013 especially bitcoin \u2013 but its journey is much longer and will produce important changes in payment systems. Most central banks are already working on their digital currencies. Meanwhile, logistics, the video game industry, or the world of investment are transforming as a result of tokenization \u2013 the concept of turning real assets into digital replicas.\n\nBlockchain technology isn\u2019t just a database: it\u2019s a set of technologies that allow for the transfer of a value or asset from one place to another, without the intervention of third parties. In this sense, it proposes a new financial model, in which authenticity isn\u2019t verified by a third party, but by the network of nodes (computers connected to the network) that participate in blockchain. Hence, no transfer of value \u2013 whether it\u2019s money or another asset that has some kind of value \u2013 is carried out through an intermediary, but through a consensus, allowing information to be stored in a transparent manner.\n\nAs its name indicates, blockchain is a chain of blocks, which contain encoded information related to a transaction on the network. And, being intertwined (hence the word chain), the blocks allow for the transfer of data (or value) with a fairly secure encoding through the use of cryptography. \u201cWhat\u2019s truly new is that the transfer doesn\u2019t require a third party to certify the information. Rather, it\u2019s distributed in multiple independent and equal nodes that examine and validate it, without the need for them to know each other,\u201d explain analysts from the Spanish bank BBVA. \u201cOnce entered, the information cannot be deleted; only new information can be added, since the blocks are connected to each other through cryptographic encryption. Modifying data from a block prior to the chain is impossible, since it would have to modify the information from the previous blocks.\u201d\n\nSomeone consults the price of Ethereum on their phone. Cryptocurrencies utilize blockchain technology. Angel Garcia (BLOOMBERG)\n\nThe big banks are already preparing for what\u2019s coming. Citibank, for instance, has published a lengthy report on the economic impact of blockchain. Digital currencies (CBDCs) issued by the world\u2019s leading economies alone could be valued at $5 trillion by the end of this decade and would be accessible on the mobile phones of 2 billion people. 90% of central banks are currently running pilot programs involving the use of virtual currencies. However, the European Central Bank (ECB) thinks that the new digital euro won\u2019t be available for at least another three years, as several unknowns remain to be cleared up, particularly regarding privacy concerns.\n\nNew formats\n\nPerhaps Manisha Patel \u2013 a finance expert at the IMF \u2013 has some solutions to the issues with blockchain. Firstly, how would this technology help the most vulnerable?\n\n\u201cThese new digital formats are being explored by many developing economies, due to their potential to increase financial inclusion. They\u2019ll succeed if they\u2019re an affordable and widely-accepted payment instrument,\u201d Patel notes. But these countries will require extensive internet infrastructure and access to mobile phones, so as to overcome barriers. \u201cCustom proposals in each country can take several years,\u201d she warns.\n\nAnd what will happen to crypto assets if official digital currencies become popular? \u201cCryptocurrencies will survive as a form of payment within the underground economy, illegal activities and tax evasion. They compete with $100 bills,\u201d predicts Kenneth Rogoff, a former IMF chief economist. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be used for speculation and crime,\u201d agrees Emilio Capela, a partner at McKinsey & Company. However, several experts believe in redemption.\n\nEnrique Dans \u2013 a professor at IE Business School \u2013 values the freedom that comes from not depending on a central bank. And he gets excited when talking with his eight-year-old little brother about ethereum, \u201can open source community that, unlike bitcoin, takes much less energy to mine (manufacture),\u201d he says. \u201cWith this technology, the 2008 crash wouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201d\n\nAnother business that envisions mountains of money coming from blockchain is that of video games. Last year, some 3.2 billion players or gamers used the technology. These guys don\u2019t usually ask themselves what technology is behind their video games. However, with the Web3 ecosystem (defined by investor Packy McCormick as \u201can internet that\u2019s owned by developers and users, coordinated with tokens\u201d), they\u2019ll improve their experience when sitting in front of a computer. Newzoo \u2013 the consultancy that specializes in this intangible space \u2013 calculates that blockchain generates $184 billion annually from the video game sector.\n\nEverything was more or less on track\u2026 until bitcoin began to be surrounded by controversy. \u201cCryptocurrencies have [blighted] the reputation of blockchain. However, the technology on which they are based is very useful,\u201d clarifies Javier Pino, an expert from the Alliance for Financial Inclusion. Still, frauds, thefts and the bankruptcy of the FTX platform have left the crypto world with bad memories.\n\nConsumption plays a big role in this game (distributors will gain an advantage in efficiency with the massive use of block systems), which, despite everything, can still be financially lucrative. Two major technologies \u2013 blockchain and tokenization \u2013 want to share the future together. Tokenization changes everything, because almost everything is tokenizable: a line of credit, a venture capital investment, the purchase of a house, the rights to songs and images, shares, currencies, gold, a Picasso painting\u2026 Advocates argue that digital assets democratize investments that were originally meant for the elites, or create brand-new investments that didn\u2019t previously exist in the financial markets.\n\n\u201cTokenization can transform financial and non-financial infrastructure and public and private markets in the next five to 15 years,\u201d estimates Alkesh Shah, director of digital asset strategy at Bank of America Global Research. The tokenized digital stock market is estimated to reach between $4 and $5 trillion by 2030. \u201cIt already allows for a reduction in credit risk, increasing the liquidity of assets that were previously illiquid, or allocating capital more efficiently,\u201d the analyst explains.\n\n\u201cThe next generation of the markets [and] the next generation of the shares will be their tokenization,\u201d predicted Larry Fink \u2013 president and founder of BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager \u2013 in an interview with The New York Times from November of 2022. If Picasso reinvented painting by dispensing with the vanishing point, technological disruption is poised to reimagine finance. Two inseparable sciences also help: sociology and cryptography. 67% of millennials (those born after 1981) around the world prefer to be guided by computer recommendations (robo advisors) when investing, rather than by fellow human beings. The investment firm Schroders has even deployed a new mantra to adapt to this trend: \u201ctechnology and digital experience.\u201d\n\nTokens are also gaining ground as the largest inheritance in history is about to begin. In the coming decades, Schroders details that, for example, in the United Kingdom alone, the former baby boomers (those born between the late-1940s and early-1970s) will bequeath 5.5 trillion pounds \u2013 or $7 trillion \u2013 to millennials and generation Z, who will tend to put more money in non-traditional assets. \u201cCurrently, tokens aren\u2019t defined or regulated consistently in all regions\u2026 but [government] administrations will address that deficiency,\u201d analysts from Schroders predict.\n\nTokenization \u2013 blessed by Wall Street \u2013 has already reached the mainstream economy. Venture capital firms such as KKR, Hamilton Lane and Apollo are digitizing some of their funds through blockchain platforms. Those who understand the technology will recognize the platforms ADDX, Avalanche, or Polygon. Meanwhile, other finance giants \u2013 such as Goldman Sachs, HSBC, JP Morgan, Citi, and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u2013 have designed their own structures to trade digital assets. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to develop the use of these services on a large scale,\u201d emphasizes John Gladwyn, manager of Pictet Digital. In fact, Hamilton Lane has lowered the minimum investment required to access some of its funds from $125,000 to $10,000. And, late last year, KKR tokenized its healthcare fund via the Avalanche platform. Even the market value of tokenized gold surpassed $1 billion in March.\n\nConstant Innovation\n\nFinancial institutions understand that they have to constantly innovate or \u2013 like a recurring nightmare \u2013 they will suddenly be worthless. Until now, cryptocurrencies had the big problem of volatility. The way to get around this fence is with stablecoins. This digital currency is linked to a real currency, such as the dollar, to provide holders with stability. There were about $7.8 trillion in stablecoin transactions in 2022 alone. Still, hackers appear, as do speculators \u2013 both hindrances in any ecosystem where seas of money flow. This has caused doubts to emerge. \u201cThe stable versions [of bitcoin] are of little use as stores of value, because it\u2019s never clear if they have enough collateral [assets] to stabilize the currency in the event of [cyber] attacks,\u201d warns Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda Montalvo, a professor of Economics at Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona.\n\nWithin the uncertainties that come with all technologies, perhaps one of the spaces where there\u2019s more consensus resides in smart contracts. This programming software allows pre-established transactions to be carried out only after a series of requirements have been met. \u201c[This] guarantees a high level of accuracy and compliance,\u201d affirms \u00c1lvaro Casado, head of digital assets at KPMG. Smart contracts work through blockchain, so the terms of the agreements are saved in a database. They can be seen\u2026 but not changed. \u201cA clear beneficiary will be international trade, which uses an enormous amount of documentation and conditions. It could be automated with standardized rules and simpler trading options,\u201d Garc\u00eda Montalvo describes.\n\nWith these types of contracts \u2013 along with the tokenization of the supply chain \u2013 those who make a fortune counterfeiting, say, Louis Vuitton bags, would have a hard time. \u201cDolce & Gabbana or Gucci have already launched experiments selling digital garments, [which are] protected within that blockchain,\u201d says Javier Molina, an analyst at eToro. \u201cIf, as a customer, I buy the NFT or, say, a digital scarf, it\u2019s guaranteed that only I am the owner.\u201d Porsche and Mercedes are also getting into this technology.\n\nIt\u2019s not just about the money. In developing countries, adulterated medicines (between 10% and 30% of all pharmaceutical drugs sold) cost a million lives a year. Hence the value of tracing \u2013 of following the trail. \u201cWalmart [and] IBM have managed to track the path of orange juice from a farm in South Africa to the American consumer in just three seconds [with the help of blockchain technology],\u201d says Daria Krivonos, CEO of the Copenhagen Institute for Future Studies.\n\nAround 20% of the top 10 global food companies will use blockchain technology by 2025. One example of this phenomenon is BlockBar: a blockchain-governed platform that allows luxury beverage brands to issue NFTs on a collection of rare wines or spirits. The goal is to own these exclusive bottles and sell them on the secondary market. \u201cThe company stores them in state-of-the-art facilities and they can be shipped worldwide, or picked up at more than 250 duty-free outlets,\u201d says its president, Sam Falic.\n\nBig brands make a bet\n\nLittle by little, an ecosystem is taking root, one whose fertile ground is that of blockchain. Brands are building a community in relation to this technology. Adidas has created an NFT collection called Into the Metaverse; Balenciaga has designed different outfits for Fortnite game avatars, while Gucci sold a virtual bag on the Roblox video game platform for $4,000. Nike recently acquired RTFKT Studios \u2013 a digital shoe manufacturer.\n\nBut this technology not only lives in that thin digital air: it also exists on the ground. \u201cThe application of digital technologies and blockchain \u2013 if they\u2019re adjusted to local needs and we guarantee that small producers can also access them \u2013 could generate great benefits for the economy as a whole, and achieve greater efficiency, productivity, resilience and sustainability,\u201d lists M\u00e1ximo Torero, chief economist of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). He also warns that \u201cthere\u2019s a risk of aggravating inequalities if these advances continue to be inaccessible to women, young people or small producers.\u201d\n\nTokenization is a phenomenon that\u2019s increasingly becoming part of culture. Selling the music catalogs of successful artists to companies such as Hipgnosis \u2013 run by Canada\u2019s Merck Mercuriadis \u2013 is generating billions. The singers earn money that relieves them from financial pressure, while the firms make cash through the reproduction rights. Universal Music Publishing has paid about $600 million to Bob Dylan to acquire his catalog. Bruce Springsteen has sold 300 songs, 20 studio albums and 23 live albums for approximately $500 million, while Sting sold all his production to Universal after receiving more than $300 million. About 130 creators \u2013 such as Paul Simon, The Killers, Phil Collins, or Neil Young \u2013 have already liquidated their works.\n\nUntil now, investing in intellectual property was impossible for an average earner. This is where blockchain technology, tokenization and its ability to fragment pieces of cultural production come into play. For instance, the co-producer of Rihanna\u2019s song Bitch Better Have My Money has made $63,000 after tokenizing the rights to the song in an NFT. He divided it into 300 parts for $210 apiece through the AnotherBlock platform. The fragments were subsequently purchased by 205 people.\n\nSelling bits of paint as art\n\nTurning masterpieces into digital assets clearly opens up big business opportunities. But it also raises some ethical questions.\n\nRemnants of paint on the studio floor that belonged to artist Jackson Pollock. This was turned into an NFT. Pamela Hassell (AP PHOTO/ LAPRES\n\nThe conversion of artworks into digital assets to exploit their value is dividing the art world. In the last months of 2021, NFT-based crypto art was going through its winter. After the digital artist Beeple (Mike Winkelmann) sold a $69.3 million NFT (Everydays: The First 5000 Days) via Christie\u2019s, almost everyone in the industry thought the most absurd art orgy in history was over. \u201cThey\u2019re a scam, just like cryptocurrencies,\u201d shrugs philosopher Bartomeu Mar\u00ed. \u201cRight-wing anarchism was looking for a way to escape the financial control of the state and not pay taxes. I haven\u2019t seen any fabulous artwork in that format.\u201d\n\nBut the pursuit of money by human beings can never be exhausted. Jackson Pollock\u2019s studio has turned the paint residue that stains the floor of the deceased artist\u2019s workspace into NFTs. In association with the Web3 Iconic platform, the studio churned out 100 units from the stains. This past July 19, they were marketed online: all were sold in just three hours for around $450,000 (paid in dollars and ethereum). When Pollock worked, paint dripped down the wooden handles of his brushes.\n\nThe works of Rafael Lozano-Hemmer are exhibited in some of the most prestigious galleries in the world, such as the Pace Gallery in New York. Acquiring one of his works can cost over a million dollars. The Mexican artist tells EL PA\u00cdS his thoughts on the matter:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made sure that my name isn\u2019t associated with NFTs, due to its intricate relationship with cryptocurrencies,\u201d he summarizes. That being said, he defends that the format can be a means of survival for artists from communities that are poorly-represented in the market. \u201cHowever, I\u2019m less impressed with creators who have a privileged position \u2013 I think of myself \u2013 and still produce them,\u201d he criticizes.\n\nOver the course of nine days this past April, British artist Damien Hirst pocketed more than $20 million from the sale of 5,508 paintings from his spiral series \u2013 all of which were generated by artificial intelligence. 399 were turned into NFTs. Despite everything, art institutions such as Lacma, Castello di Rivoli, Buffalo AKG or Pompidou have included them in their collections. In this new climate, there\u2019s always the question about what will perish and what history will disdain.\n\nMeasures are being taken so that this tokenization cannot be done to the great masters. The Italian government halted NFT sales of masterpieces from the country\u2019s museums in July of 2022. Those who paid $80,000 for NFTs of Michaelangelo\u2019s Doni Tondo ended up making a bad business decision. While many museums engaged in this form of digital commerce during the pandemic to raise funds, Italy will no longer allow this to continue: it wants to protect its cultural heritage.\n\nThe person in charge of one of the great Spanish art galleries \u2013 who requests anonymity \u2013 is in agreement. \u201cThe collection belongs to the whole country. It would be devaluing the works if we [allowed them to be sold digitally] to specific people,\u201d he reflects. However, the Thyssen Museum in Madrid has decided to use this technological tool with the painting Les Vessenots pr\u00e8s d\u2019Auvers (1890), by Vincent Van Gogh. The institution is selling 100 digital versions of the painting for $33,00 apiece. They can be purchased on an NFT marketplace run by a local telecommunications company.\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PA\u00cdS USA Edition"

        "title": "Top Altcoin Picks For Next Week: Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC) And Shiba Inu (SHIB) Are On The Way To Recovery - Coinpedia Fintech News",
        "content": "Shayan is a digital nomad and a professional journalist. He delivers high-quality engaging articles to Coinpedia through his in-depth research and analysis.\n\nIn the past week, Bitcoin has experienced significant price fluctuations within its consolidation range, influenced by various macroeconomic factors such as Jerome Powell\u2019s address. As Bitcoin falls short of meeting the short-term bullish expectations of investors, capital is increasingly flowing into the altcoin sector. Looking ahead to the coming week, a substantial recovery rally in the altcoin market is anticipated, with Ethereum, Litecoin, and Shiba Inu potentially leading this rally.\n\nAltcoins On The Edge Of Recovery\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price continues to flash volatility near $26K in response to Powell\u2019s hawkish comments. This development is somewhat expected, considering the bearish trend Bitcoin had been exhibiting in the days leading up to the Jackson Hole symposium. Traders had been preparing for Powell\u2019s ongoing moves on controlling the inflation to align with the central bank\u2019s 2% target.\n\nAmid this, the prices of Ethereum, Litecoin, and Shiba Inu have been hovering near key support levels. With sellers unable to push prices further downward, a potential bounce-back from these support levels is anticipated for the coming week.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis\n\nEther\u2019s price recently attempted to break above $1,700 but couldn\u2019t maintain its position, indicating strong defense from the bears at this price point.\n\nThe declining moving averages and the RSI below the midline suggest that bearish momentum still dominates. Sellers are likely to aim for pushing the price into the $1,625 to $1,544 range. If successful, we could see a drop below the support channel, plunging the ETH price toward the $1,360 level.\n\nConversely, bulls aren\u2019t leaving the field easily. They are expected to robustly defend the support zone and attempt to push the price above the 50-day EMA of $1,678. If they manage this, it would imply that the ETH price could continue to hover in a bullish range of $1,785-$1,863.\n\nLitecoin Price Analysis\n\nLitecoin has been trading within a narrow band of $60 to $67 over the last several days. While the bulls have managed to hold a decline below the $60 support level, they\u2019ve been unable to push past the $67 resistance.\n\nAn extended consolidation often leads to a solid breakout momentum ahead, and LTC price might experience that soon. If bulls successfully break above the consolidation next week, LTC price could initially target the 200-day EMA at $77 before aiming for the more ambitious $85 mark, where significant bearish activity is expected.\n\nConversely, it\u2019s crucial for the bulls to defend the $60 support level. Failure to do so could trigger the next downward phase, potentially driving the price to $47.\n\nShiba Inu Price Analysis\n\nThe extended wick on SHIB\u2019s candle pattern indicates that bearish traders are still active, selling off during upward movements.\n\nIf the price falls below the immediate support level of $0.000008, it would imply that the bears are still in control. In such a scenario, SHIB\u2019s price could decline to a low of $0.0000077. A further drop below this point could lead to a retest of the long-standing support at $0.00000705.\n\nOn the other hand, a surge above EMA50 will strengthen bullish positions, sending the meme coin toward $0.00001."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nA recent tweet of Santiment on-chain data vendor shows that the Ethereum holdings of 10 largest wallets have been increasing recently as they have now laid hands on one-third of all the circulating ETH supply.\n\nTop 10 wallets holding 1/3 of all ETH in market\n\nIn its recent tweet, Santiment revealed that the largest ETH whales have been taking advantage of smaller holders, who have been hit by the recent crypto FUD, dumping their ETH coins en mass.\n\nThus, as smaller investors have been selling their ETH holdings for fear of a further price drop, 10 largest wallets have picked up that Ethereum, and now they overall hold 35% of all ETH available in circulation.\n\n\ud83d\udc33 The 10 largest addresses on the #Ethereum network are now holding over 35% of the available supply. By no means does this mean the #2 asset in #crypto is suddenly #centralized, but it shows the capitulation of smaller traders showing #FUD from this dip. https://t.co/G3wIeBzelb pic.twitter.com/TXkKjSwwmn \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) August 25, 2023\n\nEthereum wallet activity surges\n\nIn an earlier tweet, Santiment spread the word about the network activity on the Ethereum chain surging as the number of ETH-holding wallets began rising quickly. This was the time when ETH briefly slumped below the $1,650 price line, showing highly volatile price conditions.\n\nNow, per that tweet of the data vendor, the number of addresses that hold 10 to 10,000 ETH rose back up to 335,000 units, showing weekly network activity of transactions worth more than $100,000.\n\n\ud83d\udc33 #Ethereum's network has picked up in large address activity during this drop below $1,650 and its highly volatile price conditions. The amount of wallets holding between 10 and 10,000 $ETH has risen back up to 355K, and $100K+ transactions have surged. https://t.co/X137U93ZYu pic.twitter.com/J9lyMoeBmf \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) August 24, 2023\n\nProminent crypto analyst Bejamin Cowen expects the ETH price to continue falling this summer. According to his recent tweet, he believes the second-largest crypto has been following the same pattern in the summer for several years. According to the chart he shared, for the past few years in the summer the ETH price would first take a big dip and then reverse to surge after that.\n\nIt seems that he expects the same to happen this year as well."

Discover SCENE\n\nMore fans, more creators, more money. For the content creator site OnlyFans, 2022 was a pretty good year. For Ethereum? Maybe not so much.\n\nOver the weekend, Crypto Twitter zeroed in on a financial statement submitted by OnlyFans\u2019 parent company Fenix International Limited to British authorities on Thursday. It showed that the company had owned over $19 million in Ether (ETH), Ethereum\u2019s native token, but its value was slashed to about $11.4 million by the end of the reporting period in November 2022.\n\n\u201cDuring this year, the group diversified part of its working capital into a cryptocurrency asset\u2014ETH or Ethereum,\u201d the company said in a strategic statement that opens the 48-page document. \u201cThere are no limitations or restrictions on the group's ability to sell the cryptocurrency assets. The asset has been impaired to its fair value at the year end.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLast year, OnlyFans\u2014infamous for the many adult performers hosted on the platform\u2014made a splash in the crypto space by announcing that creators could use verified Ethereum NFTs in their profile images. Creators who did so received an Ethereum symbol to show their ownership of the asset.\n\nAt the time, OnlyFans\u2019 CEO Amrapali Gan said the feature\u2014similar to one introduced for Instagram and Facebook by Meta\u2014aimed to \"empower creators to own their full potential.\"\n\n\"This feature is the first step in exploring the role that NFTs can play on our platform,\" Gan told Reuters.\n\nUnfortunately, the company could not have anticipated the crypto bear market lurking around the corner. At the time of the NFT announcement, ETH was trading at $2,797.43, but fell to $1,298.94 by November 30 when the reporting period ended. At the time of writing, ETH is trading at $1,645.90.\n\nImage: Coingecko\n\nLast year was a tumultuous one for cryptocurrency markets. It was marked by a cascade of failures including the collapse of Terra's UST stablecoin and governance token LUNA, the bankruptcy of crypto lender Celsius, and the implosion of cryptocurrency exchange FTX.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut apart from its ETH woes, OnlyFans enjoyed a positive 2022. According to the financial statement, the site saw the company's revenue shoot up to $5.6 billion from $4.8 billion in 2021. It also experienced a 47% increase in the number of creators on its platform, on top of a 27% increase in the total number of subscribers."

        "title": "Is Cardano DEAD? Ethereum Fans claim THIS New Chain will Replace Cardano - CryptoTicker.io - Bitcoin Price, Ethereum Price & Crypto News",
        "content": "Two crypto platforms have consistently garnered attention: Cardano and Ethereum. While both aim to revolutionize the world of decentralized applications and smart contracts, their origins, philosophies, and technical foundations differ significantly. In this article, we delve deep into Cardano, a platform often touted for its research-driven approach, and Ethereum, the pioneering force behind programmable blockchain transactions. Is Cardano dead?\n\nWhat is Cardano?\n\nCardano is a decentralized, open-source blockchain platform that offers a more secure and sustainable infrastructure for the development and execution of smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Created with a research-driven approach, Cardano distinguishes itself by emphasizing peer-reviewed academic research to ensure scalability, sustainability, and security. It employs a unique proof-of-stake consensus algorithm known as Ouroboros, which positions Cardano as a more energy-efficient alternative compared to proof-of-work-based blockchains.\n\nWhen did Cardano Start?\n\nCardano was introduced to the cryptocurrency community in 2017 by one of the co-founders of Ethereum, Charles Hoskinson. Through his technology company IOHK (Input Output Hong Kong), Hoskinson set out to address challenges faced by earlier blockchain platforms, particularly in terms of scalability, security, and sustainability. Cardano\u2019s development journey began a few years earlier, with intensive research leading up to its launch.\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nEthereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain platform that enables developers to build and deploy smart contracts and decentralized applications. It introduced the concept of programmable transactions, thereby extending the basic functionality of a blockchain. While Bitcoin, the pioneer of cryptocurrencies, is primarily a digital currency, Ethereum is more about enabling decentralized digital applications. The Ethereum network is powered by its native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), which is used for transaction fees and computational services on the network.\n\nWhen did Ethereum Start?\n\nEthereum was proposed by programmer Vitalik Buterin in late 2013. Driven by his vision and in collaboration with other developers, the Ethereum platform underwent a public crowdsale in mid-2014 to secure funding for its development. Ethereum\u2019s network officially went live on July 30, 2015, when the genesis block was mined, marking the platform\u2019s inception. Since then, Ethereum has undergone multiple upgrades and has firmly established itself as one of the foremost platforms in the blockchain and cryptocurrency landscape.\n\nCardano\u2019s TVL Challenged by a Newcomer\n\nEthereum enthusiast Evan Van Ness recently highlighted on a prominent platform that Base, an Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) chain released just this year, has overtaken Cardano in terms of Total Value Locked (TVL). With evidence from DeFiLlama, Van Ness labeled Cardano as a \u201czombie chain.\u201d The data indicates that Cardano holds a TVL of $159 million, positioning itself at 14th place. This is in contrast to Ethereum\u2019s massive $21.7 billion TVL.\n\nThe Rise of Base: Coinbase\u2019s Layer 2 Chain\n\nLaunched in partnership with Optimism earlier in the year, Base, a product of Coinbase, has shown remarkable progress. Within a few months of its introduction, it has accrued a TVL of $185 million. The design principle of Layer 2 chains, such as Base, is to amplify the capabilities of the foundational blockchain \u2013 Ethereum in this instance. These Layer 2 solutions boost transaction speed, decrease transaction costs, and magnify scalability. Yet, they still retain the inherent security and decentralized traits of the primary blockchain.\n\nDeveloper-Centric Design and a Powerful Application Suite\n\nCoinbase designed Base with developers in mind. This approach has facilitated effortless synchronization with Coinbase utilities, features, and its user base. Among its diverse range of applications, BaseSwap, SwapBased, and Stargate have been significant contributors to its impressive TVL figures.\n\nIs Cardano DEAD?\n\nContrarily, Cardano showcases its suite of high-performing decentralized apps such as Minswap, Indigo, and Liqwid. It\u2019s pivotal to understand that the label of \u201czombie chain\u201d applied to Cardano by some proponents of rival networks might be overlooking Cardano\u2019s expansive ambitions and ongoing strides in the blockchain space.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might also like\n\nMore from Altcoin"

        "content": "ETH flagged multiple signs indicating that it was ripe for a bullish takeover.\n\nETH whales could be keeping the sell pressure alive.\n\nEthereum [ETH] has been on a bearish streak since the second week of July. Its mid-August dip extended that downside, but now the bulls have been showing signs of exhaustion. Recent findings suggest that accumulation is gaining traction.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nETH delivered sideways price action for the last few days, indicating that the bears are taking a break. According to one of the latest Glassnode alerts, retail addresses have been accumulating at the current levels. The alert reveals that Ethereum addresses holding at least 10 ETH just reached a 4-week high.\n\n? #Ethereum $ETH Number of Addresses Holding 10+ Coins just reached a 1-month high of 348,950 Previous 1-month high of 348,949 was observed on 25 August 2023 View metric:https://t.co/6ggy1nLbSD pic.twitter.com/stSzgk9qDJ \u2014 glassnode alerts (@glassnodealerts) August 26, 2023\n\nThe observation was an indicator that ETH traders were regaining some confidence in the market. This was further backed by the observation that ETH has been flowing out of exchanges. In addition, ETH exchange balances just fell to a multi-year low.\n\nThe last time that ETH exchanges were at the current level was in 2016. This observation was also favorable for a long-term bullish outlook because it confirms a long-term bias.\n\nDespite these findings, ETH bulls remain subdued. This means that the prevailing levels of accumulation are not strong enough for a sizable rally. This is likely because investors are concerned that the downside might continue, especially considering the prevailing threat of higher interest rates.\n\nAnalyzing the key reasons why the bulls remain dormant\n\nThe current state of demand in the derivatives market underscores the aforementioned concern. Usually, a substantial price drop such as the one we observed recently attracts significant demand.\n\nHowever, that price crash was characterized by heavy liquidations. The threat of more downside and subsequent uncertainty resulted in a dip in ETH options open interest.\n\nETH\u2019s estimated leverage ratio is currently hovering at its lowest level in the last 4 weeks. It further emphasizes the point that there is currently a low appetite for the cryptocurrency.\n\nHowever, the usual suspects seem to be the ones holding back the possibility of a rally. Addresses in the 1,000 and 10,000 ETH categories have been shedding off some of their coins, thus contributing to sell pressure.\n\nRead about ETH price prediction for 2023/2024\n\nEvaluating the possibilities\n\nWhile the threat of more downside is real, traders should note that the next FOMC meeting is scheduled to take place in the second half of September. This means there might be an opportunity for the bulls to gain an edge over the market.\n\nBut with the current whale activity, traders should keep an eye out for when whales start to pivot because it would signal the start of a bullish relief."

Do not invest unless you are prepared to lose your entire investment. For a full disclaimer, please click here.\n\nWith December only a few months away, investors holding Ethereum (ETH), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Pomerdoge (POMD) are becoming skeptical about their potential price movements. Let\u2019s look at their current price movements and what analysts have to say.\n\nClick Here To Find Out More About The Pomerdoge (POMD) Presale\n\nEthereum (ETH) Struggling With Bearish Pressure\n\nThe Ethereum coin is trading below both the $1,670 mark and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The altcoin is currently struggling to surpass the $1,680 and $1,700 thresholds. As of press time, Ethereum (ETH) is valued at $1,659.74, a decrease of 0.05% over the last 24 hours.\n\nEthereum bulls are aiming for resistance at the $1,670 level. If they succeed, the price of Ethereum could climb higher and attempt to surpass the resistance at the $1,700 zone. Meanwhile, surpassing this level would spark a major recovery for the altcoin.\n\nHowever, if the Ether falters in surmounting the $1,700 resistance, it could then drop to the $1,640 level. Nevertheless, analysts are bullish and believe the Ethereum price could trade between $2,079.48 and $2,392.52 by December.\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) Price Forecast For December\n\nShiba Inu\u2019s price has dropped from recent highs with declining trading volume, which is typically a bearish sign. However, the drop in the trading volume could be beneficial to the Shiba Inu coi. The drop in trading volume translates to reduced liquidity.\n\nThis means that an increase in buying power could drive the Shiba Inu price up significantly. On the other hand, if a surge of sellers enters the market, it could cause a sharp downward movement. This could affect the meme coin\u2019s price greatly.\n\nCurrently, the price of Shiba Inu (SHIB) is $0.00000809, a 1.14% price decline in the last 24 hours. Nevertheless, analysts are bullish on Shiba Inu. Tradingbeasts have forecasted the memecoin to trade between $0.0000087 and $0.0000127 by December 2023.\n\nPomerdoge (POMD) Eyeing $0.15 By December\n\nPomerdoge (POMD) has emerged as a breath of fresh air in the crypto and gaming space. Notably, the project has managed to capture the community\u2019s attention through its play-to-earn gaming ecosystem. Also, the growing interest in Pomerdoge has led to the sale of over 150 million tokens.\n\nWe have officially raised over $1,500,000\n\n\n\nThere are hundreds of orders in pending since the price is increasing in 3 hours we expect this to significantly rise before the price increases to $0.01https://t.co/3Hm1hYrira pic.twitter.com/NLAYMc7vDH \u2014 Pomerdoge (@pomerdoge) August 25, 2023\n\nExperts are predicting even more significant price surges as the project continues to progress. Central to Pomerdoge is the Pomergame, a forthcoming play-to-earn crypto game. Within this game, players will be able to enhance their in-game characters to elite levels.\n\nWhat truly sets Pomerdoge apart is its unique marketplace called Pomerplace. This marketplace will enable players to monetize their achievements by trading skins, items, and valuables. Additionally, Pomerplace will function as a battle arena for gamers. At present, Pomerdoge\u2019s native token is available for purchase at a mere $0.009.\n\nIntriguingly, analysts have foreseen a remarkable 17x surge prior to the culmination of the presale. Besides, Pomerdoge will capitalize on the ever-expanding online gaming market. With such substantial support, the Pomerdoge token could reach $0.153 by the end of December.\n\nFind out more about the Pomerdoge (POMD) Presale Today:\n\nWebsite: https://pomerdoge.com/\n\nTelegram Community: https://t.me/pomerdoge"

Borroe operates on a dual-purpose framework. It\u2019s an advanced system that taps into AI-powered risk assessment. Furthermore, its underlying blockchain technology ensures security, transparency, and efficiency \u2013 three pillars that have become essential in the decentralized finance world.\n\nThe platform offers a suite of features tailored to both novice and seasoned investors. Whether it\u2019s the real-time analytics providing insights into market movements or its user-friendly interface that makes trading seamless, Borroe\u2019s offerings resonate with a wide spectrum of users.\n\nBorroe\u2019s benefits aren\u2019t just technological. Token holders can expect a plethora of advantages, both immediate and long-term. With the platform\u2019s emphasis on security and transparency, investors can trade with peace of mind. The deflationary nature of the $ROE token, combined with its rising demand, paints a promising picture of huge capital appreciation.\n\nBorroe\u2019s unique presale stages attract forward-looking investors. The presale stages are systematically designed to increase in price. With the Beta Stage already sold out at an initial price of $0.01 and the subsequent stages projecting up to a 300% price boost before it is launched on global exchanges, the growth trajectory of $ROE is nothing short of impressive.\n\n$XRP and $FIL Remain on a Bullish Trajectory\n\nRecent developments have pushed Ripple\u2019s $XRP and Filecoin\u2019s $FIL into the limelight. Ripple, recognized for its swift and cost-effective cross-border transactions, recently emerged victorious against the US SEC.\n\nThis landmark decision has not only improved Ripple\u2019s market position but has also injected renewed confidence into blockchain projects like Filecoin. Despite facing a low in December 2022, FIL\u2019s trajectory has been bullish, with experts forecasting a staggering 1,500% growth in 2023.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: $ETH Slips Under $1,700\n\nEthereum, despite its robust market presence, is experiencing high volatility. One example was its recent dip below $1,700, attributed to news of SpaceX offloading its Bitcoin holdings. This decline was heightened by the escalating liquidations in the DeFi market, with DeFi protocols on the Ethereum blockchain surpassing $75 million in liquidations.\n\nThis trend could further depress Ethereum\u2019s value. However, hope is on the horizon. The US SEC\u2019s potential nod to Ether (ETH) futures Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) might bring about a trend change, allowing investors to access Ethereum akin to stock trading, possibly leading to a substantial price surge.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\n$ROE stands out for its innovation and potential, quickly becoming one of the best crypto to buy. While established tokens like Ethereum undergo market tests, newcomers like $ROE promise a lucrative future \u2013 early investors stand to earn at least 300% before the tokens hit major exchanges.\n\nFor those eager to dive into popular NFTs, the Borroe platform offers a competitive edge that cannot be underestimated. If you are looking for the next big thing in crypto, this may be the ideal moment to join the $ROE presale and participate in the financial revolution!\n\nLearn more about Borroe ($ROE) here:\n\nVisit Borroe Presale | Join The Telegram Group | Follow Borroe on Twitter\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Disclaimer: The information presented does not constitute financial, investment, trading, or other types of advice and is solely the writer\u2019s opinion.\n\nThe lower timeframe price action showed the bears were heavily favored.\n\nEthereum was trading at a higher timeframe support zone, where recovery could be initiated.\n\nEthereum [ETH] has trended downward on the lower timeframe price charts in the past two weeks. Its recent attempts to reclaim the $1700 level were met with failure. The falling MVRV ratio suggested the downtrend was likely to continue.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nThe price action showed the structure was bearish across multiple timeframes from the daily to the 1-hour chart. ETH was within a higher timeframe area of interest where buyers would be interested, but it hasn\u2019t materialized yet. Here\u2019s what the prices can do in the coming week.\n\nThere is a strong chance Ethereum can descend to $1400 if it can\u2019t bounce soon\n\nThe price action of the past two weeks indicated a robust bearish sentiment. The series of lower highs and lower lows have continued in the past four days, although the momentum slowed down. The 1-day chart showed that the $1625-$1680 was a demand zone, where the previous Ethereum rally reaching $2020 was initiated.\n\nHence a bullish structure break on the H4 chart would be the first step toward recovery. The RSI climbed toward neutral 50 to signal a shift in momentum. Yet the OBV did not ascend by a notable amount. This highlighted weak demand and a lack of volatility.\n\nA move below $1620 and a retest of the $1620-$1650 region could offer an opportunity to short ETH. To the south, the $1520-$1550 region could serve as support. Another demand zone lower on the chart was at $1370-$1440.\n\nConviction was lacking in the futures market and bears have the advantage\n\nThe 1-hour chart from Coinalyze showed that the Open Interest did not fluctuate much in the past week. Ethereum saw a bounce from $1580 and $1680 but has sunk to the $1640 level once more. The OI has trended downward in the past three days alongside the decline in price to signal bearish sentiment was prevalent.\n\nHow much are 1, 10, or 100 ETH worth today?\n\nThe spot CVD had been in a downtrend till 23 August but has flattened its path since then. This showed that neither buyers nor sellers had the upper hand. The funding rate was positive and suggested more traders were long than short. Yet, this does not guarantee a bounce by itself.\n\nAggressive ETH bears can wait for a move below $1620 or a move to the liquidity pocket at $1700-$1720 and a rejection to enter short positions."

        "content": "PEPE has accused three of the project\u2019s co-founders of stealing 16 trillion of the meme tokens.\n\nThe co-founders in question removed themselves from the multi-signature wallet after transferring the tokens.\n\nThe tokens remaining in the project\u2019s multisig wallet have since been moved to a new address.\n\nPEPE gained more than 11% following the clarification from its remaining founder.\n\nPopular memecoin project PEPE has accused its co-founders of operating in bad faith and stealing trillions of tokens from its multi-signature wallet. According to one of the project\u2019s founders, three of the co-founders were responsible for the recent suspicious transactions from the multi-sig wallet which resulted in the outflow of over $15 million worth of the meme tokens.\n\nRemaining PEPE In Multi-Sig Transferred To New Address\n\nAccording to a lengthy tweet on PEPE\u2019s official X (formerly Twitter) account, the recent unexpected transactions involving trillions of tokens were the actions of three of the project\u2019s four founders. One of the founders, who claims to be the only one remaining, told the PEPE community that the multi-signature was initially set up to require 3/4 signers present for approval.\n\nHowever, internal strife in the project led to constant conflicts which hindered its progress when it came to making donations or purchases with the multi-sig tokens due to the unavailability of signers. Three of the four people involved in the creation of PEPE reportedly left the project a week after its launch.\n\nAs per the remaining founder, the three ex-team members returned on August 25 and logged into the multi-sig wallet to steal 16 trillion PEPE that were subsequently transferred to centralized crypto exchanges including Binance, OKX, and Kucoin where they were sold. The former team members then removed themselves from the multi-sig and gave its full control to the remaining founder.\n\nThe actions of the former team members led to a 16% decline in PEPE\u2019s price since their transactions spooked investors and traders. The remaining founder confirmed that he had full control of the project\u2019s X account, its multi-sig wallet, and the 10 trillion tokens in the wallet. The founder added that the remaining tokens had been moved to a new address.\n\nI am shocked at what took place and would like to apologize for all of the fear and uncertainty and any losses the actions of these bad actors have caused members of our community.\u201d\n\nThe founder told the PEPE community that the project was free of bad actors and had \u201cclear roads ahead\u201d. They added that they were in talks with prominent members of the crypto community to guide the project going forward. The clarification from the founder led to a hike of over 11% in PEPE\u2019s price."

        "content": "After surpassing investor expectations, Borroe ($ROE) is now attracting Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ethereum (ETH) investors. Borroe ($ROE) is still in presale but has already shown great potential, especially after rising by 25%. But will that be enough to make it surpass Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ethereum (ETH)? Let\u2019s see what investors are saying.\n\n>>BUY $ROE TOKENS NOW<<\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) Falls As Space X Dumps All Crypto Holdings\n\nLike many tokens, Dogecoin (DOGE) has been seriously declining over the past few days. Dogecoin\u2019s (DOGE) drop followed SpaceX\u2019s announcement that it had sold off nearly $400 million worth of crypto. The news shocked many investors who feared that SpaceX and its founder were no longer as bullish on cryptocurrencies, especially on Dogecoin (DOGE).\n\nWhile Elon Musk has been open about his likeness to Dogecoin (DOGE), the only digital asset his companies have purchased is Bitcoin (BTC) \u2013 which also uses the Proof of Work Consensus like Dogecoin (DOGE).\n\nAfter the announcement of SpaceX\u2019s crypto sale, the market was hit with a wave of liquidations, and several tokens crashed. Some investors say Dogecoin (DOGE) could rise by 12.6% to $0.071 due to its high investor demand as the market starts recovering.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Drops Despite Excitement Around Pending Futures ETFs\n\nReports from Bloomberg indicate that the SEC is poised to approve Ethereum (ETH) Futures ETFs. While there has been no official confirmation of which funds will receive approval, Ethereum (ETH) holders are already jubilant, with many believing that Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) value will go up.\n\nA similar thing happened when bullish excitement around Bitcoin ETFs filled the market, leading Bitcoin\u2019s price to rise above $31,000. Now, Ethereum (ETH) is expected to pull off a similar price increase.\n\nAnalysts expect Ethereum (ETH) to rise by 10.7% to $1,850 due to excitement around ETH Futures ETFs. In addition, Ethereum (ETH) is still one of the best DeFi projects on the market, so it might be a good crypto buy now.\n\nBorroe ($ROE): Unlocking Hidden Potential Within Short-term Capital Markets\n\nMany crypto firms and Web 3.0-based brands have complained about a lack of easy access to short-term capital. Most traditional revenue finance providers take lengthy delays, costing businesses more time and money.\n\nFortunately, a viable solution has emerged. Borroe ($ROE) Finance is the intersection of the revenue finance industry and blockchain technology. Borroe ($ROE) intends to provide easy access to short-term capital markets by revamping the fundraising process.\n\nBorroe ($ROE) uses fractionalized NFTs and AI to ease taking loans using future invoices as collateral. Moreover, the platform ensures appropriate risk assessment techniques are in place to provide the needed comfort to attract investors.\n\nBorroe\u2019s ($ROE) approach to revenue financing is expected to make it one of the best cryptocurrency investments. But that\u2019s not all there is. Its marketplace offers multiple rewards, including discounts and notifications of special funding requests.\n\nIn addition, Borroe ($ROE) currently costs $0.0125, but it is expected to rise to $0.040 by the end of its presale, a 220% ROI, granting its investors further gains.\n\nLearn more about Borroe ($ROE) here:"

        "content": "The DeFi hack occurred only a few days after the protocol had publicly disclosed a vulnerability affecting its boosted pools.\n\nThe protocol\u2019s team promptly addressed the situation by acknowledging the exploit related to the disclosed vulnerability.\n\nBalancer, the Ethereum [ETH]-based decentralized finance [DeFi] protocol, fell victim to an exploit resulting in losses of nearly $900,000. This incident occurred only a few days after the protocol had publicly disclosed a vulnerability affecting its boosted pools. The protocol itself confirmed the exploit and subsequent loss on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) on 27 August.\n\nBalancer is aware of an exploit related to the vulnerability below.

While they had taken mitigation measures to significantly reduce risks, they also clarified that it was not possible to stop the affected pools.\n\nTo avert further breaches, the team recommended that users withdraw from the impacted liquidity pools.\n\nBalancer disclosed the critical vulnerability in question on 22 August. This prompted an urgent call for users to withdraw funds from liquidity providers and leading to the temporary suspension of pools.\n\nThe vulnerability posed a threat to assets deployed on various platforms. These include Ethereum, Polygon [MATIC], Arbitrum [ARB)], Optimism [OP], Avalanche [AVAX], Gnosis [GNO], Fantom [FTM], and zkEVM.\n\nBalancer has received a critical vulnerability report affecting a number of V2 Pools. Emergency mitigation procedures have been executed to secure a majority of TVL, but some funds remain at risk.

However, as of 24 August, a significant level of risk persisted, with at least $2.8 million remaining vulnerable, accounting for 0.42% of the total locked value.\n\nBalancer issued a warning to its users on X, advising them about the status of their funds across various pools. They underscored that funds within the mitigated pools labeled as \u2018mitigated\u2019 were categorized as safe.\n\nNevertheless, users were strongly recommended to contemplate migrating to more secure pools or initiating fund withdrawals. Pools that remained susceptible were designated as \u2018at risk,\u2019 prompting LPs engaged in those pools to promptly exit.\n\nThe protocol closely intertwined its journey with its deployment on the Optimism network in June of the previous year. This deployment aimed to enhance user functionality while reducing transaction fees, making it more accessible and cost-effective for participants."

        "title": "Ethereum 2.0 Deposit Contract Reaches All Time High, Hacked Crypto Exchange Cypher Plans to Hold Public Token ... - Tekedia",
        "content": "The Ethereum 2.0 deposit contract, which holds the funds of users who want to stake on the new proof-of-stake network, has reached a new milestone. According to data from Etherscan, the deposit contract now holds over 28 million ETH, worth more than $4.6 billion at current prices. This is the highest amount of ETH ever locked in the contract, surpassing the previous peak of 8.4 million ETH in May 2021.\n\nThe deposit contract was launched in November 2020, ahead of the launch of the Ethereum 2.0 beacon chain, which is the first phase of the network upgrade. Users who want to become validators on the new network have to deposit at least 32 ETH into the contract and run a node that validates transactions and produces blocks. In return, they receive rewards in ETH for securing the network and participating in consensus.\n\nThe deposit contract is a one-way bridge, meaning that users cannot withdraw their funds until the merge of Ethereum 1.0 and Ethereum 2.0 transitioning will happened sometime in 2022. The merge marked the end of proof-of-work mining on Ethereum and the transition to a fully proof-of-stake network.\n\nThe growth of the deposit contract reflects the increasing interest and confidence in Ethereum 2.0, which promises to improve the scalability, security and sustainability of the network. According to data from Beaconcha.in, there are currently over 260,000 active validators on the beacon chain, with more than 100,000 pending validators waiting to join. The current annual percentage rate (APR) for staking on Ethereum 2.0 is around 6%, which is higher than most traditional investments.\n\nThe deposit contract also serves as a measure of the long-term commitment of ETH holders, who are willing to lock their funds for an indefinite period of time and support the development of the network. As more ETH gets deposited into the contract, the supply of ETH on the market decreases, which could have a positive impact on the price of ETH in the future.\n\nThe recent market crash has seen the price of Ethereum (ETH) drop to the $1600 range in August 2023, a level not seen since June 2023. However, not everyone is panicking. Some large investors, known as Ether Whales, have taken advantage of the dip and accumulated more ETH. According to data from Santiment, a blockchain analytics firm, the top 10 non-exchange ETH addresses have added more ETHERs to their holdings in the past days, worth about $94 million at current prices. This shows that these whales are confident in the long-term prospects of Ethereum and its network upgrade to Ethereum 2.0, which aims to improve scalability, security and energy efficiency.\n\nEthereum 2.0 is expected to be fully operational in late 2023 or early 2024, after several delays and technical challenges. The upgrade will transition Ethereum from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, which relies on miners to validate transactions, to a proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism, which rewards validators for staking their ETH. This will reduce the network\u2019s carbon footprint and allow for faster and cheaper transactions.\n\nThe Ether Whales are likely betting on the future growth of Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem, which hosts a variety of decentralized applications (DApps) in sectors such as decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), gaming and social media. Ethereum is the most popular platform for DApps, with over 3,000 active DApps and over 100,000 daily users, according to DappRadar. Despite the current market downturn, Ethereum\u2019s fundamentals remain strong, and its innovation continues. The Ether Whales may be ahead of the curve and scooping up ETH at a bargain price before the next bull run.\n\nHacked Crypto Exchange Cypher Plans to Hold Public Token Sale\n\nCypher, a crypto exchange that suffered a major hack in June, has announced its plans to hold a public token sale in October. The exchange claims that the token sale is part of its recovery strategy and that it has secured the support of its investors and users.\n\nAccording to a blog post published by Cypher on Monday, the exchange will issue 100 million CYP tokens, which will represent 20% of its equity. The tokens will be sold at a price of $0.1 each, valuing the exchange at $50 million. The token sale will be conducted on a decentralized platform called Launchpad, which is powered by Binance Smart Chain.\n\nCypher said that the token sale will help it raise funds to reimburse its users who lost their funds in the hack, as well as to upgrade its security and infrastructure. The exchange also said that it will use part of the proceeds to launch new products and services, such as margin trading, futures, and options.\n\nThe exchange added that it has obtained the approval of its existing investors, who have agreed to convert their shares into CYP tokens. Cypher also said that it has received positive feedback from its users, who have expressed their interest in participating in the token sale and supporting the exchange\u2019s recovery.\n\nCypher was hacked on June 15, when an unknown attacker exploited a vulnerability in its smart contract and drained $25 million worth of crypto assets from its hot wallet. The exchange suspended its operations and reported the incident to the authorities. Cypher said that it has been working with law enforcement agencies and cybersecurity experts to track down the hacker and recover the stolen funds.\n\nThe hackers managed to steal over $200 million worth of various cryptocurrencies from the exchange\u2019s hot wallets, as well as compromising the personal data of millions of users.\n\nThe hack was announced by Cypher on its official website and social media channels, where it apologized to its customers and assured them that it is working with law enforcement agencies and security experts to investigate the incident and recover the stolen funds. Cypher also said that it will compensate its users for any losses they may have suffered as a result of the hack, and that it has temporarily suspended all deposits, withdrawals, and trading activities on its platform.\n\nThe hack is one of the biggest and most devastating cyberattacks in the history of the crypto industry, and it has shaken the confidence of many investors and traders in the security and reliability of crypto exchanges. The hack also raises questions about the regulatory oversight and compliance of crypto exchanges, as well as the best practices for storing and managing crypto assets.\n\nHere are some tips on how to protect yourself and your crypto assets from such hacks:\n\nUse a reputable and regulated crypto exchange that follows high security standards and has insurance coverage for its users\u2019 funds.\n\nDo not store large amounts of crypto on exchange wallets, especially hot wallets that are connected to the internet. Use cold wallets or hardware wallets that are offline and more secure.\n\nEnable two-factor authentication (2FA) and use strong passwords for your exchange accounts. Do not share your login credentials or private keys with anyone.\n\nBeware of phishing emails, fake websites, and social media scams that may try to trick you into revealing your personal information or sending your crypto to malicious addresses.\n\n\u2013 Monitor your exchange accounts and crypto transactions regularly and report any suspicious or unauthorized activity to your exchange and law enforcement authorities.\n\nCypher is not the first crypto exchange to hold a token sale after a hack. In 2017, Bitfinex issued BFX tokens to compensate its users who lost their funds in a $72 million hack in 2016. The exchange later redeemed all the BFX tokens and replaced them with equity tokens called LEO.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nWhatsApp\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n"

        "title": "Ethereum Halving Date: What is Ethereum Triple Halving? Countdown - Bitcoinsensus",
        "content": "The Ethereum Triple Halving refers to a significant reduction in the rate at which new Ether (ETH), Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, is generated and consequently enters the market.\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, Ethereum does not have a halving event in its protocol. However, with upcoming Ethereum upgrades, the issuance rate of new Ether will decrease dramatically, mimicking the three consecutive Bitcoin halving events.\n\nThe Ethereum Halving Date is not a fixed date, but rather a period during which significant protocol upgrades are implemented ((most notably the transition to Ethereum 2.0 with Proof of Stake consensus).\n\nThese upgrades are crucial as they potentially influence Ether\u2019s price, the security of the network, and the overall development of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nTo trade ETH with leverage, sign-up for Bybit right now! Bybit\u2019s BIGGEST Bonus Campaign is now live! You can get up to a $30,000 Bonus when you fund your Bybit account with our Bybit link\n\nClaim up to $30,030 in Bonus 100x Leverage Start Trading\n\nThe Logic Behind Halving Events in Blockchain\n\nWhile Bitcoin\u2019s halving is a pre-set event that occurs approximately every four years, halving the block reward for miners, Ethereum\u2019s Triple Halving is a more gradual process resulting from multiple updates, including EIP-1559 and the transition to Ethereum 2.0.\n\nThese events, whether in Bitcoin or in Ethereum, are designed to reduce the rate at which new cryptocurrency enters the market. This can lead to decreased selling pressure from miners and potentially deflationary conditions, which can influence the asset\u2019s price.\n\nWhy the Triple Halving is a Major Event\n\nEconomic implications for Ethereum:\n\nA drastic reduction in Ether issuance is likely to have a profound impact on Ethereum\u2019s economic model. It could create scarcity, potentially driving up demand and the price of Ether.\n\nSupply dynamics and deflationary pressure:\n\nWith the implementation of EIP-1559, part of the Ether used in transaction fees is burnt, removing it from circulation. Combined with the reduced issuance of new Ether, this could potentially make Ether deflationary, a sharp contrast to its current inflationary model.\n\nEthereum Halving Date\n\n1) Tools and resources to track the Ethereum Halving Date\n\nWhile there is no fixed Ethereum Halving Date, investors and developers closely follow Ethereum\u2019s upgrade timelines. Websites like etherscan.io and ethresear.ch Provide detailed information on the progress of Ethereum network upgrades.\n\n2) How the countdown works\n\nAs opposed to a precise countdown, tracking the Ethereum Triple Halving involves monitoring the progress of various Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) and the rollout of Ethereum 2.0 phases.\n\nCommunity and developer discussions, as well as official announcements, provide insights into these significant changes.\n\nImpact on Ethereum\u2019s Price\n\n1) Historical analysis of price movements post-halving:\n\nWhile Ethereum doesn\u2019t have a history of halving events like Bitcoin, significant network upgrades have had varying impacts on its price.\n\nFor instance, after major upgrades, Ether\u2019s price has sometimes increased due to improved scalability and security. The \u2018Triple Halving\u2019, as a concept, might produce a similar scarcity effect, potentially driving up Ether\u2019s value.\n\n2) Speculations and expert opinions:\n\nVarious financial analysts and cryptocurrency experts speculate that reducing the issuance of new Ether could make it more scarce, which, according to basic economic principles, may drive up its price if demand remains constant or increases.\n\nHowever, the actual impact would depend on numerous factors, including overall market conditions.\n\nClaim up to $30,030 in Bonus 100x Leverage Start Trading\n\nWhat Does Triple Halving Mean for Miners?\n\n1) Changing rewards for miners\n\nThe metaphorical \u2018Triple Halving\u2019 would significantly decrease the issuance rate of new Ether, which is a substantial part of miners\u2019 rewards.\n\nMiners would increasingly rely on transaction fees as their source of income, a dynamic shift from the current block reward system.\n\n2) Adjustments and strategies for Ethereum miners\n\nAs block rewards decrease, miners may need to reevaluate their operations. Efficient energy usage will become more crucial, and some may need to transition to other more profitable blockchains or consider staking Ether if they transition to validating in Ethereum 2.0.\n\nAll You Need To Know About Ethereum 2.0 and Triple Halving\n\n1) Transition to Proof of Stake\n\nEthereum 2.0 marks the transition from the current Proof of Work consensus mechanism to Proof of Stake. This transition will dramatically reduce the energy consumption of the Ethereum network.\n\nIn a PoS system, validators replace miners in the creation of new blocks. This transition is part of the broader Ethereum upgrades that are metaphorically referred to as a \u2018Triple Halving\u2019 due to the expected reduction in Ether issuance.\n\n2) Relationship between Ethereum 2.0 and the Triple Halving event\n\nThe transition to Ethereum 2.0 is central to the concept of the \u2018Triple Halving\u2019 as it is expected to dramatically reduce the issuance of new Ether.\n\nThe upgrade to Ethereum 2.0 will improve the scalability, security, and sustainability of the network, and it plays a crucial role in the economic changes that the \u2018Triple Halving\u2019 concept highlights.\n\nHow to Prepare for Ethereum\u2019s Triple Halving\n\n1) Strategies for investors and miners\n\nFor investors, this period could present an opportunity to reconsider their portfolio allocations, potentially increasing their holdings in Ether if they believe the \u2018Triple Halving\u2019 will have a positive effect on its price.\n\nFor miners, considering a transition to staking (in anticipation of Ethereum 2.0\u2019s Proof of Stake mechanism) might be a strategy, or alternatively, evaluating other profitable blockchain networks for mining opportunities.\n\n2) Risks and rewards to consider\n\nInvestors need to consider the volatility that may come with these changes; while scarcity could drive up Ether\u2019s price, market dynamics are unpredictable.\n\nMiners face the risk of decreased revenues due to lower block rewards, but the transition to Proof of Stake in Ethereum 2.0 offers the potential reward of becoming a validator rather than a miner.\n\nFuture of Ethereum Post-Triple Halving\n\n1) Long-term implications for the Ethereum network\n\nA significant reduction in Ether issuance could lead to greater scarcity and potential deflationary pressures on the asset, influencing its value proposition.\n\nThe network\u2019s security dynamics will also change with Ethereum 2.0, shifting from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake.\n\n2) Expert predictions and possible scenarios\n\nSome experts predict that a substantial decrease in Ether issuance might lead to a price increase, similar to Bitcoin\u2019s price action after halving events.\n\nOthers caution that Ethereum\u2019s broader adoption and use case as a platform for decentralized applications may create different market dynamics.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe \u2018Triple Halving\u2019 is a metaphorical term referring to the significant reduction in new Ether issuance, akin to Bitcoin\u2019s halving events but achieved through Ethereum\u2019s network upgrades.\n\nThis shift has the potential to change Ethereum\u2019s economic model, making it more scarce and potentially impacting its price significantly.\n\nWhile there is no fixed countdown to a \u2018Triple Halving\u2019 event, the changes encapsulated by this term represent a pivotal point in Ethereum\u2019s development.\n\nThese changes will redefine the economic model of Ethereum and could have substantial implications for both investors and participants in the network.\n\nClaim up to $30,030 in Bonus 100x Leverage Start Trading\n\nHow to Trade Bitcoin (BTC)?\n\nTo understand the basics of Bitcoin trading, you can read our How To Trade Bitcoin Guide.

        "content": "Starknet, a se\u00adcond-layer network constructed on the\u00ad Ethe\u00adreum blockchain using the Kakarot virtual machine\u00ad and the Cairo programming language, has become\u00ad the first layer-two (L2) solution in Ethe\u00adreum\u2019s history to exceed 100 transactions pe\u00adr second (TPS).\n\nOn August 25, 2023, Starknet reached a high-speed point of 126 transactions per second. This is a big upgrade compared to Ethe\u00adreum\u2019s current abilities on its main network, where it can only manage about 15 transactions per second.\n\nThe remarkable\u00ad team behind Starknet is StarkWare\u00ad Ltd., whose CEO and co-founder Uri Kolodny is dete\u00adrmined to push the boundaries e\u00adven further. Kolodny ambition is to achieve\u00ad an unprecedente\u00add milestone of 1000 TPS for the L2 network powered by StarkWare:\n\n\u201cStarknet is the first L2 to break the 100 TPS mark. I\u2019ll bet an ice cream it will also be the first to break the 1000 TPS mark.\u201d\n\nMoreover, Starknet continue\u00ads its ascent as it attracts an increasing number of de\u00adcentralized applications (dApps) onto its platform.

        "title": "OnlyFans see record profits as owner rakes in $485 million amid Ethereum investment - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "In a year marked by unprecedented growth for online adult content platforms, OnlyFans, the British adult content subscription service, has emerged as a dominant force. The company\u2019s revenues surpassed the $1 billion mark for the first time in 2022, reflecting a significant surge in demand for its services. Predominantly focused on pornographic material, the platform has seen an influx of both content creators and subscribers.\n\nSurge in popularity: OnlyFans\u2019 billion-dollar milestone\n\nLeonid Radvinsky, the US-based Ukrainian entrepreneur who acquired OnlyFans in 2018, has reaped substantial rewards from the platform\u2019s success. Recent accounts filed with Companies House reveal that Radvinsky collected a staggering $485 million in dividends since the beginning of the previous year. This financial windfall comes in the wake of over 50 million new users registering on the site in the 12 months leading up to November 2022. Additionally, the platform welcomed over 1 million new content creators, with users collectively spending an impressive $5.5 billion on the site.\n\nThe company\u2019s financial health is further underscored by its sales figures. OnlyFans reported a 17% increase in sales, amounting to $1.1 billion for the year. Even more notably, its pre-tax profits witnessed a 21% jump, reaching $525 million during the same period.\n\nDiversifying investments: OnlyFans\u2019 foray into cryptocurrency\n\nIn a move that signals the company\u2019s forward-thinking approach and its intent to diversify its investment portfolio, OnlyFans disclosed that it has channeled some of its capital into Ethereum, a leading cryptocurrency. This strategic decision not only showcases the firm\u2019s adaptability to a rapidly evolving digital landscape but also its commitment to leveraging emerging technologies and financial instruments to ensure sustained growth and profitability.\n\nDespite its financial successes, OnlyFans has not been without its share of controversies. A BBC News investigation last year unearthed alarming findings that children had managed to sell and appear in videos on the platform. This was particularly concerning given the site\u2019s claims of restricting access to individuals below the age of 18.\n\nIn response to these concerns, OnlyFans has been proactive in emphasizing its dedication to safety and security. The company stated in its accounts that it \u201cgoes above and beyond the legal requirements, and our peers, to provide a safe platform for creators and fans.\u201d\n\nThe platform prides itself on striking a balance between ensuring safety and allowing creators and fans the autonomy to produce, view, and monetize lawful content.\n\nOnlyFans\u2019 revenue model and public controversies\n\nThe revenue model of OnlyFans is structured such that the company retains approximately \u00a31 for every \u00a34 earned by its content creators. This model has proven lucrative for many of its adult content creators, some of whom have amassed fortunes on the platform. One such creator disclosed to the Standard that she had earned over \u00a34 million on OnlyFans, subsequently investing a portion of her earnings in a rival platform.\n\nPublic perception of the platform and its creators remains mixed. OnlyFans celebrity, Eliza Rose Watson, recently found herself at the center of a controversy. Watson faced backlash for displaying posters featuring a model in a bra top across billboards in locations such as Harrow, Tottenham, Lambeth, and Edgware. Critics argued that such imagery was inappropriate for younger audiences. However, the UK advertising regulator weighed in on the matter, ruling that the image was neither overtly sexual nor objectifying towards women.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs OnlyFans continues its trajectory of growth and profitability, it faces the dual challenge of maintaining its financial momentum while addressing safety concerns and public perception. The company\u2019s recent moves, from investing in Ethereum to reinforcing its safety protocols, indicate a willingness to evolve and adapt in a dynamic digital age."
