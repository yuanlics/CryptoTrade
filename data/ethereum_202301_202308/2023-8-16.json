        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum Now Less Volatile Than Oil: Report\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum Appear To Be Experiencing A Period Of Reduced Volatility\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum, well-known for their erratic price fluctuations, appear to be experiencing a period of reduced volatility.\n\nSurprisingly, oil currently has more volatility than these digital currencies. The 90-day volatility indexes for Bitcoin and Ethereum have fallen to multi-year lows, falling by 35% and 37%, respectively, according to latest Open in a new tab from Kaiko research. As a result, compared to oil, which has a 41% volatility rate, these top cryptocurrencies are now less volatile.\n\nThe frequency and magnitude of price movements over time are indicated by market volatility. In the past, cryptocurrencies have been more volatile than oil, as seen by their bigger and more frequent price fluctuations.\n\nDespite the fact that oil currently dominates the Nasdaq and gold in terms of volatility, it has actually fallen from a volatility rate of 63% in July 2022. Increased geopolitical tensions and China's underwhelming economic rebound following the relaxation of Covid-19 limitations may be to blame for this drop in oil's volatility.\n\nKaiko's research also highlights that both Bitcoin and Ethereum are currently experiencing multi-year lows in terms of liquidity and trade volume, which could contribute to their decreased volatility.\n\nThe anticipated launch of an exchange-traded fund (ETF) for Bitcoin may stir up market volatility once again. This gained credibility in the wake of BlackRock's unexpected ETF application, given the firm's track record of successful applications and the subsequent actions of other applicants."

Despite the existence of DApp development in the blockchain space, platforms were not interoperable. Buterin envisioned Ethereum uniting them. According to him, standardizing how DApps operate and interact was the only way to sustain adoption. So Ethereum 1.0 was created.\n\nOver time, developers brought their own decentralized concepts to Ethereum. These users established the DAO in 2016, a democratic organization that voted on network adjustments and proposals. The organization was supported by a smart contract and did not require a CEO to wield authority over Ethereum. Instead, a majority vote was required for modifications to be implemented. DAO voted to \u201chard fork\u201d Ethereum to tackle security vulnerabilities by effectively undergoing a significant software update. This new variant kept the name Ethereum, whereas the original network is known as Ethereum Classic.\n\nThe Evolution of the Ethereum Blockchain\n\nSince its launch in July 2015, the Ethereum blockchain network has endured a number of upgrades and modifications. Among the most important:\n\nFrontier (2015): This was the first release of the Ethereum network, which permitted users to construct and deploy their own smart contracts and decentralized applications.\n\nHomestead (2016): This introduced a number of enhancements, including security enhancements, gas optimizations, and network stability enhancements.\n\nMetropolis (2017-2019): This was a two-part upgrade comprised of Byzantium and Constantinople for Metropolis (2017-2019). Byzantium implemented significant enhancements, including a new mining algorithm, enhanced privacy features, and a decrease in block rewards. Constantinople included upgrades to decrease transaction fees, improve efficiency, and introduce new features such as off-chain transactions.\n\nIstanbul (2019): This included the integration of zk-SNARKs (a type of zero-knowledge cryptography), a new mining algorithm, and numerous protocol upgrades to improve network efficiency and security.\n\nBeacon Chain (2020): In November 2020, the required 16,384 deposits of 32 staked ETH were successfully made to assure Beacon Chain\u2019s secure operation. As a consequence, the Beacon Chain began producing blocks on December 1, 2020, marking a significant step towards the realization of the Ethereum vision.\n\nBerlin (2021): This protocol upgrade in Berlin, 2021, introduced several new features, including gas charge optimizations, enhanced security measures, and a reduction in transaction fees for certain types of transactions.\n\nLondon (2021): This introduced EIP-1559, which altered the method by which Ethereum network transaction fees are calculated. This upgrade introduced a fee burn mechanism, which helps reduce the total supply of ETH and introduces a more predictable fee structure for consumers.\n\nParis (The Merge \u2014 2022): The Paris upgrade was activated when the proof-of-work blockchain reached a terminal total difficulty of 58750000000000000000000 on September 15, 2022, at block 15,537393. The transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake was a significant milestone for Ethereum, which was triggered on the following block. Along with this change, the upgrade included enhancements to the execution clients, similar to Bellatrix on the consensus layer, allowing the execution clients to receive instructions from their connected consensus clients by activating a new set of internal API methods known as the Engine API.\n\nThese upgrades have introduced numerous enhancements to the Ethereum network in terms of security, efficiency, and scalability, and have increased the network\u2019s functionality.\n\nShapella or Shanghai (2023): Since switching to a proof-of-stake system, Ethereum has just undergone its first significant upgrade, or \u201chard fork.\u201d The Shanghai upgrade permits validators to extricate staked ether (ETH) from the network. While the primary objective of the upgrade is to implement Ethereum Improvement Proposal-4895, which enables validator withdrawals, other significant upgrades will impact Ethereum app developers and a significant portion of the chain\u2019s users.\n\nThe enhancement will alter the functioning of the blockchain. A reduction in petrol fees for layer-2 solutions like Polygon is one of the most significant modifications. This update seeks to improve the blockchain\u2019s overall functionality and reduce transaction fees. The ability for users to access and unstake their Ethereum tokens, which were previously sealed in a smart contract when they became validators on the proof-of-stake-based Ethereum blockchain known as Beacon Chain, is another significant change. This update gives users more options for administering their staked ETH tokens.\n\nThe Shanghai update introduces technical enhancements to the smart contract feature, which will help to position Ethereum as a significant player and reflect Ethereum\u2019s ongoing efforts to improve its technology and increase user value.\n\nFeatures of Ethereum\n\nSmart contracts: One of the key innovations introduced by Ethereum is the concept of smart contracts. These self-executing contracts are coded agreements that automatically enforce the terms and conditions defined within them. Built on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain, smart contracts eliminate the need for intermediaries, reducing costs and increasing efficiency. They can be utilized across various industries, including finance, supply chain management, and real estate, to automate processes and enable trustless transactions. The primary characteristic of a smart contract is that it cannot be modified once it has been executed, and any transaction performed on top of a smart contract is recorded perpetually; it is immutable. Therefore, even if the smart contract is modified in the future, the transactions associated with the original contract cannot be modified.\n\nEthereum virtual machine (EVM): The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a crucial component of the Ethereum network. It is a runtime environment that executes smart contracts, allowing developers to build and deploy decentralized applications (dApps) on top of the Ethereum blockchain. The EVM\u2019s Turing-complete programming language, Solidity, provides developers with a powerful toolset to create complex and innovative applications. This has led to a thriving ecosystem of dApps, ranging from decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces.\n\nEther: Ether (ETH) serves as the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network. It plays a vital role in facilitating transactions and incentivizing the network\u2019s participants. Unlike Bitcoin, which primarily serves as a digital store of value, Ether has dual functionality. It can be used both as a digital currency and as \u201cgas\u201d to power computations and execute smart contracts on the Ethereum network. This duality enhances the flexibility and utility of Ether within the ecosystem.\n\nDecentralized applications (dApps): A Dapp program operates on a decentralized peer-to-peer network. It is software designed to operate in the Ethereum network without a centralized system, and that is the primary distinction: it enables direct interaction between end-users and decentralized application providers. When an application is open-source (its code is on Github) and employs a public blockchain-based token to run, it is considered a Dapp. A token serves as the propellant for a decentralized application. Dapp permits the decentralization of back-end code and data, and this is the primary architecture of any Dapp.\n\nDecentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs): A DAO is a decentralized and democratic digital organization that operates without hierarchical management. Essentially, a DAO is an organization in which decision-making is delegated to certain designated authorities or a group of designated individuals as part of an authority, as opposed to a centralized authority. DAOs rely on smart contracts for decision-making, or decentralized voting systems, within the organization, as they exist on a blockchain network that is governed by the embedded protocols of a smart contract. Before any organizational decisions can be made, the voting system, which is a decentralized application, must be utilized.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the Ethereum network stands as a groundbreaking platform that has revolutionized the world of blockchain technology. With its smart contract functionality and decentralized nature, Ethereum has empowered developers and entrepreneurs to create innovative applications and ushered in a new era of decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and decentralized applications (DApps).\n\nMoreover, Ethereum\u2019s scalability solutions, such as Ethereum 2.0 with the introduction of the Beacon Chain and shard chains, are poised to address the network\u2019s scalability limitations, ensuring that it can handle a larger number of transactions while maintaining security and decentralization. Looking toward the future, the Ethereum network shows great promise and potential for further growth and development. Ethereum 2.0\u2019s full implementation is anticipated to bring significant improvements in terms of scalability, energy efficiency, and transaction throughput, which will open doors to even more widespread adoption."

        "title": "Should You Buy Ethereum While It's Still Down? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "After a long, discouraging crypto winter, prices have been slowly recovering so far this year.\n\nEthereum (ETH 0.70%) is currently up by around 53% in 2023, but it's still down nearly 62% from its all-time high in late 2021. If you've been waiting for the right time to invest, now may seem like a smart buying opportunity, as crypto prices steadily inch closer to their previous peaks.\n\nBut some investors are still cautious, which is understandable considering how quickly the crypto market crashed last year. The last thing anyone wants is to invest while prices are higher, only to have the market plummet yet again.\n\nSo is it really a smart time to invest in Ethereum? The answer is, it depends.\n\nThe case for investing now\n\nMarket volatility is always unnerving, but it's especially challenging in the crypto space. While Ethereum has experienced incredible highs over the last few years, the lows can be unbearable for many investors.\n\nHowever, remember that crypto is a long-term investment. Even the strongest cryptocurrencies will likely see extreme volatility in the near term, but the best investments have the potential for significant long-term growth.\n\nEthereum remains one of the strongest players in the industry, and it has some major advantages over its competitors, including:\n\nIts sheer size: With a market cap of around $221 billion, Ethereum makes up just under 20% of the entire crypto market. While popularity alone doesn't necessarily make for a strong investment, it's tough for smaller cryptocurrencies to compete with a behemoth like Ethereum -- putting it in a league of its own.\n\nWith a market cap of around $221 billion, Ethereum makes up just under 20% of the entire crypto market. While popularity alone doesn't necessarily make for a strong investment, it's tough for smaller cryptocurrencies to compete with a behemoth like Ethereum -- putting it in a league of its own. It's the leading smart contract platform: The Ethereum blockchain is host to a wide variety of decentralized applications (dApps), ranging from NFT marketplaces to metaverse applications to decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. Although many other networks (such as Solana and Cardano ) can also host dApps, Ethereum is far and away the most popular platform.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain is host to a wide variety of decentralized applications (dApps), ranging from NFT marketplaces to metaverse applications to decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. Although many other networks (such as and ) can also host dApps, Ethereum is far and away the most popular platform. It's constantly updating: Last year, Ethereum developers successfully completed The Merge, a landmark upgrade that moved the network from the energy-intensive proof-of-work system to the far more efficient proof-of-stake. But there are many other updates still in the pipeline -- most notably The Surge, which should vastly improve the network's speed and reduce transaction fees.\n\nIn other words, Ethereum has a lot going for it right now. It's consistently been one of the clear leaders in the crypto space, and if it continues its upgrades and improvements, it has the potential to soar even more over time.\n\nWhen it may be best to avoid Ethereum\n\nAs with any cryptocurrency, Ethereum is still largely speculative. While it has many distinct advantages, those are mostly speculative right now, too.\n\nIf NFTs, the metaverse, or DeFi become more mainstream, Ethereum will benefit from it. But if those applications never catch on with the public, the crypto may have a tough time staying relevant. Right now, nobody can say how this space will fare over the long term, and there's always a chance it could fail.\n\nThis isn't to say you shouldn't invest in Ethereum for these reasons. For many investors, the potentially lucrative earnings outweigh the risk of crypto's speculative nature. But in general, even the \"safest\" cryptocurrencies are still more volatile than stocks -- which can be a deal-breaker for more risk-averse investors.\n\nIf you're on the fence, ask yourself which of these two scenarios you'd regret more: investing now and losing money if Ethereum fails, or not investing and missing out on those earnings if it succeeds.\n\nThere's no right or wrong answer here, but it can help you determine where your priorities lie. If your biggest concern is making a bad investment and losing money, crypto in general may not be the best fit for you right now.\n\nCrypto can be incredibly volatile, and it's important to consider your risk tolerance before you invest. That said, Ethereum has built a reputation for being a leader in the industry, and it has plenty of advantages that could make it a smart buy right now."

        "title": "Ethereum co-founder praises X's Community Notes for echoing crypto principles - crypto.news",
        "content": "Ethereum co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, has lauded X\u2019s new Community Notes feature, highlighting its alignment with core blockchain values despite its non-cryptocurrency origins.\n\nIn December 2022, the social media giant formerly known as Twitter, now X, launched Community Notes. Since then, it has steadily grown in prominence, establishing itself as a cornerstone tool for the platform.\n\nOpen-source in nature, Community Notes allows anyone to participate as a contributor. Though still recognized as being in its developmental pilot phase, the feature plays a central role in a burgeoning community dedicated to identifying and correcting misinformation on the microblogging platform.\n\nWhat do I think about Community Notes?https://t.co/9A0PnanndM \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) August 16, 2023\n\nVitalik Buterin remarked on the striking parallels between the tool and some blockchain projects. He praised its decentralized essence, the emphasis on community engagement, and its transparent coding structure.\n\nIn a recent blog post, Buterin went on record to say that Community Notes serves as a \u201cremarkably useful\u201d tool, even when circumstances become fraught with contention.\n\nButerin\u2019s intrigue with Community Notes stems from its potential as a manifestation of \u201ccrypto values,\u201d despite not originating from the cryptocurrency realm. \u201cIt might be the most fitting embodiment of \u2018crypto values\u2019 we\u2019ve encountered in the mainstream arena so far,\u201d he expressed.\n\nYou might also like: Vitalik Buterin shares insights on Ethereum\u2019s account abstraction journey\n\nAn interesting facet of Community Notes is its unique consensus-based operational procedure. Before a note gains approval and becomes visible to the audience, there has to be a mutual agreement among its contributors.\n\nThe platform mandates a consensus for note validation, a process thoroughly detailed on their official site.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/kcoleman/status/1691704978099105901?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1691704978099105901%7Ctwgr%5E7b19b1f578dcab33728923c9b92d8e3f3e9f9e0c%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fblockworks.co%2Fnews%2Fvitalik-community-notes-x\n\nHighlighting this consensus approach, Keith Coleman, X\u2019s vice president of Product, showcased an excerpt from Buterin\u2019s insights into crypto values. This acknowledgment garnered even more attention when CEO Elon Musk further shared Coleman\u2019s post, casting a spotlight on Buterin\u2019s thoughts to his vast array of followers.\n\nButerin accentuated the decentralized aspect of the notes. He clarified that these annotations, which either add context or challenge assertions made on X, don\u2019t stem from a singular authority. \u201cThe process is democratic, allowing any individual to draft and vote. The final decision regarding the display of these notes rests with an open-source algorithm,\u201d he detailed.\n\nHe also introduced the notion of \u201ccredible neutrality,\u201d a term he coined in 2020, referring to a system that remains impartial and unbiased. In Community Notes, this neutrality represents its effort to remain unbiased and all-inclusive.\n\nButerin also acknowledged that while Community Notes bears resemblance to the values of decentralization, it doesn\u2019t quite match up to the standards set by decentralized social media, saying, \u201cfor those who may find fault with its operation, alternative viewing isn\u2019t an option. However, for extensive applications, it\u2019s likely the closest we\u2019ll see in the foreseeable future.\u201d\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Valkyrie Investments has filed for an Ethereum futures exchange-traded fund (ETF), as seen in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing on Aug. 16.\n\nAccording to that filing, nearly all of the fund\u2019s assets will be invested in exchange-traded Ethereum futures, while a small portion will be invested in collateral investments such as cash, cash-like instruments, or high-quality securities. The text of the filing emphasizes that the fund\u2019s assets will not be invested in Ethereum (ETH) itself.\n\nValkyrie\u2019s filing indicates that the fund\u2019s investment capacity may be limited by regulations set by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). Those limits currently restrict ETH futures positions to 8,000 contracts per month. Each contract represents 50 ETH (currently $91,100). Valkyrie said the fund may invest in longer-dated futures contracts and additional collateral investments if it reaches these limits.\n\nValkyrie previously tried to combine its Bitcoin futures ETF (called the \u201cBitcoin Strategy ETF\u201d) with Ethereum futures in an Aug. 4 filing. That filing would see Valkyrie integrate both investments and rename the fund accordingly starting on Oct. 3 if approved.\n\nThe status of that filing, and its connection to the recent filing, have not been clarified in the document.\n\nInterest in crypto ETFs is high\n\nEthereum futures ETFs attracted widespread interest from asset managers this summer. Volatility Shares, Bitwise, ProShares, VanEck, Roundhill, and Grayscale have all applied to offer an Ethereum futures ETF in recent weeks.\n\nThat interest comes alongside broader interest in cryptocurrency ETFs, as Valkyrie and many other companies are also pursuing a spot Bitcoin ETF. Valkyrie submitted its application to the SEC on June 21 after the asset management giant BlackRock did the same just days earlier. As of the current date, no U.S. company has been granted permission to offer a spot Bitcoin ETF, reportedly due to inadequate surveillance-sharing agreements\n\nValkyrie was also one of the first companies to offer a Bitcoin futures ETF in October 2021. It offers various other crypto-related investments as well.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "Can Ethereum Price Cross $2,000 Before The End Of August? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "The Ethereum price has been on a rather disappointing run for investors over the last month and this decline has seen it fall to the low $1,800s. As the onslaught continues, the question now is will Ethereum be able to cross the $2,000 resistance before the month runs out?\n\nETH Open Interest On The Rise\n\nOne interesting factor about the current trend for the digital asset is the rate at which open interest is growing. Now, during times of falling prices where long traders are suffering the most in the market, open interest tends to decline as traders start to pull back from bullish positions. However, that has not been the case lately.\n\nRelated Reading: Will Bitcoin Price Crash Similarly To 2019 And 2020? As data from Coinglass shows, the Ethereum open interest has been on the rise lately. This growth trend is evident across exchanges, a number of which saw a significant jump in their Ethereum open interest.\n\nFor example, in the last day, the ETH open interest rose 16.77% on CoinEx, 14.48% on OKX, and 13.08% on Bitget. It doesn\u2019t end there as the likes of Huobi and Binance also saw an 8.15% and 5.94% increase in their ETH open interest, respectively.\n\nETH open interest on exchanges jumps 5.98% in 24 hours | Source: Coinglass\n\nAs a result of this, the total exchange ETH futures open interest in USD moved from $6 billion last week to $6.54 billion on Wednesday. Given that the ETH futures open interest across exchanges was sitting at $6.4 billion on Tuesday, it translates to a 5.98% jump in total open interest in the last 24 hours alone.\n\nWhat Does This Mean For Ethereum Price?\n\nThe steady rise in the Ethereum futures open interest on exchanges could point to a coming halt in the price decline. This is because, despite the falling prices, investors expect the price of the cryptocurrency to keep rising, which means bullish sentiment has not waned.\n\nWhat the current trend points to is likely a case of investors selling off holdings to secure some profit. But with so much open interest, it means there is not a lot of runway for the sellers. As a result, they will run out of steam soon and buyers will take over the market once more.\n\nWhen this happens, it would not take long until the Ethereum price is back up once more. Pulling above $2,000 will be more of a hurdle though. This is because the price of ETH continues to trade below its 50-day moving average, giving bears steam for the resistance at $2,000.\n\nETH bulls hold $1,800 support amid decline | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nHowever, with the expectations of an Ethereum ETF being approved by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), there could be more volume flowing into the asset soon. This could be just the push ETH\u2019s price would need to break $2,000. But the first ETH ETF deliberation by the SEC will happen in October, crossing August out of the picture.\n\nFollow Best Owie on Twitter for market insights, updates, and the occasional funny tweet\u2026 Featured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nTony Cai is one of those very rare developers who has experience building on both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). As such, he decided to analyze the differences between the two with his Web3 dev hat on. He managed to avoid both maximalisms and indicate the strong points of the two blockchains.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH): Which one is better for developer?\n\nFirst of all, building on Bitcoin (BTC) is much safer. It offers less surface area for potential attackers. By contrast, with Ethereum (ETH) smart contracts, a flaw in two lines of code might cost millions of dollars for the team, users and investors, Cai outlined in his recent Twitter thread.\n\nHaving spent time building on ETH first before pivoting to building on BTC, I've seen the best and worst parts of both communities.\n\n\n\nI'm probably gonna get some hate for this, but screw it...\n\n\n\nBTC vs ETH: An Honest Reflection from a Builder.\n\n\n\nHere are 6 things I noticed:\ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/3sBZKrZlRn \u2014 Tony Cai \u269b\ufe0f #SoundFinance (@TonyCai_) August 16, 2023\n\nAlso, Bitcoin's (BTC) development track is more focused while, on Ethereum (ETH), the \"next big things\" are popping up here and there. In the Bitcoin (BTC) community, developers go through a \"clear path of innovation\" with no distraction.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) developers do not have to worry about creating balanced and attack-resistant tokenomic designs as no token can go live on Bitcoin (BTC) as is. For Ethereum (ETH) applications, creating viable and attractive tokenomics is of paramount importance to sustainable product development.\n\nInstead, Bitcoin (BTC) developers can focus on a single product and its user-centric design:\n\nWith Bitcoin, it's all about pure product building in order to provide more value to our users. Our goal? Achieving product-market fit without the noise.\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, in February 2023, the Wall Street Journal accused Bitcoin Core of making the Bitcoin (BTC) development process centralized and vulnerable to censorship; analysts from CoinShares busted this narrative.\n\nEthereum (ETH) celebrates devs, not podcasters\n\nAt the same time, Cai has to admit that Ethereum (ETH) has a far more developed and mature infrastructure for engineers. Lightning apps, fiat on-ramps, multi-sigs and wallets represent all classes of apps that can be deployed on Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nAlso, Ethereum (ETH) makes new developer onboarding more streamlined through its hackathons of various types. This is why Ethereum (ETH) engineers feel like they are welcome from day one.\n\nFinally, the Bitcoin (BTC) community should hear the voices of its developers just like Ethereans do, Cai concluded. But all in all, he finds development on Bitcoin (BTC) \"feeling right\" despite all of its pros and cons.\n\nIt should be noted that the Ethereum (ETH) community always accuses Bitcoin (BTC) of being centralized in a number of ways."

        "content": "At the forefront of the burgeoning sector of decentralized finance (DeFi), Ethereum (ETH 0.54%) stands as the undisputed leader. With its robust smart contract capabilities and first-mover advantage, developers have harnessed its potential to create innovative decentralized applications, ranging from lending ecosystems to stablecoins and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nWhile various blockchain networks offer DeFi and smart contract functionality, Ethereum's pioneering position has firmly established it as the preferred choice not only for developers, but also for more traditional companies exploring new blockchain-based business models. The convergence of DeFi and traditional finance is in its beginning stages, but a handful of recent announcements prove that Ethereum is firmly leading the charge and might be worthy of a spot in investors' portfolios.\n\nCoinbase joins in\n\nOn Aug. 9, Coinbase Global unveiled Base, its Layer-2 blockchain built on top of Ethereum. The technicalities of Layer-2 solutions shouldn't be overlooked, but the key matter investors should focus on is Coinbase's decision to build it in conjunction with Ethereum rather than another blockchain.\n\nBy using Base, developers can harness the power of Ethereum's proven security and decentralization while also benefiting from the speed and low costs of Base, the most notable feature of Layer-2 solutions. In just the first week of operations, Base attracted the likes of companies such as Coca-Cola.\n\nThe strategic architecture of Base aims to streamline the construction and integration of on-chain solutions into new business models, fostering a seamless transition for individuals and companies seeking to capture blockchain technology's potential.\n\nPayPal hops on board\n\nAnother high-profile company also made the decision to launch its own Ethereum-based solution: PayPal. A global powerhouse in online payments, PayPal said on Aug. 7 it would launch its own stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain, aptly named PayPal USD.\n\nPegged to the value of the U.S. dollar, this stablecoin is poised to revolutionize the digital payments landscape. From the announcement, PayPal stated that its stablecoin \"is designed to reduce friction for in-experience payments in virtual environments, facilitate fast transfers of value to support friends and family, send remittances or conduct international payments, enable direct flows to developers and creators, and foster the continued expansion into digital assets by the largest brands in the world.\"\n\nPayPal has plans to eventually integrate the stablecoin into its online marketplace eBay and mobile payment solution Venmo.\n\nBanks explore tokenization\n\nLikely the most intriguing development in the Ethereum landscape is the blending of traditional banking and the exploration of tokenization, a process that converts real-world assets, such as bonds or equities, into digital tokens on a blockchain.\n\nRecognition of the benefits that come with tokenization, namely enabling fractional ownership, efficient international trading, and enhanced transparency, is only in its infancy but some of the most prominent institutions in the world are already exploring its potential.\n\nIn November 2022, JPMorgan Chase achieved a groundbreaking milestone by successfully tokenizing Japanese bonds and yen, orchestrating a seamless conversion to Singaporean bonds and dollars on Ethereum's network.\n\nMore recently, in June 2023 the Bank of China tokenized $28 million worth of securities, the first transaction of its kind by a Chinese financial institution and further validating Ethereum's adaptability to modernize financial systems.\n\nAdding to the trend, the National Bank of Australia (NAB) unveiled its own stablecoin in March, a significant step toward facilitating cross-border payments. Drew Bradford, NAB executive general manager, summed up the desire for blockchain solutions best when stating, \"We believe that elements of the future of finance will be blockchain enabled, and we're already witnessing rapid change in the tokenization market.\"\n\nEthereum poised to thrive\n\nIn the unfolding landscape of businesses embracing blockchain solutions, Ethereum stands poised to thrive. As this trend gains traction, Ethereum's robust ecosystem, abundant liquidity, vibrant developer community, and established role position it for sustained growth.\n\nThis bodes well for Ethereum's long-term prospects because the expansion of use cases and network participants is one of the primary ways in which a cryptocurrency derives its value. As companies delve deeper and explore the advantages of blockchain technology, Ethereum will likely emerge as a beneficiary.\n\nWith its current price well below its all-time high, investors might find today an advantageous entry point to capture the coming waves of innovation. As more use cases find their home on Ethereum, the original smart contract blockchain could be a leader of portfolios for years to come."

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is in turmoil today as both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have experienced significant price drops, sending shockwaves across the financial community. As of this writing, Bitcoin has fallen to $26,298.74, marking a 9.04% decline in the last 24 hours, while Ethereum\u2019s price has tumbled to $1,620.54, showing a 10.5% drop within the same period.\n\nThe sudden dip in prices has resulted in massive liquidations across various exchanges. Data reveals that in the last 24 hours, liquidations reached an astounding $992.12 million, affecting 166,688 traders. Binance, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, witnessed the largest single liquidation order for Ethereum, valued at $55.92M.\n\nOff a cliff\n\nThe 24-hour liquidation amount has skyrocketed to $996.6 million, marking a staggering 741.27% increase, indicating high volatility and a significant number of traders being forced to close their positions.\n\nCoinglass data show that in the past 24 hours, a total of 167,465 traders were liquidated, with the total liquidation sum amounting to approximately $997.31 million. The largest single liquidation order was on Binance for ETHBUSD, valued at $55.92 million. The long and short ratio for liquidations stands at 46.11% and 53.89%, respectively. This suggests that while a majority of traders were betting on prices going up, a slightly higher number of traders were expecting a downturn.\n\nAnalyzing the liquidation data from major exchanges, OKX saw the highest percentage of long liquidations at 98.2%. In contrast, Deribit had a dominant short liquidation rate of 56.32%. Binance, one of the world\u2019s largest exchanges, also had a significant long liquidation rate of 91.97%.\n\nThe plunge also occurred as news broke that Chinese real estate powerhouse Evergrande had filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy in a U.S. court. The financial instability of the company and its potential ripple effects on the global economy have been a topic of intense scrutiny and apprehension for investors.\n\nUltrasound.money\u2018s observations shed light on a notable amount of Ethereum being burned. The burn rate is approximately 1.67 ETH/min, and leading DeFi platforms like Uniswap are major contributors to this phenomenon.\n\nLastly, it\u2019s essential to recognize that both traditional and crypto markets are susceptible to global macroeconomic factors. The ongoing economic challenges worldwide play a significant role in shaping investor sentiment and market dynamics.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s current price is down 61.63% from its all-time high (ATH) of $68,692.14, reached on November 10, 2021. Similarly, Ethereum has plummeted 66.55% from its ATH of $4,864.11, also recorded on the same date.\n\nAmid these liquidations, other cryptocurrencies such as XRP, LTC, and DOGE have also seen significant liquidation values. Exchange-wise, OKX, Deribit, Binance, and Huobi are leading in terms of liquidation amounts.\n\nWhile the immediate future of the cryptocurrency market remains uncertain, it is essential for investors to stay informed and exercise caution. Given the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies, such market fluctuations, while unsettling, are not unprecedented.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "An amusing attempt at satire has drawn the ire of Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson, or so it appears.\n\nIn response to a fan commentary doubting the blockchain\u2019s roadmap and criticizing its supposed similarity to Ethereum, Hoskinson responded, \"It\u2019s getting delusion town now,\" and, \u201cWe are living rent-free in the maxi minds. I pity them.\" Addressing the Ethereum comparison, the founder said:\n\n\u201cEthereum has a dumpster fire of a consensus layer, has a terrible programming model that they can\u2019t change, and are getting eaten alive by their own layer 2 ecosystem.\"\n\n\"Cardano's sidechain plans mutually benefit both Cardano and the sidechain,\" he stated.\n\nIt's getting delusion town now. Hydra is live on mainnet and evolving fast. Mithril is live as well and the first step towards a rich DA and light client strategy. We already designed a significantly better way of handling transactions via tiered pricing and Babel fees.\n\n\n\nThere's\u2026 https://t.co/2cJa8ivJGu \u2014 Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) August 17, 2023\n\nIn March 2020, the Cardano Foundation published a research paper describing Hydra, a layer-2 solution using sidechains to offload transactions from the main network. Hoskinson explained that Cardano would soon become \u201cthe fastest system in the world,\" raising the following example:\n\n\u201cSimulations have shown that each 'Hydra head\u2019 can currently process about 1,000 transactions per second (TPS). With 1,000 stacking pools, each of which processes 1,000 TPS, Cardano could achieve a throughput of up to one million transactions per second.\"\n\nIn an ask-me-anything session from November 2021, Hoskinson revealed that the Hydra project was still under development with no set launch date. The first mainnet-compatible Hydra node was released on May 11, 2023. Since then, developers have teased the upcoming Hydra Pay, a supposed layer-2 integration with Cardano wallets bearing the feature of instant settlement and \u201cgazillion TPS.\"\n\nRegarding utility, data from Cardanoscan indicate that the blockchain currently processes an average of 65,000 transactions per day, or 0.75 transactions per second. In comparison, Ethereum processed over 1 million transactions in the past 24 hours, or about 12.45 transactions per second.\n\n\u201cNo matter how many times the VC coins, the cryptomedia, or the maxi crowd proclaims we are dead, irrelevant, or failing, we always remind them that Cardano is here to stay,\" wrote Hoskinson in a previous tweet.\n\nMagazine: Should we ban ransomware payments?

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nTesla CEO and Twitter owner Elon Musk made an interesting mention of Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin in a new tweet.\n\n\n\nReacting to the Ethereum founder's recent take on Community Notes, the Tesla CEO commended the profound analysis provided by Vitalik Buterin on the said topic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Great analysis of Community Notes by Vitalik Buterin,\" Musk stated in a tweet.\n\nIn a lengthy blog post released today, Buterin endorsed X's \"Community Notes\" feature, emphasizing its relevance and relationship with \"crypto values.\"\n\nThe ETH creator pointed out that Community Notes, as a fact-checking tool that occasionally inserts context notes, might be the closest thing to an instantiation of \"crypto values\" in the mainstream world. This attracted the attention of Elon Musk.\n\nThe crypto community, as usual, reacted to Musk's tweet, tagging the ETH creator. A Twitter user interpreted this to suggest that Musk is bullish on ETH. In a surprising turn of events, Elon Musk followed Ethereum developer Vitalik Buterin on Twitter in June.\n\nTwitter has seen dramatic events unfold in recent months, but amid this, Community Notes emerged as a generally respected tool, attempting to combat disinformation by providing context and facts to messages.\n\nElon Musk, in particular, has paid keen attention to this Twitter feature. As reported, Elon Musk thanked Japanese contributors for their efforts in providing community notes in Japanese, which attracted a comment from Shiba Inu lead Shytoshi Kusama.\n\nTwitter was rebranded to X in July, marking the start of billionaire Elon Musk's vision to transform it into \"the everything app.\"\n\nLong before Elon Musk's $44 billion purchase of Twitter last year, he talked about creating an all-encompassing service called \"X.\" In typical Musk fashion, the concept was expansive and amorphous."

Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin continued its crash Thursday afternoon, shedding 7% of its value in 20 minutes and briefly dipping below $26,000 in the process. And as Bitcoin went, so too did other leading cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum\u2014with a cascade of liquidations topping $800 million to follow.\n\nThe largest cryptocurrency by market cap is trading for $26,314 as of this writing, according to CoinGecko\u2014a nearly 10% dive for Bitcoin over the last 24 hours. It fell as low as $25,649 this afternoon, but has rebounded slightly since then. The price of Bitcoin hasn't been this low since the start of June.\n\nBitcoin's dive Thursday followed word of China's sizable Evergrande Group property developer filing for Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection in New York. Around the same time, word began to spread about a Wall Street Journal report noting that Elon Musk's SpaceX wrote down the value of its Bitcoin holdings by $373 million and sold an unspecified amount.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe rest of the crypto market was in the red Thursday afternoon Eastern Time, too. Ethereum, the second largest digital asset by market cap, is down nearly 10% in the last day, trading hands for $1,640 as of this writing. It fell as low as $1,576 on Thursday afternoon, per CoinGecko.\n\nOther cryptocurrencies like Ripple (XRP), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Litecoin (LTC) are all down at least 14% over the past day. All three had seen significant upward price movement in recent weeks.\n\nAccording to data from Coinglass, the crashing prices across the board triggered a cascade of liquidations for overleveraged positions, with $801 million worth of liquidations tallied in the hour after the price started dropping.\n\nBitcoin had recently been on a run after a surge of interest from institutional investors\u2014including an application from BlackRock for a spot crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF)\u2014helped propel the biggest and oldest digital asset to a yearly high above $31,000 per coin.\n\nBut interest may be waning as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) does not appear to be in a hurry to approve the long list of high-profile applications.

        "title": "Could Ethereum be on the edge of a potential rebound to $2,000 - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "ETH could recover if the open interest continues to decrease.\n\nHowever, the potential rebound to $2,000 depends on the average market behavior.\n\nAfter enduring a period of low volatility and price retracement, Ethereum [ETH] was now standing at a crucial juncture, presenting a potential scenario for a rebound. This was the opinion of Korean on-chain analyst crypto sunmoon.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nAccording to sunmoon, ETH\u2019s price decrease is usually followed by a rise in open interest. As an indicator to determine market sentiment and price strength, the open considers the open contract held by participants at the end of a trading day.\n\nRepeating patterns\n\nSunmoon, in his analysis, published on CryptoQuant, noted that a follow-up of an open interest decrease leads to ETH\u2019s price recovery historically. And this was the current state of things. Furthermore, the analyst opined,\n\n\u201cIf Ethereum\u2019s price movement continues to be limited, a short-term bounce is possible.\u201d\n\nWith the ETH price hovering around the $1,825 mark, this observation could be necessary to gauge whether the altcoin is poised for a resurgence beyond the $2,000 level and into higher territory.\n\nOne metric that provides more insight into this is the Short Term Holder NUPL. This metric takes into account the behavior of short-term investors around a 155-day period. Using the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL), the metric can identify if market participants are in a state of hope, denial, optimism, or euphoria.\n\nAt press time, the Short Term Holder NUPL indicated that the broader market was in a state of hope (orange).\n\nThis means that the average ETH holder desires a price rise. However, most were not involved in intense buying to bring their wish to reality. Unless buying pressure increases, ETH may continue to consolidate.\n\nBullish traders should be careful\n\nHow about traders? Well, indications from the funding rate suggested that traders are bullish on the ETH price action.\n\nFunding rates are periodic amounts paid between traders that hold perpetual contract positions. When the funding rate is positive, it implies that traders are bullish. Furthermore, this also implies that longs pay short a funding fee to keep their positions open.\n\nConversely, a negative funding rate implies that short positions are dominant. Therefore, at 0.009%, the funding rate suggests that traders have a similar sentiment to short-term holders.\n\nHowever, the exchange inflow could be a stumbling block to ETH\u2019s potential rise to $2,000. Additionally, the exchange inflow measures the number of assets moving from non-exchange wallets to exchange wallets.\n\nAn increase in the metric tends to support a potential to sell off. While a decrease implies a possible decision to keep for the long term.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nAt press time, ETH\u2019s exchange inflow spiked to 57,700. If the exchange inflow continues to outpace the outflow, then ETH\u2019s potential rise to $2,000 might be difficult."

        "content": "New financial documents show that former U.S. President Donald Trump is an Ethereum (ETH) whale holding $2.8 million worth of the digital asset in a cryptocurrency wallet.\n\nThe new documents were obtained by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) and supersedes a previous filing from April that showed that the former President held between $250,001 and $500,000 in an Ethereum wallet. The CREW\u2019s documents were filed this month.\n\nThe document did not provide additional information on other contents in the wallets.\n\nHowever, the holding indicates a clear departure from Trump\u2019s former anti-crypto posture. In the past, the former President said Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies were \u201cbased on thin air\u201d and their value was \u201chighly volatile.\u201d He added:\n\n\u201cUnregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump earned $4.6M from NFTs\n\nAccording to the records, President Trump\u2019s involvement in the non-fungible token sphere yielded considerable earnings, amounting to $4.86 million.\n\nThis income stemmed from an NFT licensing agreement between his company, CIC Digital LLC, and NFT INT LLC. President Trump has been listed as his company\u2019s manager, President, secretary, and treasurer since 2022.\n\nThrough this licensing, the NFT company used his \u201cname, likeness, and image\u201d to release two NFT collections that garnered broad attention from the crypto community. Last year, the first batch of the collection was launched to much hype and interest from his supporters. A \u201cseries 2\u201d was launched in April.\n\nMeanwhile, the NFT collections have always seen their value impacted by the media coverage surrounding Trump. Data from Coingecko shows that while the value of the first collection has doubled to $188 as of press time, the second collection\u2019s value is trading far below its mint value of $99.\n\nThe NFT collections are not owned, managed, or controlled by Trump, his company, or their affiliates. The website further stated that the NFTs \u201care not political and have nothing to do with any political campaign.\u201d\n\nMentioned in this article"

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum, the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is witnessing some intriguing and potentially alarming trends. While ETH long liquidations are growing in size, open interest in the cryptocurrency is simultaneously skyrocketing. This paradoxical situation demands a closer look.\n\nLong liquidations and open interest: What's happening?\n\nLong liquidations refer to the forced selling of assets, in this case, Ethereum, when traders cannot meet margin requirements for their leveraged positions. The fact that these liquidations are increasing suggests that many traders are getting caught on the wrong side of the trade, possibly due to sudden price drops.\n\nOn the other hand, open interest represents the total number of outstanding derivatives contracts, such as futures and options, that have not been settled. Skyrocketing open interest indicates that more traders are entering into contracts, betting on Ethereum's future price movements.\n\nThe simultaneous occurrence of increasing long liquidations and surging open interest is perplexing. It suggests that while many traders are being liquidated, even more are entering the market, possibly with leveraged positions. This scenario can lead to heightened volatility and risk in the Ethereum market.\n\nEthereum's price analysis\n\nOver the past month, Ethereum's price has shown some fluctuations. Starting from July 1, 2023, ETH was trading at $1,934.04. As the month progressed, it reached a high of $1966.81 but also dipped to lows like $1,830.05. As of Aug. 13, 2023, Ethereum was trading at $1,836.95.\n\nThis price movement, combined with increasing long liquidations, suggests that traders might be over-leveraging their positions, expecting Ethereum to rise. When the price does not move as anticipated, or if there is a sudden drop, these over-leveraged positions get liquidated, leading to the observed increase in long liquidations."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nFed minutes release for July\n\nCrypto market slipped by 3%, could it be based on hints of Fed hike?\n\nFurther rate hikes of 0.25% are likely\n\nThe minutes from the Federal Reserve\u2019s two-day July meeting came out yesterday, August 16 . They underscore the central bank\u2019s growing concerns about persistent inflation. Despite a recent quarter percentage point rate hike, which brought the federal funds rate to its highest level in over 22 years, the inflation battle is seen as ongoing by most FOMC members.\n\nThe minutes reveal significant worries about inflation staying above the Committee\u2019s desired range, with tight labor market conditions further complicating the outlook.\n\nAlthough some members expressed doubt about the necessity of additional hikes, the consensus leans towards caution, emphasizing the importance of a restrictive monetary policy to steer inflation back to the 2% target.\n\nWhile the future direction remains uncertain, with indications that inflation pressures might be easing, the minutes highlight a collective sentiment of vigilance, suggesting a heightened likelihood that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates again in the near future if current conditions persist.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum Slip\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin and Ethereum have slipped from their sideways range in a single percentage decrease of around 3%. Has there been a correlation between the negative sentiment toward the future economic outlook with this decrease in the cryptocurrency market?\n\nThe Fed minutes were released on the official website at 2:00 p.m. EDT yesterday.\n\nAlthough the news outlets started reporting soon after due to writing and publishing, the news lagged a bit behind until it caught on. Nevertheless, BTC and ETH prices have already been in a slight downtrend, which only propelled it further.\n\nAt the exact time of the Fed minutes release, the price of BTC and ETH started falling with higher momentum and picked up the pace overnight. The price of Bitcoin was trading at $29,195 and fell to $28,300 at its daily low. Ethereum fell from $1827 to its daily low of $1,777, which is a decrease of 2.69%.\n\nAs seen on the chart above, there is a direct correlation between this news release and the price decline. This is because all markets are currently sensitive to the overall economic sentiment, and crypto is still viewed as the riskiest asset class in particular.\n\nFed Meeting in September\n\nThe next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting will be held on September 19 \u2013 20, 2023. The consensus among financial analysts and other experts on the matter is mixed.\n\nSome expect that the monetary policy-making body of the Federal Reserve System will most likely make another interest rate hike by another 25-basis-point to moderate inflation to the targeted 2%.\n\nOthers say that it might pause for now as it did in June and evaluate the situation as it fears the economy will get too tight and limit consumer spending.\n\nConclusion\n\nFederal Reserve is the most important entity in the global economy since its decisions can impact the value of the US dollar, which is still the global reserve currency. This is why investors and traders all across the world are following their announcements.\n\nWhat the Fed does next still remains unclear, but considering that it only made a small blow to inflation and definitely not a win, further action will be required, thus we would be primarily expecting an increase in interest rates.\n\nWith the cryptocurrency market standing on shaky legs since April, this might be a catalyst for a larger decline.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nPlease note that the contents of this article are not financial or investing advice.

Making a bearish engulfing candle in the daily chart, the downtrend leads the 1.58% on 8th August and warns of a deadlier correction phase.\n\nThe Ethereum price currently trades at $1821 below the 50-day EMA and might soon approach the 200-day EMA. The sharp increase in trading volume supporting the downfall makes the downtrend more intense.\n\nIn the 4-hour chart, the bearish obstacles become clearer. These are the 200 EMA and the supply zone at $1875, undermining the recent ETH price bullish attempt. The extensive short-term selling spree might soon challenge the $100 mark.\n\nCurrently, the downtrend breaks under the resistance trendline of the broken falling channel pattern. However, a lower price rejection before the candle closing will increase the chances of a breather rally.\n\nThe trapped short-term buyers can find this potential breather as an exit strategy to minimize losses. However, this can, in turn, fuel the downtrend leading to more discounted prices.\n\nComing to the technical indicators, the RSI and MACD indicators present bearish sight in both 4-hour and daily charts. With the 50-day EMA and the 200 EMA in a 4-hour chart representing the selling side, a reversal breaking either EMA will unlock a bullish rally.\n\nIs This The Best Dip To Buy?\n\nIn case of a breather rally, the Ethereum prices can reach $1850 upon the short-term correction breakout. Moreover, the ETH price is approaching the long-term support trendline, increasing the reversal chances. Comparing the previous reversal, the ETH price is set for a 25%-40% jump.\n\nHowever, a prolonged downtrend can challenge the bullish dominance of the $1800 mark. And, in case of a $1800 breakdown, the Ethereum price can plunge to $1712."

        "content": "Share:\n\nEthereum price shows a breakdown from an ascending triangle formation, hinting at a potential correction.\n\nWhile the theoretical forecasts hint at a 45% crash, the recent breakdown suggests bears are in control.\n\nEther\u2019s open interest has surged by nearly 500 million in the last three days, suggesting a renewed interest.\n\nEthereum price action is at an interesting point, which could trigger a steep move in either direction. With Bitcoin\u2019s boring consolidation, crypto traders have been waiting for a volatile move to emerge. The lack of volatility could be ending soon, especially for Ether, as the open interest rose by nearly 500 million in the last three days from $6.09 billion to $6.58 billion. When the breakout does occur, one cap is likely to get caught in the wrong direction, causing liquidations in the millions.\n\nETH open interest\n\nAlso read: Fundstrat's Tom Lee's Bitcoin target is $180,000 if SEC approves first spot BTC ETF in the US\n\nEthereum price action hints at a massive move soon\n\nEthereum price set up an ascending triangle formation between May 28, 2022, and August 14, 2023. This setup contains three higher lows and nearly three equal highs, which are connected using trend lines.\n\nThis technical formation is a bullish one and the confirmation of a breakout would occur if Ethereum price flipped the $1,998 or $2,000 psychological level into a support floor. The ascending triangle pattern forecasts a 45% upswing to $2,915, which is obtained by adding the distance between the first swing high and swing low to the breakout point.\n\nOn the contrary, Ethereum price breached the setup to the downside on August 13 and is on its way to confirming the breakdown by producing a three-day candlestick close below it. If this outlook does play out, instead of the 45% rally, ETH could crash by 45% and revisit the next key level at $998. But in some cases, ETH could stop around or above the $1,000 psychological level, which is not too far away from the theoretical target.\n\nRead more: Breaking: $1.7 million worth of Ethereum stuck in Shibarium bridge as launch fails to catalyze meme coin rally\n\nETH/USDT 3-day chart\n\nHowever, if Bitcoin\u2019s consolidation breaches to the upside, bears that shorted ETH thinking a bearish breakdown has occurred would be trapped. In such a case, Ethereum price could quickly climb higher and flip the $2,000 psychological level. This development could confirm a bullish breakout, forecasting a 45% move to $2,915.\n\nIn bullish cases, Ethereum price could revisit the $3,000 level that has not been tagged since April 20222."

        "content": "Shayan is a digital nomad and a professional journalist. He delivers high-quality engaging articles to Coinpedia through his in-depth research and analysis.\n\nIn recent weeks, Bitcoin has shown significant consolidation near the $29,500 range. However, it recently dipped below the $28,500 threshold. This movement has ignited a strong selling sentiment in the market, a trend that Ethereum has also reflected. Presently, Ethereum\u2019s annual price chart indicates that it\u2019s at a crucial point. There\u2019s a potential for it to breach its monthly support line, which could trigger another round of selling.\n\nBulls Liquidated Nearly $37 Million Worth Of Positions\n\nRecently, the price of ETH saw a sharp decline, approaching the $1,850 mark. This forced long position holders to quickly lock their profits. Data from Coinglass indicates a surge in long liquidations, exceeding $36.5 million in just the past three days. This trend has intensified selling momentum at higher levels, creating a robust resistance close to $1,850.\n\nThe 1-year price chart for ETH is showing signs of concern. Amidst months of consolidation, Ethereum\u2019s movement within a particular bracket has market enthusiasts awaiting a clear trend, which might emerge by September.\n\nSince FTX\u2019s collapse last November, Ethereum\u2019s price has followed a rising wedge pattern. While it has consistently met its support levels in the past, the pattern seems to be converging, hinting at a final move. A drop below the support line could accelerate the confidence of long-term put holders, with predictions pointing to a potential dip to the $1,400 mark.\n\nHowever, such a decline might require significant bearish news in the market. On the brighter side, Ethereum has historically bounced back by 20-30% after successfully testing its support. If it manages to rally from the current support level of approximately $1,750, we could see a surge toward the $2,000-$2,100 range.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next For ETH Price?\n\nEther\u2019s inability to hold momentum above $1,800 has led to increased selling, driving the price down to a crucial long-term support level of $1,850. However, bulls are defending a decline strongly as there\u2019s buying pressure near the dip. As of writing, ETH price trades at $1,776, declining over 1.7% in the last 24 hours.\n\nWith the declining 20-day EMA and the RSI trading way below the selling zone at level 15, it indicates that the bears are currently dominating. If the price consistently falls and drops below $1,703, we might witness a sharper sell-off, potentially pushing the ETH price to $1,626.\n\nHowever, to turn things around, bulls must rebound the price from $1,850 and push the price beyond the 20-day EMA at $1,818. Achieving this could pave the way for a rise to consolidation around $1,860."

        "content": "With the global crypto market cap consolidating around $1.15 trillion, Ether\u2019s price has been hovering around $1800 over the past week. As a result, the market is neither greedy nor fearful. At press time, the Ethereum F&G Index flashed a neutral reading of 46.\n\nFrom the beginning of 2023 until now, Ethereum\u2019s realized price has consistently hovered between $1,500 and $1,600. At press time, it was on the brink of $1700. The realized price is technically one of the most reliable on-chain analysis metrics. The price is arrived at by dividing the sum of all coin values at the time when they were last moved by the circulating supply. Usually, the realized price has acted as a support during bear markets. On the other hand, whenever the market price has dropped below the realized price, it has swiftly bounced back, suggesting the market sees Ethereum as undervalued during those moments.\n\nConsequentially, this resilience indicates an underlying confidence in Ethereum\u2019s value. Such a setup points out that the broader market believes that ETH is worth more than its current market price. Highlighting what could be a good investment strategy, a recent CryptoQuant analysis pointed out,\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re someone with a long-term investment horizon, at least a year or more, and have confidence in the asset, considering buying and holding Ethereum whenever it nears the Realized Price Line might be a sound strategy.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: 19 SEC-Flagged Crypto Tokens Witness Trade Volume Spike\n\nDeposits to Exchanges Drop, ETH Premium Rises\n\nLet us delve into a couple of other metrics to understand what other market participants are doing at this juncture. ETH\u2019s exchange deposit transactions have been on a downtrend since mid-June. From a high of 19,000 created on June 18, the number was hovering around 38,500 a day back, suggesting that fewer participants are selling their ETH holdings.\n\nAlso Read: Coinbase: \u2018Fresh\u2019 Whale Wallets Created in 2023 Drive Activity on Base\n\nParallelly, in several regions, users are paying a premium to acquire Ether. The Korean Premium Index for this asset was hovering around 0.36 on August 13. However, it flashed a value of 1.09 at press time. The rising premium value likely indicates that Korean retail investors are applying buying pressure by accumulating ETH.\n\nThus, it can be contended that the current activity by ETH holders is setting the stage for the asset to gradually recover. Thus, long-term holders could consider accumulating at this stage.\n\nAlso Read: Stablecoin Market to Grow From $125 Billion to $3 Trillion: Bernstein"

Discover SCENE\n\nThe Shiba Inu (SHIB) ecosystem is finally launching Shibarium, its Ethereum layer-2 network.\n\nAccording to the developers, Shibarium's mainnet launch provides the essential technical foundation \u201cfor the entire SHIB state.\u201d Today's launch follows an extensive beta testnet phase, which saw a reported 21 million users.\n\nShibarium, like the swath of layer-2 networks on the market, seeks to address some of the scalability challenges inherent in the Ethereum network. By offering enhanced throughput and reduced transaction fees\u2014apparently even lower than those boasted by Polygon (MATIC)\u2014it aims to improve the overall efficiency and user experience of decentralized application applications (dApps) and transactions.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cCost and scalability of a new layer-2 network depends on a lot of factors including the number of validators, how many transactions flowing in the system, but our initial test has revealed sub-fractional transactions cost compared to Polygon and instant speeds,\u201d SHIB developer Kaal Dhairya told Decrypt.\n\nThe move also boosts the project's chances of leaving the meme coin category behind. Initially launched in 2020, Shiba Inu (SHIB) quickly joined the ranks of Dogecoin (DOGE) as yet another canine entry to the annals of crypto comedy.\n\nAlongside Shibarium, though, the developers behind the project also promise a new identity protocol to show Shiba Inu is more than an internet meme.\n\nShiba Inu lead developer who goes by the pseudonym Shytoshi Kusama emphasized that the key differentiator of Shibarium from other scaling solutions is that the \u201cL2 solution powers our entire governance and Shiba State framework.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith it, we can ensure low-cost transactions, membership, ownership, and much more on-chain for our ShibArmy and beyond,\u201d Shytoshi Kusama told Decrypt.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nShibarium and its steak delegates\n\nShibarium is built on a consensus mechanism called Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPOS), with the network\u2019s underlying infrastructure relying on a combination of validators and delegators.\n\nIn this particular design, validators take charge of running nodes, facilitating transaction processing, and generating new blocks. This collective effort also ensures the overall security of the ecosystem. Delegators, meanwhile, are backing the validators by staking support tokens.\n\n\u201cOur DPOS system is a great way for Shibizens to have a role in our new state,\u201d Kusama told Decrypt. \u201cIn essence, validators and delegators are the first two roles in the society and we will scale to thousands more roles as we build a better future.\u201d\n\nAccording to the developers, Shibarium is also poised to play a key role in supporting other components of the existing Shiba Inu ecosystem.\n\nThis extends to backing assets like the SHIB and LEASH tokens, SHIBOSHI NFTs, SHIB The Metaverse, the ShibaSwap decentralized exchange, and the Shiba Eternity game.\n\n\u201cIn my view, Shibarium's best use case is that it is specifically designed to be a blockchain for everyone,\u201d Kusama told Decrypt. \u201cWe specialize in building frameworks that support the community, not a specific use case. In this way, we promote unity, diversity, and decentralization.\u201d"

The revelation comes from certified financial disclosures for 2023, released by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW).\n\n\u2018Ethereum whale\u2019 refers to an individual or entity that possesses a substantial amount of the crypto Ethereum. Such whales wield significant influence over the market, capable of executing substantial transactions that can impact Ethereum's price and market dynamics.\n\nTrump's involvement with Ethereum has proven highly lucrative, with earnings totalling $2.8 million from his ETH holdings, a substantial increase from the $250,000 to $500,000 reported in his April 14 filing. Notably, the former President has reportedly reaped an additional $4.8 million from licensing fees associated with nonfungible token (NFT) collections that prominently feature his likeness. His foray into crypto-related ventures has generated an estimated net profit of approximately $7.6 million.\n\nAs Trump sets his sights on potentially returning to the White House in the forthcoming 2024 election, his indictment in Georgia somewhat overshadows this financial revelation. On August 14, Donald Trump and 18 associates were accused of conspiracy to overturn his 2020 election defeat in Georgia.\n\nMoreover, Trump's stance on crypto has been nothing short of controversial. Despite his notable involvement with Ethereum and NFTs, he has previously voiced scepticism towards cryptos, going so far as to label them as potentially \"fake\" and a \"disaster waiting to happen.\" He has also been a vocal critic of Bitcoin, referring to it as a \"scam\" and expressing concerns about its competition with the US dollar.\n\nHowever, as the financial landscape increasingly intertwines with the world of crypto, Trump's substantial ETH holdings underscore the evolving nature of wealth accumulation and the novel investment avenues that continue to capture global attention. As the former President navigates legal challenges and eyes a potential political comeback, his financial involvement in the crypto realm adds yet another layer of intrigue to an already dynamic narrative."

        "title": "Shiba Inu's Shibarium Ethereum L2 blockchain goes live on mainnet - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Shiba Inu launched the Shibarium mainnet, an Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution, on Aug. 16 after months of testing that saw millions of users participate and 21 million wallets created.\n\nShibarium is built on a new consensus mechanism called proof-of-participation (PoP), which works by selecting validators in proportion to their quantity of holdings in the associated cryptocurrency. This is done to avoid the computational cost of proof-of-work schemes. The new L2 blockchain solution is designed to interact with the primary Ethereum layer-1 blockchain, providing a more scalable and cost-effective transaction platform.\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) rose to popularity during the bull market of 2020\u20132021, even briefly overtaking the OG meme cryptocurrency, Dogecoin (DOGE). However, it couldn\u2019t hold onto its gains for long and lost more than 80% of its valuation during the bear market.\n\nThe price decline didn\u2019t deter the Shiba Inu community, which built a decentralized ecosystem around the cryptocurrency comprising a decentralized exchange, ShibaSwap, and a native token, BONE, along with a metaverse and a Web3 game. The price of SHIB also surged to a new multiweek high in anticipation of Shibarium\u2019s launch.\n\nPrior to the mainnet launch, Shiba Inu\u2019s lead developer, who goes by the pseudonym Shytoshi Kusama, noted that the L2 has already gained a lot of traction from new projects. In a post on X (formerly known as Twitter), the developer shared a screenshot of companies currently developing on Shibarium, suggesting over 100 companies are already using it.\n\nIn an exclusive conversation with Cointelegraph, Kusama noted that many people in the tech world are talking about an \u201ceverything app,\u201d but these innovations must be carried out from a community and decentralization perspective. He added that Shibarium incorporates both these principles in its operations while honoring \u201cthe principles of decentralization, interoperability and user-centric design for both blockchain and the technology sector at large.\u201d\n\nRelated: Why is Shiba Inu price up today?\n\nKusama further elaborated and said that the validator and delegator aspects of the new L2 will keep Shibarium decentralized, but that the true innovation lies in the framework, governance and charter to help govern the ecosystem\u2019s technology, community, protective and innovative aspects.\n\n\u201cBy using Shibarium for governance in this system, alongside self-sovereign identity to ensure quality membership (Shibizenship), the metaverse as our territory, and the ability to partner with other like-minded states, we have effectively shattered what nationhood is and rebuilt it upon the Shib ethos of decentralization!\u201d\n\nShibarium will make use of the Heimdall validator and Bor block production nodes, quite similar to the Polygon ecosystem. Heimdall will be based on the Tendermint consensus engine, while Bor will be completely interoperable with the Ethereum Virtual Machine.\n\nUsers must lock 10,000 BONE in the Shibarium network to become validators. Twenty-one million BONE will be reserved as rewards for validators and delegators inside the Shibarium ecosystem and used to pay authorized gas charges.\n\nMagazine: Deposit risk: What do crypto exchanges really do with your money?"

During an exchange on X, the Ethereum proponent claimed Cardano is following Ethereum\u2019s roadmap. However, he argued Cardano is only a few years behind Ethereum.\n\nFurthermore, the individual speculated that Hoskinson would stop talking about the Hydra scaling solution in the next six months. He asserted that Hoskinson would later convince ADA holders that Cardano must follow Ethereum\u2019s footsteps.\n\nHe further listed six features Hoskinson needs to implement for Cardano to achieve Ethereum\u2019s success. According to him, these features include fee markets and data availability.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nHoskinson Reacts, Slams Ethereum\n\nReacting, Hoskinson highlighted some significant feats Cardano has achieved in the past few years. According to Hoskinson, Hydra scaling solution and Mithril live on the Cardano mainnet.\n\nHe added that the team behind Cardano has designed a better way to handle transactions using \u201ctiered pricing and Babel fees.\u201d Per Hoskinson, Cardano has had a rollup strategy since the Midnight protocol was conceived four years ago.\n\nHoskinson took a shot at other proof-of-stake (PoS) networks he believes are lagging in terms of development.\n\n\u201cThe protocols and primitives had to catch up and are getting there,\u201d he said.\n\nInterestingly, Hoskinson specifically shaded Ethereum. According to him, Ethereum has a dumpster fire of a consensus layer. He added that Ethereum is being eaten alive by its own Layer-2 ecosystem.\n\nOn the other hand, he added that Cardano\u2019s sidechain plans benefit both the sidechain and Cardano.\n\n\u201cWe are living rent-free in the maxi minds. I pity them,\u201d he added.\n\nHoskinson Silences Critics\n\nMeanwhile, the prominent American entrepreneur is known for clapping back at trolls undermining Cardano\u2019s successes. As reported earlier, Hoskinson silenced critics, including VCs and crypto media, who proclaimed Cardano\u2019s death and irrelevance.\n\nHe informed these critics that \u201cCardano is here to stay\u201d while highlighting some of the network\u2019s recent achievements. According to a recent report by Santiment, Cardano is ranked as the third blockchain with the most development activities in the past month.\n\nADA Records Slight Gain While BTC & ETH Plunge\n\nHowever, Cardano\u2019s recent milestone slightly impacted the price of its native coin, ADA. At the time of writing, ADA is changing hands at $0.274, up 0.4% in the past 24 hours.\n\nIt bears mentioning that most crypto assets, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, are currently facing losses in the past day. While BTC is down 2.7% in the past 24 hours, ETH has plummeted 2.3% in the same period."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nPayPal is forced to halt crypto trade in the UK under new regulations\n\nUK regulators aim to implement strict rules on crypto, including removing advertisements\n\nPayPal continues to promise a US stablecoin despite governmental scrutiny\n\nPayPal UK (PYPL.O) announced in an email sent to customers it will be halting buying and selling of crypto tokens on its platform. The company\u2019s decision comes following a new set of regulations set forth by the UK government.\n\nTransparent Crypto Trading\n\nThe new regulations introduced by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) aim to limit advertising in the crypto market. In the meantime, the government is working on creating clear and strict guidelines for the sale of digital assets in the country.\n\nRedistricting advertisements in the British crypto space is the result of the new direction created by the FCA, where the regulating body aims to protect customers from making \u201chasty decisions.\u201d\n\nExecutive director at the FCA\u2019s consumers and competition division, Sheldon Mills, said that \u201cIt is up to people to decide whether they buy crypto. But research shows many regret making a hasty decision.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cConsumers should still be aware that crypto remains largely unregulated and high risk.\u201d\n\nTherefore, the FCA is currently ordering crypto institutions to cease any \u201crefer a friend\u201d feature on their platform as it sees it as a misleading advertising approach.\n\nMoreover, crypto companies will be forced to warn users before trading, such as \u201cDon\u2019t invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong.\u201d\n\nThe new rule set comes as part of the regulatory overhaul the UK government plans for the crypto trade as a result of collapses such as FTX and Terraform Labs.\n\nIn his proposal , Financial Services Minister Andrew Griffith said, \u201cOur view is that this reinforces the case for clear, effective, timely regulation and proactive engagement with industry,\u201d adding that \u201cThis includes a proposal to bring centralized cryptoasset exchanges into financial services regulation for the first time, as well as other core activities like custody and lending.\u201d\n\nThe drastic change in regulations may offer extra challenges to companies like PayPal in the crypto space. However, a senior personal finance analyst at the investment platform Interactive Investor sees said regulations as a positive change as he currently views the crypto market as a \u201cwild west of dubious claims and misleading information.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe challenge for the regulator is to devise a robust customer knowledge framework so that all the players involved know what good looks like.\u201d\n\nPayPal did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAnother Day At The Office In The U.S.\n\nIn the meantime, PayPal\u2019s operations in the US remain undeterred. The company is currently enjoying the hype it\u2019s gathering after the announcement of its native stablecoin PYUSD.\n\nHowever, the announcement was not met with no resistance. Members of the US government have been in a discussion regarding the company\u2019s stablecoin since its announcement.\n\nCongresswoman Maxine Waters made a statement on the 11th of August where she voiced her concerns regarding PYUSD.\n\n\u201cGiven PayPal\u2019s size and reach, Federal oversight and enforcement of its stablecoin operations is essential in order to guarantee consumer protections and alleviate financial stability concerns.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cWithout legislation on the books that establish clear and strong consumer protections at the Federal level, consumers are at greater risk of harm at the hands of bad actors.\u201d\n\nHowever, the same sentiment was not shared by the Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, Patrick McHenry, who also issued a lengthy statement on the matter.\n\n\u201cThis announcement is a clear signal that stablecoins-if issued under a clear regulatory framework-hold, promise as a pillar of our 21st-century payments system,\u201d reported McHenry. He added, \u201cClear regulations and robust consumer protections are essential to enabling stablecoins to achieve their full potential. \u201c\n\n\u201cWe are currently at a crossroads to keep America at the forefront of digital asset innovation. Congress is making significant, bipartisan progress on legislation to ensure the U.S. leads the financial system of the future. We must finish the job.\u201d\n\nA tale of two lawmakers and their response to the launch of PayPal's stablecoin: Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-NC) is jazzed, and Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) is not. pic.twitter.com/RGwtPW8eIs \u2014 Brendan Pedersen \ud83c\udfe6 (@BrendanPedersen) August 9, 2023\n\nPayPal is also maintaining the option to trade other crypto tokens on its platform in the US, as UK regulations only apply to local markets."

The value of an investment in the Fund could decline significantly and without warning, including to zero.\u201d\n\nValkyrie Fund has already introduced a Bitcoin Strategy ETF and a Bitcoin Miners ETF to the market.\n\nEU\u2019s First Spot Bitcoin ETF Goes Live\n\nEarlier this week, London-based Jacobi Asset Management announced the release of Europe\u2019s first spot Bitcoin ETF, which will be listed on the EuroNext Amsterdam Exchange.\n\nThe ETF went live after a one-year delay due to unfriendly market conditions after it received approval from the Guernsey Financial Services Commission (GFSC) in October 2021.\n\nThe fund charges its clients a 1.5% annual management fee with authorized participants including Jane Street and DRW.\n\nThe launch of the EU\u2019s first spot Bitcoin ETF comes amid a surge in applications for such products in the US.\n\nIn June, asset management firm Blackrock filed paperwork for a spot Bitcoin ETF, prompting other players like Invesco and Wisdom Tree to follow suit or reapply for their own Bitcoin ETF products.\n\nThe Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) also filed a bid with the SEC on behalf of Fidelity for a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nHowever, the filings were returned by the SEC due to their lack of clarity and comprehensiveness.\n\nThe SEC, although approving funds that invest in Bitcoin futures, has yet to approve a fund directly investing in the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe commission has consistently cited inadequate cross-exchange market surveillance, as well as concerns of fraud and market manipulation, as reasons why it has not yet approved a Bitcoin spot ETF.\n\nIt is worth noting that the absence of a Bitcoin spot ETF has led to the growth of over-the-counter (OTC) products like Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).\n\nThese OTC products are more expensive, illiquid, and inefficient compared to ETFs."

        "content": "Crypto markets have recently faced a concerning dip, failing to find an upward momentum after extended periods of consolidation. The stalwart Bitcoin shattered its $28,000 support, sending shockwaves throughout the market. Ethereum, too, succumbed to the bearish pressure, plummeting below its $1,800 support. With fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) spreading like wildfire, questions arise: Is Ethereum headed for a steeper decline, potentially to $1,000? Let\u2019s analyze in this Ethereum price prediction article.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis: A Hopeful Retest Turns Sour\n\nEthereum showed promise with consistent movement around the $1,900 mark, following its failure to breach the pivotal $2,100 resistance. The consensus among many traders was an optimistic one; a retest of the $2,100 barrier and potential to surge past it. Yet, the market had other plans. In a rather unforeseen move, Ethereum\u2019s price didn\u2019t just dip but plummeted, settling distressingly at $1,740.\n\nThe Factors: Why is Ethereum Crashing?\n\nMultiple factors have precipitated Ethereum\u2019s price drop. Profit-taking, wherein traders sell off their holdings to capitalize on the coin\u2019s value, is a significant contributor. Concurrently, unfavorable regulatory shifts in several countries have dampened the enthusiasm around Ethereum and other cryptos. If profit-taking stands as the sole major catalyst, Ethereum might see a swift recovery back to the safer realms of $1,900.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: Ethereum Price Targets\n\nThe dynamics of the crypto market can be unpredictable, but based on recent activities, there are potential paths Ethereum might tread:\n\nOptimistic Recovery: If the decline is primarily attributed to profit-taking, there\u2019s hope for Ethereum. A rebound towards the $2,000 mark might be on the horizon. Cautionary Slippage: Should other factors play a significant role, Ethereum could further descend to its next support at $1,650. Pessimistic Decline: If market sentiments don\u2019t improve, Ethereum could further tumble to $1,400. Worst-case Scenario: In a highly bearish condition, Ethereum might even touch the alarming $1,000 mark.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might also like\n\nMore from Altcoin"

The hike in volume represents a 500% increase from the worth the previous week, DappRadar revealed.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nLast week, the DeLabs team announced that y00ts would be moving from Polygon [MATIC] to join DeGods on the Ethereum blockchain. Although the news was not without controversy, DeLabs followed up with another announcement of a new feminine avatar version (DeGods Season III).\n\nA new collection, a new leader\n\nAccording to the team, (DeGods Season III) would feature 20,000 new generative art pieces, and would launch on the Ethereum blockchain, while also announcing a \u201cdowngrade focused on simplicity.\u201d\n\n2. The new DeGods are flat by design. That's on purpose. The Downgrade is focused on simplicity. We reduced all of the details to the bare minimum. We completely removed the shadows and used highlight tones only on a select few traits. pic.twitter.com/0sqePw5jdu \u2014 DeGods (@DeGodsNFT) August 13, 2023\n\nSo, the hike in trading volume suggests that the move to Ethereum could be termed successful. However, the team also disclosed that it had decided to postpone the launch of the female version due to the community feedback it got. The team explained that,\n\n\u201cAfter receiving a lot of valuable feedback we have decided to postpone Female DeGods. Looking forward to re-approaching that project by getting more feedback from the women in our community. We\u2019ll start reaching out shortly.\u201d\n\nConsequently, DeGods\u2019 increase in volume ensured that the collection surpassed the sales of Bored Ape Yacht Club [BAYC]. At the time of writing, DeGods\u2019 sales were $2.92 million in the last 24 hours. And these transactions happened between 171 buyers and 229 sellers. BAYC, in second place, recorded sales worth $931,784 with fewer traders.\n\nSolana drives Polygon down\n\nIn other developments, Solana [SOL] NFTs have flipped Polygon on the blockchain standing with the most volume. While the competition for dominance in the NFT space is intensifying, the upturn signifies the increasing attention the NFT ecosystem has gained in recent times.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Polygon Profit Calculator\n\nPreviously, AMBCrypto compared how the Solana and Polygon blockchain have fared all through the year. According to the analysis, Polygon has had more active addresses than Solana in the last 30 days. And this could be attributed to the rising NFT participation within the network.\n\nHowever, in the last 24 hours, Solana\u2019s sales volume increased to $1.44 million. Also, wash trading on the blockchain rose by 249.59%. As expected, Ethereum maintained the lead over the other two with a volume of $8.41 million."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), the two biggest cryptocurrencies by total market capitalization, keep displaying uncharacteristically anemic performance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to data analytics firm Kaiko, the 90-day volatility for BTC and ETH has plummeted to 35% and 37%, respectively. In contrast, oil's volatility is currently pegged at 41%.\n\nVolatility refers to the rate at which the price of a given asset increases or decreases for a given period of time. Historically, the flagship cryptocurrency has been known for its penchant for extremely high volatility. However, this has not been the case recently, with Bitcoin acting as a stablecoin.\n\nThis unusual bout of stability for Bitcoin has been accompanied by a sharp decrease in trading volume. Data reveals that Bitcoin's trading volume for last month was at its lowest since November 2020, with its 30-day volatility approaching a five-year low.\n\nIt is worth noting that Bitcoin now demonstrates lower volatility than other traditional stalwarts like the S&P 500, tech stocks and notably, gold, its closest rival.\n\nAs reported by U.Today, the Bollinger Bands, a widely used technical indicator, provides further insights into the anemic performance of the bellwether coin. Bollinger Bands are used to assess price and volatility over time for financial instruments. The narrowing of these bands signals a lull in price fluctuations.\n\nCryptocurrency analysts have recently observed that both Bitcoin and Ethereum's Bollinger Bands have tightened to their \"slimmest on the weekly timeframe.\" This indicates a broader shift toward tranquility on the crypto market.\n\nIn the meantime, oil prices have remained somewhat stable. Recent reports suggest that concerns over China's slowing economy have been offset by expectations of a tighter U.S. supply. However, Brent crude futures and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude are still navigating the rough seas of global economic factors."

        "content": "Shiba Inu Launches Shibarium Layer-2 to Ethereum Mainnet\n\nShibarium's Mainnet Launch Serves As The Fundamental Framework For The Whole SHIB Ecosystem\n\nThe Shiba Inu (SHIB) ecosystem has unveiled Shibarium, its Ethereum layer-2 network, which marks a significant milestone for the project.\n\nThis rollout comes after a thorough beta testnet phase with around 21 million users. With the aim of resolving Ethereum's scalability difficulties, Shibarium's mainnet launch serves as the fundamental framework for the whole SHIB ecosystem. It aims to increase transaction throughput while lowering costs, potentially outperforming rivals in terms of speed and cost-efficiency for decentralized applications (dApps) and transactions.\n\nThe launch of Shibarium is an intentional step to elevate Shiba Inu above its meme coin roots. SHIB, which was first released in 2020, quickly became popular in the memecoin space of cryptocurrencies together with Dogecoin (DOGE). The initiative hopes to move beyond its meme status by establishing a new identity of the protocol with the addition of Shibarium.\n\nThe Shiba Inu lead developer who goes by the moniker Shytoshi Kusama emphasized how different Shibarium is from other scaling methods. In order to provide users with efficient transactions, ownership and membership features, it works as a layer-2 solution that powers governance and the Shiba State framework.\n\nThe network relies on the Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPOS) consensus mechanism.\n\nThe Shiba Inu ecosystem's numerous elements, such as tokens like SHIB and LEASH, SHIBOSHI NFTs, the decentralized market ShibaSwap, and the Shiba Eternity game, are all significant in relation to Shibarium."

The feature offers context on tweets that garner substantial attention, especially those covering contentious topics. These notes are not determined by a centralized team but are contributed and voted upon by the platform's users. An open-source algorithm dictates which notes are showcased, promoting transparency by enabling users to verify the algorithm's output against what is presented on the platform.\n\nButerin's interest in Community Notes stems from its embodiment of values often associated with cryptocurrency. Although not a typical \"crypto project,\" the system upholds principles like decentralization, transparency and community governance. Buterin argues that the transparency offered by Community Notes aligns closely with crypto values.\n\nHe believes this approach provides significant value by deterring centralized manipulation and granting due credit to platforms that uphold ethical standards."

        "content": "ConsenSys has completed the launch of its Ethereum scaling rollup Linea, onboarding over 150 partners and bridging more than $26 million in Ether (ETH) to date.\n\nLinea went live with select partners onboarded to the alpha mainnet in July 2023, allowing developers to migrate existing decentralized applications (DApps) from Ethereum\u2019s mainnet or other scaling solutions. The zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) is a layer-2 scaling solution that provides lower transaction costs and higher throughput for DApps running in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nCointelegraph spoke exclusively to Linea senior product manager Declan Fox to unpack major milestones since the zkEVM\u2019s launch. Fox highlighted Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin\u2019s belief that zero-knowledge rollups (ZK-rollups) would prove crucial in the operation of the wider Ethereum ecosystem as Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (zk-SNARK) technology improves.\n\n\u201cBytecode-compatible zkEVMs, like Linea, provide stronger security guarantees than existing scaling solutions and maintain the full network effects of the EVM \u2014 the most adopted smart contract execution environment.\u201d\n\nAccording to Fox, Linea\u2019s mainnet facilitates trustless bridging between Ethereum and layer 2 in minutes, creating a capital-efficient environment for liquidity to be tied into rollups. Linea also addresses the disadvantages of optimistic rollup solutions that have a seven-day withdrawal confirmation time.\n\n\u201cMuch like how countries without foreign exchange control in the financial markets are more competitive, zkEVM solutions will soon outperform optimistic solutions in terms of user and liquidity acquisition.\u201d\n\nFox added that Linea supports a variety of Web3 use cases, while its low transaction costs and high throughput makes it particularly useful for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.\n\n\u201cLinea is seamless for existing DeFi protocols and DApp developers to build composable money legos that work together to create innovative user experiences.\u201d\n\nLinea also features default integration with ConsenSys\u2019 browser-based MetaMask wallet, allowing DApps on the network to access millions of users across the ecosystem.\n\nFox also noted that the potential for the Linea ecosystem is \u201cboundless,\u201d reflecting on the capabilities of ZK-rollup technology to provide lower costs, higher throughput and Ethereum-based security while providing a capital-efficient bridge to the layer-1 mainnet.\n\nThe public release also saw Linea\u2019s ERC-20 token bridge go live, allowing ERC-20 tokens \u2014 like stablecoins, liquid staking ETH and memecoins \u2014 to be bridged and accessible through the scaling solution.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: Here\u2019s how Ethereum\u2019s ZK-rollups can become interoperable"

        "content": "Share:\n\nOver the past 24 hours, the crypto market has dipped by $14 billion, resulting in $121 million worth of long liquidations.\n\nEthereum, Dogecoin, PEPE, ApeCoin, and Compound, emerged as the top five altcoins to observe excessive unexpected liquidations.\n\nWhile the exact reason for the liquidations is unknown, potential FUD surrounding the shutdown of Binance Connect, the regulated buy-and-sell crypto arm of Binance, could be one.\n\nTo the surprise of crypto traders, the past 24 hours turned out to be not exactly what one would have in mind. As the market reacted to the Binance-related news, it also potentially led to an unexpected change in certain cryptocurrencies\u2019 price action resulting in millions of dollars in liquidations.\n\nEthereum leads the liquidations race\n\nApart from Bitcoin, it was Ethereum that stood out as the altcoin with the most liquidation. Being the second biggest cryptocurrency in the world, it is not a surprise, but the volume of long liquidations stood out from normal. Within the past day, over $15 million worth of long liquidations were observed in the case of ETH.\n\nThe other major cryptocurrencies that stood out in this regard were Dogecoin, Pepe coin, ApeCoin and Compound. DOGE noted over $6.13 million worth of long liquidations, marking a two-month high, while the volume of PEPE nearly hit $1 million against merely $80,000 worth of short liquidations.\n\nDogecoin long liquidation\n\nSimilarly, APE recorded about $1.44 million worth of long contracts being liquidated, hitting a monthly high, and COMP followed in suit, observing $809,000 in long liquidations. Collectively, the crypto marketnoted over $121 million worth of long liquidations against $10 million in short liquidations within a day.\n\nApeCoin long liquidations\n\nWhile the exact reason behind this is unknown, the sudden shift in tone and liquidations is most likely a reaction to FUD. Earlier in the day, Binance\u2019s regulated buy and sell arm, Binance Connect, was announced to face closure. This was confirmed by Binance Smart Chain-based decentralized exchange Biswap that tweeted,\n\n\u201cAfter a thorough consideration, Binance has made a difficult decision to disable Binance Connect on 15 August due to its provider closing the supporting card payments service. This change aligns with the strategic efforts of Binance to focus on its core businesses.\n\nConsidering the price action reaction to the FUD, the crypto market lost about $14 billion in a day, dropping by 1.2% to hit a total market capitalization of $1.12 trillion."

        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin price coils up for a big move and could visit the $30,400 level amid shrinking volatility and increasing open interest to drive the market.\n\nEthereum price could breach the $1,891 barricade, potentially reaching the $1,921 resistance level before pulling back.\n\nRipple price to fall 15% unless bulls leverage the 200-day EMA at $0.5766 for a quick turnaround.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is moving south, coming on the back of growing open interest growing and subsequent increases in liquidations. Ethereum is recording a similar market outlook, causing investors to wonder whether it is the work of manipulators. As BTC and ETH investors brace for a massive move, Ripple (XRP) price continues to whiplsahs and may whitewash all the ground covered on July 13 if bulls continue sitting on their hands.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin volatility signals impulsive move ahead, bulls pay a steep price to get a piece of the action.\n\nBitcoin price coils up for a grand move north\n\nBitcoin (BTC) broke off from its consolidation along the equilibrium, taking a nosedive below the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $29,339. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization could drop further to tag the $28,758 support level before a possible pullback.\n\nThe ensuing demand pressure could see Bitcoin price shatter past the EMAs and escape above the downtrend line. Such a move would clear the path for a possible breach of the $30,079 resistance level and, in a highly bullish case, tag the $30,441 resistance level. Such a move would constitute a 5% climb.\n\nBTC/USDT 12-hour chart\n\nConversely, if selling pressure increases, Bitcoin price could break below the immediate support at $28,758. Such a move would expose the BTC to a possible drop down to the $27,000 range or, in the dire case, slump lower to tag the 26,3000 range. Such a move would constitute a 10% drop from current levels.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) position below 50 adds credence to this bearish outlook and the Awesome Oscillator (AO) histograms in the negative zone.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin volatility signals impulsive move ahead, bulls pay a steep price to get a piece of the action.\n\nEthereum price to head north as open interest skyrockets\n\nEthereum (ETH) price, like BTC, is in a downtrend, but this could be corrected soon as open interest rises. With more money coming into the ETH market, the PoS token could break out 5%, overcoming the $1,891 resistance level before a possible tag of the $1,921 resistance level.\n\nFor now, however, Ethereum price is looking for a possible pivot, with the $1,8118 level presenting as a potential turnaround point for a northbound move. If this bullish outlook plays out, ETH could move above the 200-, 50-, and 100-day EMAs at $1,842, $1,852, and $1,857, respectively. Further north, ETH could breach the $1,981 level and, in a highly bullish case, tag the $1,921 hurdle. This would constitute a 5% climb.\n\nETH/USDT 12-hour chart\n\nConversely, failure of the $1,813 level to hold as support could see ETH descend toward the psychological $1,725 level.\n\nThe RS supports the downside, heading south with a potential breach of the 30 level. Similarly, the AO histograms are red and negative, solidifying bears' presence in the market.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum, XRP, Litecoin and Cardano prices could be bottoming out\n\nRipple price slump continues\n\nRipple (XRP) price continues with its southbound move and could test the 200-day EMA at $0.5766 soon unless bulls recover. With strong bearish forces, the remittance token could extend lower to the $0.5048 support level or, in the dire case, write off all the ground covered in the July 13 rally to find support around the psychological $0.4604, marking a 20% slump below current levels.\n\nThe RSI indicator, currently at 28, indicates the bearish outlook in the market, with the AO histograms also bolstering the case for the bears.\n\nXRP/USDT 12-hour chart\n\nHowever, considering the position of the RSI, XRP could be regarded as overbought if this momentum indicator crosses above the 30 range to the north. The ensuing demand pressure could send Ripple price north, potentially surpassing the $0.6840 hurdle. A sustained uptrend could fuel a climb to the $0.8193 level, denoting a 40% flight above current levels."

        "content": "Share:\n\nShiba Inu price surprisingly took a turn for the worse, trading at $0.00000935, down by almost 6% in the last hour.\n\nShibarium is the designated Ethereum layer-2 solution developed by the Shiba Inu team as a means of providing cheaper and faster transactions using SHIB as the fee token.\n\nAwaiting the launch of Shibarium, the network noted a surge in new addresses, resulting in network growth shooting up by 84% within three weeks.\n\nShiba Inu price began as a meme coin, but the Dogecoin-inspired token is now establishing its presence as a legitimate cryptocurrency network with the launch of its Ethereum-based layer-2 (L2) blockchain. Titled Shibarium, the chain will act as a medium for optimum utilization of dog-themed tokens.\n\nShiba Inu price crashes against expectations\n\nShiba Inu price is set to potentially rally and recover the recent losses following the launch of the highly anticipated Shibarium. The blockchain is Shiba Inu's first attempt at expanding the meme coin's reach. With an Ethereum L2, it will be able to attract more users and investment into the ecosystem.\n\nSince Shibarium is a layer-2 solution on Ethereum, it is significantly faster and cheaper than base layer-1 (L1)chains. Shiba Inu presently operates as an L1 chain, and the launch of Shibarium could potentially bring more users to the network. Furthermore, with the mainnet of the blockchain going live, Shibarium would promote the use of dog-themed tokens within the Shiba Inu ecosystem, including the likes of BONE, TREAT and LEASH.\n\nSHIB/USD 1-day chart\n\nAll of this was supposed to push the price up, but the opposite of the expected outcome occurred, and the Shiba Inu price crashed. Down by nearly 6% in the past hour, the altcoin is currently trading at $0.00000935. With every red candlestick, the meme coin is losing the potential for recovery with price indicators, including Relative Strength Index (RSI) as well as the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD).\n\nA further decline in the price indicators could cause the investors to lose their hope for recovery straight away since the momentum would turn bearish.\n\nInterestingly this reflects against the expectations from the chain, which was observing a sudden jump in the rate thatnew addresses are formed on the network. This measures whether or not the project is finding traction amongst crypto investors.\n\nShiba Inu network growth\n\nOver the past three weeks, this network growth has noted an 84% surge, suggesting investors' interest was rising ahead of the Shibarium launch. Going forward, as the users get acclimatized to the network, it could end up pulling the price up toward the end of the month."

        "content": "Episode 16 of Hashing It Out explores one of the most popular cryptocurrency use cases: payments. Mark Smargon, CEO of Fuse, joins host Elisha Owusu Akyaw to discuss various Web3 payment solutions and how Fuse contributes to businesses\u2019 adoption of cryptocurrency payments.\n\nSmargon explained that the payment network\u2019s strategy involves looking beyond investments to focus on everyday use cases like payments, which will likely bring more sustainable adoption. Despite the goal, Smargon recounted the difficulty in convincing people and investors that businesses would adopt blockchain payments when starting Fuse in 2019.\n\nSmargon further explained that Fuse is not competing with Ethereum but with Visa and Stripe, and that it\u2019s intended to be the main payment layer for global transactions. On whether the battle of adoption will be won by a few blockchain networks, Smargon mentioned that Fuse has never held a maximalist mindset:\n\n\u201cWe really believe that in the future, there is going to be many blockchains. There is not going to be one blockchain that will hold the entire human knowledge. We were never maximalists in that approach.\u201d\n\nSmargon believes that Web3 payments have come a long way in the last two years as things like nonfungible tokens and digital collectibles have become more popular. What\u2019s more, the increase in freelancers from developing markets who are paid in cryptocurrency and the use of cryptocurrencies for cross-border payments have been among other catalysts spearheading Web3 payment adoption.\n\nRelated: Should we ban ransomware payments? It\u2019s an attractive but dangerous idea\n\nOwusu Akyaw asked about the impact of regulations on Web3 payments and adoption in the future. Smargon called it a rollercoaster ride, due to the unstable nature of regulations across the globe. He also added that blockchain technology may need to evolve by adding new features and taking away some existing features to fit regulations and create a better connection with traditional finance.\n\nListen to the latest episode of Hashing It Out with Fuse CEO Smargon on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts or TuneIn.

        "title": "Bitcoin or Ethereum? DeFi Dev Explains Which Is Better For Building - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Is Bitcoin or Ethereum a better protocol for developers? A closer look reveals the answer may not be so obvious.\n\nTony Cai \u2013 CEO of Bitcoin-based DeFi platform Atomic Finance and former Ethereum builder \u2013 published a Twitter thread on Wednesday explaining the different experiences of building apps on both networks, including the strengths and weaknesses of each.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Advantage: Security and Focus\n\nAccording to Cai, Bitcoin\u2019s first advantage is the security of its programming language. The original crypto network\u2019s Discrete Log Contracts (DLCs) boast fewer attack services than Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts, which have lost users hundreds of millions of dollars due to coding mistakes and exploits over the past few years.\n\n\u201cIn ETH, one tiny mistake (like 1-2 lines of code being written in the wrong order) can lead to millions lost,\u201d wrote Cai.\n\nHaving spent time building on ETH first before pivoting to building on BTC, I've seen the best and worst parts of both communities. I'm probably gonna get some hate for this, but screw it\u2026 BTC vs ETH: An Honest Reflection from a Builder. Here are 6 things I noticed:\ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/3sBZKrZlRn \u2014 Tony Cai \u269b\ufe0f #SoundFinance (@TonyCai_) August 16, 2023\n\nThe Bitcoin development experience also benefits from \u201claser focus\u201d \u2013 clarity and emphasis specifically on innovation. According to Cai, the ETH community \u201cmoves fast\u201d and ushers in new developments every week, making it easy for builders to get lost with \u201cshiny object syndrome.\u201d\n\n\u201cBitcoin\u2019s scripting language and capabilities are intentionally limited to ensure its primary function remains robust,\u201d said Cai to CryptoPotato via DM. \u201cEthereum, on the other hand, was designed as a platform for decentralized applications, making it more flexible and versatile.\u201d\n\nEthereum has famously boasted both NFTs and tokenization for years \u2013 technologies that have only begun to emerge on Bitcoin. This limited capability keeps developers focused on securing product-market fit, rather than conjuring complex tokenomics and \u201crationalizations\u201d as to why their projects need a token at all.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Advantage: Expressiveness and Dev Infrastructure\n\nNaturally, Bitcoin\u2019s strict scripting language leaves it with some tradeoffs. Not only is development more technically limited, but more developers naturally gravitate toward\u2019s Ethereum\u2019s more welcoming programming language \u2013 Solidity.\n\n\u201cProgramming on Solidity is simple for anyone who understands the basics of Javascript. Which most programmers do these days,\u201d said Cai. It also has far greater developer infrastructure through tools like Truffle Suite and Infura, and more hackathon events for creating new tools.\n\nCai believes the fewer hackathons in Bitcoin may boil down to its relative lack of tokenization, which has led to less funding and sponsorships for the network\u2019s developers. \u201cBTC startups don\u2019t have the luxury of massive treasuries funded by a token drop / ICO,\u201d he explained.\n\nThough firms like Blockstream and Chaincode Labs have stepped in to help fund the ecosystem, Cai said Ethereum has always had a more \u201cstructured\u201d approach to funding thanks to its ICO, and the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nDeveloper culture within both camps also widely differs. Whereas Bitcoiners make changes \u201ccautiously\u201d with a focus on \u201cpreserving the integrity of the network,\u201d Ethereum development can be more of a \u201cfree for all\u201d where devs are constantly \u201cexploring new use cases.\u201d\n\nThe contrast has created a clear rift where Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cpodcasters\u201d and \u201ccontent creators\u201d often take the public spotlight, rather than its developers. It\u2019s also limited the creativity of Bitcoin applications and startups to four basic categories: lightning network micropayments, fiat on-ramps, multisig providers, and bitcoin rewards.\n\n\u201cBitcoin\u2019s grassroots, decentralized approach to funding and development has its merits, as does Ethereum\u2019s more structured approach,\u201d concluded Cai."

The US Fed minutes of meeting for July dampened the traders sentiments across the globe, which hinted for more rate hikes by the US central lender if need be.\n\n\n\nBitcoin continued to weaken further as the largest crypto token dropped as much as 2 per cent to slip below 29,000-mark once again. Its largest peer, Ethereum, was also trading 2 per cent down, slipping below $1,800-levels after the latest weakness. Price action in the major altcoins was on the lower side.\n\n\n\nBitcoin is trading above the $28,500 mark. This might be because of the diminishing worth of the Russian Rouble and Argentina's Peso in relation to the US Dollar. Meanwhile, Ethereum has departed from its former trend of trading between $1,800 and $1,900, currently positioning itself just beneath the $1,800 threshold, said Edul Patel,Co-Founder & CEO at Mudrex.\n\n\n\nAll other top crypto tokens were trading lower on Thursday. Shiba Inu crashed more than 8 per cent, while Litecoin tanked more than 5 per cent. Dogecoin tumbled 4 per cent, whereas Toncoin, XRP and BNB dropped 3 per cent each.

        "content": "TORONTO , Aug. 16, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SHIB and its Shiba Inu Ecosystem, an interconnected family of digital assets and solutions built on the Ethereum blockchain that includes popular global cryptocurrency Shiba Inu, today announced at the Blockchain Futurist Conference/ETH Toronto that it has launched its highly anticipated Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) blockchain Shibarium. Shiba Inu is located at booth #23.\n\n\n\nNow that the Shibarium mainnet is live, it will serve as the technical bedrock underpinning the entire Shiba Inu State. Having already resonated with a community of over 21 million user wallets during its beta testnet, the live Shibarium mainnet is now ready to on-board millions more who are interested in shaping a new future that honors the principles of decentralization, interoperability, and user-centric design for both blockchain and technology at large.\n\n\u201cMany in the tech world, inside and outside blockchain, are promising \u2018everything apps\u2019 and full user interactivity in the world of ideas, goods, services, and other opportunities,\u201d said Shiba Inu Lead Developer who goes by the pseudonym Shytoshi Kusama. \u201cHowever, any such promise absolutely must start at a place of both community and decentralization. As part of one of the most popular cryptocurrencies on the planet, Shibarium lives at the intersection of those two principles in a way that eludes most other technologies, even many other blockchains.\u201d\n\nFocusing on facilitating high-speed transactions with minimal gas fees and transforming the user experience in the blockchain space, Shibarium is built on the community-first and environment-friendly consensus mechanism that is Proof of Stake (POS). The Shibarium blockchain is built on a sturdy foundation of both validators and delegators. Validators run nodes, process transactions, and create new blocks, ensuring the seamless operation and overall security of the ecosystem. Delegators, meanwhile, are empowered to support these carefully curated validators by staking support tokens. Both validators and delegators are rewarded for their participation in this ecosystem with a governance token called BONE, which has a total supply of 250,000,000. BONE can also be used within Shiba Inu State governance.\n\nAnyone can build cost-effective protocols on Shibarium, expanding the reach and potential of the ecosystem while enriching the overall user. The Shiba Inu Ecosystem is also prioritizing the integration of Self-Sovereign Identity, or SSI, into all necessary protocols moving forward so that those who interact with the Shiba Inu Ecosystem are empowered to fully control and secure their digital identity without the interference of third parties. SSI enables users\u2019 self custody of verified credentials including physical documents that confirm and secure identity, such as passports and driver\u2019s licenses.\n\nNow that it is live, Shibarium will also be used to support the other parts of the existing Shiba Inu Ecosystem, including the $SHIB and $LEASH tokens, SHIBOSHI NFTs, SHIB The Metaverse, the ShibaSwap DEX, and the Shiba Eternity game alongside the thousands of incoming community projects.\n\nAbout SHIB\n\nSHIB, a world-leading ecosystem of decentralized finance (DeFi) cryptocurrencies has gained popularity among millions of holders worldwide. It has 3.6 million Twitter followers and is frequently ranked as the second most searched crypto project by Google. Its ecosystem of tokens include $SHIB, $LEASH, and $BONE, plus native SHIBOSHIs NFTs.\n\n\n\nSHIB.io utilizes the Shib Ecosystem to power quality technologies including SHIB:The Metaverse and Shibarium, the Layer 2 blockchain, providing a solid foundation, scalability, security, and innovation for a decentralized world.\n\n\n\nTo learn more about SHIB, please visit the official website: https://shibatoken.com.\n\nTo learn more about or join Shib visit: https://www.shib.io."

        "content": "ZetaChain, the layer-one blockchain that brings universal interoperability to crypto, has closed a $27 million equity funding round from a range of top participants. The participants in the equity round include Blockchain.com, Human Capital, VY Capital, Sky9 Capital, Jane Street Capital, VistaLabs, CMT Digital, Foundation Capital, Lingfeng Capital, GSR, Kudasai, Krust, and others.\n\nZetaChain started in 2021 and has close to 150 contributors from all over the world. Some of the core contributors include Ankur Nandwani (ex-Coinbase, Brave, 0x, and co-founder of Basic Attention Token), Panruo Wu (early contributor to THORchain), and Brandon Truong (ex-BuzzFeed, Udacity, Yada). Other core members include former employees of Cosmos, Ignite, Consensys, and multiple other blockchain projects.\n\nZetaChain\u2019s mission is to establish a new standard for blockchain interoperability and enable users to manage all of their assets and data from a single platform, regardless of the blockchain they were created or stored on and without the need for bridges or wrapped tokens. This includes non-smart contract chains like the Bitcoin network and Dogecoin. Standardized interoperability provides developers with significant advantages as they can manage a single contract for all chains and reduce the attack surface. ZetaChain\u2019s Ethereum Virtual Machine compatible smart contract layer and omnichain toolkit empower developers to seamlessly implement Bitcoin smart contracts. This unlocks a whole world of users who were previously solely in Bitcoin, enabling them to utilize their Bitcoin within the broader DeFi ecosystem.\n\nThe ZetaChain ecosystem is thriving, with more than 27,000 dApp contracts currently deployed on the platform. These represent a diverse range of third-party decentralized applications, including cross-chain DeFi, NFTs, universal web3 social, identity, and gaming protocols. Already, more than 1.7 million users have participated on the ZetaChain testnet, which has seen over 13 million transactions completed to date.\n\n\u201cZetaChain\u2019s purpose is to simplify managing assets and data across multiple blockchains, which remains a complicated and fragmented process that\u2019s hindering hundreds of millions of new users joining the web3 ecosystem,\u201d said Ankur Nandwani, ZetaChain core contributor. \u201cOur EVM-compatible cross-chain smart contracts alleviate these issues by allowing decentralized app developers to build services that are faster, more secure, and easy to use.\u201d\n\nBuilt on top of the Cosmos SDK and Tendermint Consensus, which provide fast block time and instant finality, ZetaChain aims to overcome the limitations of traditional cross-chain solutions like bridges that rely on centralized trust models, making them susceptible to security breaches. Instead, ZetaChain operates as a transparent Proof-of-Stake blockchain, ensuring complete transparency, verifiability, and trust-minimized functionality for all transactions and activities, including cross-chain transactions."

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Faces Stiff Competition from This Fast-Growing Token Set for 50x Gains - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Ethereum gave Bitcoin the closest competition since the project launched as a top altcoin. Ever since, Ethereum (ETH) hasn\u2019t had any competition as stiff as this new hybrid meme coin with its promising 50x gains.\n\nThis article reviews the chances of this new meme coin taking over from Ethereum (ETH) and what this means for investors.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Journey as the Smart Contract Pioneer\n\nEthereum\u2019s proficiency in executing smart contracts drove it to the forefront of blockchain innovation. With smart contracts, developers automate processes and get rid of intermediaries. This tool paved the way for more efficient and transparent applications. There are a ton of DApps hosted on the Ethereum ecosystem, serving various uses from decentralized finance (DeFi) to non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Overall, Ethereum\u2019s versatility and developer-friendly setup make it an enabling and innovative platform.\n\nWith blockchain technology continuing its efforts at revolutionizing industries, Ethereum\u2019s importance in the crypto world remains fundamental and ETH price growth emphasizes that. If as an investor you need that exposure to a diverse range of projects built on a robust blockchain, Ethereum is a solid choice.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price is currently set at $1,830, which is 0.1% down in the last 24 hours. As the second-largest crypto, ETH has been going through minor loss phases in the past few days. The price chart reveals the issues ETH is having in its attempt to break above its current resistance levels. ETH technical indicators reveal mixed signals. But, the moving averages are still in a bullish shape, meaning an uptick might not be far off.\n\nNonetheless, the RSI is drifting in neutral territory, indicating an absence of clear direction. Investors and traders should pay close attention to the support level around $1,800 and the resistance level near $1,900. Should the Ethereum price break below $1,800, that might result in additional selling pressure. But a break above $1,900 could bring in fresh bullish momentum.\n\nPikamoon (PIKA) Betters Ethereum (ETH) Price Growth Offering to Investors\n\nPikamoon builds a world of adventures called the Pikaverse where the Pikamoon Adventure P2E game works as a reward initiative for gamers. Gamers get rewarded with NFTs or PIKA for their success in activities like monster battles, bounty searches, and more.\n\nThis project also adds innovative features like a marketplace, and seamless exchange, through the latest technologies and support from two blockchain networks as explained below:\n\nCome for the Game. Enjoy the Profits\n\nThe metaverse game that powers Pikamoon is for players to enjoy both online and offline. This means Pikamoon gamers have an edge over other GameFi gamers. Plus, that means more use and demand for PIKA, increasing its value growth for gamers and delivering more profits for investors.\n\nBuilt on the Ethereum Blockchain and One Other to Compete with Ethereum\n\nPikamoon (PIKA) builds on two of the best blockchains in the market and one of them is the Ethereum blockchain. It also builds on MultiversX (formerly Elrond). These networks better the metaverse gaming and NFT edge of the project, allowing Pikamoon and PIKA to scale with ease and continue to deliver explosive profits to investors.\n\nPIKA is Ready to Deliver Millions\n\nPIKA\u2019s deflationary design is the biggest factor behind its natural growth. As time goes on, the total PIKA supply reduces gradually. Combining this with gamers using the token often in the Pikamoon Adventure game leads to token scarcity. This means an increase in PIKA\u2019s value and more millions for PIKA holders as profits.\n\nPikamoon Presale\u2019s Success Delivers the First Sign of Possible 50x Gains\n\nAs Pikamoon Presale enters its third phase, it is clear that the time is in the mood to deliver GameFi gold. PIKA is selling out fast as investors recognize the potential for 50x more profits, as called by expert analysts.\n\nJoin the 50x party. Buy $PIKA today.\n\nFind out more about Pikamoon (PIKA):\n\nBuy Now: https://pikamoon.io/buy\n\nWebsite: https://pikamoon.io\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Pikamooncoin\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/pikamoonofficial\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Top 10 Use Cases of Ethereum NFT Assets - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Here are the Top 10 use cases of Ethereum NFT assets that Showcase their Potential and Diversity\n\nNFTs are non-fungible tokens, unique and indivisible digital assets representing anything from art, music, games, collectibles, domain names, real estate, and more. NFTs are powered by smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, which ensure their authenticity, ownership, and scarcity. NFTs have gained popularity in recent years as a new way to create, buy, sell, and trade digital goods and services. In the digital world, NFTs can also enable new forms of creativity, expression, and interaction.\n\nHere are some of the top 10 use cases of Ethereum NFT assets that showcase their potential and diversity:\n\n1. Digital Art\n\nNFTs can help digital artists prove their authorship, protect their intellectual property rights, and monetize their work globally. NFTs can also create new digital art creation and consumption possibilities, such as interactive, dynamic, or programmable art.\n\n2. Gaming\n\nNFTs can represent in-game assets, such as characters, items, weapons, skins, or land. NFTs can also enable players to own, trade, or transfer their in-game assets across different games or platforms.\n\n3. Domain Names\n\nNFTs can represent domain names registered on the Ethereum Name Service (ENS). This decentralized protocol allows users to create human-readable names for Ethereum addresses or other resources. NFTs can also give users more control and flexibility over their domain names.\n\n4. Physical Items\n\nNFTs can be used to create digital certificates or passports for physical items that can verify their authenticity, origin, history, or condition. NFTs can also enable users to track or trace their physical items throughout their lifecycle or supply chain.\n\n5. Investments and Collateral\n\nNFTs can be investments that can appreciate over time or generate passive income from royalties or fees. NFTs can also be used as collateral locked in smart contracts to borrow or lend money or other assets.\n\n6. Tokengating\n\nNFTs can grant access to premium content, services, events, or networks only available for token holders. Tokengating can also create a sense of belonging and loyalty among token holders with common interests or values.\n\n7. Identity\n\nNFTs can store personal information, such as name, email address, phone number, or social media accounts. NFTs can verify or authenticate users\u2019 identities for various purposes, such as accessing websites, dApps, or services.\n\n8. Metadata\n\nNFTs can store additional information or data about the token or its underlying asset. Metadata NFTs can also embed functionality or logic into the token, such as programmability, interactivity, or composability.\n\n9. Social Tokens\n\nNFTs can be used to create and issue tokens by individuals or communities to represent their social capital or influence. Social tokens can also reward or incentivize users for their participation, contribution, or support in a social network or platform.\n\n10. DAOs\n\nNFTs can create and manage collective entities or projects governed by smart contracts and token holders. DAOs can also coordinate and distribute resources, decisions, or actions among token holders.\n\nThese are some ways that NFTs can be used for various purposes on Ethereum. NFTs are not just a trend or a hype but a paradigm shift in the digital economy and society.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "We Asked ChatGPT for Insights on Ethereum, Shiba Inu, and Everlodge Prices \u2013 Here's What It Said - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Today, we turned to ChatGPT, an advanced AI chatbot, to provide us with its analysis and projections for three intriguing tokens: Ethereum (ETH), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Everlodge (ELDG). It gave us a unique perspective on the market trends and factors that might influence these tokens\u2019 prices.\n\nJoin the Everlodge presale and win a luxury holiday to the Maldives\n\nEthereum (ETH): Trading in the Red\n\nChatGPT took notice of the Ethereum (ETH) weekly price charts, which have been bleeding. In fact, the Ethereum price fell by 2% in the past week alone. Also, long liquidations of more than $15M have been seen in Ethereum during that time.\n\nThis liquidation resulted from the recent news that Binance Connect would cease its operations. As a result, the generated FUD caused many altcoins like Ethereum to plummet. Moreover, this bearish trend has continued as the Ethereum value now sits at $1,824.02 with a market cap of $219B, down 0.90% overnight.\n\nNot only that, but ChatGPT also pointed to the bearish technical analysis, which shows all moving averages in red. Therefore, market analysts forecast a short-term drop to its support level of $1,200 for Ethereum.\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB): Slowly Losing Gains\n\nWhen asked about Shiba Inu (SHIB), ChatGPT acknowledged the token\u2019s popularity and vibrant community but cautioned that it operates in a speculative and highly volatile space. The chatbot emphasized that investor sentiment plays a significant role in SHIB\u2019s price movements.\n\nIn recent Shiba Inu news, the token saw a delightful 14-day period as the hype for Shibarium increased. As a matter of fact, the Shiba Inu price jumped by 16.8% in that period.\n\nHowever, it now appears those gains are slowly fading as Shiba Inu has a value of $0.000009724, which is a drop of 5% overnight. Additionally, ChatGPT took notice of the red technical indicators for Shiba Inu, which paint a bearish picture. Due to all these red charts, Shiba Inu could fall to $0.00000946 soon.\n\nEverlodge (ELDG): A Potential Market Disruptor\n\nDiscussing Everlodge (ELDG), ChatGPT highlighted the innovative approach of fractional ownership and property tokenization. It recognized the potential of blockchain technology to disrupt the real estate market and increase accessibility for investors.\n\nWhat Separates Everlodge (ELDG) From the Rest?\n\nAs per ChatGPT, Everlodge taps into the global vacation rental market, valued at $82.63B in 2022. However, it also solves plenty of issues plaguing this market and the general real estate market.\n\nFor instance, a lack of transparency and trust between parties has often hindered real estate transactions. Everlodge\u2019s use of blockchain technology ensures that all property details, titles, and ownership records are stored transparently. This reduces fraud, streamlines processes, and enhances trust.\n\nMoreover, unlike traditional real estate investment, which requires an enormous upfront cost, Everlodge allows users to invest only $100. It accomplishes this by digitizing and minting NFTs representing actual luxurious properties. Afterward, these NFTs are fractionalized. As a result, buyers from all income brackets can participate in this growing market.\n\nELDG \u2013 The Token To Keep on Your Radar\n\nCurrently, the ELDG native token is valued at $0.01 as it is in Stage 1 of its presale. But, ChatGPT also pointed to the fact that Stage 2 is coming very soon- with it \u2013 a 20% pump. With predictions that ELDG could soar by 280% before its presale ends, now is the perfect time to purchase it. Therefore, sign up below for staking rewards, trading fee discounts, and more.\n\nFind out more about the Everlodge (ELDG) Presale\n\nWebsite: https://www.everlodge.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/everlodge\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Top Use Cases of Ethereum NFT Assets - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Check out the Use cases before trading Ethereum NFT Assets, and the Future of Digital Ownership\n\nUnique digital tokens that reflect ownership or validity of particular digital or physical goods are known as Ethereum NFT assets. On the Ethereum blockchain, using decentralized apps and smart contracts, they are generated, purchased, traded, and owned. Because they enable direct peer-to-peer transactions without middlemen and can establish verifiable ownership, Ethereum NFTs have grown in popularity and revolutionized how digital assets are priced, acquired, and traded.\n\nUse Cases of Ethereum NFT Assets:\n\nA wide range of use cases across several sectors and areas is possible for Ethereum NFT (Non-Fungible Token) assets. NFTs are suited for applications where ownership, authenticity, and provenance of digital or physical assets are vital due to their distinctive characteristics, such as indivisibility, verifiability, and scarcity. Some well-known applications for Ethereum NFT assets are listed below:\n\n1. Collectibles and Digital Art:\n\nBy enabling artists to tokenize and market their digital creations as distinct digital assets, NFTs have revolutionized the art sector. Limited edition or one-of-a-kind works of art can be produced by artists to ensure scarcity and exclusivity. By enabling provenance monitoring, NFTs make it possible to quickly verify the ownership history and validity of the artwork. Marketplaces for digital art and collectibles built on NFT technology, such as SuperRare, OpenSea, and Rarible, have grown in popularity.\n\n2. Gaming and Virtual Resources:\n\nIn-game characters, objects, and virtual assets may now be owned and traded by gamers because of the widespread use of NFTs in the gaming sector. NFTs enable the safe purchase, sale, and transfer of these assets, giving users actual ownership and the opportunity to profit from their gaming accomplishments. Axie Infinity, CryptoKitties, and Decentraland are three prominent blockchain-based games that highlight the potential of NFTs in the gaming industry.\n\n3. Entertainment and Music:\n\nThe music and entertainment businesses are changing thanks to NFTs. Exclusive music songs, albums, or concert tickets can be made available by musicians as NFTs, giving fans the chance to purchase one-of-a-kind digital mementos. NFTs can give artists new sources of income, allow for direct fan interaction, and give royalty payments transparency and traceability. NFT marketplaces for music and entertainment have formed on platforms like Audius and Rarible.\n\n4. Virtual Property:\n\nIn virtual worlds or metaverses, NFTs have been used to represent ownership of virtual land, buildings, and assets. Virtual real estate may be purchased, sold, and developed by users to provide one-of-a-kind and immersive experiences. Users can exchange NFT-based virtual assets and monetize their works in virtual settings provided by platforms like Decentraland and The Sandbox.\n\n5. Identity and Domain Names:\n\nNFTs may be used to symbolize domain name ownership, enabling users to safely purchase, sell, and transfer individual internet addresses. As a result, there is no longer a need for a centralized authority to manage and trade domain names. NFTs may also be used for digital identity management, enabling people to demonstrate control over and ownership of their digital identities and personal data.\n\n6. Physical Asset Tokenization:\n\nPhysical assets like real estate, designer products, and works of art may be tokenized using NFTs to create digital equivalents that can be exchanged on the blockchain. This makes it possible for often illiquid assets to have fractional ownership, liquidity, and efficient value transfer. NFTs offer provenance and transparency, which lowers the risk of fraud and fosters confidence in high-value transactions.\n\nJust a handful of the numerous use cases for Ethereum NFT assets are shown in the preceding paragraphs. NFTs are expected to be used by new applications and sectors as technology progresses to unlock value, establish ownership, and provide distinctive digital experiences.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "How the Latest \u201cERC-4337\u201d Ethereum Upgrade Will Impact NFT? - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Know how the ERC-4337 Ethereum upgrade will impact the NFT market and ecosystem in 2023\n\nThis article will explain how the latest \u201cERC-4337\u201d Ethereum upgrade will impact the NFT market and what it means for NFT creators and collectors.\n\nWhat is ERC-4337?\n\nERC-4337 is an Ethereum standard that achieves account abstraction on the protocol without any consensus-layer changes. Deployed on the Ethereum mainnet in March 2023, ERC-4337 makes transacting and creating contracts in a single contract account possible. It opens the door to user-friendly crypto wallet designs that could facilitate broader adoption.\n\nAccount abstraction is a long-awaited feature of Ethereum that aims to combine the features of the protocol\u2019s two existing account types: externally owned accounts (EOAs) and smart contract accounts. EOAs are owned and controlled by users, while smart contract accounts are smart contracts deployed on the network. Both accounts can receive, hold, and send ether or tokens, but only smart contract accounts can execute code and logic.\n\nMost existing crypto wallets on Ethereum, such as MetaMask, are EOAs, meaning they are limited by the rules set around EOAs. These limitations include solely relying on private keys to access accounts and requiring all transactions to be signed. ERC-4337 allows users to use smart contract wallets containing arbitrary verification logic instead of EOAs as their primary account. This means that users can have more control and flexibility over their transactions, such as using social recovery, customization, upgradeability, multi-factor authentication, automatic payments, and more.\n\nHow Does ERC-4337 Work?\n\nERC-4337 works by introducing a higher-layer pseudo-transaction object called a UserOperation. A UserOperation is a data structure that describes a transaction to be sent on behalf of a user. Unlike a normal transaction, a UserOperation contains several other fields, such as nonce, gas limit, gas price, fee recipient, signature, and data. The signature field is not defined by the protocol but by each account implementation \u2013 the smart contract wallet sending the UserOperation.\n\nA UserOperation is not directly included in a block but instead sent to a special contract called an EntryPoint. An EntryPoint is a singleton contract that executes bundles of UserOperations. Bundlers are nodes (block builders) that can handle UserOperations, create a valid EntryPoint.handleOps() transaction, and add it to the block while it is still valid. This can be achieved in various ways, such as flash bots or proposer-builder separation.\n\nERC-4337 also introduces a concept of paymasters \u2013 helper contracts trusted by accounts to validate an aggregated signature and pay for the gas fees of UserOperations. Paymasters can also implement different fee models, such as sponsored transactions or tokens as gas.\n\nHow Does ERC-4337 Impact NFTs?\n\nERC-4337 has several implications for the NFT market and ecosystem. Here are some of the main benefits and challenges of ERC-4337 for NFTs:\n\nBenefits:\n\nERC-4337 enables more user-friendly and secure crypto wallet designs that can attract more users to the NFT space. Users can have more options and features for managing their NFTs, such as social recovery, customization, upgradeability, multi-factor authentication, automatic payments, and more.\n\nERC-4337 allows users to pay gas fees differently, such as using tokens or sponsored transactions. This can lower the barriers to entry for NFT creation and trading, especially for users who do not have either or do not want to deal with volatile gas prices.\n\nERC-4337 supports aggregated signatures (e.g., BLS), which can reduce the size and cost of transactions involving multiple signatures. This can enable more efficient and scalable solutions for NFT minting and transferring.\n\nChallenges:\n\nERC-4337 requires users to trust bundlers and paymasters to handle their UserOperations correctly and fairly. Users may face censorship, front-running, or malicious behavior from these actors.\n\nERC-4337 adds complexity and overhead to the protocol and the user experience. Users may need to understand how UserOperations work and how to interact with different bundlers and paymasters.\n\nERC-4337 does not solve the environmental impact of NFTs on Ethereum. NFTs still consume a lot of energy and generate many carbon emissions due to the proof-of-work consensus mechanism of Ethereum. Users who care about sustainability may prefer solutions like layer 2 scaling or alternative blockchains.\n\nIn conclusion, ERC-4337 is an innovative Ethereum standard that achieves account abstraction without consensus-layer changes. It allows users to use smart contract wallets instead of EOAs as their primary account, enabling more user-friendly and flexible crypto wallet designs. It also allows users to pay gas fees differently and supports aggregated signatures for more efficient transactions.\n\nERC-4337 has significant implications for the NFT market and ecosystem. It can lower the barriers to entry for NFT creation and trading, as well as enable more features and options for managing NFTs. However, it also introduces some challenges and risks, such as trusting bundlers and paymasters, dealing with complexity and overhead, and addressing the environmental impact of NFTs.\n\nERC-4337 is a promising development for Ethereum and NFTs, but it is not a silver bullet. Users should be aware of the benefits and challenges of ERC-4337 and make informed decisions about their NFT activities.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Bitcoin vs Ethereum \u2013 What is the Difference? - Money.ca",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency speculation ran wild in 2017 with a surge in prices for digital coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum. But after bottoming out in 2018, we\u2019re seeing the early stages of another cryptocurrency rally. This article will look at Bitcoin vs. Ethereum and explore the differences between these two popular cryptocurrencies.\n\nVisit Wealthsimple Crypto\n\nBitcoin basics\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is the most popular and widely held cryptocurrency, with a market cap of $221 billion and an average trading volume of $20 billion per day. It is a peer-to-peer digital currency where transactions are recorded on ledger technology known as a blockchain.\n\nThe idea of Bitcoin emerged from a 2009 white paper written by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto (whose identity remains to be confirmed). Bitcoin would be wholly decentralized from any government or bank.\n\nInstead of a central bank issuing new money as currency, new Bitcoins are \u201cmined\u201d using powerful computers to solve complex algorithms. A successful \u2018mining\u2019 adds a new block to the blockchain, and the miner is rewarded with a pre-determined number of new Bitcoins.\n\nThese coins can be stored in a digital wallet, either on a mobile device or a computer. These are known as hot or cold wallets, with the former being connected to the internet and easier to transact, and the latter being unplugged from the internet and more secure.\n\nAround 18 million Bitcoins have been successfully mined to date, but there is a finite supply of just 21 million Bitcoins. Once all of the Bitcoins have been successfully mined there will be no more supply \u2013 even if some Bitcoins are lost forever.\n\nBitcoin is strictly used as a digital currency and a store of value, similar to that of gold. The primary goal is to establish itself as an alternative monetary system. Bitcoin \u201cmania\u201d reached a fever pitch in 2017 when the price of one coin traded at just under $20,000. Today, the price of one Bitcoin is worth just under $12,000.\n\nFinally, Bitcoin trades on cryptocurrency exchanges like Wealthsimple Crypto for fiat money (i.e. Canadian or U.S. dollars), or other digital coins like Ethereum or Litecoin.\n\nEthereum basics\n\nEthereum (ETH) is safely in the number two position in terms of cryptocurrency popularity with a market cap of $42 billion and an average trading volume of $9 billion per day.\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, which is simply a form of digital money, Ethereum is an entire network that exists on a blockchain and can be used to run decentralized applications, create and enforce smart contracts, and can even create additional cryptocurrencies.\n\nEther \u2013 the cryptocurrency of Ethereum \u2013 can be sent, received, and stored as digital money. It\u2019s used to pay transaction fees on the Ethereum network.\n\nLike Bitcoin, the idea of Ethereum was proposed in a white paper written in 2013 by Russian-Canadian programmer Vitalik Buterin. In it, he described Ethereum as a \u201cdecentralized mining network and software development platform rolled into one.\u201d\n\nEther is also \u201cmined\u201d to create new tokens or coins, but it is preparing to launch Ethereum 2.0 in 2020 which will focus more on proof of stake rather than a proof of work concept (mining to solve complex puzzles). Ether will be awarded to \u201cvalidators\u201d who have an established history with the Ethereum network.\n\nThere is no limit to the number of Ether tokens that can be mined or awarded, although Ethereum 2.0 is expected to limit the creation of new supply to around 2% per year (instead of the current 10% per year inflation rate).\n\nEther trades on cryptocurrency exchanges like Wealthsimple Crypto and can be traded by currency brokers and other online digital wallets.\n\nBitcoin vs. Ethereum: Similarities\n\nBoth Bitcoin and Ether are digital currencies that can be sent, received, and held in storage. Each of these digital coins (BTC and ETH) can be traded on a cryptocurrency exchange. For instance, you can trade Bitcoin and Ethereum for free using Wealthsimple Crypto.\n\nEthereum was created as a complement to Bitcoin, not as a competitor, with Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin arguing that Bitcoin needed a scripting language for application development. But today Ethereum is seen as Bitcoin\u2019s main rival and the second most popular cryptocurrency in the world.\n\nBecause of this perception, the price of Bitcoin and Ethereum seem inextricably linked \u2013 meaning their price movements rise and fall together unlike any other digital coin.\n\nThat\u2019s where the similarities end.\n\nYahoo Finance\n\nBitcoin vs. Ethereum: Differences\n\nBitcoin only has two uses: as a digital currency and a store of value. It\u2019s much like gold, where there\u2019s no intrinsic value but its price increases or decreases with public sentiment and speculation. If investors believe that the demand for Bitcoin will increase, they will bid the price up. If investors believe the demand for Bitcoin will decrease, they\u2019ll sell and drive the price down.\n\nEthereum is more than just a cryptocurrency, making it quite different than Bitcoin. In fact, you could argue that Ethereum isn\u2019t really a cryptocurrency at all \u2013 it\u2019s a type of blockchain technology that powers an entirely decentralized network that allows developers to create applications, smart contracts, and even games (CryptoKitties, anyone?).\n\nOther key differences include:\n\nSupply \u2013 Bitcoin has a finite supply of 21 million coins, while Ethereum has no limit to the amount of Ether that can be created.\n\nMining \u2013 Bitcoin miners must use powerful computers to solve complex puzzles that reward them with new Bitcoins. Ethereum plans to move to a proof-of-stake concept that rewards loyal and trusted \u201cValidators\u201d with new Ether coins, reducing the energy required to produce new coins.\n\nBlock time \u2013 Ethereum takes 14 seconds to create a new block in the chain, versus 10 minutes for Bitcoin. Shorter block times mean faster transactions.\n\nPurpose \u2013 Bitcoin wants to disrupt the centralized monetary system and establish itself as an alternative currency. Ethereum aims to grow its decentralized application platform and smart contracts.\n\nFinal word\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are the world\u2019s number one and number two most popular cryptocurrencies. As an investment, their prices seem to rise and fall together as if they\u2019re joined at the hip. That\u2019s where the similarities end.\n\nEthereum has a much broader objective, built to operate as a decentralized network that powers applications and smart contracts. Bitcoin\u2019s main objective is to establish itself as an alternative (and decentralized) currency.\n\nBoth have been strong investments for the past five years and can be purchased on the new Wealthsimple Crypto platform."

The price of Bitcoin experiences significant growth, often exceeding previous highs and attracting increased interest. Bull runs are typically driven by increased adoption, institutional interest, positive news developments, and market speculation. However, they come with volatility, inherent risks, and are difficult to predict.\n\nIs a bitcoin bull run coming?\n\nPredicting the occurrence of a bitcoin bull run is no easy task due to the complex and volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market. Analysts who have studied past bull runs believe that a variety of factors have contributed to past bull runs, including but not limited to:\n\nInstitutional Adoption: The increasing acceptance and holding of Bitcoin by institutional investors have significantly boosted its price in the past. When large financial institutions back Bitcoin, it has often led to a surge in demand and a potential bull run.\n\nMainstream Acceptance: As more businesses and retailers start accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment, its mainstream acceptance grows, fueling optimism and potentially driving the price up.\n\nMarket Trends: Historical market trends can sometimes provide insights into potential future bull runs. However, past performance does not guarantee future results, and trends should be analyzed with caution.\n\nBitcoin Halving Events: Historically, Bitcoin halving events, where the rewards for miners are reduced, have been associated with bull runs. The reduced supply of new Bitcoins can create a sense of scarcity.\n\nIt is essential to remember that the cryptocurrency market is highly unpredictable and influenced by a wide range of variables, making it impossible to forecast with certainty. You should conduct comprehensive research and exercise prudence when making cryptocurrency-related decisions.\n\nWhy is the crypto bull run every 4 years?\n\nThe occurrence of a crypto bull run every four years is often linked to the Bitcoin halving event, which takes place approximately every four years. The halving reduces mining rewards by 50%, decreasing the supply of new Bitcoins and creating a scarcity effect that may have historically had an effect on price. However, while this pattern has been observed in the past, the crypto market is complex and influenced by various factors, making future bull run predictions uncertain.\n\nImportant Warning\n\nBefore purchasing cryptocurrencies, conduct thorough independent research, exercise caution, consult unbiased experts, and understand the risks involved. Cryptocurrencies may not be suitable for everyone and carry high risks and volatility. The purchase of ApeMax tokens is not permitted for individuals in the United States, Canada, sanctioned countries, and other ineligible countries.

        "title": "Chainlink v/s Ethereum: Who takes the crown? - CryptoNewsZ",
        "content": "Since Chainlink was developed on Ethereum, people often don\u2019t get the difference between the two. Both Chainlink and Ethereum are popular cryptocurrencies based on blockchain technology. Still, they have certain technological differences, strengths and weaknesses, use cases, adoption, community support, market performance, and prospects.\n\nSo can Chainlink surpass Ethereum? Can Chainlink be replaced by the blockchain network it is built on? Let\u2019s find out in the section below.\n\nWhat is Chainlink?\n\nChainlink has been actively operating in the market since its launch in 2017, previously known as SmartContract.com. The name was changed to align with the new goals, and an ICO was launched that secured $32 million. Chainlink heavily differs from Ethereum and other competitors in various ways.\n\nFor instance, Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that off-chain sensors are crucial for operating decentralized applications or dApps. Oracles transfer data to blockchains and often monitor crypto prices for decentralized exchanges (DEXs) or dApps.\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nEthereum is the most popular blockchain in the world after Bitcoin, a network that made a brand name after entering the crypto market in 2015. Ethereum ushered in updating blockchain capabilities through the introduction of smart contracts. The strategy brought about a new digital era where dApps became the primary objective of several networks.\n\nEthereum supports ETH or the Ether crypto. The decentralized infrastructure\u2019s early entry allowed it to become a juggernaut today. The blockchain dominates the crypto market as one of the most popular dApp and DeFi protocols.\n\nChainlink v/s Ethereum\n\n1. Technological Differences\n\nChainlink differs from Ethereum technologically as it aims to connect real-world data with smart contracts. It is made possible by using a network of nodes that offer data to smart contracts and allow them to carry out on-chain actions based on events taking place around the world. Chainlink uses a unique consensus algorithm known as the LINK token that ensures the security and reliability of the blockchain-decentralized Oracle network.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum is a decentralized platform used to build decentralized applications and smart contracts. Ethereum uses Solidity, a Turing programming language that allows software developers to create complex applications to execute smart contracts on Ethereum. The blockchain network has its native crypto, ETH or Ether, used as a mode of payment to execute smart contracts on Ethereum.\n\n2. Strengths and Weaknesses\n\nBoth Chainlink and Ethereum have their own set of strengths, weaknesses, and challenges. When it comes to crypto like Chainlink and Ethereum, security becomes an integral consideration. Chainlink uses various security measures to protect client funds and provide a reliable network. Some standard security measures used by Chainlink include two-factor authentication, secure socket layer or SSL encryption, cold storage, and many more.\n\nEthereum also employs the above security measures. However, it also uses a consensus algorithm, Proof-of-Work or PoW, designed to prevent hacking and fraud attempts on the blockchain network.\n\nApart from security, both Chainlink and Ethereum face another significant challenge: scalability. Chainlink has introduced a variety of scaling solutions that include sharding, state channels, and off-chain computation. These solutions increase the efficiency and capacity of the network and enable more transactions per second.\n\nHowever, Ethereum is facing substantial scalability challenges as high transaction fees and network congestion have become major issues on the Ethereum network. Nevertheless, the Ethereum community is working on various scaling solutions, including Plasma, state channels, and sharding, to improve the network\u2019s efficiency and scalability.\n\n3. Use Cases and Adoption\n\nChainlink is used to create decentralized finance or DeFi applications, including decentralized exchanges, automated market makers, and prediction markets. It provides accurate and reliable real-world data to Chainlink smart contracts. DeFi apps can execute on-chain actions depending on real-world events like price movements in financial markets.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum is being adopted for various use cases that go beyond decentralized finance applications. Ethereum is employed for creating more advanced dApps, including identity verification, voting, supply chain management, gaming, and many more. It also serves as a blockchain platform to launch ICO (Initial Coin Offering) and create some of the most successful ICOs in the crypto market.\n\n4. Market Performance and Trends\n\nChainlink was launched in 2017 with the lowest price of $0.141 in Sept 2017 and the highest price of $50.07 in May 2021.\n\nBased on the historical price movements, Chainlink Prediction for 2024 is estimated at $16.82 and may reach a yearly high of $19.85. Based on our LINK price prediction, the price of Chainlink may reach a maximum of $37.57 by 2027. In addition, the price forecasted for Chainlink is expected to gain 900% in the next six months and reach $73.10 by 2030.\n\nEthereum was launched in 2015 and gained a market cap of 1 million USD by 2016. After the division of Ethereum into Ethereum and Ethereum Classic, the coin reached a value of $376.36, 121.4% more than its initial value.\n\nBased on historical price movements, ETH price prediction for 2024 is estimated at about $3,541 and may reach a yearly high of $5,097. Based on algorithmically generated predictions, the price of Ethereum may reach $6,564 by 2025. In addition, the price forecast for Ethereum is expected to gain significantly and reach $11,142 by 2027.\n\n5. Community Support and Development\n\nWhile comparing cryptocurrencies, community support is an essential consideration. Chainlink has an ever-expanding community of users and developers who have shown great interest in the technology and LINK\u2019s potential to revolutionize the digital industry. Chainlink has received positive feedback for introducing the most innovative approach to linking smart contracts with real-world events.\n\nEthereum has one of the most active and largest communities in the crypto industry, as the platform has existed in the market for many years with a large population of users and developers using and building decentralized applications on the ETH network. Ethereum crypto also has a strong ecosystem of developers with various resources and tools.\n\n6. Future Prospects and Evolution\n\nAs independent cryptocurrencies, both Chainlink and Ethereum have completely different objectives in the cryptocurrency space. While Chainlink uses Oracle networks to transfer secure tamperproof data, Ethereum is a smart contract token. Chainlink is built on the Ethereum blockchain and generally follows ETH\u2019s performance.\n\nAlthough Chainlink heavily relies on Ethereum, the two tokens have operated independently and performed outstandingly even during a bullish market. Ethereum certainly has a higher market capitalization than Chainlink, as it supports more decentralized applications and possesses more utility.\n\nHowever, since Ethereum has achieved tremendous value and Chainlink is built on Ethereum, LINK also has great growth potential.\n\nConclusion: Is Chainlink Better than Ethereum?\n\nChainlink continues to serve an integral niche that can improve the efficiency and performance of all other networks. In comparison, Ethereum has improved its strategy and keeps fighting other potential competitors to be an innovative and efficient force in today\u2019s crypto market.\n\nAs such, Chainlink and Ethereum protocols are working together to enhance the entire crypto market, and both are profitable to trade and invest in for the long term."

        "content": "Crypto analysts are eager to understand what is next for the second most valuable cryptocurrency by market cap, Ethereum (ETH). Finbold reported two \u2018bullish\u2019 signs for Ethereum on August 14, but some experts believe that ETH could face one more dump before being able to show positive results. Something similar is also expected to happen with Bitcoin (BTC).\n\n\u201cIf Ethereum falls below the $1,800 mark, the next significant support level is positioned at approximately $1,600. At this level, 2.48 million addresses acquired a total of 3.8 million ETH.\u201d \u2013 Ali (@ali_charts, on X)\n\nThis is what the Twitter (X) account known as Ali (@ali_charts) said on August 16. Pointing to a relevant price zone for Ethereum at $1,600, that should have high buyer demand in case ETH loses its current ranges.\n\nIf #Ethereum falls below the $1,800 mark, the next significant support level is positioned at approximately $1,600.

When the price of Ethereum drops, open interest spikes, followed by a bounce, which is followed by a decrease in open interest.\u201d \u2013 crypto sunmoon\n\nMeanwhile, it\u2019s possible to see, in the shared chart, a recent small drop in ETH\u2019s price, followed by a small spike in Ethereum\u2019s Open Interest positions \u2014 but these are far smaller than previous movements, which could suggest that the OI spike is not done yet. Neither price drops.\n\nEthereum: Open Interest \u2013 All Exchanges, All Symbol. Source: CryptoQuant\n\nETH price analysis\n\nAt this moment, ETH is trading above the $1,800 range ($1,815, by press time), with 1.31% losses for the day, and above 5% losses in the last 30 days.\n\nAll things considered, the digital asset\u2019s ability to meet the above analysts\u2019 expectations will depend on further developments related to Ethereum, as well as the general sentiment on the wider crypto and macroeconomic landscape.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "Ledger has partnered with PayPal to create a secure platform for exploring digital currencies.\n\nThe partnership follows PayPal\u2019s introduction of the stablecoin PYUSD on Ethereum.\n\nLedger has unveiled its partnership with the worldwide payment leader PayPal. This joint effort aims to deliver users a smooth and safeguarded environment for delving into digital currencies.\n\nThe partnership permits individuals in the United States to adhere to state regulations and directly buy cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and Litecoin (LTC) using their connected PayPal accounts through the Ledger Live companion application.\n\nOur mission has always been to build ease-of-use and security for critical digital assets. That's why we're integrating @PayPal into Ledger Live. You can now buy crypto with PayPal and get it into your custody. Learn more here: https://t.co/XtSTRRg1Xa pic.twitter.com/MAPhD1f3tT \u2014 Ledger (@Ledger) August 16, 2023\n\nIt\u2019s worth highlighting that those who have previously procured crypto using PayPal can now make purchases via Ledger Live without requiring extra verification. The user\u2019s Ledger hardware wallet will automatically receive the acquired digital tokens.\n\nTo use this functionality, individuals can easily launch the Ledger Live application, go to the \u2018Purchase\u2019 segment, pick the cryptocurrency they want, indicate their country, and opt for PayPal as their chosen payment mode. The digital tokens will be safely dispatched to the user\u2019s Ledger device after a successful transaction through the PayPal interface.\n\nNevertheless, individuals who haven\u2019t employed PayPal for cryptocurrency dealings must either establish a PayPal account or go through the obligatory Know Your Customer (KYC) verification process.\n\nPascal Gauthier, the CEO and Chairman of Ledger, conveyed his excitement regarding the collaboration, saying,\n\n\u201cBoth PayPal and Ledger are committed to ensuring secure, fast, and seamless transactions. By integrating Ledger\u2019s unmatched security with PayPal\u2019s two-decade expertise in digital payments, we aim to provide a robust platform for cryptocurrency transactions.\u201d\n\nRegulating Stablecoins\n\nThis partnership arrives shortly after PayPal\u2019s recent declaration of its stablecoin linked to the U.S. dollar, known as PayPal USD (PYUSD), introduced on the Ethereum blockchain. PayPal\u2019s fresh stablecoin, subject to regulatory oversight from the New York State Department of Financial Services and managed by Paxos Trust Company, seeks to connect traditional currency and digital currencies, potentially bringing substantial alterations to the digital payment arena.\n\nNevertheless, the incorporation has encountered its fair share of critics. U.S. Representative Maxine Waters raised apprehensions regarding the absence of a comprehensive national structure for overseeing stablecoins like PayPal\u2019s PYUSD, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar. She emphasized the necessity for strong supervision to protect users and maintain financial stability. Waters\u2019 concerns are rooted in PayPal\u2019s extensive worldwide clientele, surpassing numerous prominent banks\u2019 customer base.\n\nAlthough there might be regulatory obstacles to overcome, Ledger, boasting more than 1.5 million active users, is steadfast in its dedication to furnishing secure and user-intuitive avenues for conducting digital currency exchanges. Through the Ledger Live application, users can engage with an expanding array of Decentralized Applications (DApps) while concurrently safeguarding the confidentiality of their private keys on their Ledger device.\n\nSince 2016, Ledger asserts to have distributed more than 6 million Ledger Nano hardware wallets, securing its position as a leading producer. In May, the company encountered controversy when it initiated a concealed recovery phrase storage service, causing bewilderment among users. The team subsequently endeavored to alleviate criticism by explaining how their wallet operates.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

        "content": "The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may approve the foremost Ethereum futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This news comes amid the rising interests of several financial giants that have filed applications with the US SEC to deploy ETF products based on cryptocurrencies, such as BTC and ETH.\n\nBig Victory For Crypto: SEC To Greenlight Ethereum ETFs\n\nA Bloomberg report disclosed that the SEC is showing a possible green light to approve an ETH futures ETF for institutional investors in the country. This approval could create a way for other companies, such as Bitwise, ProShares, Volatility Shares, and Roundhill, that have submitted applications to provide ETH futures ETFs.\n\nThe SEC has hesitated to approve cryptocurrency ETFs until late 2021. The commission allowed trading in funds related to Bitcoin futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.\n\nSince then, there has been increasing speculation concerning the potential of an Ethereum futures product being deployed into the broader financial market. But the US financial watchdog has been slow to permit a derivatives product in the second-biggest crypto asset.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s reason for delaying anchors on concerns about manipulating digital asset prices and insufficient liquidity.\n\nThe Cryptocurrency ETF Landscape\n\nMany asset management companies in the US and beyond have continued pushing to launch crypto exchange-traded funds. Grayscale Investments LLC, a leading asset management firm, still awaits the US SEC\u2019s decision to approve its application. The firm filed to convert its asset from a Bitcoin trust to a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nIt is worth noting that Grayscale reportedly announced its decision to hire more workers for its ETF team. In related news, another prominent asset management company, Valkyrie Investments, filed for an ETF based on Ethereum futures on Wednesday, August 16.\n\nNotably, the fund will invest nearly all its assets in Ethereum exchange-traded futures, allocating a small portion to collateral investments like cash, cash-related instruments, or high-end securities.\n\nIn another development, Galaxy Digital CEO, Mike Novogratz, referenced reliable sources at Invesco and BlackRock, stating his optimism for regulators to approve a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund. He said that the question of approving a spot Bitcoin ETF is a \u201cmatter of time, not whether the agency will approve.\u201d\n\nThe CEO added that institutional players are optimistic that the US financial agency will approve spot Bitcoin ETFs in less than six months. While the United States SEC delays its approval, other countries have long supported crypto ETFs.\n\nFor instance, the holding company linked to QR Asset Management QR Capital in Brazil announced an ETH ETF approval in 2021. Brazil\u2019s securities regulatory agency, Comiss\u00e3o de Valores Mobili\u00e1rios (CVM), approved its Ethereum $ETH ETF fund application.\n\nFeatured image from Pixabay and chart from TradingView.com"

        "content": "Messari\u2019s Q2 2023 report on the state of Bitcoin, Ethereum and the crypto market was published yesterday.\n\n1/ We're proud to present our inaugural State of the Market report for Q2 2023! \ud83d\udcf0\ud83d\udce2\n\n\n\nA collection of market data and key performance indicators from 30+ projects covered through our Protocol Services\u2019 engagements, with Bitcoin & Ethereum as benchmarks.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udd17https://t.co/BlwiuIzXma pic.twitter.com/y9AFWy6yEa \u2014 Messari (@MessariCrypto) August 15, 2023\n\nThe PDF is a whopping 68 pages long, and was compiled by Senior Research Analyst Mihai Grigore, along with Stephen Basile, Editorial Coordinator, and Peter Horton, Research Analyst.\n\nThe report aggregates market data and key performance indicators from over 30 crypto projects followed by Messari, and also includes Bitcoin and Ethereum as a comparison.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum in Messari\u2019s crypto report\n\nWith regard to Bitcoin in particular, an analysis was made of Stacks, a layer-2 based on Bitcoin that enables the creation of smart contracts.\n\nStacks\u2019 market capitalization has increased by 53.3% since the beginning of the year, mainly due to the success of Ordinals and other Bitcoin assets.\n\nIts TVL hit an annual high at $36.0 million, although the Nakamoto version is still under development.\n\nsBTC is also still under development, hoping to provide access to a huge amount of liquidity in BTC through a bridge.\n\nDuring the quarter, due to a bug, Stacking was disabled for two cycles.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nAs far as Ethereum is concerned, the report highlights the growth of ETH\u2019s dominance from 17.4% at the beginning of the year to 18% at the end of June.\n\nIn addition, it points out that there was also an increase in usage and burns during the quarter, resulting in higher deflation.\n\nLayer-2 solutions also continued to grow, but growth was limited by rising gas costs.\n\nMarket performance\n\nCompared to twelve months ago, among the cryptocurrencies analysed in this report, Ethereum stands out, with an unparalleled +80%.\n\nIn second place, in terms of price performance compared to June 2022, is Stacks (+69%) followed by Bitcoin (+53%).\n\nIt is worth noting that the majority of the others show losses between June 2022 and June 2023, with Pocket Network recording a whooping -72%.\n\nLosses of over 60% were also reported for Boba Network and The Sandbox, and over 50% for Near, Apecoin, and 1inch,\n\nAmong the main altcoins, the negative performances of Cardano (-37%), and Solana (-44%) stand out, followed by -26% for Polkadot. Avalanche, Filecoin and Hedera also did poorly.\n\nBNB saved itself with +9%, while Tron did better with +17%.\n\nXRP (+42%) and Polygon (+37%) did well.\n\nA completely different story applies to the performance of the second quarter alone, i.e. the comparison between prices on 30 June 2023 and those on 31 March of the same year.\n\nThe strongest of the crypto assets analyzed was Tron, with +16%, followed by Bitcoin (+7%) and Ethereum (+6%).\n\nPractically all the others suffered, with losses of over 40% for Polygon, Apecoin, 1inch and Boba Network.\n\nSolana stopped at -11%, with XRP at -12%. BNB, on the other hand, lost 24% of its market value in the quarter.\n\nIn other words, it was not a good quarter for the crypto markets. However, it should not be forgotten that July was a much more positive month, thanks in particular to XRP\u2019s victory over the SEC.\n\nTrading volumes on Bitcoin, Ethereum and crypto according to Messari\u2019s report\n\nBy contrast, trading volumes were all down compared to both June 2022 and March 2023.\n\nThe only exceptions were Stacks (+312% compared to June 2022) and Venus (+390% compared to March 2023).\n\nThis should come as no surprise, both because during 2022 the hype of 2021 completely wore off, causing 2023 to begin with almost no hype, and because even during the first six months of 2023 the hype actually continued to wane.\n\nCuriously, Bitcoin\u2019s trading volumes fell more compared to March 2023 (-53%) than to June 2022 (-48%), while for Ethereum it was the opposite: only -24% compared to March, but -57% compared to last year.\n\nAmong the major altcoins, all of them have recorded a larger drop in volume since June 2022 than since March 2023, so Bitcoin in this respect is a real exception.\n\nOn the other hand, the first quarter of 2023 saw a real dominance of Bitcoin on the crypto markets, whereas in June 2022 all cryptocurrencies suffered from the collapse of Celsius.\n\nHowever, this only reiterates that Bitcoin is different from all other cryptocurrencies, and that in the long run it tends to lose less when prices fall."

        "content": "Ethereum Classic price prediction indicates a decline in the value of ETC, as observed in a falling wedge pattern on the daily chart. At the moment, ETC crypto is making efforts to bounce back from the lower trendline within this descending wedge pattern. However, for ETC crypto to make a significant upward movement towards the upper trendline, it must attract more buyers. In the meantime, investors should exercise patience and wait for the accumulation rate to rise before engaging in trading at an opportune moment.\n\nEthereum Classic price was at $16.32 and has gained 0.49% of its market capitalization during the day\u2019s trading session. However, trading volume has decreased around 11.98% during the intraday trading session. This demonstrates that sellers are still present in the trade and may try for a pullback. Volume to market cap ratio was 4.69%.\n\nEthereum Classic Price Prediction: ETC Returning From Oversold Zone \u2013 RSI\n\nSource: ETC/USD by TradingView\n\nThe forecast for Ethereum Classic price highlights the challenge faced by ETC cryptocurrency in maintaining its position along the lower trendline of the falling wedge pattern. Currently, there\u2019s a noticeable decrease in trading volume, which should ideally see an uptick during the intraday trading session. ETC crypto needs a volume spike in order to sustain and recover towards the upper boundary of the pattern.\n\nIn addition, the Ethereum Classic cryptocurrency has experienced a decline of 8.52% over the course of a week and a 14.50% decrease within a month. ETC has slipped by approximately 10.91% over the past three months and 27.16% in the preceding six months. However, Ethereum Classic has managed to achieve a modest gain of 3.95% year-to-date. This indicates that Ethereum Classic crypto possesses the capacity to recover from its lower position in the year 2023.\n\nTechnical indicators suggest the sustainability issues of ETC cryptocurrency. Relative strength index (RSI) shows the return of ETC crypto price from the oversold territory. Whereas, moving average convergence divergence (MACD) still indicates the decline of ETC.\n\nRSI was at 26 and is trying to return from the oversold territory. The MACD line is below the signal line waiting for a crossover. Investors in Ethereum Classic crypto need to wait for a clear directional change over the daily time frame chart.\n\nSummary\n\nEthereum Classic price prediction indicates a decline in the value of ETC as observed in a falling wedge pattern on the daily chart. Trading volume is noticeably low and could see an uptick intraday. Ethereum Classic has managed to achieve a modest gain of 3.95% year-to-date.
