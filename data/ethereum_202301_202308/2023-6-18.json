        "content": "Ethereum core developers plan to implement a 64-fold increase in the maximum amount of staked Ether (ETH) required to become a validator, from 32 ETH to 2048 ETH while the minimum staking amount remain at 32 ETH.\n\nThe proposal was made during a June 15 Ethereum core developer consensus meeting by Ethereum Foundation researcher Michael Neuder. The researcher noted that although the current limit of 32 ETH allows more validators to join the Ethereum network, making it more decentralized, it also leads to an inflation of the validator set size.\n\nNeuder added that such a large increase would ultimately help the Ethereum network become more efficient over time. Besides the proposal to increase the minimum required staked ETH for validators, Neuder also called for auto-compounding validator rewards.\n\nEthereum consensus layer meeting. Source: YouTube\n\nThe auto-compounding of rewards would allow validators to make more money on their staked ETH. Currently, to produce any staking income, rewards received in excess of the 32 ETH cap must be transferred to another account. These benefits could be rapidly compounded if the cap were raised, giving validators a practical way to increase their earn reward.\n\nNeuder claimed the current proposal would not only make the Ethereum network more efficient and make way for validators to earn more money, but it would also help large node operators, such as exchanges, which currently manage thousands of validators.\n\nRelated: Hong Kong legislator invites Coinbase to the region despite SEC scrutiny\n\nThe 32 ETH limit has led to a significant surge in validator addresses after Ethereum\u2019s transition to a proof-of-stake network. At present, there are over 700,000 validators, with around 90,000 awaiting activation in the queue.\n\nTotal Ethereum validators.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThere is a new protocol that allows users to create and share digital objects on Ethereum. They are called Ethscriptions\u2014an apparent tip of the hat to Inscriptions, a similar project by Ordinals deployed on the Bitcoin network.\n\nDeveloped by Tom Lehman, co-founder and former CEO of Genius.com, the project launched on Saturday and saw explosive interest. Nearly 30,000 Ethscriptions were created in less than 18 hours, according to Lehman, who tweeted that the launch was a \u201chuge success.\u201d\n\nEthscriptions enable non-financial and arbitrary data to be written into the main Ethereum blockchain. Users can inscribe any type of file provided it is under 96 kilobytes in size. According to its creator, however, it currently only allows for images\u2014but that will change in the future.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThese inscriptions leverage what\u2019s known as Ethereum \u201ccalldata,\u201d which refers to the data provided within a call made to a smart contract. According to Lehman, the protocol is cheaper and more decentralized than using contract storage.\n\nThe [protocol] \u201cguarantees global uniqueness of the content of all valid Ethscriptions,\u201d the creator tweeted, saying that \u201cit's skating to where the puck is going in an L2 world.\u201d\n\nLehman, perhaps in a bid for notoriety, called for famed NFT collection Crypto Punks to be \u201cethscribed.\u201d It successfully sparked a frenzy, and copies of the 10,000 images were inscribed in a matter of hours.\n\nThe launch echoes the Ordinals launch on Bitcoin, NFT-style images and other non-financial data included in the main chain\u2019s ledger. The arrival of Ordinals, however, triggered dismay from many in the maximalist community.\n\nThe difference in reception is the Ethereum community\u2019s apparent openness to innovation and experimentation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe exciting thing for me about Ethscriptions, similar to Ordinals, is that developers are playing around again with blockchain technology,\u201d self-proclaimed NFT archaeologist Adam McBride told Decrypt. \u201cIt\u2019s this experimentation that drives innovation and adoption,\u201d\n\nMuch like the Ordinal craze, this weekend has seen significant interest from new protocol users. This led Ethscriptions to suffer several periods of downtime, with Lehman tweeting, \u201cSorry everything is crashing! Too many people.\u201d\n\nAlthough this weekend brought an impressive debut for the protocol, some say it already existed. McBride says this technology has been around for years, with certain artists already using it in their work.\n\nStill, he told Decrypt \u201cthis is the first time it\u2019s gained widespread awareness.\u201d\n\nWhether Ethscriptions are a fly-by-night fad or an exciting new trend will ultimately be determined by the community."

        "title": "Ethereum Eyes Dramatic Shift: Proposes Validator Limit Increase From 32 To 2048 ETH - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum, the second-largest blockchain by market capitalization, could be on the cusp of a significant operational shift. In the latest Ethereum core developer consensus meeting, a key agenda item under discussion was a proposed increase in the maximum validator limit.\n\nIf implemented, this adjustment would see the limit skyrocket from the current 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH per validator. Currently, validators in Ethereum\u2019s network maintain a balance cap set at both the minimum and maximum of 32 ETH.\n\nThose managing large-scale staking operations, consequently, must establish multiple validators to earn yield beyond this limit. As such, the result is a significant growth in the number of validators, with the current count reaching 600,000 active validators and an additional 90,000 on standby.\n\nStreamlining For Optimization\n\nMichael Neuder, an Ethereum Foundation researcher and a primary advocate of this change, argues that the proposed increase would alleviate the pressures caused by the expanding validator set size.\n\nRelated Reading: Ethereum Cancun Upgrade: Why Arbitrum, Optimism Will Profit Massively\n\nNeuder highlighted that the current validator cap does support decentralization, but it simultaneously leads to an inflation of the validator set size. This increasing size eventually enhances the system\u2019s performance by expediting the conclusion within a solitary Ethereum slot.\n\nIn addition, Neuder pointed out the prospect of auto-compounding validator rewards brought on by this change. Given the current restrictions, any rewards earned beyond the 32 ETH cap must be averted to other places to generate any staking yield.\n\nWith a raised cap, these rewards could be compounded instantaneously, enabling validators to reap greater benefits from their staked ETH.\n\nImpact On Large-Scale Operators And Associated Risks\n\nThe proposal also aims to address the procedural challenges encountered by major node managers, such as exchanges like Coinbase, that presently supervise multitudes of validators due to the standing 32 ETH constraint per validator.\n\nIf the cap were to be elevated, such operators could manage fewer validators with higher stakes, which could potentially simplify operations. However, Neuder cautioned about the risks tied to this proposed change.\n\nFor instance, the increase could potentially lead to steeper penalties for inadvertent double attestations or proposals, also known as \u201cslashing.\u201d This highlights the importance of considering all possible implications in the path toward improving network efficiency and validator rewards.\n\nNotably, as Ethereum continues to evolve, this potential change in the validator limit serves as a critical discussion point in the broader conversation about the platform\u2019s future.\n\nRelated Reading: Ethereum Price Prints Bullish Technical Pattern, Why Close Above $1,780 Is Critical\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum is down 1% in the past week amid the industry\u2019s current condition. The second-largest crypto asset by market capitalization has recorded a downward movement, also falling by 1.1% in the past 24 hours.\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH trades above $1,700 after moving below that price range to trade at the $1,600 region last week. ETH\u2019s trading volume has plummeted over the past 7 days from above $7 billion last Monday to below $4 billion in the past 24 hours, indicating a decline in trading activity.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "In a recent development, Ethereum\u2019s core developers have been deliberating on a proposal that suggests a significant increase in the maximum validator balance. The current limit of 32 ether (ETH) per validator could potentially be raised to 2,048 ETH.\n\nThis proposed change aims to enhance the efficiency of the Ethereum network while maintaining decentralization. Let\u2019s delve into the details of this proposal and its potential implications.\n\nPresently, Ethereum validators face an effective balance cap, which restricts them to a minimum and maximum stake of 32 ETH. This limitation forces large-scale staking operations to create multiple validators in order to earn yield on amounts exceeding this threshold. Consequently, there has been a surge in the number of validators, with approximately 600,000 active validators and an additional 90,000 waiting to be activated in the queue.\n\nDuring a recent Ethereum core developer consensus meeting, Michael Neuder, an Ethereum Foundation researcher and a prominent advocate of the proposed change, put forth a compelling argument in favor of raising the validator cap. Neuder highlighted that while the current cap promotes decentralization, it inadvertently leads to an inflationary growth of the validator set size.\n\nOne of the key benefits of raising the validator cap is the potential to improve the network\u2019s efficiency in achieving finality within a single Ethereum slot. By slowing down the expansion of the active validator set, this change would enable more effective utilization of resources and enhance the overall performance of the network.\n\nAnother significant advantage that the proposed increased cap brings is the possibility of auto-compounding validator rewards. Currently, any rewards earned beyond the 32 ETH cap must be directed elsewhere to generate staking yield. However, if the cap is lifted, validators would have the opportunity to immediately compound these rewards, thereby maximizing their earnings from staked ETH.\n\nThe proposal also addresses operational concerns faced by larger node operators, including exchanges like Coinbase and defi protocols such as Lido. These operators currently maintain tens of thousands of validators due to the existing 32 ETH cap per validator. By raising the maximum effective validator balance, they would be able to manage fewer but higher-stake validators, reducing complexity and streamlining their operations.\n\nWhile the proposed change offers several advantages, it is crucial to consider the associated risks. With a higher validator balance, there is a potential increase in penalties for accidental double attestations or proposals, commonly known as \u201cslashing.\u201d It is essential to carefully evaluate and mitigate these risks to ensure the smooth functioning of the Ethereum network.\n\nAlso Read: Ethscriptions a new NFT Protocol live on ETH Blockchain\n\nThe proposal is currently under debate among the core developers, who have agreed to continue discussing its implementation details on social platforms such as ETHMagicians and Discord. This open dialogue allows for a comprehensive evaluation of the proposal\u2019s impact and the incorporation of valuable insights from the Ethereum community."

It is one of the most prominent cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies, known for its smart contract functionality and its native cryptocurrency called Ether (ETH). Ethereum allows developers to build and deploy decentralized applications (DApps) on its platform, offering a wide range of possibilities beyond simple financial transactions.\n\nAt its core, Ethereum is a distributed network of computers that collectively maintains a blockchain, which is a public ledger containing a record of all transactions and smart contracts executed on the network. Unlike Bitcoin, which primarily focuses on peer-to-peer electronic cash transactions, Ethereum aims to be a decentralized platform for executing code of any complexity.\n\nOne of the key features of Ethereum is its support for smart contracts. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into lines of code. They automatically execute when predetermined conditions are met, without the need for intermediaries. This feature allows for the creation of decentralized applications, enabling developers to build and deploy applications that can interact with each other, access and modify data, and execute transactions autonomously.\n\nThe native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, Ether (ETH), serves multiple purposes. Firstly, it is used to incentivize participants on the network to perform computations and secure the blockchain through a process called mining (although Ethereum is transitioning to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism). Secondly, Ether is used as a medium of exchange within the Ethereum ecosystem, facilitating transactions and powering the execution of smart contracts.\n\nThe Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a runtime environment that executes smart contracts on the Ethereum network. It is a Turing-complete virtual machine, meaning it can execute any algorithm or computation that a conventional computer can perform. The EVM runs on the nodes of the Ethereum network, and every node stores a copy of the blockchain and processes transactions and smart contract code.\n\nEthereum has gained widespread popularity due to its ability to enable decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, which offer traditional financial services, such as lending, borrowing, and trading, without intermediaries like banks or brokers. This has led to the creation of numerous DeFi platforms, decentralized exchanges (DEXs), stablecoins, and other financial instruments built on top of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe Ethereum ecosystem is continuously evolving and expanding. It has a vibrant community of developers, entrepreneurs, and enthusiasts who contribute to its growth. Ethereum has also introduced several upgrades and improvements over time, with the most notable upgrade being Ethereum 2.0, which aims to enhance scalability, security, and sustainability by transitioning from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.\n\nIn summary, Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain platform that enables the creation of decentralized applications and the execution of smart contracts. It provides a platform for developers to build innovative applications and has played a significant role in the development of decentralized finance and the broader blockchain ecosystem.\n\nWhy should you learn Ethereum?\n\nLearning Ethereum offers several compelling reasons for individuals interested in blockchain technology and decentralized applications. Here are some key reasons why you should consider learning Ethereum:\n\n1. Revolutionary Technology: Ethereum represents a paradigm shift in how applications are developed and deployed.

We also discuss the importance of Ethereum in the DeFi world and share some interesting stats. Let\u2019s get started! \u2014 Hein Alberts (@HeinAlberts) June 9, 2023\n\nImportance of Ethereum for the economy\n\nEthereum plays a significant role in the economy by introducing new possibilities and reshaping existing systems. Here are some key reasons highlighting the importance of Ethereum for the economy:\n\n1. Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Ethereum has become the backbone of the decentralized finance (DeFi) movement. DeFi applications built on Ethereum offer a wide range of financial services, including lending, borrowing, yield farming, decentralized exchanges, and stablecoins. These platforms provide access to financial services without the need for intermediaries like banks, significantly reducing costs, increasing transparency, and expanding financial inclusion. DeFi has unlocked new economic opportunities, allowing individuals around the world to participate in global financial systems.\n\n2. Innovation and Entrepreneurship: Ethereum\u2019s programmable smart contracts enable entrepreneurs and developers to build decentralized applications (DApps) and launch their own projects. This has fostered innovation and entrepreneurship, creating a vibrant ecosystem of startups and projects. Ethereum provides a decentralized and permissionless platform for individuals to bring their ideas to life, disrupt traditional industries, and introduce new business models. This innovation drives economic growth and creates employment opportunities.\n\n3. Tokenization and Asset Ownership: Ethereum\u2019s blockchain enables the tokenization of assets, such as real estate, art, intellectual property, and even traditional financial instruments. By representing these assets as tokens on the Ethereum network, ownership, transfer, and fractionalization become more efficient and accessible. This has the potential to unlock liquidity in previously illiquid markets, enable fractional ownership, and facilitate new forms of investment and trading.\n\n4. Micropayments and Token Economy: Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), serves as the fuel for executing transactions and interacting with decentralized applications on the network. Additionally, Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 token standard allows for the creation of custom tokens. These features enable micropayments and the development of token economies, where tokens represent value within specific ecosystems. Token economies provide incentives, rewards, and monetization opportunities, fostering economic interactions and creating novel business models.\n\n5. Supply Chain Management and Traceability: Ethereum\u2019s blockchain can be utilized for transparent and verifiable supply chain management. By recording transactions and product information on the blockchain, businesses can improve transparency, enhance trust, and combat counterfeiting. This is particularly crucial for industries such as pharmaceuticals, luxury goods, and food, where traceability and provenance are essential for consumer confidence. Ethereum-based supply chain solutions can streamline operations, reduce costs, and enable more efficient and ethical commerce.\n\n6. Decentralized Governance and DAOs: Ethereum facilitates decentralized governance models and the creation of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). DAOs are organizations that operate based on smart contracts, enabling decentralized decision-making and transparent governance. DAOs can facilitate collective decision-making, voting, fund management, and resource allocation. By removing central authorities and intermediaries, Ethereum empowers communities and stakeholders to participate directly in the governance and decision-making processes, leading to more inclusive and democratic economic systems.\n\n7. Interoperability and Collaboration: Ethereum\u2019s open-source nature and compatibility with other blockchain platforms promote interoperability and collaboration. Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 and ERC-721 token standards have become widely adopted, allowing tokens to move seamlessly between different Ethereum-based projects and platforms. This interoperability encourages collaboration and the development of interconnected ecosystems, where projects can leverage each other\u2019s strengths, share resources, and benefit from network effects. This collaborative environment stimulates innovation, economic growth, and cross-industry synergy.\n\nIn summary, Ethereum\u2019s impact on the economy is substantial. Through DeFi, tokenization, smart contracts, and decentralized governance, Ethereum is transforming traditional systems and introducing new economic paradigms. It empowers individuals, encourages innovation, facilitates more efficient and transparent transactions, and creates economic opportunities for both established businesses and emerging entrepreneurs. As Ethereum continues to evolve and gain wider adoption, its importance for the economy is expected to grow.\n\nAlso raed: Democratizing The Internet: How Ethereum Enables The Decentralized Web\n\nFuture of Ethereum\n\nThe future of Ethereum is a topic of great interest and speculation due to its prominent role in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space. While the future is uncertain, several developments and upgrades are expected to shape Ethereum\u2019s trajectory. Here are some key aspects to consider regarding the future of Ethereum:\n\n1. Ethereum 2.0: One of the most significant milestones for Ethereum is the ongoing transition to Ethereum 2.0, also known as Eth2 or Serenity. Ethereum 2.0 aims to address scalability, security, and sustainability concerns by implementing a new consensus mechanism called proof-of-stake (PoS). This transition involves the introduction of shard chains, which will increase the network\u2019s capacity to process transactions and execute smart contracts in parallel. Ethereum 2.0 will also introduce improvements in energy efficiency and reduce the resource requirements for participation in the network.\n\n2. Enhanced Scalability: Ethereum\u2019s current infrastructure faces scalability challenges, particularly during periods of high demand. Ethereum 2.0 aims to significantly enhance scalability by introducing shard chains and implementing other optimizations. These improvements will allow the network to handle a much larger number of transactions per second, enabling smoother and faster operation of decentralized applications and reducing transaction fees.\n\n3. Layer 2 Solutions: To address immediate scalability concerns while Ethereum 2.0 is being developed, various layer 2 solutions are being implemented. Layer 2 solutions, such as state channels, sidechains, and rollups, aim to offload a significant portion of transactions from the Ethereum mainnet while still maintaining the security and integrity of the network. These solutions will improve transaction throughput and reduce costs, making Ethereum more scalable and efficient.\n\n4. DeFi and Decentralized Applications (DApps): Ethereum has established itself as the leading platform for DeFi applications and DApps. The future of Ethereum is closely tied to the growth and development of these applications. As more projects and users adopt Ethereum for decentralized finance, gaming, NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), and other use cases, the demand and utilization of the Ethereum network are expected to increase. This growth will contribute to the overall expansion of the Ethereum ecosystem and reinforce its position as a fundamental infrastructure for decentralized applications.\n\n5. Interoperability and Cross-Chain Integration: Interoperability between different blockchain networks is a significant focus area for the future of Ethereum. Projects such as Polkadot, Cosmos, and others are working on creating interoperability protocols that allow communication and data transfer between various blockchains. Ethereum is expected to integrate with these interoperability solutions, enabling the seamless movement of assets and data across different blockchain networks. This interoperability will enhance the overall functionality and utility of Ethereum, fostering collaboration between diverse blockchain ecosystems.\n\n6.

        "content": "Following a period of correction, Ethereum\u2019s price found support at a significant region comprising the 200-day moving average and the lower trendline of the flag pattern, located at $1.6K. As a result, the price initiated a slight bullish rally.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nAfter an extended bearish phase, the price reached a notable support region encompassing the 200-day moving average and the lower boundary of the flag pattern. This zone serves as robust support, as it also aligns with the static support level of $1.6K, indicating substantial buying pressure.\n\nConsequently, this buying pressure led to the formation of a bullish rally. However, the positive momentum weakened upon reaching the previous minor swing on the daily chart, resulting in decreased volatility and the development of very small candles.\n\nNonetheless, if the bullish rally continues, Ethereum\u2019s next target will be the 100-day moving average and the upper trendline of the flag pattern, positioned at $1834.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nOn to the 4-hour chart, after breaking below the lower trendline of the extended ascending channel, the selling pressure remained high, causing the price to continue plummeting.\n\nNevertheless, after a few days of red candles, ETH reached the crucial Fibonacci level of 61.8%, representing the initial target for the correction legs during the bullish rally that originated from $1368 and persisted until encountering significant resistance at $2.1K.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that the recent rebound could be a retracement toward the broken level. Ultimately, Ethereum\u2019s next move will be determined by future price action.\n\nOn-chain Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe following chart illustrates the relationship between Ethereum\u2019s Exchange Netflow metric and its price. After encountering resistance at the $2.1K level, Ethereum\u2019s price entered a prolonged consolidation correction phase, leading to a 24% correction. As depicted in the chart, the Netflow metric exhibited a downtrend during this market condition, ultimately plummeting below 0.\n\nHowever, the recent lawsuit involving Binance, Coinbase, and the SEC acted as a catalyst for the bearish trend in the market, prompting participants to withdraw their assets from these exchanges. Consequently, the Netflow metric experienced a further impulsive decline, indicating the prevailing fear within the market.\n\nNevertheless, it is important to note that a robust and sustainable bullish rally should not be anticipated until the fear and uncertainty vanish from the market and sufficient demand returns."

        "title": "Ethereum core devs consider raising limit on maximum effective validator balance - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s core developers are currently considering a proposal that would significantly raise the maximum effective validator balance cap from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH, while retaining the minimum staking amount at 32 ETH.\n\nThis proposal, if adopted, would have far-reaching implications on the Ethereum network\u2019s operations, particularly in the context of network decentralization and validator set size.\n\nMichael Neuder, a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation and a leading advocate for this change, has argued that the existing validator cap, while ostensibly promoting decentralization, has the unintended consequence of incentivizing operations to set up more and more validators.\n\nNeuder originally posted the proposal, in addition to sharing his perspective during the latest Ethereum core developer consensus meeting held last Friday.\n\nThis would be a pivotal change that could redefine the operational dynamics of Ethereum\u2019s network by adjusting the balance between decentralization and efficiency\u2014the balance that is always at stake in an intentionally decentralized blockchain ecosystem.\n\nMaxEB\n\nMAX_EFFECTIVE_BALANCE (abbreviated as MaxEB) is a rule that limits the effective balance of Ethereum validators to 32 ETH. The effective balance is a value derived from the validator\u2019s balance and prior effective balance. This means if a validator stakes more than 32 ETH, any amount over that would not earn them extra yield.\n\nThis incentivizes validators to set up additional \u201cvalidator spots\u201d for each extra 32 ETH they want to stake\u2014in other words, single entities are incentivized to set up multiple validators, making the true measure of decentralization in the network difficult to assess.\n\nProponents argue that increasing MaxEB would unblock future upgrades on the consensus layer, enhance the performance of the current consensus mechanism and the peer-to-peer (p2p) layer, which is the network of nodes that Ethereum runs on, and improve operational efficiency for validators, regardless of their size.\n\nWhile arguments in favor of the proposal center around streamlining network growth and validator management, Neuder acknowledges that critics could argue that the upgrade may introduce unnecessary complexity to the ecosystem or open Ethereum to new potential security risks. Nevertheless, the proposal also responded to such potential criticisms by expressing confidence that such eventualities were manageable.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "Ethereum Layer 2 Network zkSync Era's Locked Value Surpasses $500M - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Matter Labs' zkSync Era, a zero-knowledge (ZK) rollup aimed at scaling Ethereum, continues to attract capital at a brisk pace.\n\nThe total value locked (TVL) on zkSync Era rose above $500 million early Monday, marking a 12% increase in one week, according to data source L2Beat. The TVL is a metric widely used to track the total value of digital assets locked or staked on a decentralized finance platform.\n\nThe scaling solution, which retains Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility while ensuring native account abstraction, is already the third-largest rollup by total value locked next to Arbitrum and Optimism.\n\nRead more: Where Is the Ethereum Virtual Machine Headed in 2023? (Hint: Beyond Ethereum)\n\nAt press time, more than 220,000 ether (ETH), or around $378.3 million, about 121 million USDC (a dollar-pegged stablecoin) and 14.43 million MUTE, worth $7.53 million, were locked on zkSync. MUTE is the native cryptocurrency of a zkRollup-based decentralized exchange, Mute.\n\nThe daily active addresses have steadily increased since May, averaging 175,000 in the past four weeks. zkSync was launched in March 2023.\n\nRecently, liquid staking solution Rocketpool went live on zkSync Era, joining the list of decentralized applications moving to layer 2 platforms. The increased user demand for rollups is likely driven by Ethereum core developers' focus on implementing the ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844, according to Galaxy Digital.\n\nThe EIP 4844 will introduce a new transaction type to Ethereum, which accepts \"blobs\" of data and reduce transaction fees on rollups.\n\n\"The prioritization of EIP 4844 as the next major code change in Ethereum\u2019s forthcoming Cancun/Deneb upgrade slated to activate sometime this Fall or Winter next year affirms the importance of rollups for the long-term scalability of Ethereum and the need for dapps built on Ethereum to eventually migrate the majority of their operations to a more cost-effective rollup,\" Alex Thorn, head of research at Galaxy Digital, said in a newsletter dated June 2.\n\nStory continues\n\nNote that activity on other ZK rollups like Starknet and Polygon zkEVM also remains brisk. That has some observers calling a Zk season ahead \u2013 a crypto market slang for a period where ZK rollups outperform other market sectors by a significant margin.\n\nLooks like its going to be Zk season.\n\n\n\nPolygon zkEVM, Starknet and zkSync Era are continuing to put all time highs as TVL, Daily Active addresses and Daily transactions continue their uptrend. pic.twitter.com/vfUcnHNoPA \u2014 Emperor Osmo\ud83e\uddea (@Flowslikeosmo) June 18, 2023\n\nRead more: Ethereum Layer 2 Network zkSync Era Jumps to Nearly $250M in Locked Value"

        "title": "Ethereum Cancun Upgrade: Why Arbitrum, Optimism Will Profit Massively - NewsBTC",
        "content": "The tentatively slated Ethereum upgrade Cancun / Deneb for autumn will be a game-changer for layer-2 rollup technologies such as Arbitrum and Optimism. The basis for this will be the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844, which will be the main code change of the upgrade, as Christine Kim, vice president in Galaxy Digital\u2019s research team explained.\n\nLast Friday, 15 June, the 111th All Core Developers Consensus (ACDC) call was held. Chaired by Ethereum Foundation Researcher Alex Stokes, participants finalized the final scope of the upgrade. And EIP 4844 (proto-thanksharding) is being implemented.\n\nEthereum: Next Upgrade Is Huge For ARB And OP\n\nAs Kim writes, EIP 4844 introduces a new transaction type called \u201cblobs\u201d. This increases the data and storage requirements of Ethereum blocks and creates a new fee market to value blobs separately from regular transactions.\n\nData blobs are the first milestone for Ethereum\u2019s full Danksharding, which will allow rollups such as Arbitrum and Optimism a 100-fold increase in capacity. This is realized by allowing nodes to safely process multiple blobs per block than the initial maximum set by EIP 4844.\n\nImportantly, EIP 4844 does not improve Ethereum\u2019s scalability as a general-purpose blockchain for executing transactions and smart contracts, Kim notes. It does not significantly increase or improve the transaction capacity of Ethereum itself.\n\nHowever, proto-Danksharding reduces the cost of transferring large amounts of data to Ethereum and thus lowers the operating costs of rollups. This is of equal importance, as recent years have seen a surge in transactional activity from rollups such as Arbitrum and Optimism. While Ethereum mainnet transactions per second (TPS) reached a maximum of 20 TPS this year, L2 TPS peaked above 50.\n\nCompared to the cost of deploying code and transactions directly on Ethereum, rollups have saved end users and dapp developers over 99% in gas fees. The goal of EIP 4844 is therefore of great importance for scaling Ethereum.\n\n\u201cBlob blockspace will be auctioned according to its own fee market, modeled after the fee market design of EIP 1559,\u201d says Kim who emphasizes that there are many parallels to the introduction of blobs on Ethereum and the introduction of segregated witness (segwit) on Bitcoin. However, one of the main differences between segwit and EIP 4844 is the expected long-term impact of these code changes.\n\nArbitrum (ARB) Price At Crucial Resistance\n\nIn recent weeks, ARB has shown relative strength compared to OP. The ARB price has swept the previous low and now needs to overcome resistance at $1.03 to enter the trading range from May 6 to June 10. If the ARB price fails to do so in the next few days, a price discovery to the downside could be imminent. Otherwise, a rise to mid-range resistance at $1.15 could be on the table.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "The weekend was accompanied by a mild volatility which has seen Ethereum (ETH), the industry\u2019s second largest digital currency pare off some gains with a 0.60% slump to $1,741.24. The current price slip has extended the losses over the past 7 days.\n\nEthereum Profitability Outlook\n\nDespite its short term performance, the digital currency has remained one of the most attractive digital currencies for longer term success in the industry. With a market capitalization of $209.26 billion, Ethereum has maintained a relative profitability with its value jumping by 43.96% in the year to date (YTD) period.\n\nadvertisement\n\nDespite the turmoil the market has experienced over the past few weeks, more Ethereum addresses are still in profit. Per data from IntoTheBlock (ITB), a total of 57.5 million addresses are in profit, accounting for a total of 59.66% of all total active addresses. In the same vein, addresses in loss totals 36.84 million or 38.22% of the total wallets holding Ether.\n\nThis data is reflective of the resilience of the digital currency amid the regulatory turmoil that is threatening exchanges and other tokens including Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) amongst others. While the hurdles being faced by these digital assets are supposed to be a boost for Ethereum, many are skeptical that the cryptocurrency will be safe should there be a regulatory purge to determine what assets are securities or not.\n\nPer the data gleaned from ITB, just about 2.05 million addresses are experiencing neutral profitability without a loss or gain.\n\nOutlook on Ethereum Price\n\nDespite the challenges in the industry at this time, Ethereum is one of the top tokens with a good projection to outrank Bitcoin in the long term.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation has continued to double down on their push to turn the blockchain into a completely functional Proof-of-Stake (PoS) with a series of upgrades scheduled for the next few months.\n\nRiding on its outlook and inherent developmental effort, we can expect the price of the ETH to continue on its upward trajectory in the long term."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s mean and median gas price declined in recent weeks.\n\nActive users and volume remained untouched, indicating sustained activities.\n\nThe Ethereum [ETH] network has long been criticized for its exorbitant gas prices, which have been a source of frustration for users. The fees have remained stubbornly high despite its massive user base and daily transactions. However, there is a glimmer of hope.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nEthereum sees gas price decline\n\nOn 18 June, a recent chart from Glassnode revealed a significant decrease in Ethereum\u2018s median gas price, reaching approximately 18.0 GWEI, marking a five-month low. Furthermore, as of this writing, the gas price had further decreased to around 17.8 GWEI.\n\nThis reduction in median gas price prompted an examination of the average gas price, or mean, on CryptoQuant.\n\nAnalysis of the data on CryptoQuant demonstrated a consistent decline in gas prices. As of this writing, the mean gas price stood at around 19.2 GWEI. This level represented a substantial drop from the peak of around 150 GWEI observed in May.\n\nConsidering the reduction in gas prices, it is worth exploring whether key activities on the Ethereum network experienced a corresponding decrease.\n\nEthereum\u2019s active users, fees, and volume\n\nDespite the observed reduction in gas prices, close attention was paid to key network metrics to determine if there was a corresponding decrease in activity. An examination of the volume metric on DefiLlama revealed no noticeable drop in volume on the Ethereum network.\n\nAs of this writing, the volume surpassed $520 million, indicating sustained activity. Additionally, the active user metric demonstrated a consistent number of users engaging with the network over the past week, with over 358,000 active users currently.\n\nFurthermore, data from Crypto Fees indicated that Ethereum continued to generate substantial fees, suggesting an increase in transactions. As of this writing, the daily fee exceeded $3.5 million, with a seven-day average exceeding $4 million.\n\nThe data indicated that the volume of interactions or transactions on the Ethereum network had not experienced a decline.\n\nAre L2s taking the shine?\n\nThe reduction in Ethereum gas fees could be attributed to the emergence of various Layer 2 solutions (L2s). These L2s aim to alleviate congestion on the Ethereum network, which helps mitigate the escalation of gas prices.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nAccording to data from L2 Beats, these Layer 2 solutions are steadily gaining traction, as evidenced by their increasing Total Value Locked (TVL).\n\nAs of this writing, the L2 TVL surpassed $8.4 billion, indicating a growing adoption of these solutions. As the adoption of L2s expands, we may witness a further reduction in gas prices on the Ethereum network."

        "content": "Ethereum inscriptions launch with 10,000 Ethereum punk inscriptions in 24 hours.\n\nEthereum dominance of the NFT space continues with blue-chip NFTs.\n\nRecent reports suggest Ethereum is treading a similar path to Bitcoin when pioneering the inscription of NFTs on its platform. In line with the concept of Bitcoin inscriptions, a new feature called Ethscriptions has recently been introduced, and it has garnered a favorable response from users.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC terms\n\nEthereum inscriptions\n\nCapsule 21\u2019s co-founder, Middlemarch, made an exciting announcement on June 16. He introduced Ethscriptions, an Ethereum-based inscription system inspired by Bitcoin\u2019s inscriptions.\n\nEthscriptions enable the creation and sharing of digital works through Ethereum transaction calldata. Alongside this remarkable development, Middlemarch also revealed the launch of Ethereum Punks. It is a collection of non-contract punks akin to those found on Bitcoin.\n\nAdditionally, a glimpse at the Ethereum Punks page revealed that all 10,000 inscriptions were swiftly claimed, leaving none available at the time of writing. This overwhelming response reflected the enthusiastic reception of its inaugural inscription venture.\n\nCurrent Ethereum NFT landscape\n\nEthereum\u2019s smart contract capabilities and widespread adoption have paved the way for the emergence of the first set of prestigious NFTs, commonly known as blue-chip NFTs. A glance at the NFT rankings based on volume, sales, and market capitalization on DappRadar revealed that the top five NFTs were on the network.\n\nAs of this writing, Axie Infinity stood at the top of all-time NFT collections. With over 19.3 million in sales and a volume of over 4.2 billion. Following closely behind was Crypto Punks, boasting impressive sales exceeding 28,000, a remarkable volume surpassing 3.5 billion, and a market capitalization approaching $2 billion.\n\nFurthermore, the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) secured third and fourth positions, respectively, showcasing the prominence of these Ethereum-based NFT collections. This data reaffirmed the network\u2019s dominant share in the NFT space, and the recent inscription launch holds the potential to attract even more attention to the platform.\n\nFees could see a spike\n\nIf we consider the impact of Bitcoin inscriptions and Ordinals, Ethereum will likely experience an increase in transaction fees. The popularity of inscriptions could bring about a higher volume of transactions on the network. The increase in transactions could then result in increased fees being generated.\n\nAccording to Crypto Fees, on 16 June, Ethereum recorded the highest fees compared to other platforms, with daily fees surpassing 4.6 million. The average fees over the past seven days were also significant, exceeding 4.3 million.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today\n\nAdditionally, despite the launch of Ethscriptions, there doesn\u2019t appear to be a noticeable impact on the number of active addresses within the last 24 hours. As of this writing, there were approximately 465,000 active addresses within that timeframe."

        "content": "Summary:\n\nEthereum Foundation researcher Michael Neuder proposed increasing the validator balance cap from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH.\n\nThe idea being considered within the developer community would stem the growing active validator set size and optimize network efficiency.\n\nIncreasing the limits of validator balances would also make room for auto-compounding of rewards, allowing validators to earn maximum yield for their staked coins.\n\nFollowing a proposal from Ethereum Foundation researcher Michael Neuder, core developers of crypto\u2019s largest altcoin network could increase the validator balance cap from the 32 ETH limit to a staggering 2,048 ETH if the idea garners support.\n\nNeuder shared the proposal during the developer\u2019s bi-weekly call where client teams meet to discuss and coordinate the most important updates to the network. The increase in validator balance seems to address a major concern \u2013 the growing number of validators on Ethereum\u2019s PoS network.\n\nIndeed, the current 32 ETH limit means that entities must run multiple validators if they wish to stake past the limit and access more staking rewards. The balance limit has so far spurred an increase in validators which currently exceeds half a million, a rapid increase since The Merge.\n\nAccording to Neuder\u2019s proposal, increasing the balance limit will push Ethereum toward greater efficiency by optimizing finality in a single block.\n\nWhile the current balance cap buoys decentralization, it also causes entities to operate a concerning number of validators which could adversely impact network efficiency, Neuder argued during Friday\u2019s developer\u2019s call.\n\nMore Ethereum Rewards For Validators\n\nFurthermore, Neuder\u2019s proposal could unlock greater rewards for Ethereum validators since they would be able to stake more and therefore, earn more yield on their staked tokens.\n\nCurrently, the 32 ETH limit does not allow validators to earn rewards beyond their capped balances. This limit propels operational costs for larger node operators who end up managing hundreds or thousands of validators in a bid to maximize their yield generation.\n\nIf the cap is increased, Neuder argued that an auto-compounding feature could allow for fewer Ethereum validators to exist while accessing greater rewards through auto-compounding of their staked yield.\n\nThe researcher warned that the idea is not without risk and developers will continue to weigh the merits alongside other hot-button upgrades mulled in the upcoming Deneb and Cancun.\n\nDeneb which focuses on changes to the consensus layer should roll out based on three EIPs. EIP 7044 introduces a code change that accepts signed validator exits in perpetuity, thus bettering the shaking experience.\n\nAnother staking experience upgrade, EIP 4788, aims to improve access to Beacon chain blocks with information on the chain state inside EVMs. EIP 7045 focuses on improved security by expanding the attestation slot from a rolling window of one epoch to two epochs."

Introducing Ethscriptions. here\u2019s everything you need to know.\n\nTL;DR\n\nEthinscriptions are Ethereum\u2019s response to Bitcoin\u2019s Ordinal Inscriptions. Tom Lehman, the co-founder of the Capsule 21 podcast and former CEO of genius.com, brings this concept to life on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nGenerated through unique transaction data on Ethereum, ensuring content uniqueness. The file size of Ethinscriptions is limited to 96KB.\n\nUsers created thousands of Ethscriptions, making them available for trading on platforms like OpenSea. Ethscriptions offer a fresh approach to digital artifacts, with the potential for lasting impact in the crypto community.\n\nWhat are Ethscriptions?\n\nIn the rapidly changing world of Web3, a new concept is causing a stir among enthusiasts. Introducing Ethscriptions, Ethereum\u2019s response to Bitcoin\u2019s Ordinal inscriptions. Tom Lehman, the co-founder of the Capsule 21 podcast and former CEO of genius.com, brought this new concept to life. Lehman leverages the power of the Ethereum blockchain to create and share digital artifacts.\n\nSignificantly, during a Twitter Space on June 16th, 2023, Lehman revealed Ethereum inscriptions to the world. The idea quickly gained attention, with Middlemarch writing a thread introducing a collection called \u2018Ethereum Punks\u2019 on the same day. The inscriptions are generated on the Ethereum network through successful transactions that contain unique data URIs. Notably, duplicate content is disregarded, and they support all valid mime types.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, to guarantee uniqueness, no previous Ethscription within a block or the same transaction block can have the same content. The transfer of Ethereum inscriptions occurs when the input data of a transaction is the hash of a valid Ethscription, and the sender of the transaction becomes the owner of the Ethscription. However, it\u2019s important to note that the file used for an inscription on the ETH chain must be below the 96-kilobyte threshold.\n\nMoreover, when a creation transaction takes place, the recipient becomes the initial owner of the Ethscription, while the sender assumes the role of the creator. Lehman has started ethscriptions.com, a website that allows visitors to explore and browse all the Ethereum inscriptions created thus far. It also provides the necessary tools for inscription creation on the Ethereum chain.\n\nAre They Gaining Popularity?\n\nSince its launch, users have created thousands of Ethscriptions, establishing their presence on marketplaces like OpenSea. Additionally, the Emblem Vault team has enabled trading for a collection of Ethscriptions on their NFT platform.\n\nThe introduction of Ethscriptions has set the crypto community abuzz, with its unique approach to creating and sharing digital artifacts. Therefore, Ethereum\u2019s blockchain opens up a path of possibilities, bringing new life to the concept of inscribed artworks.\n\nAs Ethscriptions start to gain attention, the future of digital artifacts and their impact on the crypto landscape seems more exciting than ever. This is a space where trends pop up and quickly fade away. Will this be one of them? Or could this potentially be here to stay?"

Notably, LTC\u2019s total addresses reached 200.7 million at press time,while ETH\u2019s figure stood at 181 million, which gave the former a lead of over 20 million addresses.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s LTC\u2019s market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nOther metrics also revealed that the blockchain\u2019s performance was something to rejoice over. For instance, daily active addresses also spiked, reflecting increased usage. Besides that, LTC\u2018s velocity was up.\n\nAn increase in the metric meant that LTC was used in transactions more often within a set time frame. Moreover, daily on-chain transaction volume in profit also increased last week.\n\nLitecoin\u2019s price moved sideways\n\nThough the blockchain\u2019s network activity was on the rise, its price action did not follow the same trend, as it increased marginally last week. According to CoinMarketCap, LTC\u2019s price has risen by over 1% in the last seven days.\n\nAt press time, it was trading at $77.43, with a market capitalization of over $5.6 billion.\n\nHowever, LTC\u2019s whale activity remained high, as per Santiment\u2019s chart. Sentiment around LTC also improved last week, as evident from its weighted sentiment and social volume.\n\nInterestingly, Coinglass\u2019 data revealed that LTC\u2019s sideways trajectory might soon change. Litecoin\u2019s Open Interest has registered a decline since the beginning of June.\n\nA decline in that metric usually means that the ongoing price trend may end soon. Therefore, the possibility of LTC registering gains seemed likely.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 LTCs worth today?\n\nThis can be expected from LTC\n\nLTC\u2019s daily chart pointed out quite a few bullish market indicators, suggesting a price hike in the coming days. For instance, LTC\u2019s MACD displayed the possibility of a bullish crossover. Litecoin\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) also registered an uptick.\n\nIts Money Flow Index (MFI) also followed the same trend, increasing the chances of a northbound price movement in the coming days."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Forms Bullish Pattern, US$1,780 Close Crucial - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "As cryptocurrency prices soar, many investors are eyeing the Ethereum price during the crypto bull run.\n\nRecession is weakening fiat currencies in world economies. Cryptocurrencies are picking up steam. On the other hand, Ethereum, or ETH, stands out among cryptocurrency assets. It is boosted by the surging interest in decentralized finance (DeFi), which leverages algorithms and science-oriented cryptocurrencies to operate the blockchain. The Ethereum price is currently about US$1,700, down 62% from its peak of US$4,891, reached in November 2021. However, the cryptocurrency\u2019s price has increased 49% over the past six months, showing a crypto bull run.\n\nThe Ethereum price is currently trading above the US$1,780 barrier. The price is consolidating gains above the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the most recent wave from the US$1,720 swing low to the US$1,873 high. The bulls\u2019 ability to keep the price above US$1,780 may pave the way for a move up to the US$1,850 resistance level. If US$1,850 is broken, the positive trend may continue to increase, and the price may move closer to the US$1,920 resistance level. Alternatively, a new collapse can begin if the bears drive the price below $1,780. Near $1,750 is the next significant support level, below which the cryptocurrency price may fall to reach the $1,720 support level.\n\nShould You Invest in Ethereum Now?\n\nWhile some experts predict that Ethereum\u2019s price will likely fall over time, others indicate that it will likely continue to increase. The transition to Ethereum 2.0 is presently underway. The upgrade is anticipated to boost the scalability and security of the Ethereum network. If the update is effective, it might raise interest in Ethereum, raising the price. It is a blatant sign that experts believe now is the ideal moment to invest in Ethereum.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Web3 usernames may see greater adoption due to recent advancements - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ever since the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) was launched in 2017, Web3 users have been able to replace the long strings of characters that make up a crypto address with a more easily memorized blockchain username or Web3 domain name. For example, Ethereum users can now send crypto to the network\u2019s founder, Vitalik Buterin, at his username, vitalik.eth, without knowing that his address is 0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045.\n\nBut despite this advancement making it much easier to identify users, hardly anyone has taken advantage of it. There are over 200 million unique addresses on Ethereum, yet only 2.2 million .eth names were registered as of January. This means that at least 97% of Ethereum addresses are not associated with an ENS username.\n\nThis lack of usernames creates user experience problems in the Web3 ecosystem. Just imagine if early email addresses had consisted of long strings of characters that looked like 0x7a16ff8270133f063aab6c9977183d9e72835428 or 0x3A7937851d67Ee2f51C959663749093Dc87D9C9a. If this had been the case, email may not have survived as a practice.\n\nBut despite this initial lack of adoption, there is some evidence that the tide may be turning in favor of Web3 usernames. A few recent advancements in wallet and messaging apps may onboard more users than ever before.\n\nOne of these advancements is better wallet integration with free usernames.\n\nWallet integration and free usernames\n\nWallets have had the ability to understand Web3 names for a long time. According to MetaMask\u2019s changelog, it introduced the ability to send to a .eth name in October 2017, right after ENS launched. Other wallets have followed suit with this feature, including Coinbase Wallet, Trust Wallet and others. Some of these wallets have also integrated with ENS rivals Unstoppable Domains, Space ID, Bonfida and others.\n\nHowever, these wallets still show a crypto address to users by default, as new users don\u2019t typically receive names automatically.\n\nUnstoppable Domains interface. Source: Unstoppable Domains\n\nFor a user to receive crypto via their Web3 name, they need to first register a username with a particular name provider. This means figuring out which provider to use, navigating to the provider\u2019s interface and going through the registration process.\n\nTo make matters worse, names can be expensive. ENS names typically cost $5 and expire after a year, while Unstoppable Domains names that do not need to be renewed typically cost from $20\u2013$40. Compare this with how easy it is to sign up for an email address for free using Gmail, Outlook or Yahoo, and it\u2019s easy to see why most crypto users don\u2019t have a Web3 username.\n\nA few wallet apps have been trying to solve this problem by giving away free domain names to their users. For example, Coinbase Wallet allows new users to register a single .cb.id username for free once per year, and Kresus wallet offers its users a free .kresus username of up to eight characters.\n\nThis practice of giving out free usernames has begun only recently. And some popular wallets like Trust Wallet and MetaMask still don\u2019t offer the feature. But as more users onboard to the Web3 ecosystem, this may lead to greater adoption of Web3 usernames over time.\n\nAnother recent advancement is instant messaging integration.\n\nChat messaging with Web3 usernames\n\nSome messaging apps have begun implementing Web3 names as usernames, increasing these names\u2019 utility beyond the payments use case. One example is Blockscan Chat, which allows users to send instant messages to any Ethereum address or ENS username.\n\nBlockscan Chat interface. Source: Blockscan\n\nMessages that are sent using Blockscan Chat produce alerts on the Etherscan block explorer. If the recipient sees the alert and logs into the app, they can read it. The app\u2019s developer claims that all of its messages are end-to-encrypted. So, although anyone can see if a particular user has received a message, only the sender and recipient can read it.\n\nWeb3 usernames aren\u2019t an absolute necessity for using Blockscan Chat, as it does allow users to send messages to crypto addresses. But names do make it much easier for users to find each other in the app.\n\nGrill.chat interface showing .eth names. Source: Grill.chat\n\nAnother example is Grill.chat, a messaging app running on the Subsocial network. When a user first signs up for it, they are assigned a random username. But they can optionally attach an Ethereum wallet to their account. If they do this, the app automatically converts their random username into their .eth username.\n\nBeing able to find other users to chat with via their Web3 usernames is arguably a more useful feature than being able to send crypto with them.\n\nAfter all, the crypto community is still small. If a crypto user needs money from friends or family, they may be better off using traditional Web2 apps like Venmo or Apple Pay, as their friends and family may not know how to use a Web3 wallet. But if a person wants to chat specifically about crypto and Web3 apps, being able to look them up by their username could turn out to be a huge advantage. This added use case may entice more users to adopt Web3 names in the future.\n\nAnother recent advancement in Web3 names is cross-chain names.\n\nCross-chain Web3 names\n\nWhen Web3 names were first invented, ENS was the only protocol that could be used to create them, and it could only be used on Ethereum.\n\nBut the Web3 ecosystem has since grown to encompass many different chains. And as the number of chains has grown, so has the number of naming protocols. Users can now register Polygon usernames from Unstoppable Domains, Solana ones from Bonfida, and both Arbitrum One and BNB Chain names from Space ID.\n\nThis fragmentation across chains can make integration difficult for wallets and block explorers, and confuse users. For example, suppose a person\u2019s Polygon username is newton.crypto. But when they go to register the same name on BNB Chain, they find that newton.bnb is already taken, so they register einstein.bnb instead. When a user looks at this person\u2019s address on a block explorer, either name could appear, depending on which one the developer of the block explorer has chosen to display. And regardless of which one is displayed, it could confuse users.\n\nIn this case, for example, if a user wants to send crypto to newton.crypto via BNB Chain, they may easily send it to newton.bnb instead, which will turn out to be the wrong recipient.\n\nA few Web3 companies are trying to fix this problem by creating a single name for each identity across multiple chains. For example, the Redefined app allows users to register for a username on Arbitrum One and use it to receive funds on Optimism, Polygon, BNB Chain, Solana, Bitcoin, Moonbeam, Near, or any EVM-compatible chain.\n\nTo make this feature possible, the Redefined app lets the user write an address or username for each network into the Arbitrum smart contract through a \u201cmanage\u201d tab within the app. Once the addresses are listed in the contract, any person can initiate a transaction to the correct address using a \u201csend\u201d function within the app. To send funds, the sender only needs to know the recipient\u2019s Redefined username, not the recipient\u2019s name or address on any particular chain.\n\nRedefined usernames begin with an @ and do not have extensions. For example, @newton and @einstein are possible Redefined usernames. The protocol also features an aggregator SDK that wallets and other apps can use to integrate with these usernames.\n\nDid.id, also called \u201c.bit,\u201d is a similar project that runs on the Nervos Network. It allows users to register for a .bit username that works across 39 different networks, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, Bitcoin Cash, Internet Computer and many others. Registration can be done directly with a Nervos Network wallet or indirectly using Polygon.\n\nDid.id doesn\u2019t feature a user interface with a \u201csend\u201d function. However, it is integrated with nine different wallet apps, including imToken, Tokenpocket, MathWallet, Huobi Wallet, Bitkeep, HyperPay, AlphaWallet, ViaWallet, and MIBAO. So it\u2019s available to senders who use these wallets.\n\nCross-chain usernames are yet another new development that may spur greater adoption of Web3 usernames over time.\n\nWhen will usernames catch on?\n\nDespite these advancements, it\u2019s still not clear how long mass adoption of Web3 usernames will take. Right now, over 90% of Web3 addresses are not associated with any username. So there is a huge hill to climb in terms of adoption. And in the meantime, users still need to cut and paste a complicated string of characters to find a person\u2019s Web3 identity.\n\nThere is also still plenty of friction left for users, including the continuing high cost of registering a name for users of most wallet apps.\n\nEven so, these advancements may pave the way for the mass adoption of Web3 usernames at some point in the future."

This dynamic debut echoes the launch of Ordinals on Bitcoin, marking another pivotal moment in the blockchain world.\n\nWith almost 30k Ethscriptions in <18 hours, the launch was a huge success!\n\n\n\nThank you for seeing the massive potential here!\n\n\n\nI am on Ethscriptions 24/7, but I need your help!\n\n\n\nDM @proroketh to join our protocol Twitter chat. Ideas, bug reports, NO alpha, NO trading, NERDS ONLY! pic.twitter.com/udKdsVT0L8 \u2014 Middlemarch (@dumbnamenumbers) June 17, 2023\n\nEthscriptions vs. Ordinals: a tale of two protocols\n\nBitcoin\u2019s (BTC) Ordinals and Ethereum\u2019s Ethscriptions were born from a shared vision: to expand blockchain beyond mere financial transactions.\n\nWhile Ordinals marked the Bitcoin network\u2019s foray into the world of non-financial data inscriptions, Ethscriptions, albeit similar, bring a fresh perspective to the Ethereum network.\n\nYou might also like: Bitcoin Ordinals upgrade addresses \u2018cursed inscriptions\u2019 issue\n\nWhile both protocols reflect innovation, the community\u2019s response is a stark difference. The introduction of Ordinals faced pushback from some Bitcoin maximalists, resistant to deviating from Bitcoin\u2019s primary function as a financial asset.\n\nIt appears that there's an \"attack\" on Bitcoin.\n\nThe Ordinal gang/ Big blockers? Are pushing random inscriptions and pay high fees.\n\nThey clog the mempool and increase overall fees to include a transaction in the block.\n\n\n\nWhat is unclear is, what is the purpose?\n\nThey are, at this\u2026 \u2014 Toma B (@Toma_7_32) May 7, 2023\n\nOn the other hand, the Ethereum community embraced Ethscriptions with open arms. Ethereum\u2019s culture of innovation and experimentation could explain this acceptance, as it has always positioned itself as a \u2018world computer\u2019 and a platform for decentralized applications (dApps) rather than just a currency.\n\nOrdinals and Ethscriptions use different methods to inscribe data. Ordinals rely on Bitcoin\u2019s transaction data, whereas Ethscriptions leverages Ethereum\u2019s \u201ccalldata.\u201d\n\nEthereum\u2019s approach is seen as more decentralized and cost-effective than using contract storage, a significant point of difference.\n\nIt's cheaper and more decentralized than using contract storage.\n\n\n\nAlso protocol guarantees global uniqueness of the content of all valid Ethscriptions!\n\n\n\nPlus it's skating to where the puck is going in an L2 world. \u2014 Middlemarch (@dumbnamenumbers) June 17, 2023\n\nOrdinals allow various inscriptions, including artwork, profile pictures, and playable games. Ethscriptions, although currently limited to image-only inscriptions, intends to expand to accommodate different file types, potentially leading to broader applications.\n\nA notable implication of both protocols is the potential rise in transaction costs. Bitcoin saw an increase in transaction fees with the advent of Ordinals, a likely scenario for Ethereum with Ethscriptions, especially given Ethereum\u2019s already high transaction fees.\n\nThe community response and potential implications\n\nAn undeniable indicator of the community\u2019s excitement about this groundbreaking venture is the launch of Ethereum Punks, a collection of non-contract punks similar to those on the Bitcoin network. All 10,000 inscriptions were claimed almost immediately post-launch.\n\nHowever, this high activity level resulted in occasional downtime and necessitated Lehman\u2019s assurances to the community about the project\u2019s technical stability.\n\nEthereum\u2019s innovation doesn\u2019t come without implications. The launch of Ethscriptions could result in an upswing in Ethereum\u2019s transaction fees.\n\nBut do not let this dissuade you. Increased transaction fees incentivize miners to sustain their efforts, ultimately fortifying the security of the decentralized platforms.\n\nThis measure is crucial, considering Ethereum tops the chart as the most expensive chain for transactions and development.\n\nFuture of Ethscriptions\n\nThe narrative of Ethscriptions may have just begun, but its potential ramifications are colossal. Users can only inscribe images, but Lehman hints at a future where different file types could be uploaded.\n\nThe widespread acceptance of Ethscriptions illuminates the continued push for innovation and the endless quest for improved functionalities within the blockchain universe.\n\nWhile some argue that similar technologies have existed for years, Ethscriptions\u2019 swift adoption and awareness underline a newfound appreciation for such initiatives.\n\nWhether Ethscriptions will continue to make waves or become a transient ripple in the blockchain pond depends on the ongoing community engagement and adoption.\n\nFor now, Ethereum\u2019s innovative spirit remains undeterred, continuously seeking new territories to explore in the expansive universe of blockchain.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

The rising demand for rollups can be attributed to Ethereum core developers\u2019 focus on implementing Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844, as noted by Galaxy Digital.\n\nEIP 4844 introduced a new transaction type to Ethereum that accepts data \u201cblobs,\u201d aiming to reduce transaction fees on rollups. The prioritization of EIP 7844 in Ethereum\u2019s upcoming Cancun/Deneb upgrade, expected to activate in the Fall or Winter next year. Dapps built on Ethereum are expected to gradually migrate the majority of their operations to more cost-effective rollups.\n\nAlex Thorn, the head of research at Galaxy Digital, highlighted this in a newsletter dated June 2, emphasizing the importance of rollups for Ethereum\u2019s scalability and the need for dapps to adapt to a more cost-effective solution."

        "content": "On June 19, Ethereum block explorer and analytics platform Etherscan launched a new tool dubbed \u201cCode Reader\u201d that utilizes artificial intelligence to retrieve and interpret the source code of a specific contract address. After a user inputs a prompt, Code Reader generates a response via OpenAI\u2019s large language model, providing insight into the contract\u2019s source code files. The tool\u2019s tutorial page reads:\n\n\u201cTo use the tool, you need a valid OpenAI API Key and sufficient OpenAI usage limits. This tool does not store your API keys.\u201d\n\nCode Reader\u2019s use cases include gaining deeper insight into contracts\u2019 code via AI-generated explanations, obtaining comprehensive lists of smart contract functions related to Ethereum data, and understanding how the underlying contract interacts with decentralized applications. \u201cOnce the contract files are retrieved, you can choose a specific source code file to read through. Additionally, you may modify the source code directly inside the UI before sharing it with the AI,\u201d the page says.\n\nA demonstration of the Code Reader tool. Source: Etherscan\n\nAmid an AI boom, some experts have cautioned on the feasibility of current AI models. According to a recent report published by Singaporean venture capital firm Foresight Ventures, \u201ccomputing power resources will be the next big battlefield for the coming decade.\u201d That said, despite growing demand for training large AI models in decentralized distributed computing power networks, researchers say current prototypes face significant constraints such as complex data synchronization, network optimization, data privacy and security concerns.\n\nIn one example, the Foresight researchers noted that the training of a large model with 175 billion parameters with single-precision floating-point representation would require around 700 gigabytes. However, distributed training requires these parameters to be frequently transmitted and updated between computing nodes. In the case of 100 computing nodes and each node needing to update all parameters at each unit step, the model would require transmitting 70 terabytes of data per second, far exceeding the capacity of most networks. The researchers summarized:\n\n\u201cIn most scenarios, small AI models are still a more feasible choice, and should not be overlooked too early in the tide of FOMO [fear of missing out] on large models.\u201d"

        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nEthereum users are being given a fresh way to create nonfungible tokens (NFTs) and other digital assets on the blockchain following the launch of a new protocol called \"Ethscriptions.\"\n\nLaunched on June 17 by music website Genius.com's co-founder Tom Lehman, Ethscriptions aims to revolutionize Ethereum-based digital asset creation and was quickly met with a high degree of enthusiasm, generating almost 30,000 Ethscriptions within the first 18 hours.\n\nTaking inspiration from the popular Bitcoin (BTC) Ordinals protocol \u2014 where assets are known as \u201cinscriptions\u201d \u2014 Ethscriptions promises to enhance the way digital assets are minted on the Ethereum network.\n\nThe Protocol: Leveraging Ethereum's Calldata for Improved Minting\n\nLehman, who is also known by the pseudonym Middlemarch on Twitter, declared the project a \"huge success.\" Ethscriptions employs Ethereum's \"calldata,\" which refers to the data held within a smart contract, to allow for a \"cheaper\" and \"more decentralized\" minting process compared to conventional smart contract-based methods.\n\nAt present, the protocol limits users to image-only inscriptions, but Lehman assures that Ethscriptions will accommodate different file types in the future. Current protocol specifications permit users to \"ethscribe\" any image provided it's less than 96 kilobytes in size.\n\nLehman\u2019s first project on the Ethscriptions protocol, the \"Ethereum Punks,\" witnessed a significantly positive response from the community. All 10,000 assets were claimed almost instantaneously, reinforcing the positive acceptance of the protocol by the community.\n\nChallenges and Potential: Navigating the Ethereum Ecosystem\n\nDespite the initial success, the project's launch caused so much user activity that the API interface for the official Ethscriptions website temporarily crashed, indicating possible infrastructure challenges.\n\nGiven the existing infrastructure that enables the creation of NFTs and other digital assets on the Ethereum network, it remains uncertain whether Ethscriptions will achieve the same level of popularity as Bitcoin Ordinals. Within six months, the total number of Ordinals inscribed on Bitcoin skyrocketed from zero to 10 million, driven primarily by users' fascination with minting assets and the novelty of minting entirely new tokens through the BRC-20 token standard on the Bitcoin network.\n\nThe launch of the Ethscriptions protocol on Ethereum presents a significant development for digital asset creation on the blockchain. The Ethereum ecosystem continues to evolve and innovate, and it becomes clearer over this period that initiatives like Ethscriptions could potentially introduce new dynamics and possibilities. While the immediate impact is promising, the long-term success of this novel approach to asset creation remains to be seen.\n\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "content": "In the ever-evolving crypto market, Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) continue to dominate headlines. However, a new player, Collateral Network, is making waves with its upcoming COLT presale. This article delves into the recent developments of these three projects, shedding light on their potential profitability and growth.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nEthereum (ETH): A New Era of Tokenized Securities\n\nThe crypto giant, Ethereum, is on the news recently due to developments regarding tokenized security. This may give it an advantage over its competitor, Bitcoin.\n\nEthereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has been a hot topic in the crypto world. Known for its smart contract functionality, Ethereum has been instrumental in the development of decentralized applications (dApps) and the DeFi sector.\n\nRecently, Ethereum made headlines when a subsidiary of the Bank of China launched the first-ever tokenized security on the Ethereum blockchain. This marked a significant milestone for Ethereum, demonstrating its potential to revolutionize the financial sector.\n\nIn the past month, Ethereum developers have also been planning for the next hard fork, dubbed \u2018Dencun.\u2019 This upgrade is expected to bring about significant improvements to the Ethereum network, further solidifying its position in the crypto market.\n\nThe launch of the tokenized security and the upcoming hard fork align with the article\u2019s title, suggesting that Ethereum\u2019s Proof of Stake could indeed be more profitable than Bitcoin mining.\n\nBitcoin (BTC): Bracing for CPI Volatility\n\nThe largest crypto out there, Bitcoin, is facing news of mining that may affect the profitability of the coin.\n\nBitcoin, the pioneer of cryptocurrencies, has had its fair share of ups and downs. Despite facing its first monthly drop of 2023, Bitcoin remains a strong contender in the crypto market.\n\nRecent developments have seen Bitcoin traders bracing for Consumer Price Index (CPI) volatility. This comes as Bitcoin faces numerous resistance levels. However, this volatility never came, and despite record-low inflation, Bitcoin didn\u2019t budge.\n\nThese developments indicate that Bitcoin mining could face challenges in terms of profitability, especially when compared to Ethereum.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nCollateral Network (COLT): A New Dawn in Crypto Lending\n\nCollateral Network, an Ethereum web3 peer-to-peer lending platform, is set to disrupt the lending industry. This innovative project allows users to unlock liquidity against physical assets on the blockchain, such as jewelry, watches, properties, vintage cars, and artwork.\n\nCollateral Network offers a wide range of benefits. For lenders, these include a weekly passive income, tangible assets as collateral, and security in case of loan default. For borrowers, Collateral Network offers fast turnaround, privacy, transparency, low cost, and borderless transactions.\n\nAdditionally, owners of the $COLT token will have access to our exclusive online auctions for distressed assets. These give investors the chance to buy properties below market value when a borrower defaults on a loan. Some of these auctions will also be in the metaverse.\n\nAnalysts predict a significant price surge for the COLT token. With an initial starting price of $0.001, the token will increase by 3500% during the presale, potentially reaching $0.35. Furthermore, the token will surge by 100x when it lists on major exchanges. Currently, the COLT token has increased its price up to $0.168.\n\nThese predictions, coupled with the platform\u2019s innovative approach to lending, suggest that Collateral Network could indeed be a game-changer in the crypto market.\n\nFind out more about the Collateral Network presale here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.collateralnetwork.io/\n\nPresale: https://presale.collateralnetwork.io/register\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/collateralnwk\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Collateralnwk\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "As Ethereum faces a market sell-off, investors are eyeing other promising opportunities. Litecoin, with its upcoming halving event, is garnering attention, while the Collateral Network, a rising star in the crypto lending space, is set to disrupt traditional lending norms.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nEthereum: A Shift in the Wind\n\nEthereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has been a staple in the portfolios of many crypto investors. However, recent market trends have seen a shift in sentiment.\n\nIn recent developments, Ethereum\u2019s price collapse has been a cause for concern among investors. Ethereum\u2019s price has plunged by 7% due to a wave of risk-averse sentiment, sparking a sell-off that has left many investors questioning their holdings.\n\nThis sell-off is a result of a risk-off sentiment that has swept across the market, causing investors to reconsider their positions in Ethereum. Despite this, Ethereum remains a robust project with a solid foundation and a vibrant ecosystem.\n\nThe recent price plunge and the ensuing sell-off are significant in the context of Ethereum\u2019s role in the crypto market. As investors reassess their positions, the potential for other projects to gain traction increases. This is where Litecoin and Collateral Network come into play.\n\nLitecoin: Preparing for the Halving\n\nMiners and investors are preparing for the halving event that\u2019s coming up. As such, Litecoin is expected to have a price rise very soon.\n\nLitecoin, often referred to as the silver to Bitcoin\u2019s gold, has seen an 8% price increase in the last month, despite the turbulence in the altcoin markets. This increase is largely attributed to the upcoming halving event, which has miners and investors alike on their toes.\n\nLitecoin was created by Charlie Lee as a lighter, faster version of Bitcoin. It offers quicker transaction confirmation times and a different hashing algorithm. Litecoin has consistently been in the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, making it a popular choice among investors.\n\nRecently, Litecoin has seen an uptick in activity as investors and miners prepare for the upcoming halving event. This event, which halves the reward for mining Litecoin, has historically led to a price increase. The anticipation of this event has likely contributed to the recent price surge.\n\nThe upcoming halving event and the recent price increase tie back to Litecoin\u2019s potential in the crypto market. As Ethereum holders look for other investment opportunities, Litecoin\u2019s recent developments make it a viable contender.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nCollateral Network: The Rising Star\n\nCollateral Network, an Ethereum web3 peer-to-peer lending platform, presents a unique opportunity in the crypto market.\n\nCollateral Network allows users to borrow cryptocurrencies against physical assets on the blockchain. It addresses several problems in the lending industry, including difficulties in obtaining loans for non-traditional assets and the outdated pawnbroking industry. The platform offers benefits to both lenders and borrowers, making it an attractive proposition.\n\nLenders receive a fixed passive income, and real physical assets back the loans. Borrowers, on the other hand, can unlock cash from their assets quickly and discreetly, with competitive rates and flexible terms. The platform\u2019s native token, $COLT, offers additional benefits such as discounts on borrowing fees and interest, access to online auctions, and staking rewards.\n\nAlso, access to credit can be difficult for people based in certain countries. As such, with Collateral Network, users can borrow against their assets no matter their location.\n\nAnalysts predict a 3,500% price increase during the presale, with the price potentially reaching $0.35. The token will surge by 100x when listed on major exchanges. These figures, coupled with the platform\u2019s unique proposition, make Collateral Network a promising opportunity for investors looking to diversify their portfolios.\n\nFind out more about the Collateral Network presale here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.collateralnetwork.io/\n\nPresale: https://presale.collateralnetwork.io/register\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/collateralnwk\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Collateralnwk\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

Two current heavyweights, Ethereum and Polkadot, continue their upward march alongside an ambitious newcomer, Collateral Network, which gears up for its anticipated COLT presale.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nEthereum (ETH): Charting the Path to Progress\n\nThe second largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum, made a deal with the Chinese recently. This will certainly help the growth of the blockchain.\n\nEthereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has been a stalwart in the crypto market for years. Powering a myriad of decentralized applications, Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts functionality has cemented its standing in the blockchain space. However, Ethereum\u2019s recent strides in the financial sector definitely notable.\n\nEthereum recently hit the headlines as the Bank of China\u2019s investment arm, BOCI, issued digitally structured notes worth $28 million on its blockchain. This unprecedented move by a Chinese financial institution to leverage a public blockchain platform represents a significant breakthrough for Ethereum and could signal a surge in institutional adoption.\n\nThis major development stands to boost Ethereum\u2019s position in the title\u2019s predicted gains, as referenced in the rainbow chart.

        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nTether, the issuer of USDT, the world\u2019s largest stablecoin, has minted the second 1 billion token on the Ethereum blockchain in less than two months.\n\nThe stablecoin issuer has said that the new mint is part of its \"inventory replenish\" program to ensure stablecoin liquidity across all chains. In other crypto developments, Tradecurve has been building momentum as investors flock to the new trading platform that has the potential to rekindle interest in the DeFi space.\n\nTether Mints Additional 1 Billion USDT\n\nTether\u2019s treasury has announced the minting of 1 billion USDT tokens on the Ethereum blockchain just two months after a separate 1 billion USDT token was minted. So far in 2023, the stablecoin issuer has now minted over $16 billion worth of USDT tokens. Tether remains the most dominant USD-pegged stablecoin with a market cap of $83 billion.\n\nAnnouncing the latest mint, Tether\u2019s CTO Paolo Ardoino, explained that the tokens were minted for chain swap and not due to a rising interest in the purchase of digital assets. Chain swap refers to the process of sending digital assets (in this case USDT) from one blockchain network to another \u2013 bridging assets across multiple blockchains.\n\nAfter the mint, on-chain data showed that Tether\u2019s Treasury sent $750 million worth of USDT in a chain swap transaction to Binance. According to Arkham Intelligence, the popular blockchain analytical firm, the Tether Treasury sent the funds in three separate batches of $250 million transactions after an initial $10 test transaction.\n\nThe analytical firm later reported that of the $1 billion new tokens minted, only $146 million remains on the Ethereum blockchain as the others have been swapped for USDT on other chains.\n\nTradecurve (TCRV) Price Set to Hit $0.018\n\nAlong with the increasing dominance of Tether in the stablecoin sectors, Tradecurve has enjoyed increasing attention in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Tradecurve is building the first DeFi platform where its users will have the opportunity to trade both cryptocurrencies and derivatives (like stocks, forex, options, and commodities) from a single account.\n\nExperts are bullish that the price of Tradecurve (TCRV) could easily jump above its current $0.018 price because of the magnitude of the derivatives markets. The Bank for International Settlements reports that in June 2022, the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market rose to $632 trillion.\n\nThe bullish predictions for the price of Tradecurve come from the platform\u2019s potential to connect the crypto market with the global derivatives market.\n\nExperts believe the Tradecurve platform could rekindle interest in the DeFi space as crypto traders would no longer need to open more than one account to trade global financial instruments. As more traders enter into the Tradecurve ecosystem, experts predict that the price of TCRV could jump from $0.018 to as high as $1.5 by the end of 2023.\n\nFor more information about the Tradecurve presale:\n\nClick Here For Website\n\nClick Here To Buy TCRV Presale Tokens\n\nFollow Us Twitter\n\nJoin Our Community on Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Share:\n\nXRP price has increased 6% over the weekend, reversing some of the losses seen last week, once traders digested the contents of the Hinman documents.\n\nCrypto fund manager Thomas Kralow set a bullish target of $30 for XRP, citing the altcoin\u2019s potential for higher market activity.\n\nXRP has seen 200% gain in value against Bitcoin since the SEC filed its lawsuit against Ripple at the end of 2020.\n\nXRP price recovered over the weekend after the release of the Hinman documents led to a broad sell-off of Ripple\u2019s token last week, as increasing uncertainty on how these papers can help the payment giant in its lawsuit against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) weighed on the asset.\n\nThe token trades at $0.4870, early on Monday, up 5.8% from Friday\u2019s low of $0.4601, but still under the $0.53 region it moved before the release of the Hinman documents.\n\nSpeculation surrounding the release of the Hinman documents could push XRP price up to the $30 bullish target in the short term, Kralow Capital founder and manager Thomas Kralow says in an interview, few months ahead of a key ruling which is set to determine the fate of Ripple\u2019s token.\n\nThe release of Hinman documents on June 13, a key element in the legal battle between the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple, as well as the reaction of the company\u2019s legal team has fueled speculation among XRP holders. Moreover, some of altcoin's on-chain indicators show that XRP is undervalued at the current price, $0.4870 at the time of writing.\n\nAlso read: XRP losses mount as traders digest Hinman documents\n\nXRP gains 200% in value against Bitcoin\n\nXRP price has declined significantly from its June 13 peak of $0.5661. The altcoin wiped out its gains as holders digested the contents of Hinman documents release. XRP holders are awaiting a ruling in the SEC vs. Ripple case and the outcome could make or break the altcoin\u2019s price trend.\n\nHowever, XRP has gained 200% in value against Bitcoin since the SEC filed its lawsuit against Ripple at the end of 2020. This development fuels a bullish thesis for XRP price recovery and hints at likely bullish trend reversal in the asset in the short term.\n\nXRP/BTC price chart\n\nFrom a technical perspective, the next key support is at $0.4518, a level that represents its 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA).\n\nThe altcoin\u2019s price has sustained above the $0.4500 level for over a month. If recent history repeats, XRP is likely to experience a rebound and recover from support at $0.4518.\n\nCrypto fund manager sets $30 target for XRP price\n\nXRP price is largely influenced by the SEC lawsuit against payment giant Ripple. The XRP holder community therefore closely watches the updates to determine the direction in which the altcoin is headed.\n\nIn response to the release of the Hinman documents, the contents of which are key to Ripple\u2019s defense against the SEC, XRP price rallied to $0.5649 on Tuesday. However, XRP price has settled below $0.4853 since then, wiping out its weekly gains.\n\nFind out more about Hinman documents here.\n\nThe three main factors fueling speculative narratives for XRP are: contents of the Hinman documents \u2013 internal messages and email exchanges among executives of the agency \u2013, SEC former Director William Hinman\u2019s comments on Ethereum in his 2018 speech and the regulator\u2019s stance on XRP as a security.\n\nThomas Kralow, crypto hedge fund manager at Kralow Capital, said to FXStreet that these factors could fuel further speculation, driving XRP price higher within the next three to four months.\n\nKralow weighed in on the rising interest among crypto market participants. Based on data from Google trends, searches for XRP have doubled in the last month, signaling an increase in interest among traders worldwide.\n\nKrakow told FXStreet:\n\nCurrently, we observe huge speculative narratives around Ripple, which could potentially lead to a significant price increase for XRP in the next three to four months, pushing its value to anywhere between $10 and $30.\n\nOver the past thirty days, XRP price climbed 15.32%, from $0.4190 to $0.4832 on Binance. Data from Google trends reveals further potential for market activity, Kralow says, setting a bullish target of $30 per token within the next three to four months.\n\nThe manager and founder of Kralow Capital identified two factors that could make or break XRP\u2019s rally within the next three months.\n\nRipple\u2019s IPO: Ripple and its executives have shared their desire to take the payment remittance firm public from time to time during the lawsuit. Ripple\u2019s IPO could act as a key milestone and a bullish catalyst for XRP price given the token is native to the giant\u2019s XRPLedger.\n\nRipple\u2019s win against the SEC: Ripple\u2019s win against the SEC, or a settlement between the two parties, drawing the conclusion that XRP isn\u2019t a security could propel the altcoin to a new all-time high.\n\nAccording to crypto influencers and Ripple proponents closely following the lawsuit, a ruling is expected before September 30 this year. XRP holders could expect an increase in demand closer to the ruling.\n\nKralow set a minimum of $10 and a cap of $30 as price targets for XRP ahead of the ruling.\n\nOn-chain metric signals XRP is undervalued\n\nThe Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio is an on-chain metric that shows the ratio between the current price and the average price of a certain asset. The higher the MVRV ratio, the more profitable it is to sell the token at the current market price, giving an idea of how overvalued or undervalued an asset is.\n\nMVRV chart for XRP\n\nWith an MVRV ratio of -2.8% on Monday, XRP is undervalued at a price of $0.4870, implying there is bullish potential in XRP."

Thunderpick \u2013 Crypto Casino for Sports Betting\n\nThunderpick is another Ethereum online casino that comes with a strong portfolio of games.

Its casino section also comes with a huge selection of over 1,000 slot titles, as well as card and table games.\n\nHowever, Thunderpick\u2019s welcome is not as attractive as other Ethereum gambling sites in this space. For instance, although it rewards new players with a matched deposit bonus of 100%, this is only up to a maximum of \u20ac500.\n\nTo make up for this, Thunderpick has other giveaways for individual games. For instance, this casino site has weekly giveaways with cash prizes worth \u20ac8,000.\n\nPros\n\n? Large selection of sports and eSports betting games\n\n? Wide variety of casino games\n\nCons\n\n?

It allows players to place wagers on live and virtual sporting events using crypto.\n\nPlatforms such as BC.Game, Cloudbet, and Thunderpick support sports betting across a wide range of popular leagues and championships.\n\nCasino Gambling\n\nCasino games encompass varieties such as roulette, blackjack, baccarat, pachinko, and many others. All of the best Ethereum casino sites discussed today support this kind of casino game category.\n\nHowever, the varieties offered will vary from one platform to the next. BC.Game, for example, offers more than 2,700 games including slots and live table games such as poker and blackjack with real dealers.\n\nLottery Gambling\n\nMany new Ethereum gambing platforms have also started adding crypto lotteries to their offerings.\n\nUnlike the traditional kind, crypto lotteries are run based on blockchain technology, which means that the outcome is secured and provably fair.\n\nTo play, users can simply buy a ticket and choose their favorite numbers. And if the same numbers come up during the draw, the player will win a prize.\n\nPoker Gambling\n\nAlthough a card game based largely on skill, poker still falls under the category of gambling. And as such, there are many Ethereum gambling sites that feature video poker games.\n\nAdditionally, some Ethereum gambing platforms also host live poker tournaments.\n\nDice Gambling\n\nIn dice gambling games, players try to predict whether they will roll a number higher or lower than the previous one. In most cases, the best Ethereum gambling sites offer dice games that are backed by provably fair.\n\n>>>Play Now<<<\n\nHow we Select the Best Ethereum Gambling Sites\n\nWondering how we selected and ranked the best Ethereum gambling sites for this guide?\n\nRead on to learn about our methodology and what we look for in a crypto-centric casino site\n\nSecure Crypto Payments\n\nNeedless to say, security was our primary concern when choosing the top Ethereum betting platforms for this comparison guide.\n\nAll of the platforms we reviewed today offer secure payment options, not only for digital tokens such as Ethereum but also for fiat currency deposits.\n\nMoreover, when making crypto payments, users do not need to go through any KYC process \u2013 which can be an advantage for many.\n\nFast Deposits & Withdrawals\n\nWhen using an Ethereum casino, players can expect instant deposits, which is one of the main advantages when compared to traditional providers.\n\nPlayers can deposit cryptocurrencies using their digital wallet and can complete the transaction in a matter of minutes. All of the providers discussed today also process withdrawals swiftly.\n\nBC.Game has no withdrawal fees or limits, $1 deposits and ETH is paid in just five minutes.\n\nCrypto Bonuses & Promos\n\nAll the Ethereum online casinos we discussed on this page offer a variety of gambling bonuses. New players can expect a welcome bonus when they sign up on the platform.\n\nThis mostly comes in the form of a matched deposit bonus.\n\nIn addition to marching bonuses, players can also expect to receive free spins, poker chips, and even cash prizes when joining an Ethereum casino for the first time.\n\nLow Crypto Banking Fees\n\nFiat currency payments to an online casino will invariably come with charges. However, with cryptocurrencies, users only have to cover the network fee.\n\nThe providers we reviewed above do not charge any deposit fees to process cryptocurrency transactions.\n\nFair Deposit & Withdrawal Limits\n\nDeposits and withdrawal limits also change from one blockchain gambling site to another. We have ensured that our top picks allow players to get started at small amounts.\n\nFor instance, many Ethereum casino sites on our list require a minimum deposit of just $20. Similarly, we have also ensured low withdrawal limits, so that players can cash out their winnings easily.\n\nWide Range of Crypto Betting Markets\n\nThe selection of Dogecoin gambling sites we listed above do not limit their scope to a few generic games. Instead, they list a broad range of titles, from classic slots and table games to live dealers to sports betting markets.\n\nTop platforms continue to partner with leading game developers in order to expand their range of slots and live games. In other words, the best Ethereum gambling sites ensure that players are constantly engaged with new games and products.\n\nGood Betting Features & Resources\n\nApart from offering games, what other features can an Ethereum gambling site offer?\n\nWell, as we have covered in our earlier Ethereum casino reviews, a majority of these sites host tournaments and races, which offer players access to additional rewards.\n\nThis means that in addition to winning, players will get to unlock exclusive rewards \u2013 which could be in the form of cash prizes or free bets.\n\nIn addition to this, many online casinos have launched VIP programs to reward their most loyal customers \u2013 which is another incentive for players to stick with one provider.\n\n>>>Play Now<<<\n\nEthereum Gambling Bonuses\n\nFor those new to the crypto gambling space, it might be confusing to figure out which promotional offers are worth paying attention to.\n\nBelow, we provide a brief explanation of the most common types of bonuses offered by Ethereum gambling sites.\n\nDeposit Match Bonuses\n\nMatched deposit bonuses are the most popular types of reward offered by crypto casinos these days. Suppose a crypto casino offers a 150% matched deposit bonus.\n\nThis means that if a player deposits $1,000, they will start with a balance of $2,500. However, players will have to meet some wagering requirements in order to withdraw the bonus deposit.\n\nFree Bets\n\nFree bets are widely offered by Ethereum gambling platforms to draw in customers. These are typically found on platforms that facilitate sports and eSports betting. This way, players can place bets with free money.\n\nFree Spins\n\nEthereum gambling sites that support crypto slots might also offer free spins to their players. Simply put, players get a predetermined number of free spins that they can use on a certain slot game.\n\nPoker Chips\n\nLike free spins, chips enable players to bet on poker games without having to use their own cash. However, when using free chips, players might have to place a certain number of bets in order to be able to access their winnings.\n\nNo Deposit Bonuses\n\nSometimes, it is also possible to play online casino games without making any initial deposit. This feature is available on Ethereum casinos that offer no deposit bonuses.\n\nEssentially, this means that players receive a bonus simply for signing up on the platform to help them start placing bets right away.\n\nBear in mind that on some Ethereum gambling sites, users might need to enter a code when depositing funds to access these bonuses.\n\n>>>Play Now<<<\n\nWhat is the best Ethereum gambling site?\n\nWhile there are dozens of Ethereum gambling sites in the market today, we particularly like the looks of BC.Game. This Ethereum casino offers attractive bonuses, one of the largest selections of games and a sportsbook, fast payouts, and a great reputation for player safety.\n\nCan you gamble with Ethereum?\n\nEthereum is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies, second only to Bitcoin.

Refer to our comparison guide to find out more about the best Ethereum gambling sites of today.\n\nBest Ethereum Wallet for Gambling\n\nAs we noted above, it is incredibly easy for players to start betting with Ethereum, or any other cryptocurrency for that matter. The process simply requires the player to visit the chosen Ethereum casino website, create an account, and connect their digital wallet to make a deposit.\n\nHowever, this means that players will need to take care of two things before being able to bet with Ethereum \u2013 a secure crypto wallet and sufficient ETH tokens.\n\neToro is a platform that offers excellent features for cryptocurrency investors. It allows users to buy Ethereum from a minimum of $10 \u2013 with a debit/credit card, e-wallet, or bank wire. Moreover, the fee for buying cryptocurrencies is only 1%.\n\nAlthough investors will have to account for the spread, this is also highly competitive when compared to the market average. Crucially, eToro comes with its own digital wallet that can be used to store cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum.\n\neToro supports not only cryptocurrencies but also stocks, indices, ETFs, metals, and agricultural products. It is also regulated by the SEC, FCA, ASIC, and CySEC. We also like eToro for its exclusive features \u2013 such as Copy Trading and Smart Portfolios, which allow users to invest in different asset classes passively.\n\n>>>Buy Cryptos<<<\n\nConclusion \u2013 Best Ethereum Gambling Sites\n\nToday, there are plenty of choices for those who wish to use Ethereum for online gambling purposes.

The failure of bears to keep BTC below $25,000 likely attracted bullish investors aiming to initiate a recovery. Nevertheless, the overall trend still favours the bears. BTC's support is currently at $26,386, with resistance at $26,633. Similarly, Ethereum mirrored Bitcoin's performance and is currently trading above the $1,720 threshold.\"\n\nParth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead, CoinSwitch Ventures, said, \u201cCrypto markets traded in a tight range over the weekend, and in the last 24 hours. Global crypto market capitalisation is currently $1.11 trillion, down 0.1 percent. The crypto fear and index continued to stand below 50 for the last 10 days; currently at 47, down 2 points from yesterday. The fact that market capitalisation and BTC prices continue to remain above $1.1 trillion and $25,000, respectively, hints towards slight resilience building amongst investors after last week.\u201d\n\nRajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, offered his take, \"APAC is enticing digital asset businesses, with Hong Kong having released its latest set of regulations. The unchanged price hike by the US Fed could see Bitcoin\u2019s price go further down.\"\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, \u201cToday's Bitcoin price is $26,429.20 with a 24-hour trading volume of $9.67 billion. BTC is -0.15 percent in the last 24 hours. It is currently -1.56 percent away from its 7-day high of $26,848.12 and 6.14 percent away from its 7-day low of $24,900.76. Ethereum price today is $1,727.31 with a 24-hour trading volume of $3.88 billion. ETH is +0.09 percent in the last 24 hours. It is currently -1.91 percent away from its 7-day high of $1,760.91 and 6.06 percent away from its 7-day low of $1,628.66. The price of BNB today is $243.69 with a 24-hour trading volume of $374.73 million. BNB is -0.44 percent in the last 24 hours. It is currently -3.43 percent away from its 7-day high of $252.34 and 9.83% away from its 7-day low of $221.87.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, CEO, BuyUcoin, said, \"The crypto market remained flat during the last 24 hours as the rate hike pause by the US Fed failed to cheer the market. The interest rates are already high due to the continuous hike for almost a year and the market is expecting a rate cut which will spark economic activity and boost liquidity in the market. Over the last 24 hours, the crypto market volume reached $20.73 billion, marking a 12.36 percent decrease. Within this landscape, the DeFi sector stands strong with a total volume of $1.4 billion, accounting for 6.74 percent of the market's 24-hour volume.

        "title": "Inscriptions for NFT coming to Ethereum - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "Inscriptions are landing also on the Ethereum blockchain thanks to the launch of the \u201cEthscriptions\u201d protocol, which allows users to mint NFTs at a lower cost and in a more decentralized manner than classic data storage on smart contracts.\n\nThe new protocol, which was inspired by Ordinals, is seen by the community as a great innovation, but at the same time already obsolete.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at all the details together.\n\nA new way to create NFTs on Ethereum: the \u201cEthscriptions\u201d protocol\n\nFollowing the success of Ordinals on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, here come NFT inscriptions on Ethereum thanks to the \u201cEthscriptions\u201d protocol.\n\nThe new protocol, launched on 17 June by Tom Lehman , co-founder and former CEO of Genius.com, allows users to inscribe images less than 96KB in size on the Ethereum network, creating digital artifacts similar to NFTs.\n\nLehman, also known as Middlemarch on Twitter, announced that soon the functionality of \u201cEthscription\u201d will expand to allow the inscription of other file types.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/dumbnamenumbers/status/1669822912579223552\n\nThe process is based primarily on the use of Ethereum\u2019s \u201ccalldata,\u201d or the data within a call to a smart contract.\n\nThe advantage, compared to classical storage solutions directly on smart contracts, is a lower cost in terms of gas fees and greater decentralization.\n\nIn just under 18 hours since the protocol was launched, about 30,000 ethscriptions have been registered, a number that prompted Lehman to call it \u201ca real success.\u201d\n\nMany users expressed enthusiasm about an innovation that has attracted much interest among the community, while others did not like the fact that calldata has been utilized by Ethereum developers for several years already.\n\nits not new, people have been storing custom data/art in calldata since 2016, examples are Deafbeef, 0xmon, Eulerbeats..\n\n\n\nethscription functionally is worse than state data, ethereum is more composable at the token level\n\n\n\nbut i bought some out of spite of ordinals \u2014 Clouted (@CloutedMind) June 18, 2023\n\nIn addition, although no real smart contracts exist on Bitcoin yet, and Ordinalscriptions are a necessity for minting NFTs, there are better performing solutions using smart contracts on Ethereum.\n\nEthscriptions are therefore seen as already obsolete by one part of the community, while the other side claims the launch of the protocol as an alternative method for minting NFTs that will be a total game changer.\n\nMany users have embraced the idea of inscriptions on Ethereum to such an extent that they have temporarily blocked the API interface of the Ethscriptions website because of such a large volume in terms of traffic.\n\nData from the first NFT collections on Ethereum minted with \u201cEthscriptions\u201d\n\nThe Ethscriptions protocol immediately gained the attention of the web3 audience by recording a large amount of NFT minting on the Ethereum network.\n\nJust as the advent of Ordinals triggered a mad rush to find the yet-to-be-inscribed element on the Bitcoin blockchain, the same occurred with Ethereum with users rushing to create their own unique digital artifact.\n\nThe first collection that has been created through this innovative process is that of the \u201cEthereum Punks\u201d effectively recreating one of the most famous collections in NFT history, the \u201cCrypto Punks.\u201d\n\nThe floor price of the latest version of the Punks, being highly variable at this stage, ranges between 0.0099 and 0.015 ETH.\n\nAccording to data from Blur, a decentralized marketplace for exchanging non-fungible tokens, the Ethscriptions phenomenon captured a volume of 77.57 ETH in the last day.\n\nIf we instead consider the number of exchanges as of Saturday, the day the protocol was launched, this figure comes to 195.19 ETH.\n\nMost likely, given the frenzy seen on social media about this new fad, the trading volume will easily reach 1000 ETH in the coming days.\n\nFor now we can count 1237 owners of Ordinals-style digital artefacts on the Ethereum network, and an NFT supply of 3665 pieces.\n\nIt will be interesting to observe in the coming days whether more famous collections from the NFT world will be minted and whether this trend will continue for the next few months or die out in a few days.\n\nIn addition, after the first wave of inscriptions involving only image files, many expect to see more complex inscriptions.\n\nFor example, we may soon see experimentation with fungible tokens on the Ethereum network in the style of BRC-20, without the use of a smart contracts.\n\nWhile conceptually this may be decidedly interesting, it does not represent progress for the Ethereum ecosystem, but only a step backward from the functionality that the blockchain, described by Vitalik as a \u201cglobal computer for the world,\u201d can offer.\n\nMiddlemarch is not of the same opinion, who, excited about the launch of his protocol that guarantees the global uniqueness of the content of all valid Ethscriptions, mentioned in a tweet:\n\n\u201cthe protocol is skating to where the puck is going in an L2 world.\u201d\n\nHow are inscriptions on Bitcoin progressing?\n\nWhile Ethscriptions are starting to become popular in the world of NFTs on Ethereum, the universe of inscriptions on Bitcoin has already reached the height of its popularity.\n\nActivity on the Ordinals protocol of data on individual satoshis continues apace, so much so that some 222,000 inscriptions were registered yesterday.\n\nThe number, while higher than the average for the first few days of June, still results in a decrease in interest in the protocol compared to May, where a high of 400,000 inscriptions were reached in a single day.\n\nIn any case, there are still many users who use Ordinals on a daily basis, either to mint NFT-like digital artefacts or to create fungible tokens via the BRC-20 standard. Primarily, inscriptions are performed with text files (90.3%), and png images (5.3%)\n\nIn total, 12.8 million inscriptions have been executed as of February, which have \u201cgifted\u201d miners tx fees of 1745 BTC, equivalent to $46.1 million.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s mempool continues to have some minor difficulties in including transactions in blocks quickly given the pressure from users to the Ordinals protocol.\n\nRight now for example there are about 300 thousand transactions waiting to be confirmed and added to a new block.\n\nIt is interesting to note that although inscriptions continue to swarm the Bitcoin ecosystem, the fees paid to miners are dropping quite a bit compared to the early days of May.\n\nThese now represent about 3% of total miner revenue: a figure still higher than in the July 2022 \u2013 February 2023 period, but down sharply from the top of 42% recorded on 8 May 2023."

        "title": "Weekly Market Watch: Bitcoin & Ethereum Struggles, Altcoins On The Path To Recovery - TronWeekly",
        "content": "During the past week, the cryptocurrency market witnessed a downturn characterized by a bearish trend. However, as the week drew to a close, the bullish momentum began to overpower the bears, resulting in a positive turn to conclude the week. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum managed to regain some of their value.\n\nLast week, there was a notable market crash caused by a slight deviation of Tether\u2019s USDT from its pegged value to the United States dollar. Interestingly, this event occurred simultaneously with the New York Attorney General\u2019s Office releasing substantial information to CoinDesk.\n\nIn the midst of these developments, Bakkt, a company listed on the New York Stock Exchange, decided to delist prominent altcoins Solana, Polygon, and Cardano due to regulatory uncertainties.\n\nAltcoins, the alternative cryptocurrencies, experienced a significant decline on the weekly chart, but only for a short duration. However, towards the end of the week, they were able to recover some of the losses, although a few still showed negative trends on both the weekly and daily charts.\n\nKuCoin Token (KCS) is at the top of the list of 60 altcoins experiencing significant gains this week, followed by Uniswap (UNI) and Maker (MKR), second and third place, respectively.\n\nKuCoin Token (KCS) experienced a notable increase of 22% over the course of the past seven days; however, it has managed to make a slight recovery, according to the daily chart. As of now, KCS is being traded at $7.23, reflecting a 0.15% rise within the last 24 hours.\n\nSource: CoinMarketcap\n\nThe rise can be attributed to the announcement that IMVU, a digital veteran, launched a new metaverse product on KuCoin Spotlight. KuCoin users can get VCORE allocations by holding KCS.\n\nKuCoin Spotlight is a platform to support promising crypto projects through early token purchases. Previous participants include Lukso (LYXe), Chromia (CHR), and Sui Network (SUI).\n\nMeanwhile, Uniswap (UNI) is also gaining attention as a second weekly gainer. Over the past week, UNI has experienced a significant gain of approximately 11%.\n\nCurrently, UNI is trading at $4.48, reaching a high of $4.6599 and closing the week at $4.4780 after starting the week at $4.0565. These figures indicate a notable downturn in performance.\n\nSource: CoinMarketcap\n\nIn the last 24 hours, the token has experienced a 0.87% decrease, while its trading volume has also decreased by 16.99% in the same time period.\n\nThe price surge can be attributed to the news that Uniswap Labs has unveiled the code draft for Uniswap v4, introducing custom liquidity pools through \u201chooks.\u201d This decentralized crypto exchange is the biggest in terms of volume and recently launched v3 on May 4, 2021.\n\nThe upcoming v4 will enable developers to implement on-chain limit orders, automatic deposits to lending protocols, auto-compounded LP fees, and other innovations.\n\nAdditionally, Maker (MKR) has also gained significant attention due to its weekly performance and notable increase of about 10%.\n\nSource: CoinMarketcap\n\nMoreover, some popular coins are experiencing gains in weekly charts, including SHIB at 9%, ICP at 9%, and FIL, with an increase of 7.96%, according to the data from CoinMarketcap.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) & Ethereum (ETH) Weekly Review\n\nDuring the preceding week, Bitcoin, the well-known digital currency, experienced a significant drop as it reached a critical support level of approximately $24,700. This occurrence sparked worries among investors and market watchers. Nevertheless, Bitcoin remained confined to a narrow trading range throughout the week.\n\nSource: CoinMarketcap\n\nIn the past week, the analytics firm Santiment has reported that the exchange supply of Bitcoin has reached its lowest point since February 2018. This decline can be attributed to traders opting to move their Bitcoin holdings to self-custody amidst the ongoing uncertainty surrounding major platforms such as Binance and Coinbase.\n\nThe prevailing trend of transferring Bitcoin to personal wallets is expected to persist as long as the legal actions initiated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) remain unresolved.\n\nSimilarly, Ethereum, another prominent cryptocurrency, experienced a tight range of trading similar to Bitcoin. The price of Ethereum dropped to a low point of $1,624.14, causing concern among investors and traders.\n\nSource: CoinMarketcap\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin is currently trading at $26,376.51, with a 1.90% increase over the past seven days and a 0.33% decrease in the past 24 hours. On the other hand, ETH is being traded at $1,723.63, experiencing a 0.02% decrease in the past 24 hours and 1.36% over the past seven days.\n\nRelated Reading | USDT, TUSD, and DJED Holders Moving Capital To Innovative InQubeta Presale"

        "content": "To enhance efficiency and address operational challenges faced by larger node operators, Ethereum\u2019s core developers are engaged in a heated debate over increasing the validator balance limit.\n\nCurrently, validators are restricted to holding a maximum of 32 ETH, but proponents argue that raising the threshold to 2,048 ETH would offer numerous advantages for the network.\n\nThe existing limit was initially implemented to promote decentralization. However, it has inadvertently led to an exponential growth in the number of validators. With over 600,000 validators currently online and an additional 90,000 waiting to be activated, the strain on the network is becoming apparent.\n\nMichael Neuder, a prominent researcher and advocate for the proposed modification, asserts that increasing the validator limit would curb the active validator set\u2019s explosive growth and expedite the network\u2019s ability to reach finality within a single Ethereum slot. By allowing validators to accumulate more significant amounts of ETH, the proposed change would pave the way for auto-compounding validator awards.\n\nAny rewards exceeding 32 ETH must be redistributed before staking profits can be realized. However, removing and increasing the limit would enable validators to compound their earnings, maximizing their staking returns rapidly.\n\nThe adjustment would particularly benefit major node operators like exchanges, Coinbase being a notable example, who currently manage tens of thousands of validators due to the 32 ETH limit per validator.\n\nBy increasing the maximum effective validator balance, these operators could streamline their operations and handle fewer validators with more enormous stakes, reducing complexity and resource requirements.\n\nWhile the proposal presents enticing prospects, Neuder also warns of potential risks, such as heightened penalties for inadvertent multiple attestations or proposals, commonly called \u201cslashing.\u201d Striking a delicate balance between facilitating efficiency and maintaining network security is a critical challenge that the Ethereum core developers must navigate.\n\nThe debate surrounding the increase in the validator balance limit continues to gain momentum. To gather insights and opinions from the broader Ethereum community, the core developers have extended the discussion to social media platforms like ETHMagicians and Discord.\n\nAs stakeholders eagerly await a consensus, the potential impact of this decision on Ethereum\u2019s future and its ongoing transition to a proof-of-stake mechanism remains a topic of great interest and speculation."

        "content": "Home \u00bb Ethereum How Long Does it Take to Send Ethereum? EthereumJournal How Long Does it Take to Send Ethereum? Torsten Hartmann\n\nEthereum has established itself as a cornerstone of the crypto market. One of the most frequently asked questions by both new and seasoned investors alike is, \u2018how long does an Ethereum transaction take?\u2019 The answer, as with many things in the crypto world, is not as straightforward as one might hope.\n\nEthereum transaction time can vary significantly depending on several factors. Whether you\u2019re transferring ETH between wallets or from your wallet to an exchange, the time can range from a few seconds to several minutes. The type of wallet you\u2019re using, the current network congestion, and the number of confirmations required by the receiving platform all play a role in the ETH transfer time.\n\nIn this article, we delve into the intricacies of Ethereum transactions, providing you with a comprehensive understanding of what influences the speed of ETH transfers. We\u2019ll explore the difference between hot and cold wallets, the concept of \u2018gas\u2019 in the Ethereum network, and how network congestion can impact your transaction time. This article will serve as a guide to comprehending the factors that determine how long an ETH transfer takes. So, let\u2019s dive into the world of Ethereum and demystify the process behind ETH transaction times.\u201d\n\nQuick summary \ud83d\udcda Topic \ud83d\udcdd Summary \ud83d\udd52 Ethereum Transfer Time Depending on the type of transaction and the state of the network, Ethereum transfers can take anywhere from 15 seconds to 5 minutes. Factors such as network congestion, gas price, and the type of wallet (hot or cold) can influence the transfer time. \ud83d\udd04 Wallet to Wallet Transfer Wallet to wallet transfer times can vary. If the coins are already online, then transfer times to another wallet are reasonably fast, taking anywhere between 16 seconds to 5 minutes. Transferring coins from a cold wallet will take slightly longer due to additional security measures. \ud83d\udcb1 Wallet to Exchange Transfer Transfers to exchanges can take longer than a wallet to wallet transfer because exchange platforms often require more confirmations for the transaction to be completed. This adds more security and protects the exchange from double spending. \ud83d\udcdd Confirmations in Ethereum Network When you send Ethereum from one wallet address to another, you submit a transaction to the Ethereum blockchain. The transaction is then added to the blockchain by miners (or validators). Before the Ethereum appears in the other wallet, it has to complete a set number of confirmations. More confirmations mean a greater chance your transaction is done and irreversible. \ud83c\udfe6 Transfer ETH to Bank Account Transferring Ether tokens from a wallet to an exchange like Coinbase should take around 10 mins, given that Coinbase requires 30 confirmations. The next step is to sell your ETH on Coinbase for fiat. You can then withdraw the cash to your bank account. This transfer time will depend on the exchange platform you are using. Some platforms will allow you to make an instant withdrawal, whereas some will take 3-5 business days to send the money. \ud83d\udcb0 Ethereum Transfer Fees Each Ethereum transfer requires what is known as gas, paid in ETH. These gas fees help keep the Ethereum network safe and secure. Transaction fees prevent spam on the network and increase the speed of legitimate transactions. \ud83d\ude80 Ethereum 2.0 Impact The upcoming Ethereum 2.0 upgrade is expected to improve transaction speeds significantly. It will transition from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism, which is expected to increase the speed capability from 13-15 transactions per second (TPS) to an estimated 100 TPS.\n\nHow Long Does it Take to Transfer Ethereum from One Wallet to Another?\n\nWallet to wallet transfer times can vary depending on if you\u2019re using a hot wallet (Online Wallet) or a cold wallet (Offline Wallet).\n\nIf your coins are already online, then transfer times to another wallet are reasonably fast.\n\nTransfer times will differ depending on how many confirmations the transaction requires; transferring Ether from one hot wallet to another will take anywhere between 16 seconds to 5 minutes.\n\nTransferring coins from a cold wallet will take slightly longer as you will need to deal with the additional security required to complete a transfer.\n\nHow Long Does it Take to Transfer Ethereum from Wallet to Exchange and Vice Versa?\n\nTransfers to exchanges can take a little longer than a wallet to wallet transfer; this is because exchange platforms often require more confirmations for the transaction to be completed; this adds more security and protects the exchange from double spend\n\nWhat are Confirmations?\n\nWhen you send Ethereum from one wallet address to another, you submit a transaction to the Ethereum blockchain. The transaction is then added to the Blockchainblockchain by miners (or validators).\n\nBefore the Ethereum appears in the other wallet, it has to complete a set number of confirmations; the number of confirmations required can differ depending on where you are sending your Ether.\n\nYour transaction is said to have completed one confirmation after it adds to the blockchain. Each additional block added after the initial confirmation is a further confirmation for your transaction.\n\nMore confirmations mean, the greater the chance your transaction is done and irreversible.\n\nBlockchain confirmations are essential as they are a way of verifying information that will then become permanent. If a transaction is fraudulent, the blockchain will not accept it: zero blockchain confirmations means zero transactions.\n\nHow Long Do Confirmations Take?\n\nConfirmations on the Ethereum blockchain take around 16 seconds. For an up to date, figure see here, which shows the average confirmation time over the last x figure.\n\nRead also:\n\nHow Long Does it Take to Transfer ETH to My Bank Account?\n\nAgain, it depends on several factors.\n\nFor starters, whether you\u2019re using a cold or a hot wallet.\n\nUsing a cold wallet will take longer as you need to complete additional security measures in order to transfer your coins online.\n\nSay, if you want to transfer ETH from your wallet to Coinbase to sell it, the transaction speed will depend on how many confirmations Coinbase requires the transaction to complete.\n\nCoinbase requires 30 confirmations. This means transferring Ether tokens from a wallet to Coinbase should take around 10 mins.\n\nThe next step is to sell your Eth on Coinbase for fiat. You can then withdraw the cash to your bank account. This Eth transfer time will depend on the exchange platform you are using, some exchange platforms will allow you to make an instant withdrawal, whereas some will take 3-5 business days to send the money.\n\nAre There Any Fees?\n\nThere are fees with Eth transfers. Each transfer requires what is known as gas, pay a small amount of Ether to make a transaction.\n\nGas fees help keep the Ethereum network safe and secure. Transaction fees prevent spam on the network and increase the speed of legitimate transactions.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo summarize, Ethereum transactions are generally quite fast; however, the actual transaction time will vary depending on where you are sending your Ether.\n\nAll Ethereum transactions require a set number of confirmations before the transaction is completed. The more confirmations required, the longer the transaction will take. The good news is that confirmations on the Ethereum network take only around 16 seconds, so most transfers will be completed in just a few minutes.\n\nFor users wishing to sell their Ethereum for cash in their bank account, wait times are typically longer and can be anywhere from a few minutes to 5 days, depending on which exchange platform is used"

        "title": "Proposal Seeks Ethereum Validator Balance to Reach 2048 ETH - The Coin Republic",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) network went through its highly anticipated Merge upgrade in September last year. The transition from proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake (PoS) was among the biggest upgrades across the crypto and blockchain industry. Following the update, the Ethereum network validators were bound to stake an amount of 32 ETH. Now, the maximum validator balance is said to go up to 2,048 ETH.\n\nIncreasing Upper Cap to Help Ethereum Validators\n\nIn an Ethereum Core Developers Consensus Meeting which took place on Friday, June 16, the proposal was pushed forward. As per the proposal, core developers are considering to increase the maximum validator fees ceiling to 2,048 ETH maximum. At present, one needs to stake at least 32 ETH minimum and maximum, in order to become a validator over the smart contract blockchain network.\n\nResearcher at Ethereum Foundation, who also happens to act as one among to propose the change over network, Michael Neuder, stated the current limitation of validator fees as an upper cap will result in inflation of the set of validators.\n\nPushing the validator staking amount ceiling will result in the expanding set of active validators. It will lead to improved efficiency of the network when the block finally would take in a single slot over the Ethereum network.\n\nThough the lower threshold helps the network to remain decentralized given the maximum participation of validators, the large-scale validators face some difficulties. Currently, the large-scale operations need to employ multiple validators in order to raise maximum yields. Large-scale validators, willing to earn more yield by staking more ETH, can get a chance to scale up their earning by lining up their multiple validators to the minimum.\n\nThe certain and lower staking amount resulted in a significant number of validators over the network. Over 600,000 active validators are there on the network, while approx 90,000 more are in the queue waiting to take active participation in the validating transaction process.\n\nConcerns Around Lifting the Staking Limit\n\nValidator rewards are also expected to get better with the auto-compounding. Rewards more than the limit of 32 ETH used to redirect and generate staking yield. However, with the limit to raise to the bigger number, the cap to get raised, the said rewards could get compounded and validators will have an option to to earn more.\n\nLarger validator node operators like Coinbase, have to carry out operations while keeping thousands of validators to hit their goal. The heightened ceiling would help in keeping the high stake validators in minimum number of them,\n\nHowever, the plan is not perfect and fool-proof. It also has shortcomings. On the flip side of maximum profits, the penalties on mistakes like double attestation, during validation of transaction, would also rise. The discussion is still on the proposal yet to see the signals for further developments."

This is a high-risk investment, you shouldn\u2019t expect to be protected if something goes wrong.\n\nJoin Our Telegram channel to stay up to date on breaking news coverage\n\nEthereum\u2019s developers plan to increase the minimum amount of staked Ether required to become a validator by 64 times its original value.\n\nAccording to the proposal, validators will hold a minimum of 2048 ETH tokens as opposed to the current value of 32 ETH. Ethereum migrated from the more energy-intensive Proof-of-Work to a Proof-of-Stake mechanism in 2022 during the Ethereum Merge.\n\nThis upgrade introduced validators to replace miners in confirming and securing transactions while staking a minimum of 32 ETH. However, this new proposal will likely meet mixed reactions from the current validators on the network due to its increased requirements.\n\nEthereum Validators Propose Hike In Validator Fees\n\nEthereum core developers made this proposal on June 15 in a consensus meeting with Ethereum Foundation researcher Micheal Neuder.\n\nNeuder stated that the current limit of 32 ETH creates more inclusivity in Ethereum\u2019s validators and makes the network more decentralized.\n\nHowever, its leads to inflation in the number of validators on the network. He believes that a large increase in the ETH tokens required will improve Ethereum Network\u2019s efficiency over time.\n\nAlso, Neuer advocated for the auto-compounding of validator rewards. He believes this feature will enable validators to earn more rewards on their staked ETH tokens.\n\nTo generate any staking income, rewards received that exceed the current limit of 32 ETH must move to another account. Neuder stated that raising the benchmark for validators will lead to rapid compounding of rewards.\n\nAdditionally, Neuder believes the current proposal will benefit large node operators like exchanges that currently manage numerous validators. However, this proposal received mixed reactions from the crypto community as they believe it will make the network more centralized.\n\nA centralized network will ultimately defeat the core principles of cryptocurrency, which is a largely decentralized, anonymous, and scalable network.\n\nThe recent developments on Ethereum\u2019s network could be boosting its current price recovery as it increased from the $1,600 price level on June 14 to $1,700 on June 15, where it currently trades.\n\nJP Morgan Analyses Impact Of Hinman\u2019s Documents On Ethereum\u2019s Price\n\nIn a new development, JP Morgan shared insights on the recently released Hinman documents and their impact on Ethereum\u2019s price.\n\nDespite the US. Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) Efforts to keep the documents hidden, they were finally released to the public view. The documents revealed that William Hinman, in his now infamous speech in 2018, stated that Ether did not fall under securities.\n\nJP Morgan believes these recent developments will reshape the crypto landscape and align other projects with Ethereum\u2019s operating model.\n\nFurthermore, he stated that this action would elevate Ether in the crypto market and shield the project from unnecessary regulatory pressure. Ethereum still retains its second-ranked position in the crypto market behind market leader Bitcoin.\n\nRead more:"

        "content": "To boost the rally, the Ethereum ecosystem is expanding its reach in the Web3 gaming industry and NFT sector, voyaging through uncharted territory. The second biggest blockchain is making strides with significant development in gaming protocols. Also, an increase in gas fees and added interest in Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) could play a major role.\n\nEthereum Voyaging Through Uncharted Waters\n\nIn 2023, ETH price surged nearly 80% from $1,191.00 to $2,147.47 during the time of the Shapella upgrade. But it slides down by 19.47% to its current value of $1,728.11. Despite this volatility, ETH\u2019s comeback could be fueled by the flourishing gaming sector.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) made some announcements that negatively impacted Ether\u2019s price. But a general deviation towards gaming has the potential to instill positive sentiments and help reclaim the previous high price values.\n\nAlso, gaming protocols like Axie Infinity (AXS), and The Sandbox (SAND) along with their project tokens, SAND, CHZ, AXIE, and ENJ are experiencing noticeable growth on the blockchain. It was reported in a tweet earlier.\n\nDespite the market volatility, gaming tokens have seen a significant increase in the number of active addresses over the last 7 days.\n\n\n\nGaming on $ETH saw the largest week-over-week increase, with social project tokens such as $SAND, $ENJ, $CHZ, and $AXIE leading. pic.twitter.com/RIBkQlIBT6 \u2014 Artemis \ud83c\udff9 (@Artemis__xyz) June 15, 2023\n\nThe increase in gaming activity resulted in a subsequent rise in unique active wallets for these decentralized applications (dApps). The eventual result of the surge was a positive impact on transactions and overall network volume. If the scenario continues for some time, the ETH value could rise.\n\nAt press time, Ether is trading at $1,728.11 with a gain of 0.88% in the last 24 hours and a drop of 1.20% in the last 7 days. Its value against Bitcoin suffered by 0.52% to 0.06525 BTC. Market cap corrected by 0.91% to $207 Billion, and trading volume fell by 48.43% to $3.63 Billion. Ranking at number 2, ETH shares a market dominance of 19.44%.\n\nThe surge in gaming activity caused a rise in gas usage on the Ethereum network. An increase in gas usage proves to be beneficial for the blockchain, as it showcases increased network activity along with demand for dApps. In turn, it secures the network\u2019s utility and value proposition.\n\nBlockchain NFT arm is also witnessing a surge in interest, as the number of NFT trades on the network skyrocketed. The driving force for this surge is the newly minted collections. Also, a noticeable decline was reported in the volume of blue-chip NFT collections like MAYC, Azuki, and BAYC.\n\nAlong with these NFT fanatics, the number of validators on the blockchain also increased significantly. Data suggest that the number swelled by 7.09% in the last 30 days. However, the revenue generation expected from these validators suffered a decline of 46.35% in a similar time-lapse.\n\nThe sentiments regarding ETH are broadly negative, as 52.02% of the traders took a short position. It is pointing towards the underlying bearish sentiment among the traders.\n\nSource: TradingView; ETH/TetherUSD\n\nThe current price coincides with EMA, but a weak RSI indicates price correction. If the price falls, before entering the demand zone, it might bounce off immediate support. For a northbound journey, the ETH price would have to first fight immediate resistance before entering the Supply zone.\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nThe views and opinions stated by the author, or any people named in this article, are for informational purposes only, and they do not establish financial, investment, or other advice.

        "content": "On June 19, Etherscan, a popular Ethereum block explorer and analytics platform, unveiled a new tool called \u201cCode Reader,\u201d which leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to extract and interpret the source code of a specific contract address. By utilizing OpenAI\u2019s large language model (LLM), Code Reader generates comprehensive responses, offering valuable insights into the contract\u2019s source code files. The developers at Etherscan emphasized that to utilize the tool, users must possess a valid OpenAI API Key and have sufficient OpenAI usage limits, assuring that the tool does not store users\u2019 API keys.\n\n\u201cTo use the tool, you need a valid OpenAI API Key and sufficient OpenAI usage limits. This tool does not store your API keys.\u201d\n\nCode Reader presents numerous use cases that benefit users seeking a deeper understanding of smart contract code through AI-generated explanations. The tool enables users to obtain extensive lists of functions associated with Ethereum data, facilitating a comprehensive comprehension of how the underlying contract interacts with decentralized applications (dApps). Once the contract files are retrieved, users have the option to choose a specific source code file to peruse. Moreover, the tool permits users to modify the source code directly within the user interface before sharing it with the AI, empowering them to experiment and iterate on the code effectively.\n\nEtherscan vs AI\n\nAs the field of AI continues to experience exponential growth, some experts have raised concerns about the feasibility of current AI models. In a recent report published by Singaporean venture capital firm Foresight Ventures, it was suggested that computing power resources would be a pivotal battleground in the coming decade. While there is a rising demand for training large AI models within decentralized distributed computing power networks, researchers have identified significant constraints that hinder their development. These challenges include complex data synchronization, network optimization, and concerns regarding data privacy and security.\n\nForesight Ventures highlighted a specific example to illustrate the limitations faced by large AI models. The report stated that training a model with a staggering 175 billion parameters, utilizing single-precision floating-point representation, would necessitate approximately 700 gigabytes of storage. However, distributed training mandates frequent transmission and updates of these parameters between computing nodes.\n\nIn a scenario involving 100 computing nodes, with each node requiring updates to all parameters at each unit step, the model would demand the transmission of a colossal 70 terabytes of data per second. This requirement far surpasses the capacity of most existing networks, illustrating the immense challenges in implementing distributed training for large AI models.\n\n\u201cIn most scenarios, small AI models are still a more feasible choice, and should not be overlooked too early in the tide of FOMO on large models.\u201d\n\nIn light of these constraints, researchers suggest that in many scenarios, smaller AI models remain a more viable choice. It is crucial not to overlook the potential of smaller models amidst the current frenzy surrounding large models. As the AI landscape evolves, advancements in computing power and network infrastructure will likely address some of these limitations. Nonetheless, for the time being, smaller AI models can still deliver substantial value and should not be prematurely dismissed in the pursuit of larger, more complex models."
