        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Is Ethereum a Good Investment? - Macrohive",
        "content": "[Updated 16 May 2023]\n\nSummary\n\nWe look at the latest ethereum trends, including macro risks and on-chain/flow metrics, to reveal the best time to buy ethereum and the risks of buying ETH.\n\nFor trading ethereum over the next two to four weeks, we are slightly bearish. That means we expect prices to either stay the same or fall, with more chance they will fall.\n\nHowever, we think ethereum is a good long-term investment for the next one to three years and are bullish overall. That means we expect prices to rise in the long term.\n\nIs Now a Good Time to Buy Ethereum?\n\nEthereum is currently amid a cumulative drawdown of around 62% since the November 2021 all-time high of $4,891 and is trading at around $1,820. However, the last six months have been more positive, with ethereum up 49%.\n\nOne of the main drivers of ethereum price rises is the market\u2019s hope that the Federal Reserve has finished hiking interest rates. However, we think the Fed is not done with its aggressive hiking cycle, and recession risks are increasing.\n\nConsequently, the macro backdrop for ethereum is bearish. We analyse various on-chain/flow metrics for ethereum, which are neutral. Overall, we are neutral to bearish on ETH in the short term. Therefore, if you have a two-to-four-week horizon, now may not be a good time to buy ethereum.\n\nShould I buy ethereum? Probably not\n\nWhy Has the ETH Price Risen Recently?\n\nReasons for the Current ETH Price (Short-Term View)\n\nCrypto markets surged this year after the FDIC announced it would back all deposits at Silicon Valley Bank. This move follows the Silvergate Capital collapse and has calmed fears of a potential bank run across the US. As a result, ethereum and the wider crypto market are rallying.\n\nAlso helping the ethereum price is the market\u2019s hope that the Federal Reserve has finished hiking interest rates. After one of the most aggressive hiking campaigns in decades, the Fed seems to have finally got inflation under control. After peaking at 9.1% in June 2022, headline inflation has fallen steadily to 4.9%.\n\nHiking interest rates is a contractionary monetary policy that increases the cost of borrowing, reduces demand, and is generally negative for risk assets such as stocks and crypto. It also increases the risk of recession. However, if the Fed starts easing rates, as markets currently expect for 2023, risk assets like ethereum may benefit.\n\nThe chart below shows the latest ETH price.\n\nPrevious reasons for bullishness towards ethereum included the merge, ETH\u2019s upgrade to proof-of-stake. In a previous ethereum update, we discussed the implications of the merge. The punchline was it would be bullish for these reasons:\n\nValidators can earn yield on staked ETH post merge.\n\nFaster transactions.\n\nNet issuance is projected to drop considerably post merge, constraining supply.\n\nEthereum may become deflationary.\n\nIncreased scalability and security.\n\nBetter for the environment thanks to proof of stake not work.\n\nHowever, ethereum and the broader crypto space have been unable to escape the longer-term bearish macro backdrop. We discuss that next.\n\nLike these insights? Join our free newsletter for regular updates and trade ideas. Want to receive our latest macro and financial market updates?

The main reason for the fall going into 2023 was the Federal Reserve\u2019s response to inflation. It has hiked interest rates an aggressive 500 basis points in this cycle, and this contractionary monetary policy tends to impact risk assets such as crypto negatively.\n\nMarkets seem to think the Fed is done hiking and has conquered inflation. However, April CPI showed no incremental progress on disinflation. Here are some of our main takeaways:\n\nA large increase in used car prices offset slower inflation in other categories.\n\nThe ongoing recovery in rental indices suggests that progress on shelter cost inflation may be transitory.\n\nApril core goods inflation rose to 0.6% due to a 4.4% increase in used car prices, which is converging to Manheim used car auction results, indicating further upside.\n\nMarkets continue to under-price the Fed. The labour market remains very tight, inflation is well above target, and \u2018the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go.\u2019 Markets are currently assigning just a 5% chance of a 25bp June FOMC hike. In our view, markets are under-pricing the risk of a hike and if current inflation and growth dynamics continue, a 25bp hike in June is likely (barring a debt ceiling crisis), which would be bearish for crypto.\n\nHow Interest Rates Affect Crypto\n\nYears of low interest rates since the global financial crisis in 2008 had seen markets reach extreme valuations by the end of 2021. Who cares if tech companies are loss-making if the companies can borrow easily? And if companies cannot borrow money, they can attract capital from investors, who themselves have likely borrowed money.\n\nCrypto markets have not been immune to the support from cheap leverage in the fiat markets. After all, crypto offers the tech dream of scalability and regulatory arbitrage. And if there was any doubt that crypto was not benefiting from low interest rates, the recent declines in crypto as US rates have risen should remove it.\n\nFurthermore, the correlation of ethereum to NASDAQ started to increase sharply just as US interest rates started to rise. This is a common occurrence throughout history. When the liquidity tap turns off, usually by central banks raising rates, the correlation between diverse assets shoots up. This time appears no different.\n\nThe bottom line is that the macro backdrop for crypto remains bearish on rate hikes and inflation. The probability of recession remains high at 80%, and we expect the Fed to hike more than markets are pricing in.\n\nHow Low Can Ethereum Prices Go?\n\nOne exercise is to see how low prices could get were the NASDAQ to suffer a 2000-style crash. After all, the ethereum and NASDAQ correlation was around 80% until recently. So where the NASDAQ goes, ethereum follows.\n\nBack in 2000, the NASDAQ suffered a 78% drawdown. Currently, the NASDAQ is in a 30% drawdown. A repeat of the 2000-style drawdown would put the NASDAQ at 3,500. So where would crypto be if NASDAQ were trading at this level? We estimate a regression between ethereum/bitcoin returns and NASDAQ returns from 2020 onwards. Based on this relationship, we find:\n\nBitcoin prices would reach $8,254 if the NASDAQ fell to 3,500. This implies a 72% decline from current levels.\n\nEthereum prices would reach $143 if the NASDAQ fell to 3,500. This implies a 92% decline from current levels.\n\nHow High Can Ethereum Go?\n\nShould the currently restrictive environment of rising interest rates and recession risks subside, we could see ethereum return to its all-time high of $4,379 or even beyond. However, we caution that this scenario is unlikely in the short term and, like with any investment, it is impossible to say with certainty how high ethereum will go.\n\nWhat Else Is Happening in Crypto?\n\nRegulation also is becoming more of a theme throughout 2023, with various executive orders signed already. Increased regulation should mean less uncertainty around crypto markets for investors, which would be bullish.\n\nOn the flip side, overregulation could stifle innovation by increasing censorship. The ongoing regulatory backdrop will be key to monitor. Lastly, on ethereum specifically, there is the much-anticipated merge. We previously covered its potential implications. The punchline was that it should be bullish for ethereum.\n\nCrypto News Impacting the ETH Price\n\nRising yields have mechanically increased the probability of a recession within the next 12 months to over 80%.\n\nhave mechanically increased the probability of a recession within the next 12 months to over 80%.

The Department of Justice (DOJ) is targeting crypto companies that engage in crimes themselves or allow crimes like money laundering to happen.\n\nSummary of ETH Analysis\n\nThe bottom line is that crypto, including ethereum, will remain under pressure. The main near-term support would be Fed dovishness rather than any crypto-specific dynamics. While this is possible, persistent inflation and a roaring economy make it unlikely. And for long-term investors, we still think some allocation to crypto makes sense \u2013 just like an allocation to equities also makes sense. But be prepared for weakness in 2022-3.\n\nFor all our latest analysis on crypto markets, click here.\n\nEthereum and Crypto Price Trackers\n\nUpdated 12 May 2023\n\nThis week, all our indices are in the red, with our Bitcoin Index (-6.3% WoW) down the least and our Metaverse Index (-15.6% WoW) down the most (Chart 2).\n\nOur Smart Contract Index remains most correlated to our Bitcoin Index (+87%).

With the length of the blockchain continuing to grow and decentralised finance (DeFi) gaining ground over traditional finance, this new asset class is reshaping the investment landscape.\n\nWe think ethereum is a worthwhile long-term investment. However, we also note that ethereum is extremely volatile. That means it experiences large price movements over short periods. Before you invest in ETH, you must understand the risks involved: you could lose all or a large portion of your investment. Never invest money that you cannot afford to lose.\n\nHow to Make Money Investing in Ethereum\n\nIt is easy to get carried away with the fear of missing out. You are probably aware of Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who are reputed to be the world\u2019s first bitcoin billionaires with over 100,000 coins. Or what about Barry Silbert, the owner of Grayscale Ethereum Trust, Coinbase and Coinbase? Success stories like these often give people FOMO \u2013 or the fear of missing out \u2013 if they do not invest immediately.\n\nHowever, to invest in cryptocurrency, we must first understand it. Crypto tokens are unlike any traditional asset class. And they are all different. Just because you understand bitcoin, does not mean you know how ethereum works. Our video on bitcoin and ethereum fundamentals can help you understand how ethereum prices fluctuate and how to assess trends in important ethereum metrics. And the video below explains other cryptocurrencies that might put ethereum at risk.\n\nEach currency has different underlying protocols and technology. That impacts how they trade, their volatility, and how you can value them. Some are more like stocks, others commodities, and others currencies. And each crypto token has a unique structure of supply.\n\nWe think crypto markets are a worthwhile long-term investment. The technology can capture market share on some existing markets like payments and stock trading while creating new markets like valuable scarce digital assets.\n\nBuying the Dip\n\nYour exposure to ethereum needs to be appropriately sized so that you can survive 50% to 80% drawdowns. Drawdowns provide good entry levels for exposure, but we would not go max long in an environment of rising central bank rates and falling global growth momentum.\n\nTop 3 Tips You Need to Know Before Investing in Ethereum\n\nWhere to Buy Ethereum\n\nTo buy ethereum (ETH) or any other cryptocurrency, you need access to a crypto exchange. A crypto exchange is where buyers and sellers meet to exchange money for coins, coins for other coins, and coins for money. Many options are available such as Coinbase, Binance.com, or eToro \u2013 each come with various fee structures, so research which is best for your needs.\n\nYou also need access to a crypto wallet to store ethereum and other cryptocurrencies. Many exchanges provide these, but not all do. You can also buy ethereum on platforms like Paypal and Robinhood.\n\nETH Dollar-Cost Averaging\n\nCryptocurrencies can be extremely volatile. One way to cope with the volatility is to use dollar-cost averaging. Dollar-cost averaging is a strategy where you divide the total amount you want to invest across periodic purchases of the target asset. It simply means that you would invest the same number of dollars each month or quarter, regardless of market trends.\n\nThe idea is that when prices are high, you can afford less of the asset. But when prices are low, you can afford more. When the market recovers, you benefit from having bought more shares at the lower price. Please note that using this strategy will not always result in a profit or necessarily protect you from falling prices.\n\nDiversify Your Crypto Portfolio\n\nWith the crypto landscape so volatile and diverse, managing risk in a portfolio is critical. That essentially means position sizing and diversification \u2013 as with any other kind of investment.\n\nOne of the best pieces of investment advice we have heard recently comes from Ari Paul, co-founder and CIO of Blocktower Capital, a crypto and blockchain investment firm. As Paul says,\n\n\u201cRisk is only sizing. So, if you think bitcoin is too risky, you could size it at 0.1% of your portfolio or 0.001%. Too risky is never a reason not to own an asset. If something is positive expected value, risk adjusted, and relatively low correlation, you have to own it. That\u2019s peak portfolio management 101.\u201d\n\nOne way to diversify your portfolio is with stablecoins, although these have also been very high-risk following the Terra debacle. Our recent analysis has explored how safe is tether and which stablecoins could fall next. We advise only a very small allocation to crypto and prefer diversification with more traditional asset classes.\n\nFAQs\n\n\u2192 Is now a good time to buy ethereum?\n\nFor trading ethereum over the next two to four weeks, we are neutral to bearish. That means we expect stable to falling prices. For 2022-3 in general, we think recession risks pose a risk to ETH and so now might not be the best time to buy ethereum if you have a medium-term outlook. We think ethereum is a good long-term investment for the next one to three years and are bullish overall. That means we expect prices to rise in the long term.\n\n\u2192 When was ethereum at its lowest?\n\nEthereum was the lowest in October 2016, when its price was $0.41. Since then, Ethereum has experienced several major bull runs. The first was in 2017/8 when it peaked at $1,400. It subsequently dropped to around $300-400 until the start of 2021. From January that year, bullish sentiment took the coin to over $4,000. It was not until the closing moments of 2021 that ETH breached this threshold, continuing its rise to $4,780 in November 2021. Since then, ETH price has been volatile and generally gone downwards. It is currently around $1,500.\n\n\u2192 Can you lose your money buying ETH now?\n\nAs with all investments, the value of ethereum can rise as well as fall. While it is unlikely that ethereum will suffer a complete loss of value, investors must be prepared to suffer drawdowns of between 50% and 80%. We recommend small allocations and diversification of your portfolio. Never invest what you cannot afford to lose.\n\n\u2192 When to sell ethereum?\n\nTraditional wisdom says you should buy low and sell high. But whether you should sell ethereum depends on your investment horizon, risk appetite and financial goals. Although some website speculate that certain days of the week are better or worse then others for selling ethereum, we believe that any decision to buy or sell should be based on analysis of crypto fundamentals.\n\n\u2192 Is ethereum a good investment?\n\nWe think a small allocation to ETH makes sense in the long term. However, we caution against investing in ethereum too heavily as cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile and often subject to large downturns.\n\nAppendix\n\nEthereum as a Good Inflation Hedge\n\nEthereum and bitcoin have historically been touted as a hedge for inflation. When inflation expectations rise, you would want the relationship between the cryptocurrency and inflation expectations to be at least positive. This, historically, has held. However, since February, the relationship has broken down. Inflation expectations remained anchored while ETH prices have fallen. A more hawkish Federal Reserve could weigh on ETH going forward.\n\nThe Ethereum Merge (or ETH 2.0)\n\nEthereum has been running on two different blockchains since April 2022. One operates using proof-of-work, like bitcoin. The other is a test chain what uses proof-of-stake. The merge is an upcoming event where these two blockchains will combine, ending proof-of-work. It is expected to happen in Q3/Q4 2022, and it will eliminate the energy-intensive mining required in proof-of-work. Guest author Nikhil Shamapant explains more about the ethereum merge and what it could mean for ETH price in 2023 in his recent article.\n\nDalvir Mandara is a Quantitative Researcher at Macro Hive.

        "title": "Ethereum derivatives flirting with bearishness: Mind the $1,820 support - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "After a brief overshoot above $2,000 on May 6, the Ether price has returned to a tight range between $1,820 and $1,950, which has been the norm for the past three weeks.\n\nAccording to the latest Ether (ETH) futures and options data, odds favor the Ether price breaking below the $1,820 support, as professional traders have been unwilling to add neutral-to-bullish positions using derivatives contracts.\n\nEther price in USD, 12-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nNot even the memecoin frenzy that boosted Ethereum network demand was able to instill confidence in investors. The average Ethereum transaction fee skyrocketed to $27.70 on May 6, the highest in 12 months, according to BitInfoCharts data. As reported by Cointelegraph, one of the main drivers behind the increase was the insatiable demand for Pepe (PEPE), among other memecoins.\n\nMoreover, the increased gas fees have driven users to layer-2 solutions, which could be interpreted as a weakness. For instance, it causes a decline in the total value locked by removing deposits from the Ethereum chain, especially in decentralized finance applications.\n\nSome analysts believe the $30 million Ether sale by the Ethereum Foundation contributed to ETH being unable to break above $2,000, as nearly 20,000 ETH were sent to the Kraken cryptocurrency exchange. The foundation\u2019s last relevant transfer occurred in November 2021, when the price topped around $4,850 and subsequently declined by 80%.\n\nOn the macroeconomic side, the United States\u2019 4.9% April consumer price index (CPI) data announced on May 10, slightly below consensus, further increased investors\u2019 expectations of stable interest rates at the next Federal Reserve meeting in June. CME Group\u2019s FedWatch Tool showed 94% odds of stability at the current 5% to 5.25% range.\n\nTherefore, with no signs of a Fed pivot on the horizon, the demand for risk-on assets such as cryptocurrencies should remain under pressure. But if investors fear that Ether has higher odds of breaking the three-week sideways movement to the downside, i should be reflected in the ETH futures contract premium and increased costs for protective put options.\n\nEther futures reflect weak demand from longs\n\nEther quarterly futures are popular among whales and arbitrage desks. However, these fixed-month contracts typically trade at a slight premium to spot markets, indicating that sellers are asking for more money to delay settlement.\n\nAs a result, ETH futures contracts in healthy markets should trade at a 5% to 10% annualized premium \u2014 a situation known as contango, which is not unique to crypto markets.\n\nEther three-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nEther traders have been extremely cautious in the past week, as there was no surge in demand for leverage longs during the rally above $2,000 on May 6. Presently at 1.4%, the ETH futures premium reflects a complete lack of appetite from buyers using derivatives contracts.\n\nEther options risk metric stood neutral\n\nTraders should also analyze options markets to understand whether the recent correction has caused investors to become more optimistic. The 25% call-to-put delta skew is a telling sign when arbitrage desks and market makers overcharge for upside or downside protection.\n\nIn short, if traders anticipate an Ether price drop, the skew metric will drop below 7%, and phases of excitement tend to have a positive 7% skew.\n\nRelated: Arbitrum's DAO to receive over 3,350 ETH revenue from transaction fees\n\nEther 30-day options 25% delta skew. Source: Amberdata & The Block\n\nAs displayed above, the ETH options' 25% call-to-put delta skew has been neutral for the past two weeks, as the protective put options were trading at a fair price relative to similar neutral-to-bullish call options.\n\nEther options and futures markets suggest that pro traders are not confident, especially considering the 10.6% rally between May 2-6. Therefore, the weak derivatives indicators are more likely to flip bearish if the three-week sideways movement breaks to the downside.\n\nIn other words, if Ether\u2019s price breaks below $1,820, traders should expect a much higher appetite for bearish bets using ETH derivatives, an indicator of distrust and a lack of demand for longs.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Deneb represents the upgrade to Ethereum\u2019s consensus layer.\n\nThe Cancun fork includes the highly anticipated Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844 , \u201cProto-Danksharding.\u201d This feature is a milestone that lays the important groundwork for full Danksharding implementation.\n\nCommenting on the importance of Proto-Danksharding, Ethereum core developer P\u00e9ter Szil\u00e1gyi stated, \u201cI kind of feel that 4844 should be the thing that everybody focuses on, and the rest is \u2018nice to have.'\u201d\n\nThis latter part will take several years before it\u2019s ready to ship. Proto-Danksharding will act as an intermediate upgrade to help scale rollups on the network.\n\nNo specific date has been given for the Cancun upgrade, but it\u2019s anticipated to go live in the second half of 2023.\n\nOther EIPs that may or may not appear in the Cancun upgrade include :\n\nEIPs 4758 , 6046 , 6190 : SELFDESTRUCT removal\n\n, , : SELFDESTRUCT removal EIP-663 : Unlimited SWAP and DUP instructions\n\n: Unlimited SWAP and DUP instructions EIP-5920 : PAY opcode\n\n: PAY opcode EIP-1153 : Transient storage\n\n: Transient storage EIP-2537: Precompile for BLS12-381 curve operations\n\nPrecompile for BLS12-381 curve operations EIP-4788 : Beacon state root in EVM\n\n: Beacon state root in EVM EVMMAX EIP-6601 & EIP-6690\n\n& Simple Serialize (SSZ) changes: EIP-6493 SSZ signature scheme EIP-6465 EIP-6404 / EIP-6466\n\n\n\nWhat is Danksharding?\n\nDanksharding is the third and final part of the ETH2/ Serenity upgrade, after the successful roll out of the Beacon chain and The Merge. The newly-designed, simplified sharding architecture will completely replace the project\u2019s initially proposed idea of introducing 64 shard chains.\n\nInstead of allowing for more transactions, Danksharding focuses on increasing data availability for rollups.\n\nRollups are a Layer 2 technology that bundles together blockchain transactions and processes them off-chain. Any rollup operator can process a batch of transactions and submit the results or a proof to the main chain.\n\nDepending on the specific rollup technology used\u2014Optimistic or Zero Knowledge (ZK)\u2014 other validators in the network or a smart contract review the results.\n\nOptimism, Arbitrum, zkSync Era, and Loopring are examples of popular Ethereum Layer 2 scaling protocols that use rollups.\n\nTo help kickstart the network\u2019s long transition over to full Danksharding, EIP-4844 will introduce many of its key execution layer components this year.\n\nWhat is Proto-Danksharding?\n\nProto-Danksharding is an interim upgrade to the Ethereum network proposed by Ethereum developers Protolambda and Dankrad Feist.\n\nOn the EIP-4844 FAQ page, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin describes Proto-Danksharding as a \u201cstopgap\u201d solution that will dramatically reduce rollup gas fees ahead of full sharding implementation.\n\nShard blob transactions\n\nEIP 4844 introduces a transaction type called \u201cblob-carrying transactions.\u201d\n\nA blob is an abbreviated term for \u201cbinary large objects\u201d and represents a 125 Kilobyte payload of data.\n\nTo create a blob-carrying transaction, rollups submit their data to blobs and attach them to blocks.\n\nA single blob-carrying transaction can contain up to two blobs. To encourage the uptake of these transactions, the upgrade will implement a multi-dimensional EIP-1559 fee market. This feature will introduce a variable gas fee for blob-carrying transactions based on supply and demand.\n\nThe main benefit of blob-carrying transactions is cost-effectiveness.\n\nRollups currently store transaction data permanently on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain via Calldata. Blob data, however, works out much cheaper than Calldata because it isn\u2019t committed to the execution layer (the Ethereum Virtual Machine). Nor does it exist on the execution layer forever. Instead, Beacon nodes store them at the consensus layer, and after one month to a year, the blobs are deleted. You can think of it as clearing cached data from your laptop or device.\n\nA polynomial commitment scheme called a KZG (named after its creators Kate, Zaverucha, and Goldberg) will verify transaction data posted in blobs. Like other zero knowledge proof systems, KZG allows for verification without revealing the entire contents of a blob.\n\nWhat does the Cancun upgrade achieve? The overarching goal of the Cancun upgrade is to continue preparing the network for full data sharding, while scaling rollups in the interim. The introduction of blob-carrying transactions will increase data availability for rollups and make them considerably cheaper. EIP 4844 will also include most of the execution layer logic and groundwork for full sharding. This step will greatly reduce the implementation work needed later down the line. After Cancun activates, Ethereum users should expect faster, cheaper payments when using the ecosystem\u2019s native cryptocurrency, applications, and ERC-based tokens."

During the Shanghai denial-of-service attacks in 2016, attackers tricked the dominant client at the time (Geth) into slowing down block operations. Alternative clients who were not affected by the vulnerability were online at the time, and able to prevent Ethereum from being compromised.\n\nSuperphiz.eth said the loss of finalization might be \u201cthe first real-world test of our consensus client diversity work,\u201d and called the incident \u201cbig, but inconsequential.\u201d\n\n\u201cDecentralization on all levels limits the impact of these events, regardless of what caused this we must continue hardening every vector,\u201d superphiz.eth added.\n\nSuperphiz didn\u2019t immediately return a request for comment.\n\nThe incident is currently being investigated by Ethereum developers and more information is expected to be revealed.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nUpdated May 11, 2023 at 5:54 pm ET: Added additional context and comments throughout.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "The single biggest beneficiary was antigovernment extremist Ammon Bundy\u2019s People\u2019s Rights Network (PRN), which received transfers worth $93,000.\n\nHatewatch was first alerted to the cryptocurrency donations to PRN by the Institute for Research and Education on Human Rights.\n\nOther major beneficiaries include white nationalist publication VDARE, which received $42,000, and white nationalist organization American Renaissance, which received $35,000.\n\nThe donations continue a pattern of anonymous big-money benefactors using cryptocurrency to conceal their identities and avoid accountability for funding extremists. Hatewatch has previously reported on similar donations including over $8 million donated to conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.\n\nDonor covers tracks\n\nThe mystery donor concealed the original source of the donations by using Tornado Cash, a so-called \u201cmixer\u201d service that disguises the origins of cryptocurrency transfers. Tornado Cash has since been sanctioned by the U.S. government due to its use in money-laundering, including by hackers sponsored by the North Korean regime.\n\nFrom Tornado Cash, the donor transferred Ethereum to three cryptocurrency addresses, which were then used to funnel the digital coins to extremists.\n\nJust over 99 Ethereum coins worth $314,000 were sent from Tornado Cash to a cryptocurrency address of unknown ownership on Jan. 10, 2022.\n\nPRN\u2019s big payday\n\nAlso on Jan. 10, 2022, PRN received a 20-coin donation from that address, and a five-coin donation on Jan. 29. Together those amounts were worth over $66,694 when they were sent.\n\nThe first account also transferred on Jan. 10, 2022:\n\nA five-coin donation to VDARE, worth $15,754 at that time.\n\nA five-coin donation to white nationalist broadcaster Red Ice worth $3,150.\n\nA one-coin donation to Infowars.\n\nOn April 15, 2022, the donor transferred some 36 Ethereum coins from the first address to a second one. These were worth around $110,000 at that time.\n\nFive days later, on April 20, 2022, this second account sent PRN a donation of five Ethereum coins, worth $15,512 at the time.\n\nThen, between 11:56 p.m. and midnight Greenwich Mean Time on April 20, that same account sent matching five-coin donations to VDARE, American Renaissance, Red Ice and Infowars.\n\nApril 20 is a date of complex significance on the far right and in extremist subcultures. As well as being Adolf Hitler\u2019s birthday, it marks the anniversary of the Columbine High School mass shooting, which took place in 1999.\n\nThe preceding date, April 19, marks the anniversary of both the 1995 bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City by antigovernment extremist Timothy McVeigh, and the conclusion of the Waco, Texas, siege in 1993, one of the events McVeigh claimed to be responding to.\n\nOn Aug. 13, 2021, the donor transferred 10 Ethereum from Tornado Cash, the cryptocurrency mixer, to a third account. The coins were worth just over $30,000 at that time.\n\nExtremists cash in\n\nPeople\u2019s Rights Network received Ethereum coins worth $10,819 in three one-coin donations from the third crypto address on Aug. 13, 2021, Sept. 24, 2021, and Nov. 8, 2021.\n\nThe donor used the same address to send three one-coin donations to VDARE on the same dates.\n\nThe third address was also used by the donor to send:\n\nTwo 0.5-coin donations, worth $3,885 at the time, to Slightly Offensive, a far-right podcast hosted by Elijah Schaeffer. Schaeffer was fired in October 2022 from Glenn Beck\u2019s media company The Blaze for allegedly groping a co-worker.\n\nOne-coin and 0.25-coin donations to American Renaissance, worth a total of $4,201 when they were sent in August and November 2021.\n\nA one-coin donation to white nationalist hate group Defend Evropa, which was worth $3,047 when it was sent in August 2021.\n\nA 0.25-coin donation to the far-right Idaho Freedom Foundation, worth $1,154 when it was sent in November 2021.\n\nA 0.02-coin donation to Infowars, worth just over $920 in November 2021.\n\nBetween August 2021 and April 2022, Ammon Bundy\u2019s PRN received donations from all three accounts, as did VDARE, Infowars and American Renaissance.\n\nRed Ice received donations from the first and second accounts, while Defend Evropa, Idaho Freedom Foundation and Slightly Offensive only received donations from the third account.\n\nAn Idaho hospital, St. Luke\u2019s Meridian Medical Center, is suing Bundy for defamation over his accusations that the hospital forcibly vaccinated the grandchild of a member of his People\u2019s Rights Network.\n\nA lawyer for St. Luke\u2019s has reportedly described Bundy as a \u201cgrifter\u201d and expressed interest in his sources of income.\n\nHatewatch contacted Bundy, Jared Taylor of American Renaissance, Red Ice, and Peter Brimelow of VDARE for comment but did not receive replies by publication time.\n\nPhoto illustration by SPLC"

He added that the blockchain avoided forking because no client had a supermajority.\n\nCurrently, two consensus clients \u2014 Lighthouse and Prsym \u2014 dominate Ethereum, each with 38% dominance. Only three other clients have a notable presence.\n\nEthereum has experienced other outages in the past: it experienced a DDOS attack in 2016 and saw partial Infura-related outages in November 2020.

It\u2019s so popular that there are even blocks that are supposed to be censored due to regulations.\n\nHowever, Ethereum is known for being censorship-resistant. And on Wednesday, it proved to be just that.\n\nEthereum\u2019s OFAC-Compliant Blocks Drop to 29%\n\nEthereum has just become more censorship-resistant. On Thursday, Ethereum\u2019s OFAC-compliant blocks dropped to just 29%.\n\nEthereum OFAC compliance chart. Source: mevwatch.info.\n\nOFAC stands for Office for Foreign Assets Control, an agency of the U.S. Department of the Treasury that administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions to support national security and foreign policy objectives.\n\nIn August 2022, the OFAC imposed sanctions on Tornado Cash, a decentralized crypto mixer on the Ethereum blockchain, and several associated Ethereum addresses. The OFAC said Tornado Cash facilitated illegal and criminal money transfers and implemented measures to censor specific transactions.\n\nIn response to the OFAC sanctions, some relay operators, the most famous of them being Flashbots, started filtering transactions that were not compliant with the OFAC sanctions. Initially, around 80% of all transactions on Ethereum were OFAC-compliant.\n\nHowever, that number has since gone down drastically. According to data from mevwatch.info, only 29% of all transactions on the Ethereum network are currently OFAC-compliant. This means that Ethereum has maintained its censorship-resistance property.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nRelayers can start blocking transactions that aren\u2019t OFAC-compliant anytime if there are attractive maximal extractable value (MEV) opportunities.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nBeing censorship-resistant is one of the most important properties of a blockchain. The fact that Ethereum has maintained this property over the years speaks volumes about its resilience and importance in the blockchain world.\n\nRead more about Lido enabling stETH withdrawals:\n\nLido Finally Sets Date for stETH Withdrawals\n\nRead more about how Polygon is driving institutional adoption of DeFi:\n\nHere\u2019s How Polygon Is Driving Institutional Adoption of DeFi"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nCryptocurrency prices rose on Wednesday after a widely-watched inflation gauge in the U.S. suggested the Federal Reserve\u2019s fight against soaring prices is making progress.\n\nThe Consumer Price Index rose 4.9% in the 12 months through April, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) said Wednesday, coming in slightly below economists' estimates of 5%.\n\nOn a month-to-month basis, the index, which tracks price movements across a broad range of goods and services, rose 0.4% in April compared to a 0.1% bump in March and a 0.4% increase in February.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitcoin was up 1.4% over the past day, chipping away at weekly losses of 1.8% at around $27,900, according to CoinGecko. Ethereum was also in the green, notching a 1.6% daily increase and reversing a weekly downtrend at $1,870. Meanwhile, the global crypto market capitalization was sitting at $1.2 trillion\u2014up 0.8% from the previous day.\n\n\n\nIn terms of the impact that Wednesday\u2019s CPI print had on crypto markets, Managing Director at Wave Digital Assets Nauman Sheikh told Decrypt a lack of liquidity is likely at play, pointing to market makers like Jane Street and Jump who have scaled back.\n\n\u201cLiquidity just fell off a cliff, so any market impact on the way up on the way down will be a little bit more exaggerated,\u201d he said. \u201cThere's no depth to the market, which means any slight pressure on either side is just going to be exasperated.\u201d\n\nThe index\u2019s increase in April was largely fueled by a jump in housing prices, which grew 0.4% month-to-month, the BLS said. But the measure represented a notable decline compared to a monthly increase of 0.6% in March and 0.8% in February.\n\nThe report indicated that core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, rose 5.5% in the 12 months through April, edging down from 5.6% in March.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor the most part, inflation has steadily cooled over the past several months, down significantly from a sweltering 9.1% clip last June. Still, the latest report showed annual inflation remains far above the Fed\u2019s target of 2%. And the U.S. central bank has jacked interest rates aggressively in response to rising prices. It\u2019s lifted interest rates to their highest levels since 2007, delivering its 10th consecutive rate hike last week.\n\nHigher interest rates cool down the economy because of their ripple effect, impacting costs associated with credit cards and mortgages. They also weigh on stocks and other \u201crisk\u201d assets, such as crypto, making yields on cash reserves and U.S. Treasury Bills comparatively more attractive.\n\nThe Fed risks tipping the U.S. economy into a recession if it raises rates too quickly. And signs of stress emerged in the financial system when several banks collapsed in March. The tumult continued when First Republic Bank failed last week. Now a potential debt ceiling crisis looms.\n\nWhen the Fed decided to raise interest rates last week, Chair Jerome Powell indicated there could be a potential pause. But he said the central bank would wait and see how the economy performed before making a decision at the Fed\u2019s next meeting in June.\n\n\u201cThe fact that [inflation] is within expectations, a bit better for the annual rate, it means the Fed will likely pause,\u201d Kaiko analyst Dessislava Aubert told Decrypt, \u201cBecause the current banking turmoil in the U.S. is basically making traditional tightening less necessary\u2014banks are already tightening lending standards.\u201d"

        "title": "Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin May Get His Way on Ether Supply Cap \u2014 5 Years Late - Blockworks",
        "content": "Ethereum has no formal cap on the supply of ether, but it looks to be getting an informal one thanks to the burn.\n\nThe total ether supply is now projected to have peaked in March at 120.5 million ETH, and has declined by about 100,000 ETH since then, according to data from Ultrasound Money.\n\nSome observers note the historical irony of that 120 million number; Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin proposed it as a hard cap back in April 2018. To be fair, it was the first day of April, and Buterin confessed the following day that his suggestion was an April Fools\u2019 prank of sorts \u2014 though he did intend to encourage a very real debate on the subject.\n\nStill \u2014 joke or not \u2014 Buterin\u2019s suggestion was generally dismissed on the merits, as unhelpful and unworkable.\n\nAt the time, the circulating supply of ether \u2014 due to its genesis allocations and subsequent proof-of-work issuance \u2014 stood at about 98.5 million. It would be 32 more months before long-term holders could start locking 32 ETH in the Beacon Chain\u2019s validator deposit contract, and longer still before the London hard fork introduced the concept of burning a portion of Ethereum transaction fees with EIP-1559.\n\nA year later, the Merge further bent the curve of ether supply towards deflation, as it instantly reduced the rate of issuance \u2014 the supply previously required, under proof-of-work, for the network to operate.\n\nSource: Ultrasound.Money\n\nThe purpose of EIP-1559 was not to reduce transaction fees, but for them to become \u201cmore predictable and thereby make the fee estimation problem \u2014 the problem of choosing the optimal gas price for a transaction \u2014 as straightforward as possible,\u201d according to the December 2020 research paper by Tim Roughgarden detailing the concept.\n\n\n\nFor many ether holders, the more long-term ramification, however, may be the de facto supply cap, which was considered a \u201cside benefit\u201d at the time of its introduction.\n\nBuried on page 52 of the 58-page paper, Roughgarden wrote, \u201cbecause burned fees are effectively a lump sum refund to ETH holders, the value of ETH would be tied directly to the intensity of network usage.\u201d\n\nThree and a half years later, the price is about half what it was when the network\u2019s London hard fork took effect near the height of the previous bull market euphoria. But ether\u2019s supply has been undergoing deflation for 5 months straight, fueled by all kinds of network usage, from rollups to meme tokens.\n\nOn top of that, the amount of ether staked has been trending steadily higher, reaching an all-time high Thursday, with upwards of 566,000 validators.\n\nAround 3,100 metric tons of gold will be mined in 2023, resulting in between 2-3% supply inflation.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s inflation rate stands at 1.74%. Ether\u2019s supply, meanwhile, has fallen 1.07% since the burn began.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Validators earned $46 million in the first week of May due to an increase in the staking rewards rate, which is a metric for validators\u2019 annualized yield. According to data, validators earned 24,997 Ether (ETH) in the week, representing a 40% increase over the previous week\u2019s income of $33 million, when 18,339 ETH were distributed as rewards.\n\nThe recent trading craze of a new memecoin called Pepe (PEPE) is the reason behind the increased rewards for validators. In the past week, the average fees on the Ethereum network have exceeded 100 gwei, marking the highest level since May 2022. As gas fees increase, end users pay over $30 per swap, resulting in higher fee income for validators from processing transactions and the regular validator rewards.\n\nETH staking rewards reference rate. Source: Beaconcha.in\n\nBeaconcha.in states that the present staking rate signifies the anticipated annualized return for validators. In order to engage in the network\u2019s consensus procedure, validators on Ethereum are mandated to stake a minimum of 32 ETH, valued at roughly $58,000.\n\nThere are two types of rewards identified by ETH Store, a company that measures reward rates: consensus rewards for proposing and attesting blocks, and transaction fees for processing transactions on the Ethereum network.\n\nRelated: Worth it? Trader spends $120K on gas buying $155K worth of a memecoin\n\nSince Ethereum\u2019s network moved to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism with the Merge in 2022, and following the recent Shapella upgrade enabling validator withdrawals for the first time, ETH staking has attained significant interest from institutions.\n\nMagazine: Joe Lubin: The truth about ETH founders split and \u2018Crypto Google\u2019"

        "content": "Ethereum layer-2 blockchain Arbitrum will distribute Ether (ETH) worth nearly $6.2 million to its decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), the project announced on May 9 on Twitter.\n\nThe funds to be collected are base fees and surplus revenue generated from network transactions. According to Arbitrum\u2019s tweet, a total of 3,352 ETH will be collected by its DAO. As internet-native organizations, DAOs are collectively owned and managed by their members. They have treasuries and make decisions through proposals voted on by the group.\n\nBig news Arbinauts!\n\n\n\nArbitrum is the only rollup that sends all surplus revenue generated by transaction fees to their respective DAO and it is time for the DAO to collect the funds so far!\n\n\n\nFollow along to learn more about it. \u2014 Arbitrum (,) (@arbitrum) May 10, 2023\n\nArbitrum is a popular scaling network used by many decentralized applications and blockchain developers. All users pay a fee during transactions on Arbitrum One.\n\nThe cost of sending ETH on Arbitrum is currently $0.25, and swapping tokens is $0.68 at the time of writing. Data from Crypto Fees shows that Arbitrum's users paid $387,423 in fees over the past seven days.\n\nEach fee paid on Arbitrum One is divided into two sections \u2014 the L1 fee and L2 fee. According to the protocol, the L1 fee covers the cost of posting a transaction on the Ethereum network and the L2 fee covers the cost of running the network.\n\n\"All revenue from the Arbitrum Network is sent to the DAO treasury and it is up to the DAO on how to spend it\", told Cointelegraph the Arbitrum Foundation.\n\nA revenue breakdown reveals around 582 ETH of surplus funds generated from the L1 fee, nearly 1,308 ETH from base fees and a 1,462 ETH surplus from the L2 fee. Combined, this represents revenue of 3,352 ETH for Arbitrum's DAO.\n\nA related proposal from an anonymous member of Arbitrum's governance forum urges the protocol to create a mechanism for revenue distribution that would be triggered periodically by a smart contract. According to the proposal, delegated ARB tokens would be eligible for revenue distribution. The DAO hasn't voted on the proposal.\n\nThe proposal claims it would \"align community incentives and give ARB a purpose beyond a worthless governance token.\" Most community members support the proposal, according to the governance forum. Some members, however, highlighted that the revenue distribution might further serve to classify the ARB token as a security.\n\nCommunity member comments on Arbitrum\u2019s \"Distribution of DAO Revenue to ARB token holders\u201d proposal. Source: Arbitrum DAO.\n\nArbitrum's revenue distribution comes after the protocol team clashed with its community over a nearly $1 billion fund transfer that wasn't approved by ARB holders.\n\nUpdate (May 17, 2023 at 14:48 UTC): This article has been updated to clarify that the proposal on Arbitrum's governance forum was submitted by an anonymous member, not by the Arbitrum Foundation. The anonymous member has no relationship with the Arbitrum Foundation. The DAO has not voted to approve the proposal nor is it implemented.\n\nMagazine: Joe Lubin \u2014 The truth about ETH founders split and \u2018Crypto Google\u2019"

        "title": "From Bitcoins to \u201cShitcoins,\u201d Meet the Latest Crypto-Currency Craze and the Scams It Is Spawning - The Indypendent",
        "content": "What was promised as an important technical innovation has instead become the most extensive platform for fraud, gambling and scams the world has ever seen.\n\nThe latest craze in crypto is a token on the Ethereum blockchain celebrating the meme \u201cPepe the Frog\u201d and intended to challenge the Dogecoin favored by Elon Musk. The ticker $PEPE has become a rabid mania on Musk\u2019s Twitter, and, despite being created by an anonymous team who likely intended to snatch a quick buck, it reached $1.5 billion in market capitalization in less than a month. It embodies the ultimate degenerate rush of the ever-shifting crypto endeavor: so-called \u201cshitcoins.\u201d\n\nWhile a seemingly trivial and jovial fight for memetic supremacy, the raging one-off shitcoin and \u201cmemecoin\u201d run-ups encapsulate the attention economy of frenetic insanity that Ethereum enables. What was promised as an important technical innovation to protect free speech and universal access to computing has instead become the most extensive platform for fraud, gambling and scams the world has ever seen, leaving innumerable victims suffering in silence and without sympathy.\n\nWhat investment could be easier than betting on the madness of crowds?\n\nEvery single day on the Ethereum blockchain, thousands of computer programs, called \u201csmart contracts,\u201d are launched that intend to deceive and harm their users. Sometimes they involve NFTs as programs that assign \u201cownership\u201d to various image files but are often used to make false or overzealous promises about their value. Sometimes they are DeFi protocols, unregulated bank accounts or savings and loans that earn their own token which can be traded like a stock, yet which often are scams or are hacked. Sometimes they are so-called \u201cshitcoins,\u201d technically primitive tokens that in some almost mystical way represent a proxy for the overall Ethereum network. In some sense, their only value comes from the memetic power of the ticker symbol, although the same names can be used over and over again. Hundreds of other \u201cdevs\u201d have already tried to launch a Pepe coin with much less success.\n\nThe Pepe meme\u2019s well-known association with the online alt-right also raises questions about why this particular meme now strives for cultural hegemony on the blockchain. While it does seem that the memecoin is being propelled by pure speculation and nostalgia for Pepe in general, there is something uncomfortable and risky about focusing on this particular \u2014 and rather played out \u2014 meme, especially given the serious allegations that Ethereum\u2019s most popular NFT project, Bored Ape Yacht Club, is inspired by esoteric fascism.\n\nEventually most \u201cprojects\u201d on Ethereum end in a fast or a slow \u201crug,\u201d proving that most activity on so-called Web3 is no different from confidence games of old. $PEPE may not \u201crug\u201d quite yet, but we already know that its early investors are openly planning to unload their million-dollar bags to the naive \u201cexit liquidity\u201d of cartoon frog fans betting on a dream.\n\nThus, it is at the level of the Ethereum blockchain where we should interrogate $PEPE, and the hundreds of other tokens, like $MUSK and $SEC, minted every day like candy. Every single transaction has fees ranging from $20 to $50 that go straight to the largest Ethereum holders who stake their tokens. They benefit all of the time, even as they are \u201cvalidating\u201d transactions intended quite clearly to defraud. In one sense, the current \u201cshitcoin meta,\u201d a term that describes the most lucrative area of speculation at any given moment, more accurately represents the mass marketing of a new gambling opportunity for customers of the maniacal Ethereum casino.\n\nThe Pepe meme\u2019s well-known association with the online alt-right also raises questions about why this particular meme now strives for cultural hegemony on the blockchain.\n\nBoosters act like Ethereum is a new and free online metaverse, where pure internet demand determines activity. The truth is much different. The token distribution of ETH is highly centralized, giving big holders the ability to manage and orchestrate Ponzi schemes at ease, using every illegal practice, especially pumping-and-dumping and wash trading, that is \u2014 at least in theory \u2014 disallowed on Wall Street. Pepe promoters point to the $6 billion valuation of the Ethereum Doge alternative, $SHIB, as evidence that $PEPE can go much higher, yet there are serious questions about the centralized nature of $SHIB ownership, which puts its accurate valuation in doubt.\n\nMoreover, gambling over the value of memes says something profound about the frothiest financial capital that is moving increasingly into speculation and quantitative trading on the probable success of new ponzi schemes, rather than productive investment. What investment could be easier than betting on the madness of crowds? And, after riding Gamestop and AMC, young investors in particular have brought a certain predictable level of logic and discipline to their madness.\n\nWhen one steps back and considers it, however, you have to ask why these primitive programs, or \u201csmart contracts,\u201d on a primitive distributing computing platform should be valued so highly. In my mind, it is like being overly protective of your saved score on an early Atari video game. It may be a remarkable achievement, but will anyone care after the Nintendo Entertainment System comes out?\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum may still triumph as a \u201csettlement layer\u201d for a new digital economy. By not investigating and prosecuting the open scams and crimes on Ethereum, the federal government has given its clique of owners, or \u201cwhales,\u201d unimaginable amounts of wealth to use to finance and propel their endeavor, alongside more and more creative cons. SEC regulators have dithered at accurately describing Ethereum activity, and it is obvious that the FBI does not have the resources (nor perhaps the expertise) to keep track of the scams orchestrated.\n\nNow that serious crypto regulation is on the table, Ethereum must be part of the conversation since its leadership refuses to assert any moral authority. Stepped-up enforcement of existing laws by an invigorated and quick-moving FBI, rather than pure security and commodities regulation, should be the focus. Starving fraud and financial crimes enforcement when the U.S. government needs to take control and fundamentally reform a rotten system from top to bottom \u2014 addressing the root cause of crypto\u2019s popularity \u2014 is insane. Ethereum is now the most vicious corner of the cryptocurrency space, and its victims should not be forgotten.\n\nTodd Fine is a PhD candidate in History at the CUNY Graduate Center.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArbitrum (ARB), one of the most functional Ethereum-based Layer 2 scaling solutions, has shared an insight into its adopted mechanism for managing the fees generated on its platform. Taking to its official Twitter handle, Arbitrum said it is the \"only rollup that sends all surplus revenue generated by transaction fees to their respective DAO.\"\n\nFee generation model\n\nAccording to the insights shared by the protocol, all users on Arbitrum One pay a fee when transacting on the network. This fee is split into two components, including L1 fees for covering transactions on Ethereum and L2 fees for Arbitrum fees. Of these generated fees, it said surplus tokens are accumulated before it is sent to the DAO.\n\nAll users on Arbitrum One pay a fee when transacting on the network. The fee is split into two components:\n\n1. L1 fee to pay for costs on Ethereum.\n\n2. L2 fee to pay for costs on Arbitrum.\n\n\n\nSurplus L1 fees and all L2 fees accumulate on-chain before it is sent to the DAO. \u2014 Arbitrum (\ud83d\udc99,\ud83e\udde1) (@arbitrum) May 10, 2023\n\nWhile L1 fees are not expended immediately as the Sequencer covers the cost upfront before it is recovered later, a large portion of the L1 fee is reserved for the Sequencer.\n\nAt present, Arbitrum revealed that the total funds billed for the Sequencer are pegged at 5,954 ETH worth approximately $10.9 million. The surplus on this comes in at 582 ETH, which can be sent to the DAO.\n\nArbitrum also revealed that the L2 fees accumulated thus far come in at a total of 2770 ETH. As revealed, a total of 3,352 ETH is billed to be sent to the DAO as a reward after the Sequencer is refunded 5,954 ETH.\n\nHow does this Help ARB?\n\nWith the Arbitrum protocol promising to trigger a call that will push for the collection of the accumulated Ether tokens by the DAO, the price of ARB recorded a bullish uptick with more than 3% growth to $1.1229 at the time of writing.\n\nMembers of the Arbitrum community DAO will be the beneficiaries of this reward distribution when it is finally made. This can notably trigger an intense buy-up of ARB to open access for users to gain good rewards. This event has further extended the positive outlook of Arbitrum as a viable scaling tool on Ethereum."

        "content": "Grayscale Investments has formed a new entity structured as a Delaware statutory trust and filed for three new exchange traded funds.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest digital asset manager plans to launch three new funds: Grayscale Ethereum Futures ETF, Grayscale Global Bitcoin Composite ETF, and Grayscale Privacy ETF.\n\nIn a May 9 announcement, the firm said it had established the Grayscale Funds Trust, set up as a Delaware statutory trust, which would allow it to independently manage 1940 Act products, in line with its ambitions to build out its ETF offerings.\n\n\u201cWe are putting the necessary foundations in place so Grayscale can continue creating and managing regulated, future-forward products,\u201d said CEO Michael Sonnenshein in a statement.\n\nNEW TODAY: We\u2019re proud to announce the formation of Grayscale Funds Trust, a Delaware statutory trust structure that enhances our capabilities as a global asset manager.\n\nInvestors want and deserve access to future-forward investment opportunities, and Grayscale Funds Trust will\u2026 pic.twitter.com/qEeqwWHNSe \u2014 Grayscale (@Grayscale) May 9, 2023\n\nAlong with the creation of the new entity, the firm filed a registration statement for three new ETFs with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which rejected Grayscale\u2019s proposal to convert its flagship fund GBTC into a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart, one of these ETF filings \u2013 the Bitcoin Composite ETF \u2013 is almost symbolic of an \u201coutright attack on the SEC.\u201d The fund will invest 40% in internationally listed Bitcoin ETFs and 60% in Bitcoin mining companies, similar to many existing blockchain-themed ETFs on the market.\n\nI think the SEC will have to allow this Bitcoin Composite ETF to launch for the same reason Bitcoin Futures ETPs were allowed \u2014 the futures market is federally regulated. The same argument can be made for spot Bitcoin ETPs in Canada, Europe, Brazil etc. And it's only 40%. 6/x \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) May 9, 2023\n\nThe Ethereum Futures ETF will invest 100% of its funds under management in cash-settled futures, which is only offered by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). Seeing as the structure of this ETF mirrors existing Bitcoin Futures ETFs that have been approved, a denial from the SEC would likely force the regulator into explaining why it views Ethereum in a different light to Bitcoin.\n\nGrayscale also filed for a Privacy ETF, which will invest 10% in Grayscale\u2019s ZCash Trust. The remaining funds will be allocated to relatively liquid listed companies, with a market cap of at least $250 million, that confirm to the overall \u201cprivacy theme.\u201d\n\nThese new announcements from Grayscale come amid growing uncertainty around its parent company Digital Currency Group (DCG), specifically, whether the firm can repay a $630 million debt obligation due this week."

In the last 24 hours, the cryptocurrency market has declined by 3%. Notably, most Ethereum investors who bought the crypto asset this year are still in profit.\n\n>>Click Here To Register For The Tradecurve Presale<<\n\nEthereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and the largest DeFi project. While bullish traders have had their fun for most of the week, the price seemed set for a correction.\n\nAt the start of the week, Ethereum crossed the $2000 mark for the first time since last year. The slight breakout set the stage for a more positive upward move. Following Ethereum's break, Polygon, Arbitrum, and other Ethereum projects joined the party.\n\nETH's price chart. Source: Coinmarketcap\n\nEthereum's (ETH) Price Remains Strong Despite the Shapella Unlock\n\nWhile many other top cryptocurrencies have recorded notable gains this month, Ether's price seems to steal the show. On the 12th of April, the Shanghai and Capella (Shapella) upgrade on the Ethereum network went live. ETH validators eventually gained access to the locked tokens following the upgrade since staking started in December 2020.\n\nThe token lock resulted from the staking activity, which supported the smooth transition of the Ethereum network from the Proof of Work to the Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. Since lots of ETH tokens were to be unlocked, several ecosystem participants were concerned about the impact on price.\n\nInterestingly, the release of ETH did not lead to a huge sell-off or massive price dump. The Ethereum team regulated the situation by gradually scheduling the release of the staked tokens.\n\nFurther, the Shapella upgrade was perceived as an improvement to the network. With Ethereum still clinging to its broad vision of improving its scalability and decentralized level, more investors are drawn to the network. Surely, layer-two scaling protocols and cross-chain projects will support the network in achieving its goals.\n\nTradecurve (TCRV) - The hottest trading platform in DeFi\n\nThe Tradecurve team is building the next generation hybrid trading platform combining the best of centralized and decentralized exchanges and providing a one-stop shop for users to trade crypto, stocks, forex and commodities.\n\nTradecurve is set to revolutionize the multi-trillion dollar trading market with a cross-border permissionless platform where users will only require an email address and connect their wallet to begin trading, breaking down the barrier to entry for users worldwide.\n\nThe team has high aspirations for the project and will not be happy toppling platforms like OKB, Robin Hood App, Huobi. Their aim is to challenge established players like Binance, Coinbase and Kraken implement Proof of Reserves (PoR). Recent issues surrounding centralized exchanges have highlighted the trust that has been lost with traders, and the appetite for challengers like Tradecurve to emerge and provide a solution.\n\nTradecurve\u2019s native token TCRV, is available to purchase for $0.01. The price is expected to soar by 50X during its presale and possibly give investors 100X profits once launched.\n\nVisit Links Below For Info About Tradecurve Presale\n\nWebsite: https://tradecurve.io/\n\nPresale: https://app.tradecurve.io/sign-up\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Tradecurveapp\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/tradecurve_official"

Over time it has been co-opted as a hate symbol by alt-right groups, according to the Anti-Defamation League,\u201d \u2013 From Coinbase\u2019s newsletter\n\nThousands of Pepe bulls flooded crypto Twitter with #DeleteCoinbase posts after the newsletter dropped. Coinbase stock COIN bled as aggrieved Pepe supporters threatened to withdraw their assets and close their accounts on the crypto exchange. Some users also said they would switch to Gemini which supports PEPE trading.\n\nOne user highlighted another portion of the same ADL post that contradicts the platform\u2019s presentation of Pepe meme culture.\n\nWhy you lying @coinbase ?\n\nLooks like the only people practicing defamation are you guys by twisting the words of the ADL and I can't fathom why https://t.co/UR2AXSpoQE pic.twitter.com/VNx2Gnm0yI \u2014 Agent PEPE \ud83e\ude99 (@agentgottlieb) May 11, 2023\n\n\u2018We screwed up and we are sorry\u2019 \u2013 Coinbase Chief Attorney\n\nChief Legal Officer Paul Grewal tweeted to the Pepe community on behalf of the company. \u201cThis did not provide the whole picture of the history of the meme and we apologize to the community.\u201d, said Grewal about the company\u2019s newsletter.\n\nThe crypto exchange has been the subject of similar backlash on at least two other occasions.\n\nFor meme-coiners, the apology is another notch on the belt after a blitzing memecoin mania that has spiked gas fees on Bitcoin and Ethereum."

        "content": "Bitcoin price broke to $28,200 while Ethereum hovered above $1,800 as stocks climbed on US CPI data.\n\nKAVA price also rose, jumping 11% amid the positive sentiment and increased network activity.\n\nBTC, ETH and KAVA are trading near key technical levels.\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market rose 1.8% on Wednesday to $1.2 trillion as investors reacted to the latest US inflation data. The price of Bitcoin (BTC) was up 3% to $28,270 while Ethereum retested levels above $1,800 following recent dumps for the top two coins by market cap.\n\nElsewhere, US stocks turned green as Consumer Price Index (CPI) data showed inflation continued to cool, with the annual rate now at its slowest pace in two years.\n\nGains across equities and in the crypto major caps were also replicated in the medium and small cap altcoins. A notable upside was with the price of Kava (KAVA), which was up more than 11% as of 12:20 ET.\n\nBTC, ETH, KAVA price prediction: what next after CPI bump?\n\nBTC/USD\n\nBitcoin price had fallen below $28k this week following the large transaction volumes that hit the network and saw fees skyrocket. The congestion, attributable to the rise in BTC-20 tokens, forced crypto exchange Binance to halt BTC withdrawals on two occasions. The ensuing FUD pushed Bitcoin price lower.\n\nAlthough prices are above $28k again, market experts and analysts suggest bulls are not in control yet. This is because the price remains below the key technical level of $30,000.

The ETH/USD pair fell to lows of $1,800 on Monday and saw four consecutive red candles on the daily timeframe before today\u2019s uptick.\n\nThe RSI and MACD suggest bears are still strong and bulls are likely to struggle for support at current prices. This means the $2,000 remains a key technical level and moving further off it could spell more bloodbath for ETH price. Here\u2019s an analyst\u2019s Ethereum price prediction?\n\n#Ethereum breached a key demand wall at $1,850-$1,905. Failure to regain this critical support zone may trigger a correction, potentially leading $ETH to the next significant demand area at $1,570-$1,630. pic.twitter.com/7s7q1LlF06 \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) May 9, 2023\n\nKAVA/USD\n\nKAVA is the native token of layer-1 blockchain Kava, which ranks as the 98th largest cryptocurrency by market. The price of KAVA hit the all-time high of $9.12 in August 2021. At current prices, its value is more than 90% down.\n\nHowever, increased ecosystem activity around DeFi on the Kava blockchain has aided the double digit gains seen in the past 24 hours. It\u2019s what pushed KAVA/USD towards the psychological $1.\n\nThe main barrier for KAVA remains the $1.12 zone, while bears could enjoy some bloodbath to $0.52."

        "title": "Understanding Ethereum Forks: Hard Forks Vs Soft Forks - Inventiva",
        "content": "Understanding Ethereum Forks: Hard Forks vs Soft Forks\n\nEthereum is a decentralized blockchain platform that has undergone several forks throughout its history. Forks are upgrades or changes to the underlying protocol of a blockchain network, and they can be either hard forks or soft forks. Understanding the difference between these two types of forks is crucial for anyone interested in Ethereum and its development. In this article, we will explore the differences between hard forks and soft forks and their impact on the Ethereum community. So, if you are a newbie in ETH investment, here is a Guide for Investing in Ethereum.\n\nHard Forks\n\nA hard fork occurs when there is a significant change to the rules of the blockchain, resulting in a split from the original blockchain. This means that nodes that do not upgrade to the new rules will be unable to validate transactions on the new chain. Hard forks are usually initiated to introduce new features, fix critical bugs or address issues of network security.\n\nOne notable hard fork in Ethereum\u2019s history is the DAO fork. In 2016, the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), a venture capital fund on the Ethereum network, was hacked, resulting in the loss of millions of dollars worth of Ether. To recover the lost funds, a hard fork was proposed, which would essentially revert the blockchain to before the hack occurred. This hard fork was successful and resulted in the creation of a new chain, now known as Ethereum (ETH), while the original chain continued as Ethereum Classic (ETC).\n\nAnother example of a hard fork in Ethereum\u2019s history is the Constantinople fork, which was implemented in 2019 to address issues related to network efficiency and gas prices. The hard fork introduced several upgrades, including changes to the block rewards and improvements to the network\u2019s data storage capacity.\n\nHard forks can have a significant impact on the Ethereum community, as they can result in the creation of two separate chains with different rules and features. However, hard forks can also bring about improvements and enhancements to the network. It is important for members of the community to carefully consider the implications of a hard fork before deciding to support or oppose it.\n\nSoft Forks\n\nA soft fork, unlike a hard fork, is a backward-compatible upgrade to the blockchain, meaning that nodes that have not upgraded to the new rules can still validate transactions on the network. This is because the new rules are a subset of the old rules, meaning that older nodes can still participate in the network.\n\nOne example of a soft fork in Ethereum\u2019s history is the Homestead fork, which was implemented in 2016 to introduce new features and improve network security. The Homestead fork introduced changes to the protocol, including improvements to the gas pricing system and the addition of new opcodes to the Ethereum Virtual Machine.\n\nAnother example of a soft fork in Ethereum\u2019s history is the Byzantium fork, which was implemented in 2017 to introduce improvements related to network efficiency and security. The Byzantium fork introduced several changes, including a reduction in the block reward and the introduction of the \u201creplay attack\u201d protection mechanism.\n\nSoft forks are generally less disruptive than hard forks, as they do not result in a split in the network. However, they can still have a significant impact on the network and its users, particularly if the changes introduced are critical to the functioning of the network. It is important for members of the community to stay informed about soft forks and their implications.\n\nForks and Consensus\n\nIn Ethereum, forks are ultimately determined by the consensus of the network. Consensus is the process by which nodes on the network agree on the state of the blockchain. Consensus can be achieved through different mechanisms, including proof-of-work (PoW), proof-of-stake (PoS), or a hybrid of the two.\n\nIn the case of a hard fork, achieving consensus can be challenging, as some nodes may choose not to upgrade to the new rules. This can result in a split in the network, with some nodes continuing to validate transactions on the original chain and others validating transactions on the new chain.\n\nIn the case of a soft fork, achieving consensus is generally easier, as the new rules are a subset of the old rules, meaning that older nodes can still participate in the network. This makes it less likely that a split in the network will occur.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo sum up, Ethereum forks are a crucial part of the platform\u2019s development and evolution. Depending on the modifications they make, hard forks and soft forks have distinct ramifications and can be more or less divisive. Keeping up with forks and their possible effects on the network is crucial for community members. People can help the Ethereum ecosystem continue to expand and evolve by recognizing forks and their importance."
