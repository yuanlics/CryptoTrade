The groundbreaking ETP, with a 1.49% management fee, provides investors with a simplified gateway to Ethereum staking while benefiting from robust security enhancements.\n\n\n\n\n\nstaking while benefiting from robust security enhancements. Partnership with industry leaders like Copper Markets ( Switzerland ) AG and Blockdaemon ensures paramount security and a non-custodial staking environment for investors.\n\nZUG, Switzerland and TORONTO, Aug. 22, 2023 /PRNewswire/ - DeFi Technologies Inc. (the \"Company\" or \"DeFi Technologies\") (NEO: DEFI) (GR: MB9) (OTC: DEFTF), a crypto native technology company that pioneers the convergence of traditional capital markets with the world of decentralized finance (\"DeFi\"), is excited to announce that its subsidiary Valour Inc. (\"Valour\"), a leading issuer of exchange traded products (\"ETPs\") that provide simplified access to digital assets, has launched its 1Valour Ethereum Physical Staking ETP, set to redefine and simplify the Ethereum investment landscape. This innovative product aims to harness the essence of Ethereum while offering investors access to additional yield income opportunities.\n\nThe 1Valour Ethereum Physical Staking ETP (ISIN GB00BRBMZ19) is issued by Valour's new EU-wide issuance platform for physically stored digital assets Valour Digital Securities Limited (\"VDSL\"). This Jersey-based securities issuer has garnered approvals from both Swedish and Jersey regulatory entities and is underpinned by digital assets physically safeguarded by licensed custody providers.\n\nAvailable for trading on the Frankfurter Wertpapierboerse/ XETRA, the new staking ETP is poised to simplify network participation for investors. With a fixed yield, undefined expiry and a 1.49% management fee, investors have the potential to earn passive returns, sidestepping the technical challenges involved with staking, and actively contributing towards the evolving DeFi landscape. Enhanced security measures including slashing insurance and full collateralization mean investors benefit from additional transparency and security measures.\n\nCrypto staking represents a cornerstone in blockchain dynamics. It enables enthusiasts to immerse in the governance and consensus of Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchains, earning rewards for their contributions. Contrary to energy-hungry Proof-of-Work systems, PoS networks lean on validators who pledge assets to corroborate and usher new blocks. However, the staking landscape isn't without its intricacies \u2013 validators often grapple with asset lock-ups during bonding periods, as well as enduring unbonding spells prior to rewards being unlocked.\n\nOlivier Roussy Newton, CEO of Valour, comments, \"The 1Valour Ethereum Physical Staking ETP exemplifies Valour's commitment to creating innovative and trustworthy investment vehicles. We understand the challenges and complexities of crypto investments. Our mission is to bridge the gap, providing opportunities to enhance returns which are straightforward for our investors. In addition, all ETPs issued under the VDSL umbrella are endowed with the physical delivery option that might benefit investors based in Germany with a tax benefit after a holding period of one year.\"\n\nPartnering with elite entities like the VQF registered Copper Markets (Switzerland) AG for custody and industry stalwart Blockdaemon for staking services, Valour guarantees paramount security, ensuring a consistently collateralized, non-custodial staking environment.\n\nValour Inc. invites progressive investors to partake in this revolutionary venture, unlocking Ethereum's potential in the most accessible and safeguarded manner.\n\nIn addition to their novel digital asset platform, which includes 1Valour Bitcoin Physical Carbon Neutral ETP and Valour Digital Asset Basket 10 , Valour offers fully hedged digital asset ETPs with low to zero management fees, with product listings across European exchanges, banks and broker platforms. Valour's existing product range includes Valour Uniswap ( UNI ), Cardano ( ADA ), Polkadot ( DOT ), Solana ( SOL ), Avalanche ( AVAX ), Cosmos ( ATOM ), Binance ( BNB ), Enjin ( ENJ ), Bitcoin Carbon Neutral ( BTCN ) and Valour Digital Asset Basket 10 ( VDAB10 ) ETPs with low management fees.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn a concerning turn of events, Ethereum (ETH), the cornerstone of the crypto market, is teetering on the edge of a scenario reminiscent of 2019, ringing alarm bells among the investor community. Diving deep into the charts, renowned crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen has surfaced with a noteworthy insight that raises concerns for the altcoin giant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe crux of the matter lies in ETH's breach of the dynamic support line, signified by the Bull Market Support Band indicator. This echoes a pattern last witnessed over four years ago. Back then, Ethereum suffered a pivotal level loss, paving the way for a tumultuous six-month journey where its value plummeted by a staggering 48%, only finding reprieve by the close of December 2019.\n\nIn 2019, #ETH fell below its Bull Market Support Band in July/August, just as it has in 2023. pic.twitter.com/36v6BEDch1 \u2014 Benjamin Cowen (@intocryptoverse) August 22, 2023\n\nWith history appearing to echo itself, the stakes are high for ETH's journey through the remainder of this year and the advent of 2024. An unsettling projection arises from Cowen's analysis, spotlighting the potential for Ethereum to slide toward the $900 mark per token.\n\nConvergence of perspectives\n\nNotably, Cowen is not the sole voice predicting such an outcome. Just a day prior, crypto analyst Ali Martinez , renowned in his own right, also foresaw a comparable fate for Ethereum based on meticulous technical analysis. Martinez articulated that Ethereum's fall beneath the $1,600-$1,550 range could lay the groundwork for a substantial correction ranging from 37% to 45%, ultimately targeting the $1,000 mark.\n\nAs the situation continues to evolve, it is increasingly evident that dark clouds are amassing over Ethereum, casting a shadow of uncertainty not only on the altcoin itself but also on the broader crypto market."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s number of wallets in loss reached a seven-month high\n\nMetrics and market indicators suggested that ETH\u2019s price might decline further\n\nOver the last few months, Ethereum [ETH] witnessed a decline in its network activity. This was the case as the blockchain\u2019s monthly average active addresses dropped.\n\nThe monthly average of active ETH addresses stood lower than the yearly average. This clearly indicated low activity, which could be taken as a bearish signal. While the blockchain\u2019s network activity declined, its price also failed to shoot up.\n\nIs Ethereum\u2019s reluctance to push its price up a consequence of less network activity?\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nThe reason for ETH\u2019s price drop\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, ETH was down by more than 9% in the last seven days, reflecting its sluggish behavior. At the time of writing, it was trading at $1,670.05 with a market capitalization of over $200 billion.\n\nThe price drop had a major impact on investors\u2019 portfolios. As per Glassnode Alerts\u2019 tweet, the number of ETH addresses in loss reached a seven-month high of 42,602,870.333.\n\nHowever, upon taking a closer look, the reason behind the downtrend might not have been less network activity. This was because while ETH\u2019s active addresses dropped, Layer-2s like Base, Optimism [OP], and rollups gained popularity.\n\nThe primary reason behind market participants shifting to L2s was that they offered more scalability. For reference, Coinbase\u2019s L2 Base bridged $251 million, with ETH accounting for $155 million out of the total within days of launch.\n\nA closer look at Ethereum\u2019s state\n\nA look at Ethereum\u2019s on-chain performance gave a better understanding of what was going on in the ecosystem. Upon checking, it was revealed that investors in funds and trusts, including Grayscale, have relatively weak buying sentiment.\n\nAdditionally, as per CryptoQuant, ETH\u2019s net deposit on exchanges was high compared to the seven-day average, suggesting high selling pressure. However, it was interesting to see that when ETH fell victim to the latest price correction, investors took it as an opportunity to increase accumulation.\n\nThis was evident from Glassnode Alerts\u2019 tweet, which pointed out that Ethereum\u2019s exchange outflow volume reached a one-month high during that period.\n\n? #Ethereum $ETH Exchange Outflow Volume (7d MA) just reached a 1-month high of 9,627.006 ETH Previous 1-month high of 9,608.990 ETH was observed on 20 August 2023 View metric:https://t.co/LzFffVHu6i pic.twitter.com/dhJIEP4CZO \u2014 glassnode alerts (@glassnodealerts) August 21, 2023\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today\n\nNot only metrics, but a few market indicators were also bearish. For example, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) displayed a bullish edge in the market.\n\nFurthermore, ETH\u2019s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) also registered a downtick, increasing the chances of a price decline. Nonetheless, the Money Flow Index (MFI) rebounded from the oversold zone, which can help the token increase its price."

        "content": "Qadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nStory Highlights ETH price action gives the bearish breakdown of the pennant pattern.\n\nThe downtrend tests the dominance at $1600.\n\nA downfall below $1600 will potentially crash the ETH prices to $1491.\n\nAs predicted in our last ETH price analysis, the ETH prices fail to rise above the $1700 mark, leading to a bearish continuation. With a 2.53% drop, Ethereum breaks into the demand block above $1600.\n\nEntering deep into the previously demand-marked territory, the ETH price action displays lower price rejection with long tails. Becoming a lucrative asset at a discounted price, Ethereum finds a short recovery phase as sellers also get exhausted.\n\nBreaking the short-term support trendline, the ETH price action falls to $1581 before the buyers step in to push the closing at $1634. With high demand at lower levels, Ethereum may find some chances to avoid further downfall.\n\nCurrently, ETH price trades at $1640 with an intraday gain of 0.37% following the 2% drop last night.\n\nOpen Interests On A Downhill\n\nOpen interest is the number of outstanding contracts (both long and short) on a particular derivative instrument. When open interest increases, it means that more people are betting, which can lead to more volatility and liquidity. This generally means the continuation of the set trend.\n\nHowever, as Ethereum\u2019s Open Interest (OI) decreases from $5.125 billion to $3.604 billion, it means investors are closing their futures positions. This could cause a short squeeze, which is a sudden price movement in the positive direction.\n\nWill Ethereum Prices Find A Recoil Rally?\n\nDespite the recent fall, the ETH price action highlights the lower price rejections from the $1600 demand block. Moreover, the technical indicators reflect a solid buying pressure present to absorb the supply inflow.\n\nIgnoring the downtrend in the 4H chart, the daily RSI line maintains a positive trend reflecting a bullish divergence. It even highlights a solid buying pressure at the $1600 demand block. Furthermore, the MACD indicator also showcases a bullish divergence but struggles to sustain the positive alignment.\n\nTherefore, the 4H chart gives a bullish Ethereum price prediction with a recoil recovery from $1600. With initial targets at $1700 and $1790, the uptrend may soon retest the broken support trendline.\n\nOn the flip side, in case of a $1600 breakdown, the Ethereum price can challenge the psychological mark of $1500."

        "content": "00:00\n\nPaul, I want to first get your take on the FCC case, maybe not as as a judge, but just as someone who watches crypto. How important was it that Ripple won at least part of that case? So I think it was actually pretty important because any step forward towards clarity is a positive step. And I think if you look at the draft legislation that's coming from Congress, it's very, very reasonable. And so all of these things, I hope, are converging towards pressure towards we should have more clarity of rules. And I think what Meltem said in your introduction was fantastic. She's right on target. Clarity is good for business. And hopefully between the legal decisions and the pending legislation, we're getting there in one small step at a time. Okay. So as we talk about the pending decisions around what is and is not a security, also all waiting with bated breath each and every day to see if a spot ETF approval actually may come or grayscale may actually have its ruling come down in the D.C. Circuit Court. Didn't happen today. We'll see if it happens on Friday. So we'll all wait for that. In regard to futures, though, and that potential ETF, that one seems like it it maybe is more likely. What real difference would that make, Paul? So I think it would make an enormous difference because we're really starting and your prior guest was amazing on this topic. We're really starting to see the difference between Bitcoin, which is a kind of digital gold, and people want to see it as potentially an inflation hedge or a global asset versus Etherium, which is becoming a global computing infrastructure. And so by having ETF for the two separate ones and specifically having Etherium ETFs, you can start to sort of take a stake in the Etherium ecosystem in the cash flow of transactions, in the value of the overall asset infrastructure that's being built there. And for people to see these two properly as separate. I think it's really important for the development of the overall marketplace. Okay. So on the subject of Etherium, you are a somewhat expert on the subject. You actually just wrote a book that was released earlier this summer, Etherium for business. It's called A Plain English Guide to How to use cases that generate returns from asset as asset management to payments to supply chains. Paul How should businesses be thinking about using this technology? So we have a very simple thing at UI, which is that we believe blockchains are going to be the glue that tie business ecosystems together. And even though everyone tends to focus on finance and DEFI and SEC rulings, in fact, Etherium is an incredible infrastructure for tokenizing assets tracking supply chains. If we look at the kind of things that we talk, I talk about in the book and that we're doing it why they are tokenizing carbon offsets, tokenizing carbon traceability, tracking pharmaceuticals, managing procurement agreements. Right. There's a tremendous amount of operational business stuff, none of which is finance related, but is essential for how companies interact with each other. And Etherium provides a neutral, decentralized infrastructure in which enterprises can transact with each other on a level equal terms. On the subject of things being level, is this a zero sum game, Paul? Are we going to head into a world where one chain actually is dominant? Etherium Perhaps. So I do believe that. I think if you look historically at the world of computing infrastructure, we like standards, right? Basically, a single operating system represents 90% of all PCs. Two operating systems represent more than 95% of all phones. We like standard standard scale really well. So I think we are headed for a global infrastructure where Etherium is the global base layer standard for digital business transactions in the same way that TCP IP is a global network standard and that others over time will gradually wither away. Just like 20 or 30 years ago, we used to have an alphabet soup of different networking standards and now we just have TCP IP. That reminds me that I love the metric system. Paul And we're kind of nowhere there in the US. Are we going to face a similar disadvantage when it comes to the global blockchain? I mean, is the US regulating itself out of competition here or not regulating itself into competition? I worry that there is some risk of that happening. I just actually got back from four weeks in Asia and it's very clear Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore and additionally Europe and the Middle East. These are all places that are moving really forward. If we look at kind of our volume of work and deals, we're up in every sector and we're up in every geography. But the places that are growing the fastest by by far in terms of our blockchain and core crypto work are Europe in preparation for the MICA Assets law and Hong Kong, which is growing rapidly at us as China tries to reopen, and then obviously Dubai in the Middle East where the regulatory environment is maturing very quickly. So the US is growing again and that part is good. And I've been telling all the people in our team, you know, summer is coming, but we are definitely lagging compared to other regions."

        "content": "After weeks of consolidation below a significant resistance level, Ethereum\u2019s price has finally demonstrated a large move to the downside.\n\nWhile there are still many support levels available, things are not looking good for ETH.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy: Edris\n\nThe Daily Chart:\n\nOn the daily chart, the price has dropped sharply below the $1,750 level and the key 200-day moving average, located around the $1,800 mark. The mentioned moving average is one of the most important trend indicators, and the market is considered to be in a bearish phase when the price trades below it.\n\nCurrently, the short-term $1,650 support level is holding the price, as a bullish pullback seems probable. Yet, the market structure has shifted bearish with the recent decline, and a retest of the $1,400 level looks probable in the coming weeks.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart:\n\nLooking at the 4-hour timeframe, it is evident that the price dropped below the large descending channel a few days ago. This breakdown has resulted in the decline being aggravated, with a large wick piercing through the $1,650 level.\n\nHowever, the mentioned level has successfully supported the price until now. The RSI indicator has also recovered from the oversold region, pointing to a potential consolidation in the short term. Yet, looking at the recent price action, lower prices are still likely.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nBy: Edris\n\nEthereum Open Interest\n\nAfter weeks of consolidation in a tight range, Ethereum\u2019s price experienced a sudden drop over the last few days. These sudden price moves are usually caused by futures market liquidations.\n\nThis chart demonstrates the Open Interest metric, which measures the total number of open positions in the perpetual futures markets. High values mostly lead to volatility.\n\nAs the chart depicts, the recent decline was accompanied by a sharp decrease in Open Interest. Therefore, it could be interpreted that the futures market was once again responsible for the recent drop, as the significant reduction in Open Interest indicates that the market went through a long liquidation cascade.\n\nAs a result, more stable price action can be expected in the short term, with fewer leveraged positions open at the moment."

Discover SCENE\n\nThere are now more daily transactions on Ethereum layer-2 Base, which was incubated and launched by Coinbase, than on Ethereum\u2014fueled in large part by the hype around social app Friend.tech.\n\nThe latest data from digital asset analytics platform Artemis Terminal shows that daily transactions on Base hit 1.37 million yesterday while on Ethereum, they stood at little over 1 million.\n\nBase is American crypto exchange Coinbase's latest product: An Ethereum scaling solution which promises to make it quicker, easier and cheaper for developers to build apps. But Coinbase has been adamant that Base will be decentralized, meaning the company's role in its governance will diminish over time.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSan Francisco-based Coinbase has said the chain will be open ecosystem for millions of new decentralized apps.\n\nAnd it has taken off with lots of projects and their tokens but right now mainly because of Friend.tech, a new decentralized social media platform build on Base which has exploded with popularity.\n\nThe reason? Friend.tech is a Twitter-linked crypto app which lets users buy and sell shares of their friends\u2019 social media profiles\u2014and it's being lapped up by celebs. It's worth noting that Ethereum researcher Evan Van Ness and Flashbots product lead Robert Miller have pointed out on Twitter: There are signs that a large portion of the transactions on Base are coming from bots and spammers trying to get an edge on Friend.tech.\n\nStill, the app's boom in popularity means that transactions are soaring on Base as more people sign up to use the app.\n\nSince its launch, the total amount generated in protocol fees is fast closing in on $6 million, according to DeFi Llama data.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe mobile platform links to Twitter accounts and tokenizes them; users who buy \"keys\" to another account gain exclusive access to that user's private chat room\u2014and ostensibly the value of that user's token, whether it rises or falls.\n\nBut Base is still lagging behind Ethereum, the second biggest blockchain, in other metrics: Volumes on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) is still the highest on Ethereum-based ones, at 836 million. On Base, which stands at a mere 8.25 million.\n\nAnd the total value locked in Base protocols is at 180 million; on Ethereum it's over 22 billion."

This new product can be applied for in less than 10 minutes and offers a free digital version, with the option of a physical version delivered in no more than three days.\n\nOn September 22, 2022, Crecy broke into the Mexican market with its credit card backed by Mastercard and Ethereum, setting a milestone in LATAM. With more than 25 million long-term investors in cryptocurrencies, known as HODLers, in the region, Crecy\u2019s card provides them a way to instantly unlock their crypto assets\u2019 financial potential.\n\nThe card allows users to purchase Mexican pesos without selling their tokens, with financing options of up to 12 months. Additionally, the card has no annual fees and offers a significantly lower CAT (Total Annual Cost) than any other credit card on the market. It can be used at over 90 million establishments worldwide that accept Mastercard.\n\nInitial access to the card was granted in September 2022 to 100 early adopters and holders of Crecy\u2019s exclusive NFT, the \u201cCrecy Card NFT.\u201d However, a public version backed by NEAR tokens was launched in April 2022.\n\nFor the future, Crecy plans to incorporate features such as cashback in Crecy Coins, cryptocurrency on/off-ramping, a crypto-linked card for real-time spending, and a yield generation tool.\n\nThis new crypto-backed credit card service is made in collaboration with Meta Pool, a significant player in the world of crypto asset staking like NEAR and ETH.\n\nCrecy\u2019s launch comes at a time when interest in cryptocurrencies in Latin America is booming, with a flow of USD $562 billion in crypto assets to the region between July 2021 and June 2022.\n\nFounded in 2020, Crecy has previously raised USD $633,000 in pre-seed funding from investors such as Mucker Capital, Platanus Ventures, 500 Global LatAm, CAPEM, and angel investors.

        "title": "Why data availability sampling matters for blockchain scaling - Blockworks",
        "content": "On-chain data availability has become an increasingly common topic as Ethereum continues to scale.\n\nToday, Ethereum developers are looking at where and how data should be stored on blockchain networks as they work towards resolving the so-called blockchain trilemma, referring to the tradeoffs between security, scalability and decentralization.\n\nIn crypto, data availability refers to the concept that data that is stored on a network is accessible and retrievable by all network participants.\n\nOn Ethereum layer-1, the network\u2019s nodes download all the data in each block, making it difficult for invalid transactions to be executed.\n\nAlthough this can guarantee security, this process can be relatively inefficient \u2014 asking a network node to verify and store all data in a block can drastically reduce throughput and hinder blockchain scalability.\n\nEthereum layer-2 scaling solutions are designed to resolve this problem.\n\nOne popular solution today is the optimistic rollup, such as Arbitrum and Optimism. Optimistic rollups are \u201coptimistic\u201d in nature as they assume transactions are valid until proven otherwise.\n\nMost rollups today only have one single sequencer, meaning there is a centralization risk, Anurag Arjun, co-founder of modular blockchain Avail, told Blockworks.\n\nThis is not a major problem at present, as rollup solutions must put the raw transaction data on Ethereum using something called calldata \u2014 the cheapest form of storage on Ethereum today, as Arjun notes.\n\nOnce a calldata is submitted to Ethereum mainnet, anyone can challenge whether or not it is accurate within a set period of time, according to Neel Somani, the founder of blockchain scaling solution Eclipse.\n\nIf no one challenges the validity of the rollup, it will be accepted on Ethereum once the period of time is up.\n\nThe problem, Somani notes, is how someone can then prove that a transaction was executed inaccurately if they don\u2019t have the data.\n\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t tell you what I executed, there\u2019s no way for you to possibly prove that it is wrong, so you need to know exactly what I executed in order to fix that,\u201d Somani said. \u201cSo all blockchains must prove data availability in some way, shape or form.\u201d\n\nData availability sampling\n\nAs all blockchains must prove data availability, it can be inefficient to download a full block onto a network, which again invokes the initial data availability problem.\n\n\u201cSo as someone who doesn\u2019t want to download the full block, I still want the confidence that the information on the block is not being withheld,\u201d Somani said.\n\nThe solution, according to Somani, is the use of data availability sampling to gain confidence that the block is actually there.\n\nData availability sampling involves sampling random parts of the block to obtain arbitrarily high confidence that the block is there, Somani explains.\n\nThis technology utilizes polynomials \u2014 a mathematical expression comprising variables, coefficients and exponentiation \u2014 to model relationships between variables in a block.\n\nA common misinterpretation of data availability sampling is that if you sample half the block, you only gain 50% confidence that the information in the block is accurate, Somani said. This isn\u2019t true, he explains, because as with data availability sampling, users must make sure that they have enough points to recover the original polynomial.\n\nProjects like Celestia and Avail are currently building out data availability sampling solutions.\n\n\u201cWhat we sincerely believe is that every base layer is going to be a data availability layer,\u201d Arjun told Blockworks. \u201cThe main directional fight that we are having is wanting to scale data availability at the base layer, and have execution and roll up on the second layer.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

Proof-of-stake assets\u2014such as Ethereum (ETH)\u2014pledge it to the network by sending it to a specific blockchain address and can receive rewards for doing so.\n\nIt\u2019s a controversial issue in the states and Wall Street\u2019s biggest regulator, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has gone after major crypto exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken with fines.\n\nThe SEC alleged in February that Kraken failed to register the offer and sale of its crypto asset staking-as-a-service program and hit it with a $30 million fine. In June, it sued Coinbase, alleging that the San Francisco-based company offered and sold unregistered securities via its staking service.\n\nBitstamp added that customers will continue earning staking rewards up until September 25 but after that, all staked assets will be unstaked. They\u2019ll then be credited to users\u2019 Bitstamp wallets, the company said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe exchange earlier this month announced that U.S. customers would no longer be able to trade Axie Infinity (AXS), Chiliz (CHZ), Decentraland (MANA), Polygon (MATIC), NEAR Protocol (NEAR), The Sandbox (SAND), and Solana (SOL) on its platform."

        "content": "Introducing Zeth \u2014The First Type 0 zkEVM\n\nSEATTLE, Aug. 22, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- RISC Zero , developers of leading general purpose zero-knowledge (ZK) virtual machine technology, today announced Zeth , a first-of-its-kind \"Type 0\" (fully Ethereum-compatible) zkEVM built on the RISC Zero zkVM and Bonsai proving service . Zeth is a new way of architecting L2's and scaling Ethereum, making this milestone release a significant step forward for ZK tech and the Ethereum ecosystem. Zeth paves the way for unprecedented ease in building powerful and efficient ZK infrastructure such as ZK rollups, ZK light clients, and ZK bridges.\n\nType 0: A new category of zkEVM\n\nIntroducing Zeth \u2014The First Type 0 zkEVM Post this\n\nEthereum was not originally designed around ZK-friendliness, so there are many parts of the protocol that take a large amount of computation to ZK-prove. Type 1 aims to replicate Ethereum exactly, and so it has no way of mitigating these inefficiencies. At present, proofs for Ethereum blocks take many hours to produce. However, using Zeth, Ethereum blocks can be proven in minutes.\n\n\"This is a watershed moment for the blockchain industry and the Ethereum ecosystem \u2013 Zeth is a compelling example of RISC Zero's mission to maximize the utility of zero-knowledge cryptography. Our technology allowed Zeth to be built at a tiny fraction of the cost of similar efforts; RISC Zero's zkVM can be used by any team to build innovative new offerings in record time.\" said Brian Retford, CEO and Co-Founder of RISC Zero.\n\nRoughly one year ago, Vitalik published The different types of ZK-EVMs . Zeth was built using standard Rust crates \u2014 the same crates used by popular full nodes like Reth . Because it makes no changes to Ethereum semantics and reuses code from popular Ethereum node software, Zeth is a new category of zkEVMs \u2014 Type 0 zkEVM (fully Ethereum compatibility and high code reuse).\n\nZK rollups and zkEVMs\n\nExisting ZK rollups and zkEVM circuits are monolithic in design and lack upgradability without a high level understanding of ZK cryptography from the developer. In contrast, RISC Zero's zkVM-based approach to Zeth enables any developer to customize and modify to suit their needs.\n\nZeth makes it possible to ZK prove a given Ethereum block without relying on a validator or sync committee in minutes. And with RISC Zero's support for onchain verification , anyone can cheaply verify those proofs on chain . Zeth provides everything needed to generate ZK proofs for EVM-based blocks. This is a key component in any zkEVM or bridge.\n\nZeth, based on revm , and can easily be adapted to support other zkEVMs and EVM-compatible chains. This ensures easy updates to Zeth for future EIPs while providing modularity that enables developers to build their own block construction logic into Zeth.\n\nAs a Type 0 zkEVM, Zeth enables developers to build ZK rollups with completely native EVM and Ethereum support. Zeth is open source , so developers can easily modify and use it in their projects. The proofs can be verified onchain (perfect for bridges and L2s) or in native apps (perfect for full nodes and light clients). For any teams and projects looking to collaborate/build on RISC Zero, please fill out this form .\n\nTo start building with Zeth, go to https://github.com/risc0/zeth\n\nAbout RISC Zero\n\nRISC Zero is revolutionizing the internet by creating the infrastructure and tooling for Web3 developers around the globe to build zero-knowledge proof software. The project is on a mission to empower Web3 developers to build with the latest zero knowledge technology, enabling individuals worldwide to leverage its benefits. Backed by notable investors, including Blockchain Capital and Bain Capital Crypto, RISC Zero has raised a $40M Series A.\n\nSOURCE Risc Zero"

        "title": "Ethereum\u2019s Bullish Breakout Looms As Exchange Reserve Hits 5-Year Low! Where\u2019s ETH Price Heading Next? - Coinpedia Fintech News",
        "content": "After the market downturn, Bitcoin experienced a decline of over 10% from its crucial $28K mark, with Ethereum reflecting a similar pattern. Presently, despite being aware of the upcoming launch of Ethereum futures ETF in October, both investors and large-scale holders are actively liquidating their holdings. Yet, a promising metric remains that is bringing confidence, suggesting Ethereum could be on the brink of a breakout.\n\nBullish Signal For Ethereum As Exchange Reserve Touches 5-Year Low\n\nAs per Coinglass, traders are consistently offloading their positions, even during slight upticks. In just the past two days, positions worth over $10 million were liquidated, with bullish traders accounting for approximately $6.5 million of that amount. This indicates that Ethereum could encounter significant sell-offs if it tries to climb from its current level, potentially keeping the price confined within a specific range.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s a bullish metric that is holding promises of a breakout in the ETH price. Data from CryptoQuant reveals that the Exchange Reserve metric has been declining steeply this year, now reaching its 5-year low of 148 million ETH. This level was previously reached on 6 August 2018, when the Ethereum price was trading around $400.\n\nThe graph above illustrates that Ethereum\u2019s exchange reserve experienced a decrease in 2021, but the decline became more pronounced in 2022. The metric in this context is the \u201call exchanges\u201d variant, getting data from both spot and derivative trading platforms.\n\nWhen this metric rises, it indicates holders are moving their coins to exchanges, likely to swap ETH or cash out. This can increase the asset\u2019s selling supply, potentially driving prices down. Conversely, a decrease suggests reduced selling supply, indicating holders are accumulating and remain bullish on Ethereum. Despite low prices, more ETH is being bought and withdrawn from exchanges, intensifying the supply shock, a bullish scenario for Ethereum.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next For ETH Price?\n\nEther\u2019s recovery is facing significant resistance at $1,695, suggesting that sellers are still active and taking advantage of small price surges. However, buyers continue to defend the $1,645 level strongly. As of writing, ETH price trades at $1,656, declining over 0.7% in the last 24 hours.\n\nA weak rebound often points to a lack of energy from buyers. This increases the possibility of an immediate decline below the strong support. If the price decreases and falls below $1,645, it would indicate the continued dominance of the bears. Following this, the ETH price might approach the recent low of $1,550.\n\nOn the other hand, if the price surges from its present position and surpasses the upward trend line at $1,700, it could signal the beginning of a strong recovery. The initial target might be above the 50-day EMA at $1,720. If the price goes beyond this, it could aim for $1,860."

        "content": "Crypto exchange Bitstamp will discontinue staking services for customers based in the United States. In a message shared with Cointelegraph, the exchange announced the ending of Ether (ETH) staking as of Sept. 25.\n\n\u201cCustomers will continue earning staking rewards up until September 25, 2023, and after that, all staked assets will be unstaked. Rewards, along with the principal, will be credited to users\u2019 main Bitstamp account balances,\" said Bobby Zagotta, U.S. CEO and global chief commercial officer at Bitstamp, warning that it could take a few days for users\u2019 balances to reflect the changes.\n\nAccording to Bitstamp\u2019s website, it charges a 15% commission on all staking rewards. The monthly reward rate for staking ETH on the exchange is 4.50%; by comparison, the monthly reward for staking Algorand (ALGO) is 1.60%. With the move, the U.S. joins other countries where Bitstamp staking services aren't available, including Canada, Japan, Singapore and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe decision appears to be related to recent legal developments in the United States. In early August, Bitstamp announced at least seven altcoins would no longer be offered in the country. They were Axie Infinity (AXS), Chiliz (CHZ), Decentraland (MANA), Polygon (MATIC), Near (NEAR), The Sandbox (SAND) and Solana (SOL). While the company didn\u2019t specify why it suspended trading, all seven tokens were deemed unregistered securities by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in June as part of its lawsuits against crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase.\n\nUpdate for our US users\n\n\n\nStarting August 29: AXS, CHZ, MANA, MATIC, NEAR, SAND, and SOL trading will be halted after evaluating recent market developments.\n\n\n\nExecute any open trades. Holding and withdrawing tokens afterwards will be unaffected.\n\n\n\nMore info:\u2026 \u2014 Bitstamp (@Bitstamp) August 8, 2023\n\nEther is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain and the second largest by market cap behind Bitcoin (BTC). A central issue surrounding the ongoing regulatory environment in the U.S. relates to whether ETH could be classified as a commodity or a security. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has repeatedly called Ether a commodity, while SEC Chair Gary Gensler said at a hearing in April that Bitcoin was a commodity but would not specify whether ETH should be deemed a security.\n\nMagazine: Crypto regulation \u2014 Does SEC Chair Gary Gensler have the final say?"

When he's not analyzing the markets, Sohrab indulges in his hobbies of graphic design, minimal design or listening to his favorite hip-hop tunes.\n\nEthereum, like many altcoins, began the week in the red, experiencing a significant downtrend. The breach of its upward trendline added to the challenges, with the coin\u2019s price showing resilience above the crucial $1600 support level. However, concerns have arisen as the price could potentially decline by 27% to $1,200, with another support at $1,366 likely to slow the fall.\n\nTechnical indicators are aligned with this bearish sentiment. The higher EMA 100 crossed beneath the lower EMA 50, a bearish signal. The daily chart further reveals a drop below $1,750 and the vital 200-day moving average at $1,800.\n\nAnalysts are expressing worries about ETH\u2019s price trajectory, drawing parallels to a similar situation in 2019. A crypto analyst, Benjamin Cowen, highlighted the importance of a broken support line indicated by the Bull Market Support Band indicator. This scenario, reminiscent of four years ago, saw a 48% decline in ETH value over six months, followed by a gradual recovery.\n\nIn 2019, #ETH fell below its Bull Market Support Band in July/August, just as it has in 2023. pic.twitter.com/36v6BEDch1 \u2014 Benjamin Cowen (@intocryptoverse) August 22, 2023\n\nSimilarly, crypto analyst Ali Martinez foresees a significant drop if Ethereum falls below $1,550, projecting a 37% to 45% decrease to $1,000.\n\nDespite the uncertainty, Ethereum\u2019s outlook remains mixed. Vitalik Buterin\u2019s transfer of $1 million worth of ETH to Coinbase and the Ethereum Investment Fund (ETF) may influence the market. The coin\u2019s advanced mechanism system also holds potential. This leaves the market divided between bearish and bullish sentiments, while ETH is currently trading at $1,666."

Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) price remains in the woods.\n\nAlso Read: If things do not improve, another miner-induced sell-off is likely for Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin price could slump further unless conditions change\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price signals the continuation of a downward trend as prices shifted onto a bearish trajectory after breaking below the ascending trendline. Since the start of the year, price movements have adhered to an ascending channel following a substantial consolidation period. However, by market capitalization, the leading cryptocurrency underwent another consolidation phase in late July.\n\nNotably, last week, Bitcoin price breached this consolidation, descending beneath the lower boundary of the ascending channel, thereby instigating a bearish sentiment.\n\nThe pivotal support level of $26,012 holds significance, having previously functioned as a robust resistance threshold. A breach and subsequent close beneath this level would contribute to the existing downward trend, potentially propelling prices toward the critical psychological milestone of $20,000. This equates to a decline of approximately 23% from the current price level.\n\nIn conjunction, the Awesome Oscillator (AO) histograms provide clear support for the downward trajectory, evidenced by the prevalence of red and elongated bodies. Similarly, the Williams Percentage R Indicator operates within the oversold range of -80, indicating persistent short-position opportunities.\n\nHowever, the Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) positioning introduces an exciting facet. With the 50-period EMA situated above the 100-period EMA, there are indications of potential positive movements. This implies the possibility for a minor price retracement before an eventual breach of the critical $26,000 support.\n\nThe more prudent approach, therefore, would involve awaiting price confirmation below the $26,000 level before considering entry into a short position.\n\nBTC/USD 1-day chart\n\nConversely, a resurgence by sidelined investors could restore Bitcoin price into the bullish technical formation, with the potential to breach the $30,699 resistance level.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin CME gaps at $35,000, $27,000, and $21,000. Which one gets filled first?\n\nEthereum price could fall amid bearish indicators\n\nEthereum (ETH) price shows an impending downward trajectory, substantiated by the breach of the ascending trendline. The breach has also led to a dip below the critical support level of $1,687. This development has paved the way for a potential 27% price reduction, potentially reaching the psychological benchmark of $1,200, with intermediate support of $1,366.\n\nAdditional technical indicators reinforce these observations. The higher EMA 100 has recently intersected with the lower EMA 50 from a downward perspective, signifying a bearish market trend. Similarly, the histograms of the AO have transitioned to red, with robust bodies positioned beneath the zero line, indicative of heightened selling pressure.\n\nGiven this scenario, traders could consider initiating short positions in the market after a confirmed closure below the $1,620 level.\n\nETH/USD 1-day chat\n\nOn the other hand, the position of the RSI within the oversold region points to a forthcoming price reversal. If momentum is nurtured, Ethereum price could steadily restore above the $1,687 support level and elevate above the ascending trendline in a highly bullish case. Such a move would increase the chances of a continued uptrend, with a decisive foray above $2,029 confirming the uptrend.\n\nAlso Read: SEC could approve multiple Ether ETFs soon while delaying Bitcoin spot ETFs\n\nRipple price eyes key levels as the downtrend continues\n\nRipple (XRP) price reflects a significant retracement of the recent gains accrued after the favorable resolution of the SEC case. At present, indications of a continued downward trajectory are becoming apparent. The current price movement follows the path delineated by the 200-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA).\n\nThe broader context conveyed by various indicators suggests a likelihood of further price depreciation, potentially reaching the $0.411 level. This level holds significance as the second support threshold, coinciding with the lower boundary of the channel (denoted by the blue color) initiated in June. Should this level prove inadequate in upholding the value of XRP, an extended descent toward the $0.287 level becomes probable, signifying a substantial decline of approximately 45% from the current price.\n\nAn analysis of the MACD histograms shows the continuation of the southerly trajectory, substantiated by the histograms consistently manifesting in the negative region below the zero line. Furthermore, the Stochastic Oscillator's northward orientation corroborates the prevailing bearish sentiment.\n\nFollowing this analysis, the recommended course of action involves waiting for confirmation of price closure below the descending grey trendline before considering entry into a short position.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, a descending grey trendline offers preliminary support to the cryptocurrency pair, possibly facilitating a brief retracement. If the Ripple price sustains above this line, the odds of a move north increase. However, invalidation of the current bearish outlook would only occur once XRP surpasses the upper boundary of the chart pattern.\n\nAlso Read: XRP price rally to $0.60 likely with recovery fueled by developments in SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit"

        "title": "How to unlock Ethereum's potential: the complete guide to Optimism - OKX",
        "content": "Ethereum is a dynamic platform that caters to many transactions and applications, from Decentralized Finance (DeFi) to gaming, and even Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). But, a prominent challenge it faces is scalability. As it stands, Ethereum can handle about 30 transactions every second.\n\nThe reason for this limitation is rooted in Ethereum's foundational values, because it prioritizes decentralization and security. While these principles bolster the network's trustworthiness and resilience, they also impose constraints on its transactional speed or throughput. When the network demand is higher, so are the gas fees for transactions, which can be astronomical \u2014 especially for new blockchain adopters.\n\nLayer 2 (L2) can offer some tangible solutions to help enhance blockchain scalability and speed by processing transactions off the main chain (layer 1) and then periodically consolidating them. This reduces congestion and fees, allowing faster transactions without sacrificing security or decentralization. Their adoption is vital for blockchains to accommodate more users and applications.\n\nWhat is Optimism (OP)?\n\nEthereum L2 represents a suite of solutions crafted to augment Ethereum's capacity. These solutions process transactions away from the primary Ethereum blockchain, known as Layer 1 or L1.\n\nWhile these transactions are handled off the main blockchain, they still enjoy the robust security and decentralization features that Ethereum inherently offers. Think of L2 as an auxiliary system meticulously designed to expand Ethereum's transactional capabilities.\n\nLayer 2's primary mission is scalability. It adeptly manages multiple transactions, ensuring Ethereum's ecosystem is not overwhelmed. On the flip side, Ethereum's L1 has its plate full of pivotal responsibilities; it's the bastion of the system's security, data accessibility, and, crucially, decentralization.\n\nThis dynamic partnership between L1 and L2 makes sure that while the system scales up its transactional might, it doesn't compromise on its foundational security principles.\n\nOptimism as a layer 2\n\nOptimism serves as a L2 solution constructed atop the foundational Ethereum blockchain. Its inception addresses two pressing concerns for Ethereum users: exorbitant transaction fees and occasional sluggishness in transaction processing times.\n\nHow does Optimism achieve this?\n\nInstead of processing every transaction directly on the Ethereum mainnet (L1), Optimism acts as an intermediary layer where most of the transactional activity occurs. Optimism can expedite these processes by shifting much of the transactional workload off the main chain, offering users a quicker transactional experience.\n\nHowever, it's essential to understand that while the bulk of the transaction activity happens on Optimism, it doesn't operate in isolation. To ensure security and integrity, the data from these transactions is relayed back to the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nThe data undergoes validation, benefiting from Ethereum's robust security protocols. This dual-layer mechanism helps to make sure that while users enjoy swifter and more cost-effective transactions on Optimism, they can remain confident in the integrity and security of their operations, thanks to the validation on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nHow does Optimism work?\n\nIn the traditional Ethereum network, every transaction is processed on the main chain, preserving security but sometimes leading to congestion and high fees. Optimistic Rollups is a technology to shift most of the transaction processing away from the main Ethereum chain.\n\nWhen a user initiates a transaction on Optimism, it takes place on this L2 solution instead of directly on the Ethereum mainnet. This L2 is a separate blockchain running alongside Ethereum.Here's what the flow looks like:\n\nUser intent: A user initiates a transaction using Optimism on an app or platform.\n\nTransaction processing: Instead of directly broadcasting the transaction to the Ethereum mainnet, it's first processed on the Optimistic L2. This allows for faster and cheaper transactions because L2 is designed for high throughput.\n\nSubmission to Ethereum: Once processed, these transactions are then sent to the Ethereum mainnet in batches, instead of individually, reducing the overall load on the mainnet.\n\nEthereum as a data availability layer\n\nWhile Optimism deals with the bulk of transaction processing, Ethereum\u2019s mainnet still plays a vital role. It acts as the final source of truth and as a data availability layer.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nEvery transaction processed on Optimism is eventually recorded on the Ethereum mainnet. This is done by sending a cryptographic proof (a sort of summary) of all the transactions that occurred on Optimism. Even though the mainnet doesn\u2019t need to process each transaction individually, it still stores this proof, guaranteeing the data is available and verifiable by anyone.\n\nThis system makes sure that if Optimism faced an issue (like downtime), users could still retrieve and verify their transactions using the Ethereum mainnet. In short, it offers a robust security guarantee.\n\nIntroduction to Optimized batch compression\n\nOne of the standout features of Optimism is its ability to handle a large volume of transactions efficiently. This is achieved through a process called optimized batch compression.\n\nImagine you had to move a library's worth of books from one building to another. Instead of moving each book individually, you'd pack them into boxes, making the process faster and more efficient. Similarly, instead of submitting each transaction from Optimism to Ethereum one by one, they're bundled together in 'batches'.\n\nThese batches are then 'compressed' using cryptographic techniques. This means taking a large set of transaction data and converting it into a much smaller yet verifiable format.By doing this, Optimism can significantly reduce the amount of data that needs to be stored on the Ethereum mainnet, saving on fees and maintaining the efficient use of Ethereum's resources.\n\nWhat's Optimism's bedrock upgrade?\n\nBedrock is a pivotal upgrade to the Optimism protocol. It brings several performance improvements, primarily focusing on reduced transaction fees, shorter deposit times, improved proof modularity, enhanced node performance, and a more Ethereum-equivalent architecture.\n\nHere's a breakdown of these features:\n\nLower fees\n\nBedrock has implemented innovative methods to reduce transaction costs:\n\nOptimized data compression: Bedrock adopts a new data compression strategy, targeting minimal data costs. Initial benchmarks suggest this change can significantly reduce fees.\n\nElimination of L1 execution gas: By eliminating all L1 execution gas, Bedrock further drops L1 data fees to its bare minimum, offering a 10% fee reduction over its predecessor.\n\nShorter deposit times\n\nDepositing funds into the rollup system can be a time-consuming process. Earlier versions had a wait time of up to 10 minutes for deposit confirmation. However, Bedrock will help improve the speed and efficiency of deposits.\n\nHandles L1 re-organization: By introducing support for L1 reorganizations in the node software, Bedrock cuts down the confirmation time for deposits, targeting around 3 minutes.\n\nImproved proof modularity\n\nA key aspect of rollups is the proof system that guarantees correct transaction execution. Bedrock enhances this by:\n\nSeparating proof system from OP stack: This abstraction lets a rollup employ fault or validity proofs, like zk-SNARKs. Systems like Cannon can use this modularity to prove any discrepancies.\n\nImproved node performance\n\nNodes play a crucial role in maintaining and validating the rollup. Bedrock offers significant improvements in node performance:\n\nMultiple transactions in one block: Unlike the older one-transaction-per-block model, Bedrock allows the bundling of several transactions in one roll-up block. This approach amortizes the cost of Merkle tree updates over multiple transactions, reducing state growth by an estimated 15GB/year.\n\nTechnical debt removal: Technical debt can hinder performance and scalability. Bedrock addresses this by removing the requirement for a separate data transport layer node to index L1 and ensures efficient querying for transaction data from L1.\n\nImproved Ethereum equivalence\n\nFor seamless interaction and integration, Optimism must be as analogous to Ethereum as possible. Bedrock makes strides towards this through the following:\n\nRemoval of protocol deviations: Bedrock removes various deviations from Ethereum that existed in previous versions, such as the one-transaction-per-block model, custom opcodes for L1 block information, separate L1/L2 fee fields in the JSON-RPC API, and a unique ERC20 representation for ETH balances.\n\nIncorporation of Ethereum features: To stay aligned with Ethereum's ecosystem, Bedrock supports features like EIP-1559 and chain re-orgs in Ethereum's L1.\n\nBedrock represents a significant leap for the Optimism protocol. By focusing on user experience (reduced fees and shorter deposit times), technical robustness (proof modularity and enhanced node performance), and Ethereum compatibility, Bedrock provides a more efficient and seamless L2 solution for Ethereum applications.\n\nWhat's Optimism's Superchain?\n\nThe future of the decentralized web is advancing rapidly, and at its forefront is the Optimism Superchain, an innovative development poised to transform blockchain scalability and interoperability.Here's why the Superchain concept is transformative:\n\nThe essence of Superchain: The Superchain is a groundbreaking approach to horizontal scalability. It's a network of multiple chains (L2 chains), but these are not just any chains \u2014 they're chains that share unified security, a cohesive communication layer, and a holistic open-source development stack. Think of it as a cooperative web of chains, each bringing unique capabilities yet functioning cohesively as one unit.\n\nMerging Optimism Mainnet with other chains: The real magic happens when discussing how Superchain joins Optimism mainnet with other chains. Instead of each chain operating in isolation, the Superchain allows them to share a central truth source: the L1 chain. This eliminates the need for every new chain deployment to establish its own set of validators, making the entire system more efficient and streamlined.\n\nSignificance for the decentralized web: The decentralized web is all about providing robustness, security, and scalability. The Superchain, with its ability to treat multiple chains as interchangeable computational resources, paves the way for developers to craft cross-chain applications. This reduces systemic risks and significantly cuts overheads, allowing for a more efficient and cohesive decentralized ecosystem.\n\nThe revenue model of Superchain rewards both application and protocol developers. The OP Stack, the backbone on which Superchain is built, sees that revenue is reinvested into public goods, making the ecosystem sustainable, robust, and forward-looking.\n\nThe Superchain is a game-changer, ushering in a new era where multiple chains can coexist, interoperate, and benefit from shared security and resources. It's a testament to the spirit of collaboration, innovation, and the boundless possibilities of the decentralized web.\n\nHow does Optimism compare with other Ethereum layer 2 solutions?\n\nWhen diving into Ethereum's L2 scaling solutions, Polygon has also been making headlines. Here's a breakdown to grasp their differences more clearly:\n\nPolygon\n\nOriginally christened as Matic Network, Polygon has etched its identity with a versatile multi-chain approach. This means it masterfully interweaves the characteristics of both L1 and L2 solutions.\n\nAt its heart, Polygon operates through a Proof of Stake blockchain network, which serves a dual purpose: it accelerates Ethereum transactions and simultaneously slashes the transaction costs. Delving into its architectural blueprint, Polygon showcases a twin-layer setup named Heimdall and Bor.This dynamic duo streamlines the validation of transactions and enables the swift production of blocks.\n\nUnlike its counterparts, Polygon has a direct line to Ethereum through smart contracts, allowing it to function independently.Polygon offers an intricate yet efficient framework, setting itself apart with its unique integration of features to elevate Ethereum's performance.\n\nOptimism\n\nAlternatively dubbed \"Optimistic Ethereum\", Optimism is best known for harnessing the Optimistic Rollups technology. Its main aim is to amplify Ethereum's scalability. Unlike Polygon, which directly interacts with Ethereum and stands robustly on its own, Optimism takes a different route.\n\nIt groups multiple transactions together and then confirms their validity on the Ethereum network. This approach does make individual transactions on Optimism cheaper. However, it's crucial to remember that Ethereum still shoulders the broader validation costs.\n\nAn intriguing aspect of Optimism is its inherent trust in transactions, deeming them valid by default. But, if any transaction raises eyebrows, there's a 7-day challenge window to make sure everything's as it should be.\n\nUnique features of Optimism\n\nOptimistic Rollups: The major technology behind Optimism is the Optimistic Rollup. Rollups are a way of increasing the throughput of the Ethereum network without requiring each node to process every transaction. Instead, most transaction processing is done off-chain, and only the final state or a summary of transactions is committed to the main Ethereum chain.\n\nFraud proofs: Optimism uses a system where transactions are presumed valid unless proven otherwise. If someone thinks a transaction is fraudulent, they can challenge it. The transaction is rolled back if the challenge is valid, and the malicious actor is penalized. The term \"optimistic\" comes from this, as the system optimistically assumes transactions are valid.\n\nCompatibility with Ethereum: Optimism is designed to be highly compatible with Ethereum. This means that developers can easily port their existing Ethereum smart contracts to Optimism with minimal changes.\n\nSequencer: Optimism has introduced the sequencer concept to optimize the user experience. The sequencer is responsible for ordering transactions and provides a consistent transaction history. This allows for faster confirmation times than waiting for Ethereum mainnet confirmation.\n\nDecentralization with security: Despite being a L2 solution, Optimism leans heavily on the security of the Ethereum mainnet. While it processes transactions off-chain for speed and efficiency, it still uses Ethereum for the finality and security of those transactions.\n\nCompared to Polygon, Optimism's primary focus is enhancing Ethereum's scalability using the Optimistic Rollup technology. While both solutions offer increased throughput and reduced transaction costs, they achieve this using different architectures and technologies. Optimism\u2019s emphasis on compatibility and its optimistic approach to transaction validation make it a unique addition to the Ethereum scaling ecosystem.\n\nThe final word\n\nThe development of L2 solutions, like Optimism, seek to enhance Ethereum's efficiency without diluting its inherent security and decentralization strengths. Optimism operates as an intermediary, processing transactions swiftly and cost-effectively.\n\nHowever, it doesn't function in isolation. After processing, transaction data is relayed and validated on the primary Ethereum blockchain (L1). As a result, users of Optimism gain both speed and the assurance of Ethereum's robust security, enjoying the best of both worlds in Ethereum's layered approach.\n\nSuperchain's innovative approach to horizontal scalability encapsulated within Optimism can potentially revolutionize the decentralized web. Fostering a network of interconnected chains with unified security and communication heralds a future where chains don't function in silos.\n\nThe capacity for chains to share a core truth, eliminating redundant validations, suggests a streamlined and efficient future for blockchain networks. This could propel Superchain to be a cornerstone in the evolving decentralized digital landscape."

        "content": "DISCLAIMER: This article is a SPONSORED Press Release and does not constitute Finbold's editorial content nor undergo monitoring. Crypto assets/products involve significant risks. Do not invest unless you are prepared to lose your entire investment. For a full disclaimer, please click here.\n\nIn the constantly evolving landscape of digital assets, investor migration patterns often reveal the next big trend. Recently, a new contender has emerged on the horizon: Everlodge (ELDG). Notably, Everlodge is currently running a presale event, with Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) holders jumping in to secure their early access. Let\u2019s take a look at what could be driving the investor migration toward this crypto newcomer.\n\nJoin the Everlodge presale and win a luxury holiday to the Maldives\n\nEverlodge (ELDG): Huge Presale Opportunity for Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) Holders\n\nEverlodge is leading the charge as the first-ever platform to combine the allure of fractional vacation property ownership, timeshares, and the technological prowess of NFTs. Its unique approach is democratizing luxury property investments \u2013 from upscale hotels to exquisite villas \u2013 all built on a transparent blockchain framework.\n\nThe mechanism is straightforward: Properties are converted into digital tokens or NFTs. These tokens, encoded with intricate property details in their smart contracts, are then subdivided. This means users have the flexibility to invest in portions rather than the whole, and as the tangible property appreciates, the NFT\u2019s worth mirrors this ascent.\n\nA standout feature in Everlodge\u2019s holistic ecosystem is the Rewards Club. Within this system, members amass complimentary stays, redeemable at any property listed on Everlodge, further solidifying the platform\u2019s value proposition.\n\nCentral to the operations and benefits of Everlodge is the ELDG token. This native currency streamlines various platform functionalities and stands as a testament to the holder\u2019s stake. Advantages for ELDG token owners range from slashed property purchase rates to the promise of steady income via staking, not to mention the attractive loyalty incentives.\n\nAs of now, there\u2019s a window of opportunity with ELDG tokens priced enticingly at $0.010 during the first stage of the presale. However, with each ensuing phase, the price is destined to inch upward, emphasizing the benefits of early engagement.\n\nThe buzz around Everlodge isn\u2019t just smoke and mirrors. Predictions from industry insiders hint at a staggering 280% price leap during the presale alone, with prospects of a 30-fold jump when the platform officially kicks off.\n\nEthereum (ETH): Rumored ETFs and the $2,000 Resistance\n\nEthereum, the leading smart contract platform, is gaining traction among big financial players due to rumors of a potential Blackrock-endorsed ETF. This renewed interest is amplifying Ethereum\u2019s already significant presence in the market.\n\nThe solid foundation built around Ethereum is evident from its impressive $26 billion Total Value Locked (TVL). This figure highlights the growing appetite for DeFi services anchored on the Ethereum network.\n\nAt present, all eyes are on Ethereum\u2019s impending challenge of the pivotal $1,920 \u2013 $2,000 resistance bracket. A successful breach of this threshold could potentially ignite a powerful surge, catapulting Ethereum to as high as $10,000, according to some market analysts.\n\nSuch a rally would yield a substantial 5x return for Ethereum enthusiasts. While this projection offers a promising ROI for those backing the Ethereum Foundation, it\u2019s worth noting that returns like this might still be overshadowed by the potential profits awaiting early backers of Everlodge.\n\nSolana (SOL): The Significance of the $25 Support Level\n\nOnce hailed for its game-changing potential in the layer-1 market, Solana has been navigating rough waters lately. Despite showing signs of recovery in 2023, the predominant trend has been bearish for Solana over the past few years.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, Solana recently broke out from the symmetrical triangle pattern, briefly soaring from $18.70 to $32 within a week. However, this optimism was short-lived as the Solana price quickly corrected back to $22.\n\nWhat\u2019s more concerning for Solana holders is that this correction saw the asset fall below the $25 support level. This shows serious weakness in the underlying support for Solana and could be a sign of far worse to come.\n\nSolana holders are now taking advantage of this moderate price pump by selling their positions and investing in Everlodge\u2019s ELDG token instead. While Solana could still break out above resistance, Everlodge has a clear path to success and a huge potential for growth that Solana simply can\u2019t match.\n\nFind out more about the Everlodge (ELDG) Presale\n\nWebsite: https://www.everlodge.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/everlodge"

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nLayer-1 scaling solutions involve enhancing the base protocol of the blockchain to accommodate a higher number of transactions per second.\n\nImplementing layer-1 solutions often necessitates significant network-wide upgrades or even hard forks, which can lead to community discussions and potential splits in the blockchain.\n\nWhile increasing scalability, layer-1 solutions aim to maintain the core security and consensus mechanisms of the blockchain, ensuring the decentralized nature of the network.\n\nEthereum\u2019s consensus layer upgrade, incorporating Proof of Stake and shard chains, serves as a prominent example of a layer-1 scaling solution in progress.\n\nDue to the complexity of implementing changes at the protocol level, layer-1 solutions generally require longer development cycles and thorough testing before deployment.\n\nLayer-2 scaling solutions focus on processing transactions off the main blockchain, aiming to alleviate congestion and reduce transaction fees.\n\nThe key advantages of layer-2 solutions lie in their ability to offer rapid transaction processing and cost-efficient transactions compared to layer-1 solutions.\n\nHowever, achieving scalability through layer-2 solutions can sometimes involve trade-offs between security and scalability, requiring careful consideration and design.\n\nProminent layer-2 solutions include the Lightning Network for Bitcoin and Plasma for Ethereum, both of which aim to enhance scalability and improve transaction speed.\n\nAnother interesting aspect of layer-2 solutions is their potential for interoperability, allowing them to function across multiple blockchains and further enhancing the overall scalability of the ecosystem.\n\nWhat Are Blockchain Scaling Solutions?\n\nBlockchain scaling solutions are strategies and tactics created to increase the performance and scalability of blockchain networks. They solve the built-in drawbacks of conventional blockchains, such as their inefficient transaction processing, exorbitant fees, and low throughput. With the help of these technologies, blockchain networks should be able to process more transactions per second (TPS) while experiencing less congestion.\n\nLayer-1 (L1) scaling, which modifies the underlying blockchain protocol, and layer-2 (L2) scaling, which adds additional frameworks or protocols on top of the base layer to offload transactions and increase scalability, are two examples of common scaling solutions. These solutions strive to maintain the security and decentralization of the underlying technology while improving the performance, scalability, and user experience of blockchains.\n\nSharding, switching to a more effective consensus mechanism like Proof-of-Stake (PoS), or making other architectural changes are examples of L1 solutions. Higher transaction throughput and lower latency are the goals of these changes at the blockchain\u2019s foundation layer.\n\nLayer-2 solutions, like payment channels and sidechains, enable quicker and more scalable transactions while using the security and decentralization of the underlying blockchain.\n\nFurthermore, L1 and L2 solutions are implemented to overcome the trilemma, boost scalability, and preserve security and decentralization. The blockchain trilemma exists as a fundamental challenge in blockchain technology. The inherent trade-offs between scalability, security, and decentralization define the trilemma. These trade-offs result from the underlying architecture and design decisions made when developing blockchain technology.\n\nScalability Trade-Off\n\nHigh scalability demands the capacity to handle a huge volume of transactions in a timely and effective manner. However, as more transactions are made, the blockchain gets larger, creating problems with storage and bandwidth.\n\nFurthermore, it takes more time and resources to reach consensus among a large number of nodes. Trade-offs must be made, such as giving up some security or decentralization, in order to offset these problems.\n\nSecurity Trade-Off\n\nBlockchain networks use techniques like distributed validation, cryptographic hashing, and consensus methods to maintain security. But when scalability rises, maintaining strong security becomes more difficult.\n\nFor instance, scalability improvements like increasing block size or speeding up block confirmation times may result in weaknesses like a higher likelihood of forks or double-spending attacks. As a result, achieving a high level of security frequently necessitates sacrificing decentralization or scalability.\n\nDecentralization Trade-Off\n\nA fundamental tenet of blockchain technology is decentralization, which makes sure that no single party has control over the network. It encourages distrust and resistance to assaults or restrictions.\n\nHowever, maintaining decentralization while reaching great scalability can be difficult. Implementing techniques like sharding or off-chain processing (which will be explained at later stages in the article) to increase scalability frequently has an impact on the degree of decentralization.\n\nNevertheless, the fundamental idea of decentralization may be undermined if a limited number of businesses control transaction processing or block validation. The intricate problem that the blockchain community faces is highlighted by this fine line between achieving amazing scalability and maintaining the fundamentals of decentralization.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Scalability Challenges And Metrics\n\nThe dominance of Bitcoin in the cryptocurrency realm has brought to light the pressing issue of blockchain scalability. Throughput and latency significantly impact user experience quality (QoE), making them pivotal performance indicators.\n\nTransaction Throughput And Its Constraints\n\nTransaction throughput is a key concern. Bitcoin\u2019s highest transaction throughput is reported at 7 TPS, a big contrast to Visa\u2019s capability of over 4000 TPS. This difference highlights Bitcoin\u2019s limited capacity in accommodating larger trading volume.\n\nIn theory, transaction throughput hinges on the block interval and size. While a larger block increases throughput by accommodating more transactions, it simultaneously elongates block propagation time.\n\nOptimal configuration of block size and average block interval is around 1 MB and takes 10 minutes respectively for the Bitcoin network to confirm. Bitcoin aims to ensure adequate block propagation across the network. Yet, as block sizes increase to enhance throughput, system-wide bandwidth limitations act as a performance bottleneck, influencing blockchain efficiency.\n\nTransaction Confirmation Latency And User Experience\n\nTransaction confirmation latency, representing the time taken for a transaction to be confirmed, is another pivotal metric closely tied to user experience. With the surge in Bitcoin transactions, block size limitations hinder the inclusion of all submitted transactions. Miners, therefore, prioritize high-fee transactions, leading to extended latency for transactions with lower bids.\n\nKey Lessons: Bitcoin Data Processing Times\n\nIn essence, the capacity of Bitcoin to process transactions is contingent upon the size and frequency of transaction blocks. Larger blocks have a higher transaction capacity, albeit with longer confirmation times. To strike a balance, Bitcoin aims for blocks of approximately 1 megabyte in size, with a new block being appended to the blockchain every 10 minutes. This strategy aids in the even distribution of transaction processing.\n\nHowever, as Bitcoin tries to handle more transactions at once by making the blocks bigger, it hits a limit on how much data can be sent through the Bitcoin network at once, making transaction confirmation slower and less efficient.\n\nUnderstanding The Layers Of Blockchain Architecture To Address Scalability\n\nIn the context of addressing the scalability challenges of blockchain technology, the existing solutions can be grouped into two distinct layers: layer-1 and layer-2.\n\nLayer-1\n\nLayer-1 primarily focuses on improving scalability addressing issues related to consensus mechanisms, network infrastructure, and the fundamental data structure of the blockchain. These improvements are implemented directly within the main on-chain blockchain framework.\n\nLayer-2\n\nLayer-2 adopts a different route to scalability by employing off-chain methods. These methods include utilizing off-chain channels, side-chains, and cross-chain protocols to enable the blockchain to scale out more effectively.\n\nDeep Dive On Layer-1: On-Chain Scaling Solutions\n\nOn-chain scaling solutions, sometimes referred to as layer-1 scaling solutions, are techniques used to boost the efficiency and capacity of the underlying blockchain network. These solutions concentrate on enhancing the blockchain\u2019s basic layer, which comprises the fundamental protocol and consensus mechanism.\n\nTo encourage wider adoption and handle rising transaction volumes, it is necessary to overcome the scalability restrictions of blockchain networks, such as low transaction throughput and high latency. layer-1 solutions attempt to increase the network\u2019s capacity, speed, and overall performance by strengthening the base layer.\n\n1.0 Segregated Witness (SegWit)\n\nWorking Principle Of Segregated Witness (SegWit)\n\nSegregated Witness (SegWit) was introduced in August 2017 as a soft fork to enhance Bitcoin\u2019s efficiency by splitting transactions into two parts and removing unnecessary information. This removed information refers to the transaction signatures, also known as witness data, which are a part of Bitcoin transactions.\n\nBenefits of the SegWit\n\nImproved space efficiency: Transaction signatures can be quite large and occupy significant space in each block. SegWit helps scale the blockchain throughput by separating transaction signatures from the rest of the transaction data, storing them in a distinct structure known as the Witness structure.\n\nEfficient verification: With SegWit, only essential parts of a transaction are included in the main blockchain, while witness data is stored more efficiently. This streamlined verification process ensures that accidental changes to transactions are prevented.\n\nSmaller transaction records: By implementing SegWit, the overall size of Bitcoin\u2019s transaction records is reduced. This makes the blockchain\u2019s history of transactions more compact and manageable.\n\n2.0 Case Study On Increasing The Block Size: Hard Fork Of Bitcoin Blockchain To Bitcoin Cash\n\nCase Study Of Bitcoin Cash\n\nIn 2017, due to scalability concerns, Bitcoin encountered a hard fork resulting in a division into two blockchain branches: Bitcoin and Bitcoin-Cash, where Bitcoin-Cash opted to increase its block size to 8MB, a significant jump from Bitcoins 1MB version.\n\nAs Bitcoin Cash increased the block size to 32MB, despite these adjustments, the blockchain still kept the original 10-minute block time. In theory, this enhances transaction capacity, however, issues arise when trying to solve scalability by enlarging the block size. As the block size in MB increases, challenges emerge from both theoretical and practical standpoints.\n\nAs the continual expansion inflates block sizes, making transfer challenging due to intra-blockchain bandwidth limitations. These larger blocks trigger centralization concerns. As individual users struggle to efficiently propagate blocks and verify numerous transactions within a set timeframe, this situation may ultimately lead to a scenario where only a centralized entity can function as a full node.\n\nDrawbacks of Bitcoin Cash\n\nThe Bitcoin Cash hardfork presented several drawbacks:\n\nIntra-blockchain bandwidth constraints : As block sizes kept inflating, it made transfers challenging due to intra-blockchain bandwidth limitations. These larger blocks trigger centralization concerns.\n\nCentralization concerns : The enlargement of block sizes raised concerns about centralization, as individual users struggled to efficiently propagate larger blocks and validate numerous transactions in a timely manner.\n\nPotential full node centralization : The culmination of these challenges could potentially lead to a scenario where only a centralized entity could feasibly function as a full node, contradicting the decentralized ethos of blockchain technology.\n\n3.0 Block Compression: TXID\n\nWorking Principle Of Txilm\n\nTxilm, protocol based on BIP-152 employs a unique approach to enhance the efficiency of transactions within the blockchain. BIP-152 compresses transactions in each block to save the network\u2019s bandwidth. It is achieved by utilizing shortened codes to represent individual transactions. This technique not only conserves space but also improves the overall efficiency of data storage within blocks.\n\nThe core idea is to reduce the amount of data required for transmitting transactions across the network.\n\nBenefits Of Txilm\n\nSignificant reduction in data footprint: The reduction in data footprint contributes to more efficient data transmission across the blockchain network.\n\nOptimized data storage within blocks: The use of shorter codes for transactions allows more transactions to be accommodated in each block.\n\nClever \u201cSALT\u201d codes: To prevent potential conflicts arising from identical short codes, Txilm introduces extra information called \u201cSALT\u201d code which ensures that each transaction remains unique and distinguishable.\n\nEmpirical evidence: Txilm\u2019s implementation has showcased the reduction of data usage by up to 80 times improving efficiency gains and highlighting its real-world advantages in terms of data efficiency and network performance.\n\n4.0 Storage Scheme Optimization\n\nCUB\n\nConsensus-unit based (CUB) introduces an innovative strategy by grouping nodes into Consensus Units. Each unit is responsible for storing specific block data segments. To better understand, one may think of \u2018grouping nodes\u2019 as people and \u2018Consensus Units\u2019 as teams, where each unit is responsible for storing specific parts of the blockchain data puzzle sections. Each node in the consensus unit or team has a specific section of the blockchain data puzzle to work on.\n\nInstead of everyone working on the same blockchain puzzle together, which slows down the process, the blockchain puzzle gets divided into smaller parts and each person or node is assigned what to work on.\n\nCUB optimizes the way data is stored and accessed, which helps reduce storage costs and makes the blockchain system work faster and more effectively.\n\nLayer-1: Scaling Mechanisms\n\nThis section discusses different scaling methods of blockchain and some optimizations proposed to improve the scalability of blockchain:\n\nSharding\n\nWorking Principle of Sharding\n\nThe primary concept of sharding involves breaking down a large and complex network into smaller, manageable segments called \u201cshards.\u201d Each shard operates independently as a subset of the larger network. This technique, initially designed to enhance the efficiency of extensive business databases, segments data within sizable databases into fragments stored across separate servers.\n\nBy doing so, it alleviates the load on a central server, resulting in improved search speed and expanded storage capability for the entire database system.In the context of blockchains, sharding involves dividing a blockchain network into multiple shards, where each shard functions as its own mini-blockchain.\n\nBenefits Of Sharding\n\nImproved scalability: Sharding enables handling more transactions via parallel processing.\n\nFaster transaction processing: Transactions can be processed simultaneously in separate shards.\n\nEnhanced network performance: Sharding reduces congestion and boosts overall speed.\n\nHorizontal scaling: Sharding allows a network to grow by adding more shards.\n\nEfficient resource usage: Each shard can work on its transactions without affecting others.\n\nDrawbacks Of Sharding:\n\nCross-Shard communication costs: Cross-shard transactions can lead to higher communication costs and slower confirmation times.\n\nTransaction placement complexity: Properly assigning transactions to shards requires balancing factors like shard distribution and cross-shard transaction volume.\n\nProtocol limitations: Some sharding protocols, like Elastico, have specific drawbacks: Frequent identity and committee generation: Frequent operations may affect transaction efficiency. Inefficient transaction execution: Transaction processing might not be optimized. Cross-shard transaction atomicity: Ensuring the consistency of cross-shard transactions can be challenging.\n\n\n\nDelegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)\n\nIn DPoS, a small group of elected delegates are responsible for creating and validating blocks unlike traditional proof-of-stake (PoS). Blockchains like Tron and EOS use this method for salability purposes.\n\nDPoS works in two main steps. First, token holders in the network vote for the delegates they trust to create blocks. The top 21 delegates with the most votes then become the block producers. This way, the network lets those who hold tokens choose trustworthy delegates who can help the blockchain work well.\n\nWhen a delegate creates a block, it\u2019s checked by other delegates. If at least 15 out of the 21 top delegates agree, the block is confirmed. This voting process keeps going, and if a delegate doesn\u2019t do their job (create a block) for a day, they are replaced by someone else. Also, if a delegate doesn\u2019t do well in the past, they have a lower chance of being picked in the future. This whole system helps keep the blockchain secure and efficient.\n\nBenefits of DPoS:\n\nSpeed and scalability: DPoS can process transactions faster compared to other consensus mechanisms like proof-of work (PoW) or PoS. The smaller group of elected delegates can make decisions more quickly.\n\nEnergy efficiency: DPoS is more energy-efficient than Bitcoins PoW, as it doesn\u2019t require the massive computational power needed for solving complex puzzles.\n\nDecentralization: While DPoS involves a smaller group of delegates, it can still maintain a degree of decentralization, as token holders participate in choosing these delegates.\n\nSecurity: The continuous voting and verification process helps ensure that only trustworthy delegates are chosen, making the network more secure against attacks.\n\nGovernance: DPoS systems often allow token holders to have a say in the development and direction of the blockchain by voting for delegates. This can lead to more community involvement and decisions.\n\nDrawbacks of the DPoS:\n\nCentralization concerns: While DPoS is more decentralized than traditional systems like PoW, the power is still concentrated among a relatively small number of delegates. This can lead to centralization risks if a few powerful delegates collude or control a majority of the network.\n\nVulnerability to vote buying: In some cases, delegates may try to buy votes or offer rewards to token holders in exchange for their votes, which could undermine the fairness of the system.\n\nReduced security under certain conditions: DPoS systems might be more vulnerable to attacks if a majority of delegates become malicious or compromised, as they control the consensus process.\n\nLimited participation: Token holders who have a small number of tokens might have less influence in the voting process compared to those with more tokens, leading to potential inequality in decision-making.\n\nNetwork reliability: DPoS systems heavily rely on the availability and honesty of elected delegates. If a delegate goes offline or behaves dishonestly, it can impact the overall network performance.\n\nUnderstanding Layer-2 Scaling Solutions\n\nNow, let\u2019s picture layer-1 as a bustling highway, occasionally bogged down by excessive transactions, akin to too many cars on the road. layer-2, on the other hand, is akin to constructing an exclusive express lane positioned above the highway, designed exclusively for the swiftest vehicles. These vehicles navigate without hindrance, evading congestion and facilitating an expedited journey overall.\n\nLayer-2 offers a shortcut for transactions as it takes some transactions away from the main road (layer-1) and processes them separately. This way, the main road doesn\u2019t get clogged up, and everyone can complete their transactions faster.\n\nAs Bitcoins projected limit of 21 million BTC approaches experts are concerned about potential security vulnerabilities. For instance, after the 21 million limit is attained, miners\u2019 validation motivation will shift entirely from newly created coins to transaction fees. This scenario could lead to transaction fees becoming high or security significantly compromised.\n\nAmidst these apprehensions, a set of innovative solutions known as layer-2 technologies\u201d have emerged. These technologies offer a distinct approach to enhance blockchain functionality without altering the core protocol. Rather than modifying the fundamental blockchain protocol at layer-1 level, these technologies will interface with the primary infrastructure.\n\nTheir primary function involves leveraging the underlying blockchain to cryptographically validate entire groups of transactions as a single settlement. An advantage of layer-2 technology is the potential to enhance scalability and preserve the security strengths inherent to the blockchain.\n\nLayer-2 technology has been proposed as a means to segregate transaction settlement and validation processes, where a promising path may be laid out in maintaining security integrity while significantly boosting blockchain scalability.\n\nTypes of Layer-2 Scaling Solutions For The Bitcoin Blockchain\n\n1.0 Payment Channels\n\nPayment channels are like having a tab at your favorite ice cream shop. Instead of paying for each scoop separately, you open a tab, have as many scoops as you want, and settle the bill later.\n\nPayment channels work similarly by letting people do lots of transactions without putting every single one on the main blockchain. The Lightning Network is a layer-2 scaling solution for the Bitcoin blockchain network, designed to enable faster and more cost-effective transactions by facilitating off-chain microtransactions.\n\nLightning Network\n\nThe Lightning Network is designed to facilitate fast and low-cost transactions by allowing users to create payment channels directly between themselves without the need to broadcast every transaction to the main blockchain.\n\nThese payment channels are like private channels between two parties and can be opened, closed, and maintained without needing to interact with the main blockchain for each transaction. This enables micropayments and increases the transaction throughput of the network.\n\nBenefits of the Lightning Network\n\nFast transactions: Transactions within payment channels are virtually instant.\n\nLow fees: Since transactions occur off-chain, the associated fees are significantly lower.\n\nScalability: The Lightning Network helps alleviate congestion on the main blockchain by handling a large number of transactions off-chain.\n\nMicropayments: The network enables microtransactions that were previously impractical due to high on-chain fees.\n\nDrawbacks of the Lightning Network:\n\nWallet complexity: Wallets can be more complex than traditional on-chain wallets , posing a challenge in finding user-friendly options that seamlessly integrate with the network.\n\nSecurity concerns: The need for payees to sign a recovery transaction and the requirement for a hot wallet, which could expose private keys in case of security breaches.\n\nChannel management: Channels require ongoing attention and may involve closing and reopening channels to maintain balance, potentially inconveniencing users who prefer a hands-off approach.\n\nLimited network coverage: Reliant on a network size and the channel availability. Users might resort to on-chain transactions if recipients lack network access or have limited channel capacity, removing the intended benefits.\n\n2.0 Sidechains\n\nSidechains serve as innovative solutions that expand functionality and scalability to blockchain systems. Imagine them as parallel tracks running alongside the main blockchain, each acting as a self-contained environment for conducting transactions and executing smart contracts.\n\nThese sidechains are interconnected but separate, allowing users to carry out specific activities without burdening the primary blockchain with every detail. This segregation enables faster and more efficient transactions, enhancing overall network performance.\n\nWhen necessary, the sidechains can communicate with the main chain, facilitating interoperability and ensuring that data can be securely shared between the two layers. This layer-2 architecture introduces flexibility, enabling blockchain networks to manage varying workloads and optimize resource allocation. They maintain integrity and security of the main blockchain.\n\nRootStock (RSK)\n\nRSK is a sidechain project that aims to bring smart contract functionality to the Bitcoin blockchain. It allows developers to build and deploy dApps on the RSK sidechain using Ethereum-compatible smart contracts.\n\nRSK uses a two-way peg to enable the movement of Bitcoin to the RSK sidechain. Bitcoin is locked on the Bitcoin blockchain, and an equivalent amount of Smart Bitcoin (RSK-BTC) is created on the RSK sidechain. RSK-BTC can be used within the RSK ecosystem for executing smart contracts and dApps.\n\nPegging-In (Moving Bitcoin to RSK)\n\nBitcoin holders begin by transferring their Bitcoins to a multisignature (multisig) address on the Bitcoin blockchain, acting as a secured vault for the bitcoins. Once deposited, a cryptographic\n\nSimplified Payment Verification (SPV) proof is generated to validate the bitcoin deposit on the Bitcoin blockchain. This SPV proof is transmitted to a bridge smart contract on the RSK sidechain, which verifies and acknowledges the deposit. In response, an equivalent amount of RBTC (RSK\u2019s native currency) is minted on the RSK sidechain, representing the pegged-in Bitcoin and becoming available for the user.\n\nPegging-Out (Moving RBTC back to Bitcoin)\n\nWhen users wish to move their RBTC back to the Bitcoin blockchain, they initiate a reverse process. They send their RBTC to a bridge smart contract on the RSK sidechain. The bridge smart contract confirms the transaction and produces an SPV proof for the RBTC transaction. This SPV proof is then forwarded to the Bitcoin blockchain, where it is verified to authorize the release of the initially pegged-in bitcoins\u2019 equivalent amount.\n\nRootStock (RSK) Benefits:\n\nCompatibility with Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts: RSK allows developers to send their Ethereum smart contracts onto its platform, increasing interoperability between the two ecosystems.\n\nImproved scalability for decentralized applications (dApps): RSK\u2019s sidechain architecture enhances scalability, enabling faster and more efficient execution of dApps compared to the main Bitcoin network.\n\nUtilizes Bitcoin\u2019s security through merged mining: RSK leverages Bitcoin miners\u2019 computational power, providing a high level of security and protection against potential attacks.\n\nSupports DeFi solutions and stateful smart contracts: RSK enables the creation of advanced decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and complex smart contracts that retain state, expanding the scope of possibilities.\n\nExpands Bitcoin\u2019s functionality without altering its core protocol: RSK\u2019s compatibility with Bitcoin allows for the development of new features and functionalities without modifying the underlying Bitcoin network.\n\nRootStock (RSK) Drawbacks:\n\nPotential centralization due to the federation of functionaries: RSK\u2019s reliance on a federation of functionaries for certain tasks could introduce centralization risks if not well-distributed or managed.\n\nRSK-BTC lacks the same security level as the Bitcoin network: While RSK benefits from merged mining with Bitcoin, its security may not match the robustness of the original Bitcoin blockchain due to differences in hashing power and network size.\n\n3.0 State Channels\n\nImagine you and your friend are playing a game, and you keep track of the score on a piece of paper. You only write down the final score when the game ends, instead of every single point. State channels work similarly by keeping track of lots of transactions off-chain and only record the final result on the main blockchain.\n\nThey allow users to conduct transactions and perform tasks independently, reducing congestion on the main blockchain while maintaining the ability to interact with it when needed. The Lightning Network serves as a real-world illustration of state channels in the Bitcoin network.\n\nBy establishing a multi-signature wallet on the Bitcoin blockchain, two parties open a payment channel, as explained above. The state of the channel can then be updated by them doing several transactions off-chain. Because they are not published on the main blockchain, these transactions are scalable and cost-effective.\n\nWhen they are done, the channel is closed, and the last state of the channel is stored on the Bitcoin blockchain. In this approach, many transactions take place off-chain, with only the opening and closing transactions being recorded on the main blockchain.\n\nA summary of the differences between sidechains and state channels can be found in the table below:\n\n4.0 Layer-2 Scaling Solutions For The Ethereum Blockchain\n\nEthereum and other Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-based blockchains have encountered a challenge with scalability. The limited processing capacity of these networks, coupled with the surging demand for decentralized applications, has resulted in elevated transaction fees and sluggish transaction processing times.\n\nHowever, a set of layer-2 scaling solutions has emerged to tackle these issues. In this piece, we will delve into these technologies and their transformative impact on EVM-based blockchains. These solutions leverage techniques such as state channels, sidechains, and rollups to enable swifter and more cost-effective transactions.\n\nPlasma\n\nPlasma, one of the prominent layer-2 scaling solutions, was initially conceptualized by Vitalik Buterin in 2017. This framework introduces the concept of \u201cchild\u201d chains, interconnected with the primary Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThese child chains have the capacity to process a substantial volume of transactions, periodically summarizing their state to the main chain. This approach effectively reduces the data load on the main chain, thereby lowering transaction fees and boosting network performance.\n\nBenefits Of Adopting Plasma As A Layer-2 Scaling Solution:\n\nScalability: Plasma chains significantly improve the scalability of Ethereum by enabling the execution of transactions off-chain while maintaining a connection to the Ethereum mainnet. This allows for a larger number of transactions to be processed compared to the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nReduced transaction fees: By offloading a significant portion of transactions to the Plasma chains, users can experience lower transaction fees since they are not competing with the congestion on the mainnet.\n\nFaster transaction processing: Since Plasma chains can process transactions off-chain, they can achieve faster transaction confirmation times compared to the Ethereum mainnet, where network congestion can cause delays.\n\nInteroperability: Plasma chains can be designed to focus on specific use cases or industries, enabling tailored solutions while still benefiting from the security of the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nDrawbacks Of Adopting Plasma As A Layer-2 Scaling Solution:\n\nSecurity and complexity: Plasma chains are more complex to implement and require careful design to ensure the security of the assets locked within them.\n\nLimited use cases: While they can offer increased throughput, they might not be optimized for executing more complex smart contracts or interactions.\n\nChallenges in implementation: Developing and deploying a secure Plasma chain can be challenging and resource-intensive.\n\nLimited decentralization: Depending on the design and architecture of the Plasma chain, there may be concerns about the level of decentralization achieved compared to the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nRollups\n\nRollups, another noteworthy layer-2 scaling solution, function as smart contracts that bundle multiple transactions into a single transaction, subsequently submitted to the primary chain. This aggregation significantly reduces the data volume on the main chain, leading to swifter transaction processing times.\n\nNotably, Rollups are categorized into two distinct types: Optimistic Rollups and ZK Rollups.\n\nOptimistic Rollups\n\nAre a type of layer-2 blockchain scaling solution that aims to improve scalability by processing transactions off-chain and then batching them for inclusion on the main Ethereum blockchain. In this approach, validators process transactions off-chain, and witnesses verify them before adding them to the main blockchain.\n\nZero Knowledge (ZK) Rollups\n\nFocusing on improving scalability and privacy, ZK Rollups utilize zero-knowledge proofs for secure and private transaction verification. A zero-knowledge proof is a cryptographic method that allows one party (the prover) to prove to another party (the verifier) that a statement is true without revealing any specific information about the statement itself.\n\nInstead of fully processing transactions off-chain like in Optimistic Rollups, ZK Rollups bundle transactions and then use zero-knowledge proofs to provide cryptographic evidence of their validity. This approach offers enhanced privacy while maintaining security, but it may come at the cost of slightly lower scalability compared to Optimistic Rollups.\n\nA summary of the differences between optimistic rollups and ZK rollups can be found in the table below:\n\nBenefits Of Adopting Rollups As A Layer-2 Scaling Solution:\n\nScalability: Provide a significant scalability boost aggregating multiple transactions into a single transaction that is submitted to the Ethereum mainnet. This reduces congestion on the mainnet and increases the number of transactions that can be processed.\n\nReduced gas fees: Help reduce gas fees for users by consolidating multiple transactions into a single one, making transactions more cost-effective and accessible.\n\nCompatibility with smart contracts: Capable of supporting smart contracts, making them suitable for a wider range of use cases beyond simple token transfers.\n\nEnhanced speed: Transaction processing times are improved since Rollups can process multiple transactions in a single batch, reducing the time required for individual transactions.\n\nDrawbacks Of Adopting Plasma As A Layer-2 Scaling Solution:\n\nData availability: Rollups rely on data availability and require users to monitor and ensure the availability of the necessary data to interact with the smart contracts on the mainnet.\n\nLatency for data availability: The need for data availability verification can introduce some latency between transaction submission and finality.\n\nDevelopment complexity: Implementing and integrating Rollup solutions can be complex due to the need for robust data availability mechanisms, compatibility with existing smart contracts, and security considerations.\n\nLimited decentralization: The degree of decentralization in Rollup solutions can vary, and some trade-offs may be made to achieve scalability and efficiency.\n\nComparison: Layer-1 Vs. Layer-2 Scaling Solutions\n\nLayer-1 and layer-2 scaling solutions represent two distinct approaches to addressing the scalability challenges of blockchain networks.\n\nLayer-1 Scaling Solutions\n\nLayer-1 scaling solutions focus on improving the base layer of a blockchain network. They involve making fundamental changes to the blockchain\u2019s protocol, consensus mechanism, or architecture to increase its capacity to handle more transactions per second (TPS).\n\nAdvantages Of Layer-1 Scaling\n\nSecurity and decentralization: Layer-1 blockchains, like Ethereum, are highly secure and decentralized due to their robust consensus mechanisms.\n\nFlexibility: Developers have direct access to the base layer, allowing for innovative features and functionalities.\n\nSelf-contained: Layer-1 scaling solutions do not require additional layers or systems for implementation.\n\nDisadvantages Of Layer-1 Scaling\n\nUpgrade challenges: Implementing changes at the base layer can be complex and may require community consensus.\n\nSlow development: Major upgrades may take time to develop, test, and deploy, causing delays in addressing scalability issues.\n\nRisk of centralization: Rapid protocol changes can lead to centralization if a small number of entities control significant portions of the network.\n\nLayer-2 Scaling Solutions\n\nLayer-2 scaling solutions work on top of existing blockchains (layer-1) and aim to increase throughput by moving some of the transaction processing off-chain. They include various techniques like payment & state channels, sidechains, rollups and plasma.\n\nAdvantages Of Layer-2 Scaling:\n\nScalability: Layer-2 solutions significantly increase the transaction throughput of the main blockchain.\n\nFast transactions: Off-chain processing allows for near-instantaneous transaction confirmation and settlement.\n\nCost efficiency: Reduced congestion on the main chain leads to lower transaction fees.\n\nDisadvantages Of Layer-2 Scaling:\n\nSecurity considerations: Layer-2 solutions rely on the security of the underlying layer-1 blockchain.\n\nInteroperability challenges: Interactions between different layer-2 solutions or between layer-2 and layer-1 can be complex.\n\nCentralization risk: Some layer-2 solutions might require trusted intermediaries, leading to potential centralization.\n\nIn summary, layer-1 scaling solutions involve making changes directly to the blockchain\u2019s protocol, while layer-2 solutions build on top of existing blockchains to improve scalability. Layer-1 solutions offer enhanced security and decentralization but may require longer development cycles.\n\nLayer-2 solutions focus on boosting transaction throughput and reducing fees, but may introduce security and centralization concerns. The choice between these approaches depends on the specific requirements and goals of the blockchain network.\n\nSummary of the differences between layer-1 and layer-2 scaling solutions can be found in the table below:\n\nPopular Blockchain Networks And Their Scaling Solutions\n\nSolana\n\nSolana is a high-performance blockchain platform renowned for its scalability and quick transaction processing. It makes use of innovative technologies such as Tower BFT consensus and PoH, which enable thousands of transactions per second at cheap costs. Its objectives are to enable dApps and promote a vibrant development and user ecosystem.\n\nSolana stands apart in the blockchain scene due to its distinctive scaling method, which makes use of a number of cutting-edge technologies to achieve high throughput and low latency.\n\nProof Of History (PoH)\n\nPoH is a cryptographic timestamping method that Solana uses to establish a historical record of all transactions on the blockchain. This saves time and resources by allowing nodes to confirm the timing and order of transactions without the need for recurrent consensus.\n\nTower BFT Consensus\n\nSolana uses a high-performance consensus technique called Tower BFT, which speeds up transaction finality and optimizes the block confirmation process. This guarantees speedy and secure confirmation of transactions.\n\nParallel Processing\n\nSolana uses a method called \u201cSealevel\u201d to process several transactions concurrently across various nodes. With thousands of transactions per second (TPS) possible because of its parallel processing capabilities, the network\u2019s transaction throughput greatly rises.\n\nSharding\n\nSolana employs a technique known as \u201cProof of Replication\u201d sharding to divide the network into smaller sections, or \u201cshards.\u201d The processing of individual transactions by each shard increases scalability and eases congestion.\n\nLow Transaction Fees\n\nCompared to certain other blockchain networks, Solana can handle a huge number of transactions with efficiency thanks to its high throughput characteristics.\n\nBenefits of Solana\u2019s scalability solutions\n\nSolana\u2019s scalability solutions offer:\n\nScalability: Solana is well suited for decentralized applications (dApps) with strict performance requirements because of its novel approach to scaling, which enables it to handle a large number of transactions per second.\n\nLow latency: Solana offers low transaction confirmation times thanks to its quick block confirmation times and finality, which improves the user experience and permits real-time interactions.\n\nCost-effectiveness: Solana is a cost-effective choice for users and developers, especially for applications that demand frequent transactions, because of its cheap transaction costs and high throughput.\n\nEcosystem development: Solana\u2019s scalability and efficiency draw developers and projects to its platform, enabling the growth of a robust dApp and DeFi ecosystem.\n\nCardano\n\nScalability is of utmost importance in the dynamic world of blockchain technology. The capacity of a blockchain network to handle an increasing number of transactions becomes crucial as more users and apps enter the market.\n\nA third-generation blockchain platform called Cardano has adopted a novel strategy for scalability, deliberately positioning itself within the layer-1 vs. layer-2 paradigm. The Ouroboros protocol, a ground-breaking invention created to overcome the shortcomings of current blockchain scalability approaches, is at the core of Cardano\u2019s scalability solution.\n\nCardano\u2019s Positioning In The Layer-1 vs. Layer-2 Paradigm\n\nWhether to grow a blockchain protocol\u2019s base layer or create other layers that function on top of the base layer is at the center of the argument between layer-1 and layer-2 solutions. Here\u2019s an overview of how Cardano aims to scale without sacrificing security and decentralization :\n\nOn-Chain Solutions\n\nBlock size increase: The transaction capacity has been increased by 12.5% (from 64KB to 72KB); further modifications are expected based on network performance.\n\nPipelining : Aiming for quicker block dissemination and enabling scalable updates, pipelining improves block propagation time by combining validation and propagation.\n\nInput endorsers: By grouping transactions into pre-built blocks, enhancing consistency, and allowing for larger transaction rates, input endorsers increase throughput.\n\nMemory/CPU efficiency: Optimizes the chain\u2019s use of memory for hash representation, stake distribution, live stake distribution, and processing of unspent transaction output (UTXO).\n\nPlutus script optimizations : Smart contract optimization includes reference inputs (CIP-0031) for input inspection without spending and Plutus Datums (CIP-0032) directly attached to outputs for simplified usage.\n\nNode enhancements : Improves stake and reward computations distribution, memory usage efficiency, and peak load management, boosting scalability.\n\nOn-disk storage : Storing parts of protocol state on disk reduces memory requirements, easing scalability bottlenecks, enabling greater blockchain state growth.\n\nOff-Chain Solutions\n\nSidechains: Sidechains are separate blockchains that are linked to the primary blockchain in a bidirectional manner. This allows for frictionless asset transfer between chains, increases flexibility, and supports a wide range of functions. A single main chain can support a variety of functionally separate, interoperable sidechains.\n\nHydra: Hydra introduces a collection of layer 2 protocols, such as isomorphic state channels, to increase throughput, decrease latency, cut costs, and reduce the amount of storage needed. By effectively processing transactions off-chain and using the main-chain ledger for secure settlements, Hydra remains a popular solution.\n\nOff-chain computing: Asynchronous Contract Execution (ACE), a type of computation that is off-chain, improves the performance of the core network. Through a trust paradigm, transactions can be quick and inexpensive while still taking place off-chain.\n\nMithril: It is critical to address the complexities of operations related to participant numbers logarithmically in order to increase scalability. Mithril improves chain synchronization while maintaining trust and bringing about effective multi-signature aggregation without jeopardizing security.\n\nEthereum\n\nThe dApp and smart contract revolution has been led by Ethereum, a ground-breaking blockchain platform. However, due to its quick growth, significant scalability issues with its initial design have come to light, mostly with the layer-1 protocol.\n\nBy creating a more scalable and effective architecture, the Ethereum consensus layer upgrade (The Merge), which took place in September 2022, hoped to overcome these issues. The Ethereum ecosystem has also adopted a number of layer-2 solutions to temporarily address the scaling difficulties while switching to PoS consensus mechanism to address scalability and energy related issues.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Layer-1 Scaling Challenges\n\nLayer-1, commonly referred to as the basic layer, of Ethereum had significant problems with scalability, transaction throughput, and network congestion.\n\nNetwork congestion: When there is a rush in demand, Ethereum\u2019s limited capacity for processing transactions is made clear by an increase in transaction fees, which makes the platform less usable for users and DApps.\n\nSlow transaction confirmation: Compared to conventional payment systems, Ethereum\u2019s Proof of Work (PoW) consensus process results in slower transaction confirmation times, which limits real-time use cases.\n\nHigh gas costs: During network congestion, gas costs, which users pay to perform transactions and deploy smart contracts, can soar to absurdly high levels that they negatively affect the user experience and deter modest transactions.\n\nScalability limitations: Due to its low throughput, Ethereum is unable to handle many concurrent transactions without experiencing delays and potential bottlenecks.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Transition To Proof-Of-Stake Consensus Method\n\nBy adopting the PoS mechanism in 2022, Ethereum undertook a substantial transformation that is credited with improving security, consuming less energy, and being better suited for the incorporation of novel scaling solutions.\n\nValidators are at the center of the proof-of-stake paradigm. Validators are in charge of processing transactions on the Ethereum network, acting similarly to miners in the proof-of-work model and significantly contributing to the network\u2019s security.\n\nBy staking (depositing) a minimum of 32 ETH into the designated contract, anyone can join the PoS network and become a validator. The protocol then uses a randomized method to choose participants for making suggestions for and casting votes against adding additional blocks to the chain.\n\nAn execution client, a consensus client, and the validator software itself are required to become validators on Ethereum. This extensive collection of tools works together to provide effective transaction validation and strong involvement in the PoS system.\n\nFurthermore, every 32 slots, or around 6.4 minutes, an epoch takes place in the context of Ethereum\u2019s PoS ecosystem. Each of these time slots designates a specific period of time for the committee of validators to carry out important tasks. These committees are made up of teams with at least 128 validators.\n\nAn epoch contains tasks like adding new blocks to the blockchain and voting on them to confirm their legality. The efficiency, consistency, and security of Ethereum\u2019s transaction validation process are optimized by this coordination of validator committees functioning within well specified epochs.\n\nEthereum\u2019s use of the PoS paradigm, which is intimately linked with the ideas of validators and epochs, underlines its dedication to developing the network\u2019s capabilities while upholding security, energy efficiency, and scalability standards. This change highlights both Ethereum\u2019s adaptability and endurance in the constantly changing world of blockchain and cryptocurrencies. It also represents technological advancement.\n\nLayer-2 Scaling Solutions On The Ethereum Blockchain\n\nThe constraints of the Ethereum blockchain\u2019s scalability have been addressed by layer-2 scaling solutions, which have emerged as a game-changing strategy. The ability of Ethereum to process a large number of transactions becomes increasingly important as its popularity grows. While preserving the security and decentralization that Ethereum is renowned for, layer-2 solutions present an inventive way to reduce congestion and improve efficiency.\n\nBy adding to the existing Ethereum blockchain, layer-2 scaling solutions essentially create supplementary layers that process a sizable amount of transactions off-chain. This tactic speeds up transaction processing while easing the load on the main Ethereum network. Optimism and Arbitrum are two well-known layer-2 solutions that have attracted attention.\n\nOptimism\n\nThe optimistic rollup method is employed by Optimism to increase Ethereum\u2019s scalability. In this approach, transactions are off-chain processed optimistically and combined into a single \u201crollup\u201d transaction that is regularly published to the Ethereum mainnet. Thus, Optimism drastically lowers the volume of transactions that are handled directly on-chain, resulting in lower fees and quicker confirmation times.\n\nThe interoperability of Optimism with current Ethereum smart contracts is one of its main features. With only a few adjustments, developers can migrate their contracts to the Optimism network. This function facilitates optimism\u2019s adoption and hastens its adoption within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nArbitrum\n\nAnother layer-2 solution that prioritizes a flawless user experience and improved scalability is Arbitrum. Arbitrum utilizes an optimistic rollup process, much like Optimism. Off-chain transaction processing is done, and it regularly sends compiled data to the Ethereum mainnet for verification. This procedure ensures that transaction integrity is upheld while easing network congestion.\n\nBy placing a strong emphasis on usability and interoperability, Arbitrum stands out. Developers can easily move their smart contracts to the Arbitrum network and take advantage of its scalability without making significant code revisions.\n\nA comparison summary table of summary of the differences between Bitcoin scaling solutions and Ethereum scaling solutions can be found in the table below:\n\nCan Bitcoin Scale Without Layer-2? A Future Outlook\n\nThe rapid expansion of Bitcoin\u2019s influence, from the emergence of applications for Bitcoin-based exchange-traded funds in the United States to El Salvador\u2019s acceptance of Bitcoin as legal tender, has amplified the demand for enhanced scalability within the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nAs mainstream adoption continues to surge, the need for solutions that can accommodate greater transactional capacity and efficiency becomes paramount. Adam Back, an eminent figure in the Bitcoin development community and the CEO of Blockstream, a prominent blockchain technology company, emphasizes the potential of layer-2 networks to address this challenge.\n\nLayer-2 Networks: Pioneering Scalability\n\nAs this article has outlined layer-2 networks represent a groundbreaking approach to scaling the Bitcoin blockchain. As mentioned earlier, the function as secondary protocols built on top of existing blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, these networks bear resemblance to the evolution of the internet\u2019s protocol stack. Which is a protocol that addresses the implementation of a computer networking protocol suite or protocol family.\n\nOne of the notable figures advocating for layer-2 solutions is Adam Back. As the CEO of Blockstream, a company deeply involved in blockchain technology and development, Back\u2019s insights into layer-2 technology hold significant weight.\n\nIn a video interview with YouTube channel Forkast News. News. Adam Back outlined the role of layer-2 networks in resolving the scalability issues faced by blockchain systems. He compared these networks to segments of transactional capacity optimized for specific use cases.\n\nBack mentioned that while it might be challenging for all potential Bitcoin users to directly conduct transactions on the main chain, layer-2 networks provide an alternative by enabling different use cases that can leverage Bitcoin in distinct ways. He emphasized that this approach enables the onboarding of more users while reducing the data load on the main chain. Back acknowledged that layer-2 networks involve certain trade-offs, but they offer assurances akin to those of the primary Bitcoin chain, recognizing that a single protocol cannot be universally optimal for all scenarios.\n\nLayer-2: Where Innovation Thrives\n\nThe concept of layer-2 networks gains prominence in the context of Bitcoin\u2019s development trajectory. The pace of upgrades to the Bitcoin network has been deliberate, with significant upgrades such as the SegWit soft fork in 2017 and the more recent Taproot upgrade in 2020. Given the measured and occasionally uneven pace of these upgrades, many innovative developments within the Bitcoin blockchain ecosystem have found their home in layer-2 solutions.\n\nDrawing a parallel with the internet\u2019s architecture, Back highlighted that while the core TCP/IP protocol has remained largely unchanged for decades, innovation has flourished in the layers above, particularly at the application layer. This architecture, Back explained, promotes robustness by allowing the best technology to evolve in the most flexible layers, similar to how layer-2 solutions are facilitating innovation while maintaining the integrity of the underlying blockchain.\n\nInsights And Perspectives\n\nAdam Back\u2019s views extend beyond the technical realm, encompassing the societal and economic impacts of Bitcoin\u2019s growing adoption. He envisions a scenario where the widespread adoption of Bitcoin could influence the valuation of traditional assets like stocks, real estate, gold, and artwork. The potential reduction in the monetary premium attached to these assets could have both positive and negative effects.\n\nWhile it might lead to more affordable real estate, it could also challenge the conventional methods of preserving value. He notes how El Salvador\u2019s adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender has led to remarkable progress in financial inclusion, with the number of Bitcoin wallet users surpassing the count of individual bank accounts within a short span.\n\nReflecting on the \u201cblock war\u201d of 2017, Back contends that the market ultimately determined the fate of competing blockchain forks, reinforcing the decentralized nature of the decision-making process.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Future Strategy\n\nTransitioning to proof-of-stake in 2022 marked a crucial move to prepare the Ethereum platform for the next phase of enhancements as explained by Vitalin Buterin during EthCC 2022, involving four pivotal upgrades known as Surge, Verge, Purge, and Splurge. Here\u2019s a concise overview:\n\nThe upcoming Surge upgrade introduces the concept of sharding, specifically Danksharding in Ethereum\u2019s case. Sharding partitions the network into separate sets of validators, simultaneously handling distinct transactions. Notably, Ethereum ensures communication between shards and the base layer, maintaining the network\u2019s unified truth source. This was unfeasible under proof-of-work, which requires every node to process and record each transaction, leading to inefficiencies. Ethereum\u2019s current capacity is around 15-20 transactions per second.\n\nSharding revolutionizes this scenario, drastically reducing data requirements for node maintenance\u2014from several gigabytes to a manageable level for phones or personal computers. Moreover, sharding facilitates the utilization of roll-ups. Roll-ups enable transactions to be bundled, cryptographically linked, and processed off-chain before being presented as a single entry to the network.\n\nVerkle trees, a commitment scheme similar to Merkle trees but with compact witnesses, will be made available through the Verge upgrade. Smaller node sizes and optimized storage are promised by this. By enabling block validation without keeping a copy of the whole blockchain history, verkle trees open the door for stateless clients. This represents a major step towards improved protocol decentralization.\n\nState expiry will be implemented in relation to the Perge upgrade. After this phase, Ethereum clients will destroy data that is older than a year. The difficulty comes in keeping old data after it has been thrown away. The mechanisms causing this are still unknown. The Perge enhances Ethereum in several ways:\n\nReduced hardware needs for nodes (less storage)\n\nDeletion of the legacy transaction-specific code\n\nClients sync less data, reducing the network\u2019s bandwidth use\n\nThe Splurge phase completes the blueprint for Ethereum\u2019s upgrading. It includes features that were not included in earlier releases. Timing and implementation specifics are scarce. According to Vitalik Buterin, The Splurge might be unneeded if Ethereum scales effectively with earlier releases.\n\nConclusion\n\nBlockchain scalability was always going to be a continuous challenge throughout the crypto space and is addressed through layer-1 and layer-2 scaling solutions. layer-1 solutions involve direct changes to blockchain protocols, while layer-2 solutions create parallel networks to offload transactions.

        "content": "The Ethereum cofounder transferred 600 ETH to Coinbase amid a week of negative price action for the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap.\n\nVitalik Buterin, the cofounder of Ethereum, deposited 600 ETH worth over $1 million to crypto exchange Coinbase on Monday, data from blockchain explorer Etherscan shows.\n\nThe tokens were sent from the wallet address labelled \u201cvitalik.eth,\u201d which currently still holds 3,993 ETH worth $6.5 million at current prices.\n\nButerin\u2019s transfer comes amid a week of volatility for ETH, which is down 10% over the last seven days. A sharp selloff late on Thursday last week saw crypto traders suffer $1 billion worth of liquidations, with ETH liquidations alone accounting for $302 million over 24 hours.\n\nBefore sending the 600 ETH to Coinbase, Buterin repaid 251,000 Rai Reflex Index (RAI) tokens on the Maker protocol and withdrew 1,000 ETH worth $1.67 million.\n\nAlthough several market participants speculated that Buterin sent the ETH to the crypto exchange to sell, the reason behind the transfer remains unknown. Over the last few years, however, Buterin has sold ETH after similar transfers to crypto exchanges, along with other lesser known tokens that people have sent to his wallet.\n\nIn fact, earlier this year, Buterin moved $3.6 million ETH to crypto exchanges Kraken, Gemini and Coinbase, according to data from Arkham. Incidentally, the timing of these transfers also coincided with a drop in ETH\u2019s price.\n\nOn Sunday, another Ethereum wallet address which had acquired ETH during the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in 2014, moved 191 ETH worth around $320,000 to another address after more than eight years of leaving it untouched."

        "content": "Ethereum price has made a bearish breakout in the past few days as a somber mood engulfs the crypto industry. ETH coin plunged to a low of $1,544 on Friday, the lowest level since March 12th. It has fallen by more than 22% from the highest level this year, meaning it has moved into a bear market.\n\nBond yields rising\n\nEthereum price has been in a strong bearish trend in the past few days as investors focus on the falling interest in digital currencies. There is a sense in which many crypto investors have rotated to the stock market.\n\nAt the same time, there are concerns about the performance of the bond market. The yield of the 10-year and 30-year government bonds has jumped to the highest level in more than a decade.\n\nIn most periods, soaring bond yields mean that investors are anticipating more rate hikes by the Fed. If this happens, it will come at a time when the situation in the US and China is a bit mixed. For example, data from the United States shows that mortgage rates have jumped to the highest level in years.\n\nAt the same time, many Americans have started to default on their credit card debt and other loans. And the situation will worsen when millions of Americans restart paying their student loans.\n\nChina is another reason why Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies are sinking. Recent economic data from China showed that industrial production, manufacturing output, and retail sales slowed in July. Similarly, the country\u2019s imports and exports have plunged hard in the past few months.\n\nChina is an important part for Ethereum and Bitcoin since many people are still trading these assets. Data by WSJ showed that Binance generates over 20% of its income from Chinese customers.\n\nAdditional data shows that DeFi TVL in Ethereum has slumped to $56 billion, a 11% drop in the past 30 days. It has fallen to 33.94 million ETH from the year-to-date high of 60 million ETH.\n\nEthereum price prediction\n\nThe daily chart shows that the ETH price has made a bearish breakout in the past few weeks. This sell-off gained steam last week as the coin fell to a low of $1,544. It is now moved below the 100-day moving average and is trading at the lowest level on June 15th.\n\nEthereum has formed what looks like a double-top pattern. Therefore, the coin will likely have a bearish breakout in the coming weeks. If this happens, the next level to watch will be at $1,500."

        "content": "friend.tech, a new application on Base, ensured that the L2 transaction outpaced others in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nBase\u2019s TVL surged, as the amount bridged exceeded $253 million.\n\nAs it stands, the reign of many Ethereum [ETH] L2s has been put on hold, making way for Coinbase\u2019s L2, Base, to take the mantle. And it\u2019s not just that. The Ethereum Mainnet may have also stepped back for Base to take the crown of increased activity and traction.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s OP\u2019s market cap in ETH terms\n\nHow has this come to be?\n\nFriends help Base trump the king\n\nNot to beat around the bush, Base\u2019s Transactions Per Second (TPS) surpassed that of Ethereum on 22 August, according to L2 Beat. As per the chart below, Ethereum\u2019s TPS was 12.05 while Base was 15.88.\n\nThe data revealed that Base\u2019s TPS had increased by 73.56% in the last 24 hours. Ethereum, on the other hand, decreased by 1.47% within the same timeframe. However, there was one particular reason that Base was able to achieve the milestone and its name\u2014 friend.tech.\n\nfriend.tech is a mobile application built on Coinbase L2. While it prides itself as the \u201cmarketplace for your friends,\u201d friend.tech provides an avenue for users to tokenize their identity. And, in turn, can sell shares of themselves to their followers or anyone interested in their community.\n\nDespite being launched only recently, friend.tech has experienced rapid growth and adoption. According to Dune Analytics, the application has amassed 97,316 unique traders. These traders have been involved in over one million transactions, valued at 39.195 ETH.\n\nBut besides Ethereum, Base has also pegged back the dominance of Arbitrum [ARB] and Optimism [OP]. Previously, AMBCrypto had reported how Base\u2019s emergence had disrupted the L2 flow.\n\nThe daily transactions reflect the usage rate of the network on a day-to-day basis. Therefore, the hike in transactions suggested optimism around Base. If it stays the same or increases further, the project might completely overtake its predecessors.\n\nMoreover, the integration of projects like Compound [COMP] and Aave [AAVE] also ensured that the \u201con-chain summer\u201d leader attracted more users. Now, the shift has extended to transactions.\n\nL2 standings have changed\n\nAccording to Delphi Digital, daily transactions on Base have outstripped those of Optimism and Arbitrum combined.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nAt the time of writing, over $253 million had been bridged on Base. Based on Dune\u2019s data, ETH led the cohort of assets that have appeared on the network. This was followed by stablecoins Tether [USDT] and DAI.\n\nAlso, Base\u2019s Total Value Locked (TVL) has risen to $185.32 million, DefiLlama revealed. The surge in TVL implies that participants have come to trust Base despite a series of scams appearing on the network before its public Mainnet launch."

        "content": "For many investors, ETH price is back to the drawing board, down 9.7% in a week to $1,664 on Tuesday.\n\nThe leading smart contracts token tumbled from support at $1,800 last week amid a market-wide sell-off that saw Bitcoin price drop from its range support at $29,000, before seeking support at $25,000.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum came under heavy selling pressure, as traders swiftly switched to short positions that left many investors liquidated.\n\nSupport that had been anticipated in the region between $1,780 and $1,800 due to the presence of the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) did little to stop bears from pushing the price lower.\n\nTrading below the upper dotted ascending trendline, which had provided support since November 2022, following the FTX exchange implosion enhanced the bearish sentiments, and thus encouraged traders to sell more.\n\nAlthough ETH price touched $1,545 during the descent, a knee-jerk reaction reclaimed support at $1,600 aided by the lower ascending trendline. This buyer congestion remains critical for the resumption of the uptrend, even as Ethereum dodders at $1,664.\n\nETH Price On The Cusp Of Another 17% Sell-Off\n\nEthereum has from April, following the Shapella upgrade rally to the 2023 highs of $2,144, been facing a weakening market structure. The tug of war between bulls and bears confined Ether in a rectangle pattern, with resistance at $2,000 and support at $1,650 \u2013 call it consolidation.\n\nWithin the rectangle, a narrow range formed with Ethereum holding onto higher support at $1,800. Following, the losses incurred last week, ETH price now faces a crossroads:\n\nA break below the rectangle support at $1,650 could trigger another breakdown, where Ethereum may drop 17.76% to $1,56. On the other side of the fence, if this support holds, bulls will likely be encouraged to double down their efforts and push for a breakout above $2,000.\n\nIn the short term, the outcome is likely to be bearish based on the outlook exhibited by the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator as it moves further below the mean line (0.00).\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI), although in a sustained downtrend from the overbought region in early July, is not quite oversold. This suggests that sellers still have room to wiggle, pushing the price further down.\n\nUncertainty About the SEC\u2019s Spot ETF Approval Dampens Crypto Markets\n\nInvestors are jittery when it comes to seeking more exposure to crypto products, as revealed by CoinShares\u2019 digital asset investment products report.\n\nDigital asset investment products recorded outflows of up to $55 million last week compared to $29 million in fund inflows in the previous week.\n\nAlthough the market-wide sell-off may have contributed to the dismal numbers in digital asset investment products, the CoinShares report argued that it may be attributed to a \u201creaction to recent media highlighting that a decision by the US Securities & Exchange Commission in allowing a US spot-based ETF is not imminent.\u201d\n\nAccording to John Reed, a former SEC attorney, the SEC is unlikely to approve a spot ETF. Reed cited insights from Better Markets who wrote a letter to the SEC urging the agency not to approve any spot ETFs.\n\nWill the SEC Approve Any Of The Recent Bitcoin Spot ETF Applications? People often ask for my opinion on whether the SEC will approve any of the recent spate of bitcoin spot ETF applications, which is an interesting and important question. My take is that the current SEC will\u2026 pic.twitter.com/lPXebl03Y4 \u2014 John Reed Stark (@JohnReedStark) August 13, 2023\n\nAlthough Bitcoin was the most hit by the uncertainty surrounding the ETF approval, Ethereum saw $9 million in outflows, which erased the $2.5 million it recorded in the week before.\n\nCrypto markets are likely to remain in this dilapidated environment, especially with the Federal Reserve considering more rate hikes in September.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "title": "Crypto Spotlight: Ethereum, Shiba Inu, and Bitgert Performance Review | Mint - Mint",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is always evolving and introducing new projects that capture the attention of investors. Among the latest trends are three tokens, the giant, Ethereum (ETH), the meme coin, Shiba Inu (SHIB), and the innovative, Bitgert (BRISE). Here is a comparative analysis of their performance, features, and prospects.\n\nEthereum: Why are Whales Bidding Adue to Ethereum?\n\nEthereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, after Bitcoin. Ethereum is also the most popular platform for smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). Ethereum has undergone a major upgrade with Ethereum 2.0. Ethereum 2.0 aims to improve its scalability, security, and efficiency. Ethereum 2.0 transitioned Ethereum from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake (PoS) one. Ethereum 2.0 will reduce its energy consumption and environmental impact.\n\nEthereum has also been benefiting from the growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which are mostly built on Ethereum network. Ethereum has a market capitalization of $197.61 billion USD. However, presently, traders are gradually leaving the Ethereum market. The current open interest stands at its lowest point in the past 13 months, indicating a cautious retreat by traders to safeguard themselves from potential losses on the Ethereum network. A large whale sold off 10,600 Ethereum (equivalent to $17.2 million) at a rate of $1,622, resulting in a loss of approximately $2.9 million. As of August 23, 2023, Ethereum was trading at $1,644 USD.\n\nShiba Inu: Shibarium\u2019s Launch Hiccup & The Reconciliation Upgrade\n\nAlongside the crypto giant Ethereum, we have Shiba Inu on the list. Shiba Inu is a meme-based cryptocurrency that was launched in August 2020 as a \"Dogecoin killer\". Shiba Inu is named after a Japanese breed of dog Shiba Inu that is also the mascot of Dogecoin. Shiba Inu has a total supply of one quadrillion tokens. Half of Shiba Inu tokens were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin as a gesture of trust. Buterin later donated most of his Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens to various causes, such as Covid-19 relief in India and animal welfare.\n\nShiba Inu is also the native token of ShibaSwap. ShibaSwap is Shiba Inu\u2019s decentralized exchange that allows users to swap, stake, and farm Shiba Inu (SHIB) and other tokens. Shiba Inu\u2019s ShibaSwap also features a governance system that lets SHIB holders vote on proposals and changes to the platform. Shiba Inu recently launched its own blockchain called Shibarium. Shiba Inu\u2019s Shibarium is based on Ethereum's layer-2 solution Arbitrum. Shiba Inu\u2019s Shibarium aims to enhance Shiba Inu's speed, scalability, and security while enabling more DeFi and NFT applications.\n\nAs of August 23, 2023, Shiba Inu was trading at $0.00000786 USD, with a 24-hour trading volume of $4.32 billion USD. Shiba Inu was up 5.67% in the last 24 hours and 18.43% in the last week. Shiba Inu had a market capitalization of $3.1 billion USD, which accounted for 0.14% of the total crypto market cap.\n\nBitgert: Investors Eying on The Array of Developments Under Bitgert\u2019s Sleeve\n\nAlong with Ethereum and Shiba Inu, we have Bitgert on the list. Bitgert, a crypto engineering project founded in July 2021, offers blockchain products and auditing solutions. Bitgert is a newcomer that's swiftly capturing the attention of traders. Bitgert aims to deliver cost-free, high-speed blockchain interactions while consistently rewarding its robust community. BRISE is the native token of Bitgert platform. Initially based on BNB Chain, it shifted to the BRC20 blockchain in 2022, known for low gas fees and high-speed cross-chain transactions. The BRISE Wallet DApp is central, providing secure crypto asset management, while the BRISE token supports BUSD rewards through staking. The ecosystem employs a 5% transaction fee for buyback, enhancing the BRISE token's value. The Bitgert dApp Wallet features a P2P service for secure and fee-free transactions between buyers and sellers.\n\nAs of August 23, 2023, Bitgert was trading at $0.00000022 USD, with a 24-hour trading volume of $24.14 million USD. Bitgert was up 3.19% in the last 24 hours and 27.91% in the last week. Bitgert had a market capitalization of $203 million USD. Unlike Ethereum, investors have been eyeing on Bitgert for its developments and roadmap. Bitgert is also preparing to launch its own peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange, which will allow users to buy and sell Bitgert (BRISE) and other cryptocurrencies directly with each other, without intermediaries or fees. Bitgert P2P exchange will also offer more liquidity, security, and privacy to Bitgert users. Bitgert P2P exchange launch is expected to boost Bitgert's price and popularity, as more users will be able to access and trade Bitgert (BRISE) tokens easily and efficiently.\n\nTo buy Bitgert, you need to have an account on a cryptocurrency exchange that supports BRISE trading, such as Phemex or Uniswap. You can then use your preferred payment method to purchase Ethereum or another cryptocurrency that can be swapped for BRISE. You can then transfer your ETH or other crypto to your BRISE wallet address and exchange it for BRISE tokens on the BRISE platform or ShibaSwap.\n\nEthereum, Shiba Inu, and Bitgert are three cryptocurrencies that have different features and goals but share a common enthusiasm in the crypto community. While networks like Ethereum, and Shiba Inu have already saturated the market, newer projects like Bitgert are securing a strong foothold in the space.

        "content": "Bitcoin and other crypto tokens were trading range-bound on Tuesday, with a negative bias. The digital asset market has been struggling with prolonged winter, regulatory actions and litigations over the last few weeks. However, macroeconomic signals will also have their say in the token markets.\n\n\n\nBitcoin was trading flat, continuing to remain under selling pressure as the largest crypto tokens dropped slightly but managed to hold above $26,000-levels. However, Its largest peer, Ethereum, dropped about a per cent but retained above $1,650-mark. Price action in the altcoins was on the lower side.\n\n\n\nAfter we saw the decline in Bitcoin in the last few days, its price is just managing to keep up above the $26,000 mark, and the market seems to have found psychological support just over the 1 trillion-dollar market capitalization. Furthermore, the crypto and fear index continues to remain in the fear zone with a score of 37/100, said Shubham Hudda, Senior Manager, CoinSwitch Markets Desk.\n\n\n\n\"A very interesting product on Coinbase\u2019s layer 2 BASE, called friend.tech, has now been generating close to $1 million in 24 hours duration - making it the third most valuable Dapp within weeks of launching. The app lets Twitter or X.com users create an exclusive community where they can buy 'keys' of famous celebrities to get exclusive chat access with these celebrities,\" he said.\n\n\n\nBarring the Litecoin and US dollar pegged USD Coin, all other top crypto tokens were trading lower on Tuesday. Shiba Inu crashed about 5 per cent, while Polygon tanked about 4 per cent. Cardano and BNB dropped 3 per cent each, XRP and Dogecoin shed 2 per cent each.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading quite lower, falling down to $1.05 trillion-mark as it dropped almost a per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes jumped as much as 31 per cent to $28.94 billion.\n\n\n\nImage: Crypto-chart-price\n\n\n\nTech View by WazirX Trade Desk\n\nTravala.com is a leading booking service that embraces cryptocurrency, offering a vast selection of travel options across the globe, including hotels, homes, flights, tours, and activities.

        "content": "South Korea, known for its tech-savvy populace and a strong inclination towards crypto investments, has thrown a new trend into the spotlight concerning XRP.\n\nA recent report from the South Korean news outlet News1 Korea indicates that the nation\u2019s Generation Z (GenZ) displays a marked preference for altcoins, most notably XRP, over the more established giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nGenZ\u2019s Shift To Altcoins\n\nThe report undertook a detailed study of investment data on Bithumb, one of South Korea\u2019s leading crypto exchanges. The findings from this analysis illuminate the distinctive investment behaviors of different age groups, especially emphasizing the choices made by GenZ investors.\n\nThe investment propensity based on age revealed that GenZ or those in their 20s are more inclined towards \u201caggressive\u201d investment proneness. This emerging generation of investors is displaying a pronounced preference for altcoins, alternatives to the dominant cryptos such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).\n\nIn this study, Bitcoin and Ethereum are categorized as \u201clong-term\u201d and \u201cstable investments\u201d owing to their perceived low volatility in the market.\n\nThe report reveals that roughly 82.5% of GenZ investors have poured their money into altcoins, excluding ETH. But it\u2019s XRP that stands out amongst the crowd. Approximately one in five GenZ investors, or 20.7% to be precise, have chosen this token as their primary altcoin for investment.\n\nThe Larger Context And XRP\u2019s Role In It\n\nThis surge in the altcoin\u2019s popularity among younger South Korean investors is juxtaposed with a contrasting trend for the slightly older age bracket.\n\nInvestors in their 30s were found to have a higher affinity for Bitcoin and Ethereum. It suggests that while GenZ is more open to exploring newer and potentially riskier altcoins, the previous generation is still aligned mainly with the tried and tested crypto leaders.\n\nFurther shedding light on this trend, a crypto derivatives platform Bitget report stated that nearly half of the crypto copy traders on the exchange belong to the GenZ demographic.\n\nSpeaking of the token, Crypto lawyer John Deaton has recently explained that the US Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) legal tussle with Ripple over the XRP token may have significantly set the altcoin\u2019s trajectory back in the US market by three years.\n\nYou could NEVER underestimate the damage the SEC\u2019s lawsuit has caused \u2013 NOT ONLY AGAINST RIPPLE \u2013 BUT #XRP. THREE YEARS OF ADOPTION \u2013 that\u2019s what it\u2019s caused. Just how long is 3 yrs \u2013 in crypto years? People seem to forget how much Coinbase promoted #XRP before the lawsuit.\u2026 https://t.co/1fZ3r8WCSd pic.twitter.com/GLu4kFUU38 \u2014 John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) August 22, 2023\n\nMeanwhile, the cryptocurrency currently trades for $0.52, up by 1.9% over the past 24 hours, with a 24-hour trading volume of $1 billion.\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, Chart from TradingView"

        "title": "Base Spectacular Rise: Surpasses Ethereum's TPS With Record Highs - TronWeekly",
        "content": "Coinbase\u2019s Layer 2 blockchain, Base, shattered records by achieving an unprecedented average of 15.88 transactions per second [TPS] within the last 24 hours. This surge has propelled the L-2 beyond its rivals, most notably Ethereum and other prominent Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism, according to data analysis conducted by L2Beat.\n\nMoreover, the rapid ascent of Base\u2019s TPS comes hand in hand with an astounding growth rate of 157% over the course of just one week. This staggering progression is primarily tied to the immense popularity of the brand-new social application, Friend.Tech, which has so far attracted over 100,000 individuals within days of its launch.\n\nAs earlier reported by TronWeekly, Friend.Tech has taken the crypto world by storm, serving as a virtual marketplace where enthusiasts can buy and sell fractional ownership in their favorite celebrities. It has recently scored a new milestone by reaching the top 3 protocols, surpassing both the Uniswap and Bitcoin networks, and ranking second only to the Ethereum and Lido protocols in terms of generated revenue.\n\nBuilt on OP Stack in collaboration with Optimism, the synergy between the two has undoubtedly unleashed a revolution, redefining the scope of what blockchain and social interaction can achieve together. In the midst of a broader crypto market decline, Base has managed to defy expectations.\n\nBase\u2019s Ascent Beckons A New Era For L-2 Blockchains\n\nAs indicated by DefiLlama, the Base\u2019s Total Value Locked [TVL] has surged impressively in the same period. The driving forces behind this remarkable achievement are the decentralized exchange \u201cBaseSwap\u201d and the cross-chain bridge \u201cStargate.\u201d These components have played a pivotal role in propelling the TVL to an impressive $188 million mark, a testament to the trust and engagement the community places in layer 2.\n\nIt is not only investors who are captivated by Base\u2019s allure; other prominent protocols are looking for ways to leverage it. Among these is Synthetix, a derivatives liquidity protocol, which is actively considering the protocol for its deployment strategy. The significance of the L-2\u2019s achievements has been solidified by on-chain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence, which recently announced its support for the Ethereum L2 chain.\n\nAs Base continues its upward trajectory, its rise to prominence signifies a new era, one where Layer 2 solutions stand at the forefront of blockchain innovation, forging a new path of engagement with technology and finance."

        "title": "How ICP's AstroX ME Enhances Interoperability with the Ethereum Ecosystem - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "Numerous cryptocurrency wallets exist only as browser-only plugins, which lack compatibility with the demands of modern mobile lifestyles. However, requiring users to be stationed at a computer, and installing a specific browser to access a wallet, would introduce significant inconvenience. In addition, the evolution of wallets is inevitably geared toward widespread adoption, necessitating a user experience that rivals or even surpasses that of Web2 products.\n\nFurthermore, intelligent wallets should harness cryptographic methods to establish the credibility of transactions on blockchain networks. AstroX ME envisions a redefinition of wallets, emphasizing security and transactional ease.\n\nThe AstroX ME wallet represents a multi-chain smart wallet fortified by cutting-edge cryptography, delivering a seamless interactive encounter reminiscent of Web2 applications.\n\nThe ME wallet employs biometric technologies such as fingerprints and facial recognition, departing from conventional private key management. This innovative approach facilitates wallet restoration on new devices without using seed phrases. The wallet extends its support to numerous chains and a variety of cryptocurrencies.\n\nHow does the AstroX ME wallet work?\n\nDrawing from the conceptual comprehension of identity and wallets, the AstroX ME wallet has been meticulously designed to distinguish between the concepts. Users will initially establish a decentralized identity using the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) and then utilize the associated wallet. Here\u2019s a video on how to use \u00c5strox ME.\n\nAstroX Me Wallet Mobile App Interface\n\nThis approach carries two significant implications:\n\nPrimarily, users only need to recall their identity to oversee all the associated data, akin to how registering for a Google account permits access to numerous applications and services.\n\nSecond, users can oversee their wallets using a singular identity (username), enabling fluid asset transfers within wallets. Upon logging into a third-party DApp using a username, users can seamlessly switch between wallets, emulating the payment experience in our day-to-day lives. In essence, the essential data of all DApps, including account levels and operational records, are exclusively linked to the identity (username), enabling users to conveniently switch wallets for various transactions.\n\nOnce the user creates their AstroX ME wallet they can receive and send tokens of ICP, EXT, ICRC-1, DIP20, XTC, Origyn, and DRC20 standards and collectibles of EXT, DIP721, Origyn, GIGA, ICPunks, CCC, C3, Departure Labs, and IC Naming Standards. All they need to do is click on \u201cManage Token\u201d to enable their token of choice from the available token list.\n\nICP Token Wallet Interface\n\nManage Token Interface\n\nServing as the conduit between users and DApps, the AstroX ME wallet introduces innovation in its authorization mechanism design, presenting three distinct authorization login modes with varying privacy levels:\n\nOrdinary\n\nPseudonymous\n\nAnonymous\n\nThis empowers users to determine whether third-party DApps can track behavioral data within or across applications.\n\nAstroX ME leverages the ECDSA Threshold Signature of Dfinity, an L1 public chain, for signature completion. Notably, this signature process necessitates no intermediary servers for verification, relying on the Dfinity blockchain\u2019s consensus mechanism for security and efficiency.\n\nThe Threshold ECDSA, an advancement over ECDSA technology, incorporates support for BIP 32-derived standards. This widely utilized ECDSA signature in the blockchain industry empowers smart wallets with ECDSA public keys for transaction signing. Through Threshold ECDSA, wallets can hold BTC and ETH while executing transactions. Collaboration among nodes in creating Threshold ECDSA signatures enables key sharing, ensuring signature completion even if a portion of nodes face issues.\n\nThe dynamically evolving Threshold ECDSA, regularly updated to mitigate the risk of secret leakage, remains operational even if 1/3 of the nodes experience disruptions, attesting to its reliability.\n\nAstroX ME adopts an account abstraction mechanism with smart contracts executed in a WebAssembly container, with permissions verified in the protocol stack. User account ownership resides within user-bound devices, each of which functions as a hardware wallet. Users enjoy the flexibility to add or remove devices at their discretion.\n\nIn contrast to numerous smart contract wallets relying on Solidity compiled EVM, which demands pre-unlocking of contracts and can be hampered by network congestion and L1 limitations, AstroX ME employs the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) high-performance protocol. Boasting a block speed of 30 blocks per second and 2-second finality, it aligns with Harmony\u2019s performance standards.\n\nBy scripting smart contracts in a WebAssembly-supported language, ME facilitates intricate custom logic and contract upgrades, offering ample room for addressing diverse user requirements.\n\nKey AstroX wallet features\n\nAstroX is committed to crafting the ME wallet with an array of robust features, designed to enhance user convenience, security, and accessibility across various devices and platforms. The ME wallet encompasses the following attributes:\n\nUser-friendly ID registration and login\n\nAstroX prioritizes ease of use by enabling users to effortlessly register and log in using a memorable ID. This streamlines the onboarding process, eliminating the need for convoluted login procedures.\n\nSeamless multi-device binding\n\nIn a departure from traditional practices that rely on seed phrases, the ME wallet introduces a secure multi-device binding mechanism. This empowers users to associate their wallets with diverse devices, spanning desktop computers and smartphones, without the need for cumbersome seed phrases.\n\nEnhanced security via biometric authentication\n\nAstroX recognizes the significance of biometric security measures. By allowing users to log in with devices featuring biometric capabilities, such as fingerprint and facial recognition, the ME wallet ensures an extra layer of robust security.\n\nIntegration with Ethereum wallets like Metamask\n\nThe ME wallet extends its interoperability by facilitating seamless login with Ethereum wallets like Metamask. This enables users to access their Ethereum assets without friction, enhancing the wallet\u2019s versatility.\n\nMobile client compatibility\n\nAstroX caters to a diverse user base by offering ME wallet support for both iOS and Android devices. This cross-platform accessibility ensures users can manage their assets conveniently, regardless of their preferred mobile operating system.\n\nMulti-blockchain and coin support\n\nThe ME wallet exemplifies AstroX\u2019s commitment to inclusivity by accommodating multiple blockchains, including Harmony and various other EVM-compatible chains. It extends its utility by supporting a wide range of mainstream coins such as BTC, ETH, ONE, and ICP, among others.\n\nSupport multiple standards of collectibles\n\nAstroX Me wallet supports a wide range of collectibles including EXT, DIP, CCC, and GIGA.\n\nThird-party DApp integration\n\nAstroX acknowledges the significance of decentralized applications (DApps) in the blockchain ecosystem. The ME wallet stands as a gateway to third-party DApps, encompassing both Web DApps and MiniDApps.

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin Transfers $1M Worth Ethereum (ETH) to Coinbase - The Coin Republic",
        "content": "Based on on-chain data, a wallet linked to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin transferred 600 Ether, which is valued at approximately $1 Million to Coinbase earlier today.\n\nAt press time, the exact reason for this transaction is subject to speculation. Traditionally, transfers to exchanges are often interpreted as potential indications of an intention to sell. Given the recent challenges in Ethereum\u2019s price performance, Buterin\u2019s transaction might contribute to additional selling pressure on the digital asset.\n\nAdditionally, on-chain tracking service Lookonchain has noted that the Vitalik.eth wallet made a repayment of 251,000 RAI on the Maker DeFi platform and subsequently withdrew 1,000 ETH, amounting to roughly $1.67 Million, on August 20th, 2023.\n\nThe wallet identified as \u201cvitalik.eth\u201d has been in existence for seven years and currently holds 3,993 ETH, valued at $6.5 Million at the present time. The Arkham Intelligence dashboard has corroborated that this wallet is indeed associated with Ethereum\u2019s co-founder.\n\nAdditionally, this wallet contains other digital assets, including $84,000 worth of USD Coin (USDC) and $58,000 worth of Wrapped Ethereum (WETH).\n\nIndeed this is not the first instance of Buterin transferring assets to a cryptocurrency exchange. Back in March 2023, the Ethereum co-founder sent 200 ETH to Kraken. During the same timeframe, Buterin also sold off a number of unsolicited altcoins, converting them into 439.25 ETH.\n\nButerin\u2019s recent transaction coincides with the aftermath of last Thursday\u2019s sudden crash in the crypto market. During the previous week, Ethereum\u2019s price dropped below the $1700 threshold for the first time since June 2023 and has remained below that level as of the present moment.\n\nEthereum Founder Not Transferring for First Time\n\nIt\u2019s true that historically when ETH tokens are transferred by Vitalik Buterin or the Ethereum Foundation, it has often coincided with a decrease in ETH\u2019s price. While the rationale behind the recent transfer remains unclear, there\u2019s a chance that Buterin might be considering another substantial sell-off.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s also possible that this transfer is a one-time occurrence for a specific sale. Speculations are circulating on social media, as the community tries to decipher the potential implications of this action.\n\nMarket analysts and experts are currently projecting a significant decline in Ethereum\u2019s value if it drops below the critical support range of $1,550-$1,600. The broader cryptocurrency industry has experienced a substantial drop, with the total market capitalization decreasing by over 10% in the past week. As of the present moment, the entire cryptocurrency market capitalization is situated at $1.05 Trillion."

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin cashes out over $1 million in ETH before 'anticipated dip to $1000' - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "In a recent analysis, popular crypto market analyst Ali Martinez issued a cautionary note to cryptocurrency investors, highlighting the critical importance of Ethereum (ETH) maintaining its support within the $1,600 \u2013 $1,550 range.\n\nMartinez\u2019s warning emphasized that a breach of this key support zone could expose Ethereum to substantial downside risks, potentially triggering a significant correction of 37% to 45%. Such a correction could potentially drive the price of the popular crypto token to as low as $1,000.\n\nOn August 21, the expert revealed that Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, moved 600 ETH worth more than $1 million to Coinbase, citing on-chain data from blockchain intelligence platform Arkham.\n\nAccording to Martinez, the move could signal that Buterin is \u201ccashing out before the anticipated ETH dip to $1,000.\u201d\n\nButerin moving 600 ETH to Coinbase. Source: Ali Martinez Twitter\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nAt the time of publication on August 22, ETH was changing hands at $1,657, down 1.17% in the past 24 hours.\n\nThe second-largest crypto asset by market cap fell by more than 10% on a weekly basis and 12% on the month, losing over $26 billion in market cap during this period.\n\nETH 1-week price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nYear-to-date, ETH remains up over 38%, though significantly underperforming Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) 56% surge.\n\nWhy is Ethereum falling?\n\nThe latest drop in price coincides with a broader downturn in the cryptocurrency market, which has been driven by concerns of potential interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve.\n\nAdditionally, investor sentiment has been influenced by unresolved uncertainties surrounding the legal conflict between the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Grayscale.\n\nThis dispute pertains to Grayscale\u2019s pursuit of converting its GBTC bitcoin trust into an exchange-traded fund (ETF) backed by spot BTC, leaving market participants awaiting further regulatory clarity.\n\nPseudonymous crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto said on Tuesday that Ethereum\u2019s recent dip below $1,570 presented a \u2018fantastic buy\u2019 opportunity for the number two cryptocurrency.\n\nHowever, CrediBULL\u2019s views differ from Martinez\u2019s as he believes that Ethereum\u2019s bottom is likely behind us and that ETH may be one of the first altcoins to follow the lead of Bitcoin to the upside despite the bearish stance on ETH/BTC pairing in the short term.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
