        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum Now Less Volatile Than Oil: Report\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum Appear To Be Experiencing A Period Of Reduced Volatility\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum, well-known for their erratic price fluctuations, appear to be experiencing a period of reduced volatility.\n\nSurprisingly, oil currently has more volatility than these digital currencies. The 90-day volatility indexes for Bitcoin and Ethereum have fallen to multi-year lows, falling by 35% and 37%, respectively, according to latest Open in a new tab from Kaiko research. As a result, compared to oil, which has a 41% volatility rate, these top cryptocurrencies are now less volatile.\n\nThe frequency and magnitude of price movements over time are indicated by market volatility. In the past, cryptocurrencies have been more volatile than oil, as seen by their bigger and more frequent price fluctuations.\n\nDespite the fact that oil currently dominates the Nasdaq and gold in terms of volatility, it has actually fallen from a volatility rate of 63% in July 2022. Increased geopolitical tensions and China's underwhelming economic rebound following the relaxation of Covid-19 limitations may be to blame for this drop in oil's volatility.\n\nKaiko's research also highlights that both Bitcoin and Ethereum are currently experiencing multi-year lows in terms of liquidity and trade volume, which could contribute to their decreased volatility.\n\nThe anticipated launch of an exchange-traded fund (ETF) for Bitcoin may stir up market volatility once again. This gained credibility in the wake of BlackRock's unexpected ETF application, given the firm's track record of successful applications and the subsequent actions of other applicants."

According to him, standardizing how DApps operate and interact was the only way to sustain adoption. So, Ethereum 1.0 was created.\n\nVitalik Buterin co-created Ethereum to address Bitcoin\u2019s deficiencies. Buterin published the Ethereum white paper in 2013, describing smart contracts \u2014 automated, immutable \u201cif-then\u201d statements \u2014 that facilitate the creation of decentralized applications. Despite the existence of DApp development in the blockchain space, platforms were not interoperable. Buterin envisioned Ethereum uniting them. According to him, standardizing how DApps operate and interact was the only way to sustain adoption. So Ethereum 1.0 was created.\n\nOver time, developers brought their own decentralized concepts to Ethereum. These users established the DAO in 2016, a democratic organization that voted on network adjustments and proposals. The organization was supported by a smart contract and did not require a CEO to wield authority over Ethereum. Instead, a majority vote was required for modifications to be implemented. DAO voted to \u201chard fork\u201d Ethereum to tackle security vulnerabilities by effectively undergoing a significant software update. This new variant kept the name Ethereum, whereas the original network is known as Ethereum Classic.\n\nThe Evolution of the Ethereum Blockchain\n\nSince its launch in July 2015, the Ethereum blockchain network has endured a number of upgrades and modifications. Among the most important:\n\nFrontier (2015): This was the first release of the Ethereum network, which permitted users to construct and deploy their own smart contracts and decentralized applications.\n\nHomestead (2016): This introduced a number of enhancements, including security enhancements, gas optimizations, and network stability enhancements.\n\nMetropolis (2017-2019): This was a two-part upgrade comprised of Byzantium and Constantinople for Metropolis (2017-2019). Byzantium implemented significant enhancements, including a new mining algorithm, enhanced privacy features, and a decrease in block rewards. Constantinople included upgrades to decrease transaction fees, improve efficiency, and introduce new features such as off-chain transactions.\n\nIstanbul (2019): This included the integration of zk-SNARKs (a type of zero-knowledge cryptography), a new mining algorithm, and numerous protocol upgrades to improve network efficiency and security.\n\nBeacon Chain (2020): In November 2020, the required 16,384 deposits of 32 staked ETH were successfully made to assure Beacon Chain\u2019s secure operation. As a consequence, the Beacon Chain began producing blocks on December 1, 2020, marking a significant step towards the realization of the Ethereum vision.\n\nBerlin (2021): This protocol upgrade in Berlin, 2021, introduced several new features, including gas charge optimizations, enhanced security measures, and a reduction in transaction fees for certain types of transactions.\n\nLondon (2021): This introduced EIP-1559, which altered the method by which Ethereum network transaction fees are calculated. This upgrade introduced a fee burn mechanism, which helps reduce the total supply of ETH and introduces a more predictable fee structure for consumers.\n\nParis (The Merge \u2014 2022): The Paris upgrade was activated when the proof-of-work blockchain reached a terminal total difficulty of 58750000000000000000000 on September 15, 2022, at block 15,537393. The transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake was a significant milestone for Ethereum, which was triggered on the following block. Along with this change, the upgrade included enhancements to the execution clients, similar to Bellatrix on the consensus layer, allowing the execution clients to receive instructions from their connected consensus clients by activating a new set of internal API methods known as the Engine API.\n\nThese upgrades have introduced numerous enhancements to the Ethereum network in terms of security, efficiency, and scalability, and have increased the network\u2019s functionality.\n\nShapella or Shanghai (2023): Since switching to a proof-of-stake system, Ethereum has just undergone its first significant upgrade, or \u201chard fork.\u201d The Shanghai upgrade permits validators to extricate staked ether (ETH) from the network. While the primary objective of the upgrade is to implement Ethereum Improvement Proposal-4895, which enables validator withdrawals, other significant upgrades will impact Ethereum app developers and a significant portion of the chain\u2019s users.\n\nThe enhancement will alter the functioning of the blockchain. A reduction in petrol fees for layer-2 solutions like Polygon is one of the most significant modifications. This update seeks to improve the blockchain\u2019s overall functionality and reduce transaction fees. The ability for users to access and unstake their Ethereum tokens, which were previously sealed in a smart contract when they became validators on the proof-of-stake-based Ethereum blockchain known as Beacon Chain, is another significant change. This update gives users more options for administering their staked ETH tokens.\n\nThe Shanghai update introduces technical enhancements to the smart contract feature, which will help to position Ethereum as a significant player and reflect Ethereum\u2019s ongoing efforts to improve its technology and increase user value.\n\nFeatures of Ethereum\n\nSmart contracts: One of the key innovations introduced by Ethereum is the concept of smart contracts. These self-executing contracts are coded agreements that automatically enforce the terms and conditions defined within them. Built on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain, smart contracts eliminate the need for intermediaries, reducing costs and increasing efficiency. They can be utilized across various industries, including finance, supply chain management, and real estate, to automate processes and enable trustless transactions. The primary characteristic of a smart contract is that it cannot be modified once it has been executed, and any transaction performed on top of a smart contract is recorded perpetually; it is immutable. Therefore, even if the smart contract is modified in the future, the transactions associated with the original contract cannot be modified.\n\nEthereum virtual machine (EVM): The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a crucial component of the Ethereum network. It is a runtime environment that executes smart contracts, allowing developers to build and deploy decentralized applications (dApps) on top of the Ethereum blockchain. The EVM\u2019s Turing-complete programming language, Solidity, provides developers with a powerful toolset to create complex and innovative applications. This has led to a thriving ecosystem of dApps, ranging from decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces.\n\nEther: Ether (ETH) serves as the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network. It plays a vital role in facilitating transactions and incentivizing the network\u2019s participants. Unlike Bitcoin, which primarily serves as a digital store of value, Ether has dual functionality. It can be used both as a digital currency and as \u201cgas\u201d to power computations and execute smart contracts on the Ethereum network. This duality enhances the flexibility and utility of Ether within the ecosystem.\n\nDecentralized applications (dApps): A Dapp program operates on a decentralized peer-to-peer network. It is software designed to operate in the Ethereum network without a centralized system, and that is the primary distinction: it enables direct interaction between end-users and decentralized application providers. When an application is open-source (its code is on Github) and employs a public blockchain-based token to run, it is considered a Dapp. A token serves as the propellant for a decentralized application. Dapp permits the decentralization of back-end code and data, and this is the primary architecture of any Dapp.\n\nDecentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs): A DAO is a decentralized and democratic digital organization that operates without hierarchical management. Essentially, a DAO is an organization in which decision-making is delegated to certain designated authorities or a group of designated individuals as part of an authority, as opposed to a centralized authority. DAOs rely on smart contracts for decision-making, or decentralized voting systems, within the organization, as they exist on a blockchain network that is governed by the embedded protocols of a smart contract. Before any organizational decisions can be made, the voting system, which is a decentralized application, must be utilized.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the Ethereum network stands as a groundbreaking platform that has revolutionized the world of blockchain technology. With its smart contract functionality and decentralized nature, Ethereum has empowered developers and entrepreneurs to create innovative applications and ushered in a new era of decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and decentralized applications (DApps).\n\nMoreover, Ethereum\u2019s scalability solutions, such as Ethereum 2.0 with the introduction of the Beacon Chain and shard chains, are poised to address the network\u2019s scalability limitations, ensuring that it can handle a larger number of transactions while maintaining security and decentralization. Looking toward the future, the Ethereum network shows great promise and potential for further growth and development. Ethereum 2.0\u2019s full implementation is anticipated to bring significant improvements in terms of scalability, energy efficiency, and transaction throughput, which will open doors to even more widespread adoption."

        "content": "At the forefront of the burgeoning sector of decentralized finance (DeFi), Ethereum (ETH 0.54%) stands as the undisputed leader. With its robust smart contract capabilities and first-mover advantage, developers have harnessed its potential to create innovative decentralized applications, ranging from lending ecosystems to stablecoins and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nWhile various blockchain networks offer DeFi and smart contract functionality, Ethereum's pioneering position has firmly established it as the preferred choice not only for developers, but also for more traditional companies exploring new blockchain-based business models. The convergence of DeFi and traditional finance is in its beginning stages, but a handful of recent announcements prove that Ethereum is firmly leading the charge and might be worthy of a spot in investors' portfolios.\n\nCoinbase joins in\n\nOn Aug. 9, Coinbase Global unveiled Base, its Layer-2 blockchain built on top of Ethereum. The technicalities of Layer-2 solutions shouldn't be overlooked, but the key matter investors should focus on is Coinbase's decision to build it in conjunction with Ethereum rather than another blockchain.\n\nBy using Base, developers can harness the power of Ethereum's proven security and decentralization while also benefiting from the speed and low costs of Base, the most notable feature of Layer-2 solutions. In just the first week of operations, Base attracted the likes of companies such as Coca-Cola.\n\nThe strategic architecture of Base aims to streamline the construction and integration of on-chain solutions into new business models, fostering a seamless transition for individuals and companies seeking to capture blockchain technology's potential.\n\nPayPal hops on board\n\nAnother high-profile company also made the decision to launch its own Ethereum-based solution: PayPal. A global powerhouse in online payments, PayPal said on Aug. 7 it would launch its own stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain, aptly named PayPal USD.\n\nPegged to the value of the U.S. dollar, this stablecoin is poised to revolutionize the digital payments landscape. From the announcement, PayPal stated that its stablecoin \"is designed to reduce friction for in-experience payments in virtual environments, facilitate fast transfers of value to support friends and family, send remittances or conduct international payments, enable direct flows to developers and creators, and foster the continued expansion into digital assets by the largest brands in the world.\"\n\nPayPal has plans to eventually integrate the stablecoin into its online marketplace eBay and mobile payment solution Venmo.\n\nBanks explore tokenization\n\nLikely the most intriguing development in the Ethereum landscape is the blending of traditional banking and the exploration of tokenization, a process that converts real-world assets, such as bonds or equities, into digital tokens on a blockchain.\n\nRecognition of the benefits that come with tokenization, namely enabling fractional ownership, efficient international trading, and enhanced transparency, is only in its infancy but some of the most prominent institutions in the world are already exploring its potential.\n\nIn November 2022, JPMorgan Chase achieved a groundbreaking milestone by successfully tokenizing Japanese bonds and yen, orchestrating a seamless conversion to Singaporean bonds and dollars on Ethereum's network.\n\nMore recently, in June 2023 the Bank of China tokenized $28 million worth of securities, the first transaction of its kind by a Chinese financial institution and further validating Ethereum's adaptability to modernize financial systems.\n\nAdding to the trend, the National Bank of Australia (NAB) unveiled its own stablecoin in March, a significant step toward facilitating cross-border payments. Drew Bradford, NAB executive general manager, summed up the desire for blockchain solutions best when stating, \"We believe that elements of the future of finance will be blockchain enabled, and we're already witnessing rapid change in the tokenization market.\"\n\nEthereum poised to thrive\n\nIn the unfolding landscape of businesses embracing blockchain solutions, Ethereum stands poised to thrive. As this trend gains traction, Ethereum's robust ecosystem, abundant liquidity, vibrant developer community, and established role position it for sustained growth.\n\nThis bodes well for Ethereum's long-term prospects because the expansion of use cases and network participants is one of the primary ways in which a cryptocurrency derives its value. As companies delve deeper and explore the advantages of blockchain technology, Ethereum will likely emerge as a beneficiary.\n\nWith its current price well below its all-time high, investors might find today an advantageous entry point to capture the coming waves of innovation. As more use cases find their home on Ethereum, the original smart contract blockchain could be a leader of portfolios for years to come."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nCardano founder Charles Hoskinson says Ethereum has terrible programming\n\nThe CEO highlights the power of his layer-2 solution Hydra\n\nADA survives despite removal from key exchanges\n\nIf Elon Musk was right about one thing when it comes to Twitter it would be about its potential as a town square. No other social media platform allows everyday folk to interact with celebrities, CEOs, and multi-millionaires/billionaires the way Twitter does. For that reason, one may find several instances where influential figures on the platform voice their opinions in a candid non-corporate-like manner.\n\nOn August 17th, Twitter became home to a daring statement by Charles Hoskinson, CEO of Cardano. Hoskinson quote-retweeted a user who outright mocked Cardano, Hydra, and Hoskinson. The CEO then responded by highlighting key advantages Cardano has over Ethereum, the blockchain the user seemingly preferred.\n\nCool, let\u2019s make a bet. My prediction is that within six months time, Charles will: Stop talking about Hydra \u201cWe never actually said that was a viable solution for everything, it\u2019s only good for a few specific things\u201d, has level set on Input Endorsers \u201cThat\u2019s the long term\u2026 \u2014 0xNLY.arf (@0xNLYFANS) August 17, 2023\n\nCardano: A Better Way Of Handling Transactions\n\nHoskinson\u2019s response focused both on criticizing Ethereum, and on highlighting the capabilities of his technology.\n\n\u201cHydra is live on mainnet and evolving fast. Mithril is live as well and the first step towards a rich DA and light client strategy. We already designed a significantly better way of handling transactions via tiered pricing and Babel fees.\n\nThere\u2019s been a roll-up strategy since Midnight was conceived 4 years ago. The protocols and primitives had to catch up and are getting there,\u201d tweeted Hoskinson.\n\nHydra refers to the layer-2 scaling solution that uses sidechains to offload transactions from the main chain. This allows Cardano to process more transactions per second at a lower cost.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile Ethereum has a dumpster fire of a consensus layer, has a terrible programming model that they can\u2019t change, and are getting eaten alive by their own layer 2 ecosystem.\u201c\n\nIt's getting delusion town now. Hydra is live on mainnet and evolving fast. Mithril is live as well and the first step towards a rich DA and light client strategy. We already designed a significantly better way of handling transactions via tiered pricing and Babel fees. There's\u2026 https://t.co/2cJa8ivJGu \u2014 Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) August 17, 2023\n\nIn a 2020 video, Hoskinson changed up the trend on his Youtube channel from updates about his personal life to a talk about his company\u2019s innovations.\n\n\u201cSimulations have shown that each \u2018Hydra head\u2019 can currently process about 1,000 transactions per second (TPS). With 1,000 stacking pools, each of which processes 1,000 TPS, Cardano could achieve a throughput of up to one million transactions per second,\u201d said Hoskinson in his video.\n\nHydra was first revealed during an AMA video on Hoskinson\u2019s Youtube channel in 2020. When asked about updates on the layer-2 solution his company has been working on, he had this to say:\n\n\u201cWe are going to keep adding resources to Hydra, and we\u2019ve been trying to identify some teams so we can parallelize the workstream because it\u2019s such a high commercial priority. And it\u2019s going to be very important that we\u2019ll be able to offload a large number of the transaction traffic that\u2019s going to come from all of the apps that are coming.\u201d\n\nHoskinson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nCardano\u2019s ADA Token Thrives Despite Outcasting\n\nCardano\u2019s native token ADA has been subject to several attacks due to its status in the eyes of the US Securities and Exchange Commission and its leader, Gary Gensler. Gensler sees any token besides Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, and Litecoin as a security. Accordingly, the SEC is willing to sue any exchange that trades in significant sums of these supposed \u2018unregistered securities.\u2019\n\nAs a result, many exchanges, such as Revolut, have been seen suspending trading of tokens such as ADA, SOL, and MATIC.\n\nHowever, Cardano and Hoskinson look at the application of ADA and its corresponding blockchain as technologies beyond the simple potential of financial investment.\n\nFor example, in 2021, Hoskinson tweeted his celebration of Cardano technology being used in Ethiopian schools as a form of encrypted credentials for five million students.\n\nDropped by the MOE today to discuss the digital transformation of Ethiopia's educational credentials. Five million students on schedule pic.twitter.com/FGhguPDW2q \u2014 Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) October 28, 2021\n\nOn top of that, Cardano\u2019s ADA is doing relatively well. Reports show that ADA is on an upward price trajectory and that bulls might be holding ADA in anticipation of a price increase."

        "content": "The SEC is reportedly set to approve Ethereum futures exchange-traded funds.\n\nInvestors traded $12.5 billion in Ethereum futures contracts in July.\n\nA futures product in the US may increase demand for Ethereum.\n\nWhile Bitcoin futures exchange-traded funds have been around for nearly two years, Ethereum is yet to have one \u2014 but that may be about to change.\n\nOn Thursday, Bloomberg News reported that the US Securities and Exchange Commission is poised to approve the sale of futures contracts for ETH, the token used in the Ethereum blockchain network and the second most valuable cryptocurrency.\n\nThat\u2019s good news for the dozen firms that have long desired to roll out an ETH futures ETF. They include Bitwise, Roundhill, and ProShares, and some funds might be approved as soon as October, Bloomberg reported. Moreover, funds in the hunt for investors may slash fees to capture market share as soon as possible.\n\nDemand influx\n\nAn Ether futures ETF could also be a bright spot for DeFi investors who have been whipsawed this year by an endless stream of hacks and heists in the Ethereum-inspired precinct of the crypto world. The futures product could \u201cincrease the demand influx for Ethereum in the US,\u201d according to K33 Research. Translation: more volume, and more action.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nThe advent of ETH futures ETFs may also bolster confidence that the SEC is looking kindly on the many applications filed by asset management firms such as BlackRock for a Bitcoin spot price fund.\n\nNOW READ: Coinbase and Binance crank up lobbying push as Congress prepares to debate crypto bills\n\nThat would be a seismic event because ETFs offer investors an affordable way to bet on the performance of stocks, commodities, and perhaps, cryptocurrencies. Plus, ETFs, which trade in the securities markets, tend to be highly liquid.\n\nThe hope is that a Bitcoin ETF would finally vault the asset class into the mainstream, and take the rest of crypto along with it.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nUnlike a spot ETF, a futures version would offer investors a chance to bet on where the price of ETH will be months from now. These products, which are technically derivatives, are tailored for institutional investors rather than retail traders.\n\nThis is why the SEC and its hard charging chair, Gary Gensler, are probably green-lighting their sale even as the agency continues to review the applications for spot BTC funds.\n\nRobust market\n\nWhile ETH fans may like the news, futures contracts for the token may follow the same trajectory as their Bitcoin counterparts, analysts say. And that could be worrisome for investors.\n\nTwo years after their introduction, Bitcoin futures-related ETFs have less than $1.5 billion in total assets under management, Nate Geraci, president of investment advisor ETFStore, told DL News.\n\n\u2018I believe investors want the real deal.\u2019 \u2014 Nate Geraci\n\nStill, there is a robust market in Ethereum futures contracts. In July, investors traded more than $12.5 billion in Ethereum futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, according to Coinglass data. That may be far less than the record high of $34 billion in November 2021, but the action has been consistently greater than $10 billion a month this year.\n\nFee war\n\nThe SEC\u2019s approval is likely to spur a race by asset managers to attract investors. That means a fee war is probably coming.\n\nRoundhill, an asset management firm vying for an Ethereum futures ETF, could take a chunk of the action if its fees are anything to go by. The asset manager disclosed a 0.19% management fee for its fund, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart tweeted.\n\nNOW READ: Aave stablecoin GHO struggles to hold dollar peg. \u2018The focus on peg should come later,\u2019 founder says\n\n\u201cThis is very low compared to Bitcoin futures ETFs like ProShares\u2019 0.95%,\u201d Seyffart said. And it may be \u201cdrastically lower\u201d than VanEck\u2019s Bitcoin futures product which charges 0.76%.\n\nETFStore\u2019s Geraci said he thought fees would be below 0.4%, but it \u201cmight end up way lower than that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill be brutal fee competition,\u201d he concluded.\n\nNot as simple as Bitcoin\n\nIt will be important to see how investors size up an Ethereum futures ETF compared to its Bitcoin counterpart, Geraci said. Ethereum isn\u2019t as simple as Bitcoin.\n\nAs the linchpin of the Ethereum network \u2014 and by extension, much of the DeFi ecosystem \u2014 Ethereum is more of a software play. Its proposition is wrapped up in providing financial utility to users, whether it\u2019s for payments or loans or collateral for loans or buying NFTs. In contrast, Bitcoin is now widely seen as a speculative asset.\n\nInvestors should come at the two digital assets with an entirely different approach, CoinShares\u2019 said last year.\n\n\u2018Ethereum should be valued differently, assigning a level of utility demand, while Bitcoin is a form of money.\u2019 \u2014 Marc Arjoon\n\n\u201cEthereum should be valued differently, assigning a level of utility demand, while Bitcoin is a form of money and should be valued via a monetary demand model,\u201d research associate Marc Arjoon wrote.\n\nPut another way, Ethereum is a closer match to tech companies than it is to Bitcoin, Arjoon argued. As a result, its correlation to the Nasdaq will \u201clikely rise above that of Bitcoin over time as investors grasp its complexities.\u201d\n\nThe upshot: Ethereum\u2019s futures ETFs might decouple from the course Bitcoin\u2019s futures products took. And there is another consideration \u2014 if the SEC approves a spot BTC ETF, there could be a big shift in assets from futures to the spot market.\n\n\u201cI believe investors want the real deal,\u201d Geraci said, referring to spot ETFs.\n\nDecent proxy\n\nAnalysts are already trying to figure out the scale of the Ethereum futures ETF marketplace. Bitcoin\u2019s market cap is around $500 billion, while Ethereum\u2019s is a little less than half that. \u201cI think that\u2019s a decent proxy for what to expect from Ethereum futures ETFs,\u201d Geraci said.\n\nMatt Kunke, a research analyst at market maker GSR, is also making estimates.\n\n\u201cWe anticipate the upper bound on demand will similarly be around $1 billion,\u201d he told DL News. This is a fraction of what the market maker would expect for a spot ETF, he added.\n\nHave a tip about the crypto markets? Contact the author at adam@dlnews.com."

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is in turmoil today as both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have experienced significant price drops, sending shockwaves across the financial community. As of this writing, Bitcoin has fallen to $26,298.74, marking a 9.04% decline in the last 24 hours, while Ethereum\u2019s price has tumbled to $1,620.54, showing a 10.5% drop within the same period.\n\nThe sudden dip in prices has resulted in massive liquidations across various exchanges. Data reveals that in the last 24 hours, liquidations reached an astounding $992.12 million, affecting 166,688 traders. Binance, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, witnessed the largest single liquidation order for Ethereum, valued at $55.92M.\n\nOff a cliff\n\nThe 24-hour liquidation amount has skyrocketed to $996.6 million, marking a staggering 741.27% increase, indicating high volatility and a significant number of traders being forced to close their positions.\n\nCoinglass data show that in the past 24 hours, a total of 167,465 traders were liquidated, with the total liquidation sum amounting to approximately $997.31 million. The largest single liquidation order was on Binance for ETHBUSD, valued at $55.92 million. The long and short ratio for liquidations stands at 46.11% and 53.89%, respectively. This suggests that while a majority of traders were betting on prices going up, a slightly higher number of traders were expecting a downturn.\n\nAnalyzing the liquidation data from major exchanges, OKX saw the highest percentage of long liquidations at 98.2%. In contrast, Deribit had a dominant short liquidation rate of 56.32%. Binance, one of the world\u2019s largest exchanges, also had a significant long liquidation rate of 91.97%.\n\nThe plunge also occurred as news broke that Chinese real estate powerhouse Evergrande had filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy in a U.S. court. The financial instability of the company and its potential ripple effects on the global economy have been a topic of intense scrutiny and apprehension for investors.\n\nUltrasound.money\u2018s observations shed light on a notable amount of Ethereum being burned. The burn rate is approximately 1.67 ETH/min, and leading DeFi platforms like Uniswap are major contributors to this phenomenon.\n\nLastly, it\u2019s essential to recognize that both traditional and crypto markets are susceptible to global macroeconomic factors. The ongoing economic challenges worldwide play a significant role in shaping investor sentiment and market dynamics.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s current price is down 61.63% from its all-time high (ATH) of $68,692.14, reached on November 10, 2021. Similarly, Ethereum has plummeted 66.55% from its ATH of $4,864.11, also recorded on the same date.\n\nAmid these liquidations, other cryptocurrencies such as XRP, LTC, and DOGE have also seen significant liquidation values. Exchange-wise, OKX, Deribit, Binance, and Huobi are leading in terms of liquidation amounts.\n\nWhile the immediate future of the cryptocurrency market remains uncertain, it is essential for investors to stay informed and exercise caution. Given the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies, such market fluctuations, while unsettling, are not unprecedented.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nTony Cai is one of those very rare developers who has experience building on both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). As such, he decided to analyze the differences between the two with his Web3 dev hat on. He managed to avoid both maximalisms and indicate the strong points of the two blockchains.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH): Which one is better for developer?\n\nFirst of all, building on Bitcoin (BTC) is much safer. It offers less surface area for potential attackers. By contrast, with Ethereum (ETH) smart contracts, a flaw in two lines of code might cost millions of dollars for the team, users and investors, Cai outlined in his recent Twitter thread.\n\nHaving spent time building on ETH first before pivoting to building on BTC, I've seen the best and worst parts of both communities.\n\n\n\nI'm probably gonna get some hate for this, but screw it...\n\n\n\nBTC vs ETH: An Honest Reflection from a Builder.\n\n\n\nHere are 6 things I noticed:\ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/3sBZKrZlRn \u2014 Tony Cai \u269b\ufe0f #SoundFinance (@TonyCai_) August 16, 2023\n\nAlso, Bitcoin's (BTC) development track is more focused while, on Ethereum (ETH), the \"next big things\" are popping up here and there. In the Bitcoin (BTC) community, developers go through a \"clear path of innovation\" with no distraction.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) developers do not have to worry about creating balanced and attack-resistant tokenomic designs as no token can go live on Bitcoin (BTC) as is. For Ethereum (ETH) applications, creating viable and attractive tokenomics is of paramount importance to sustainable product development.\n\nInstead, Bitcoin (BTC) developers can focus on a single product and its user-centric design:\n\nWith Bitcoin, it's all about pure product building in order to provide more value to our users. Our goal? Achieving product-market fit without the noise.\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, in February 2023, the Wall Street Journal accused Bitcoin Core of making the Bitcoin (BTC) development process centralized and vulnerable to censorship; analysts from CoinShares busted this narrative.\n\nEthereum (ETH) celebrates devs, not podcasters\n\nAt the same time, Cai has to admit that Ethereum (ETH) has a far more developed and mature infrastructure for engineers. Lightning apps, fiat on-ramps, multi-sigs and wallets represent all classes of apps that can be deployed on Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nAlso, Ethereum (ETH) makes new developer onboarding more streamlined through its hackathons of various types. This is why Ethereum (ETH) engineers feel like they are welcome from day one.\n\nFinally, the Bitcoin (BTC) community should hear the voices of its developers just like Ethereans do, Cai concluded. But all in all, he finds development on Bitcoin (BTC) \"feeling right\" despite all of its pros and cons.\n\nIt should be noted that the Ethereum (ETH) community always accuses Bitcoin (BTC) of being centralized in a number of ways."

I pity them.\" Addressing the Ethereum comparison, the founder said:\n\n\u201cEthereum has a dumpster fire of a consensus layer, has a terrible programming model that they can\u2019t change, and are getting eaten alive by their own layer 2 ecosystem.\"\n\n\"Cardano's sidechain plans mutually benefit both Cardano and the sidechain,\" he stated.\n\nIt's getting delusion town now. Hydra is live on mainnet and evolving fast. Mithril is live as well and the first step towards a rich DA and light client strategy. We already designed a significantly better way of handling transactions via tiered pricing and Babel fees.\n\n\n\nThere's\u2026 https://t.co/2cJa8ivJGu \u2014 Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) August 17, 2023\n\nIn March 2020, the Cardano Foundation published a research paper describing Hydra, a layer-2 solution using sidechains to offload transactions from the main network. Hoskinson explained that Cardano would soon become \u201cthe fastest system in the world,\" raising the following example:\n\n\u201cSimulations have shown that each 'Hydra head\u2019 can currently process about 1,000 transactions per second (TPS). With 1,000 stacking pools, each of which processes 1,000 TPS, Cardano could achieve a throughput of up to one million transactions per second.\"\n\nIn an ask-me-anything session from November 2021, Hoskinson revealed that the Hydra project was still under development with no set launch date. The first mainnet-compatible Hydra node was released on May 11, 2023. Since then, developers have teased the upcoming Hydra Pay, a supposed layer-2 integration with Cardano wallets bearing the feature of instant settlement and \u201cgazillion TPS.\"\n\nRegarding utility, data from Cardanoscan indicate that the blockchain currently processes an average of 65,000 transactions per day, or 0.75 transactions per second. In comparison, Ethereum processed over 1 million transactions in the past 24 hours, or about 12.45 transactions per second.\n\n\u201cNo matter how many times the VC coins, the cryptomedia, or the maxi crowd proclaims we are dead, irrelevant, or failing, we always remind them that Cardano is here to stay,\" wrote Hoskinson in a previous tweet.\n\nMagazine: Should we ban ransomware payments?

Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin continued its crash Thursday afternoon, shedding 7% of its value in 20 minutes and briefly dipping below $26,000 in the process. And as Bitcoin went, so too did other leading cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum\u2014with a cascade of liquidations topping $800 million to follow.\n\nThe largest cryptocurrency by market cap is trading for $26,314 as of this writing, according to CoinGecko\u2014a nearly 10% dive for Bitcoin over the last 24 hours. It fell as low as $25,649 this afternoon, but has rebounded slightly since then. The price of Bitcoin hasn't been this low since the start of June.\n\nBitcoin's dive Thursday followed word of China's sizable Evergrande Group property developer filing for Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection in New York. Around the same time, word began to spread about a Wall Street Journal report noting that Elon Musk's SpaceX wrote down the value of its Bitcoin holdings by $373 million and sold an unspecified amount.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe rest of the crypto market was in the red Thursday afternoon Eastern Time, too. Ethereum, the second largest digital asset by market cap, is down nearly 10% in the last day, trading hands for $1,640 as of this writing. It fell as low as $1,576 on Thursday afternoon, per CoinGecko.\n\nOther cryptocurrencies like Ripple (XRP), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Litecoin (LTC) are all down at least 14% over the past day. All three had seen significant upward price movement in recent weeks.\n\nAccording to data from Coinglass, the crashing prices across the board triggered a cascade of liquidations for overleveraged positions, with $801 million worth of liquidations tallied in the hour after the price started dropping.\n\nBitcoin had recently been on a run after a surge of interest from institutional investors\u2014including an application from BlackRock for a spot crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF)\u2014helped propel the biggest and oldest digital asset to a yearly high above $31,000 per coin.\n\nBut interest may be waning as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) does not appear to be in a hurry to approve the long list of high-profile applications.

        "title": "Could Ethereum be on the edge of a potential rebound to $2,000 - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "ETH could recover if the open interest continues to decrease.\n\nHowever, the potential rebound to $2,000 depends on the average market behavior.\n\nAfter enduring a period of low volatility and price retracement, Ethereum [ETH] was now standing at a crucial juncture, presenting a potential scenario for a rebound. This was the opinion of Korean on-chain analyst crypto sunmoon.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nAccording to sunmoon, ETH\u2019s price decrease is usually followed by a rise in open interest. As an indicator to determine market sentiment and price strength, the open considers the open contract held by participants at the end of a trading day.\n\nRepeating patterns\n\nSunmoon, in his analysis, published on CryptoQuant, noted that a follow-up of an open interest decrease leads to ETH\u2019s price recovery historically. And this was the current state of things. Furthermore, the analyst opined,\n\n\u201cIf Ethereum\u2019s price movement continues to be limited, a short-term bounce is possible.\u201d\n\nWith the ETH price hovering around the $1,825 mark, this observation could be necessary to gauge whether the altcoin is poised for a resurgence beyond the $2,000 level and into higher territory.\n\nOne metric that provides more insight into this is the Short Term Holder NUPL. This metric takes into account the behavior of short-term investors around a 155-day period. Using the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL), the metric can identify if market participants are in a state of hope, denial, optimism, or euphoria.\n\nAt press time, the Short Term Holder NUPL indicated that the broader market was in a state of hope (orange).\n\nThis means that the average ETH holder desires a price rise. However, most were not involved in intense buying to bring their wish to reality. Unless buying pressure increases, ETH may continue to consolidate.\n\nBullish traders should be careful\n\nHow about traders? Well, indications from the funding rate suggested that traders are bullish on the ETH price action.\n\nFunding rates are periodic amounts paid between traders that hold perpetual contract positions. When the funding rate is positive, it implies that traders are bullish. Furthermore, this also implies that longs pay short a funding fee to keep their positions open.\n\nConversely, a negative funding rate implies that short positions are dominant. Therefore, at 0.009%, the funding rate suggests that traders have a similar sentiment to short-term holders.\n\nHowever, the exchange inflow could be a stumbling block to ETH\u2019s potential rise to $2,000. Additionally, the exchange inflow measures the number of assets moving from non-exchange wallets to exchange wallets.\n\nAn increase in the metric tends to support a potential to sell off. While a decrease implies a possible decision to keep for the long term.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nAt press time, ETH\u2019s exchange inflow spiked to 57,700. If the exchange inflow continues to outpace the outflow, then ETH\u2019s potential rise to $2,000 might be difficult."

Valkyrie should be the first ETF with ETH futures on Oct. 3 or 4, he said before adding that the fund will be a mixed Bitcoin and Ethereum product.\n\nThis is what the dates look like as far as we\u2019re aware for #Ethereum Futures ETFs.

In early Asian trading on Friday morning, ETH dumped to $1,576 before recovering on the SEC news.\n\nStill, the asset is down 6% on the day, trading at $1,688 at the time of writing, so the promise of an ETF still hasn\u2019t prevented the massive selloff.\n\nEthereum spent around two months hovering around $1,850 before this week\u2019s declines. However, it could return to those levels if support can be found where it currently trades."

The infamous flash crash of May 19, 2021, is one such instance. On that day, BTC lost 14.38%. The loss was much higher when viewed from the daily high to daily low perspective.

In fact, a couple of weeks before the crash, the asset also scripted history by attaining a peak at $64,854. This time, the conditions were completely different. Bitcoin had been consolidating in a horizontal range for more than a month, trying to amass liquidity. However, it could not garner enough buying momentum, and eventually lost its support by around $28,585.

This was especially the case among the Ethereum whales.\n\nAs their activity has shown bullish sentiment, could this mean that the price is ready for a bounce?\n\nAre whales buying?\n\nAs reported by Lookonchain in a Twitter thread, BlockTower Capital deposited 5K of ETH worth $8.4M to Coinbase to sell, while other whales have bought the dip.\n\n1/ After the market crashed, BlockTower Capital panicky deposited 5K $ETH ($8.4M) to Coinbase.https://t.co/8xgOWrI1yA But the other 2 whales bought a total of 5,631 $ETH ($9.5M) from the bottom. Are you bullish or bearish? pic.twitter.com/xmBC5yFO4Z \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) August 18, 2023\n\nMeanwhile, more buying whale activity was seen. Two whales bought a total of 5,631 ETH worth $9.5M on the dip. One whale deposited 3998 ETH worth ($6.72M) to Compound and borrowed $5M stablecoins only to buy back 3,027 ETH ($5.09M) at $1,652.\n\nAnother deposited $4M in USDC to Binance and withdrew 2,604 ETH ($4.4M) after the market crashed. A Whale named Cumberland was mostly selling a total of 8K in ETH ( worth $14.4M) before the market dumped and then bought back 4K ETH ($6.72M), withdrawing it from Binance.\n\nPer Messari data, looking at the supply distribution charts, we can clearly see that whales haven\u2019t been dumping, and instead, they have been increasing their holding. The price has already made a bounce off almost 10% from its dip, so the whales have definitely been offering support.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis\n\nThe price of Ethereum fell sharply and came down from $1,800 on its open yesterday to $1543 at its lowest wick today, decreasing 14.64%. It has already recovered by 8.5%, measured to the level on which it\u2019s currently trading at $1,675.\n\nETH fell to the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level of the previous ascending move, but the 4-hour candle closed at 0.618, leaving an 8.2% wick on the 4-hour chart. This is in itself the sign that the support is strong at the $1,670 territory as the dip was immediately bought back with a strong supply, as evident from the previous paragraph from the ETH whales.\n\nThe RSI is signaling extreme oversold conditions as it fell to 6.4% on the 4-hour chart and 20% on the daily. The last time we saw those values was in June 2022, when the market started recovering significantly.\n\nElliott Wave count points out that we could have seen the end of the correctional pattern WXY from mid-April. Due to all of these indicators signaling that the price is undervalued, a bounce will be expected shortly.\n\nThe first target for the expected recovery would be close, to the lower level of the resistance zone above at $1780. What happens at those levels will dictate the next sustainable uptrend, as if a rejection occurs it could set up the price into a larger downtrend. But if it manages to enter the resistance zone again, it will likely mean that it is headed further beyond it, above the mid-April high of $2130.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nPlease note that the contents of this article are not financial or investing advice.

Arbitrum Orbit might be able to further aggregate transactions and optimize computation, significantly increasing the transaction throughput.\u201d"

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nFed minutes release for July\n\nCrypto market slipped by 3%, could it be based on hints of Fed hike?\n\nFurther rate hikes of 0.25% are likely\n\nThe minutes from the Federal Reserve\u2019s two-day July meeting came out yesterday, August 16 . They underscore the central bank\u2019s growing concerns about persistent inflation. Despite a recent quarter percentage point rate hike, which brought the federal funds rate to its highest level in over 22 years, the inflation battle is seen as ongoing by most FOMC members.\n\nThe minutes reveal significant worries about inflation staying above the Committee\u2019s desired range, with tight labor market conditions further complicating the outlook.\n\nAlthough some members expressed doubt about the necessity of additional hikes, the consensus leans towards caution, emphasizing the importance of a restrictive monetary policy to steer inflation back to the 2% target.\n\nWhile the future direction remains uncertain, with indications that inflation pressures might be easing, the minutes highlight a collective sentiment of vigilance, suggesting a heightened likelihood that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates again in the near future if current conditions persist.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum Slip\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin and Ethereum have slipped from their sideways range in a single percentage decrease of around 3%. Has there been a correlation between the negative sentiment toward the future economic outlook with this decrease in the cryptocurrency market?\n\nThe Fed minutes were released on the official website at 2:00 p.m. EDT yesterday.\n\nAlthough the news outlets started reporting soon after due to writing and publishing, the news lagged a bit behind until it caught on. Nevertheless, BTC and ETH prices have already been in a slight downtrend, which only propelled it further.\n\nAt the exact time of the Fed minutes release, the price of BTC and ETH started falling with higher momentum and picked up the pace overnight. The price of Bitcoin was trading at $29,195 and fell to $28,300 at its daily low. Ethereum fell from $1827 to its daily low of $1,777, which is a decrease of 2.69%.\n\nAs seen on the chart above, there is a direct correlation between this news release and the price decline. This is because all markets are currently sensitive to the overall economic sentiment, and crypto is still viewed as the riskiest asset class in particular.\n\nFed Meeting in September\n\nThe next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting will be held on September 19 \u2013 20, 2023. The consensus among financial analysts and other experts on the matter is mixed.\n\nSome expect that the monetary policy-making body of the Federal Reserve System will most likely make another interest rate hike by another 25-basis-point to moderate inflation to the targeted 2%.\n\nOthers say that it might pause for now as it did in June and evaluate the situation as it fears the economy will get too tight and limit consumer spending.\n\nConclusion\n\nFederal Reserve is the most important entity in the global economy since its decisions can impact the value of the US dollar, which is still the global reserve currency. This is why investors and traders all across the world are following their announcements.\n\nWhat the Fed does next still remains unclear, but considering that it only made a small blow to inflation and definitely not a win, further action will be required, thus we would be primarily expecting an increase in interest rates.\n\nWith the cryptocurrency market standing on shaky legs since April, this might be a catalyst for a larger decline.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nPlease note that the contents of this article are not financial or investing advice.

        "content": "In an Aug. 17 meeting, Ethereum developers discussed developments around a new testnet \u2014 named \u2018Holesky\u2019 \u2014 that is set to launch on Sept. 15.\n\nParithosh Jayanthi, DevOps at the Ethereum Foundation, said that developers tested 1.4 million validators on the Holesky testnet and were able to finalize the network. Jayanthi said this is now recommended as the starting size for the testnet.\n\nJayanthi also asked developers how many testnet tokens should circulate on Holesky. Ethereum developers decided to introduce 1.6 billion Holesky ETH into circulation, as large supplies have previously been supported on testnets. Developers decided not to reduce that number to match the Ethereum mainnet\u2019s 120 million ETH supply, though this option was briefly under consideration.\n\nHolesky will launch in mid-September\n\nGitHub documentation indicates that Holesky will launch on Sept. 15, 2023 at 14:00 UTC. This incidentally was the date of Ethereum\u2019s Merge launch in 2022.\n\nThe testnet will remain in use for several years, with long-term service (LTS) support lasting until 2027 and end-of-life (EOL) lasting until 2028.\n\nDocumentation additionally states that Holesky will replace Ethereum\u2019s Goerli testnet, which was introduced in 2019 as the project prepared to launch its proof-of-stake features and abandon proof-of-work mining. Goerli and Holesky \u2014 as well as the current Ethereum mainnet \u2014 all act as proof-of-stake chains. However, unlike Ethereum\u2019s mainnet, the two testnets do not use ETH tokens with real market value.\n\nHolesky will also pave the way for two future Ethereum upgrades: an execution layer upgrade called Cancun and a consensus layer upgrade called Deneb.\n\nThe testnet\u2019s unusual name is not \u201chole-sky\u201d but is named after a train station in the Czech Republic city of Prague. That station is often casually referred to as \u201cHole\u0161ky.\u201d Ackee Blockchain Security discovered that the testnet\u2019s code contains an easter egg: the chain ID of the testnet, 17000, is also the area\u2019s postal code.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Share:\n\nEthereum price shows a breakdown from an ascending triangle formation, hinting at a potential correction.\n\nWhile the theoretical forecasts hint at a 45% crash, the recent breakdown suggests bears are in control.\n\nEther\u2019s open interest has surged by nearly 500 million in the last three days, suggesting a renewed interest.\n\nEthereum price action is at an interesting point, which could trigger a steep move in either direction. With Bitcoin\u2019s boring consolidation, crypto traders have been waiting for a volatile move to emerge. The lack of volatility could be ending soon, especially for Ether, as the open interest rose by nearly 500 million in the last three days from $6.09 billion to $6.58 billion. When the breakout does occur, one cap is likely to get caught in the wrong direction, causing liquidations in the millions.\n\nETH open interest\n\nAlso read: Fundstrat's Tom Lee's Bitcoin target is $180,000 if SEC approves first spot BTC ETF in the US\n\nEthereum price action hints at a massive move soon\n\nEthereum price set up an ascending triangle formation between May 28, 2022, and August 14, 2023. This setup contains three higher lows and nearly three equal highs, which are connected using trend lines.\n\nThis technical formation is a bullish one and the confirmation of a breakout would occur if Ethereum price flipped the $1,998 or $2,000 psychological level into a support floor. The ascending triangle pattern forecasts a 45% upswing to $2,915, which is obtained by adding the distance between the first swing high and swing low to the breakout point.\n\nOn the contrary, Ethereum price breached the setup to the downside on August 13 and is on its way to confirming the breakdown by producing a three-day candlestick close below it. If this outlook does play out, instead of the 45% rally, ETH could crash by 45% and revisit the next key level at $998. But in some cases, ETH could stop around or above the $1,000 psychological level, which is not too far away from the theoretical target.\n\nRead more: Breaking: $1.7 million worth of Ethereum stuck in Shibarium bridge as launch fails to catalyze meme coin rally\n\nETH/USDT 3-day chart\n\nHowever, if Bitcoin\u2019s consolidation breaches to the upside, bears that shorted ETH thinking a bearish breakdown has occurred would be trapped. In such a case, Ethereum price could quickly climb higher and flip the $2,000 psychological level. This development could confirm a bullish breakout, forecasting a 45% move to $2,915.\n\nIn bullish cases, Ethereum price could revisit the $3,000 level that has not been tagged since April 20222."

        "title": "Ethereum Displays A Concerning Pattern On The 1-Year Chart! Is ETH Price Aiming For $1,400? - Coinpedia Fintech News",
        "content": "Shayan is a digital nomad and a professional journalist. He delivers high-quality engaging articles to Coinpedia through his in-depth research and analysis.\n\nIn recent weeks, Bitcoin has shown significant consolidation near the $29,500 range. However, it recently dipped below the $28,500 threshold. This movement has ignited a strong selling sentiment in the market, a trend that Ethereum has also reflected. Presently, Ethereum\u2019s annual price chart indicates that it\u2019s at a crucial point. There\u2019s a potential for it to breach its monthly support line, which could trigger another round of selling.\n\nBulls Liquidated Nearly $37 Million Worth Of Positions\n\nRecently, the price of ETH saw a sharp decline, approaching the $1,850 mark. This forced long position holders to quickly lock their profits. Data from Coinglass indicates a surge in long liquidations, exceeding $36.5 million in just the past three days. This trend has intensified selling momentum at higher levels, creating a robust resistance close to $1,850.\n\nThe 1-year price chart for ETH is showing signs of concern. Amidst months of consolidation, Ethereum\u2019s movement within a particular bracket has market enthusiasts awaiting a clear trend, which might emerge by September.\n\nSince FTX\u2019s collapse last November, Ethereum\u2019s price has followed a rising wedge pattern. While it has consistently met its support levels in the past, the pattern seems to be converging, hinting at a final move. A drop below the support line could accelerate the confidence of long-term put holders, with predictions pointing to a potential dip to the $1,400 mark.\n\nHowever, such a decline might require significant bearish news in the market. On the brighter side, Ethereum has historically bounced back by 20-30% after successfully testing its support. If it manages to rally from the current support level of approximately $1,750, we could see a surge toward the $2,000-$2,100 range.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next For ETH Price?\n\nEther\u2019s inability to hold momentum above $1,800 has led to increased selling, driving the price down to a crucial long-term support level of $1,850. However, bulls are defending a decline strongly as there\u2019s buying pressure near the dip. As of writing, ETH price trades at $1,776, declining over 1.7% in the last 24 hours.\n\nWith the declining 20-day EMA and the RSI trading way below the selling zone at level 15, it indicates that the bears are currently dominating. If the price consistently falls and drops below $1,703, we might witness a sharper sell-off, potentially pushing the ETH price to $1,626.\n\nHowever, to turn things around, bulls must rebound the price from $1,850 and push the price beyond the 20-day EMA at $1,818. Achieving this could pave the way for a rise to consolidation around $1,860."

In this article, we\u2019ll take a closer look at the Ethereum community,\n\nEthereum is a decentralized blockchain platform that has gained immense popularity over the years. At the heart of the platform lies the Ethereum community, a group of developers, investors, entrepreneurs, and enthusiasts who are passionate about building a more decentralized and open world. In this article, we\u2019ll take a closer look at the Ethereum community, who\u2019s behind the platform, and what they\u2019re building.\n\nThe Birth of Ethereum\n\nEthereum was founded in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin, a Russian-Canadian programmer who was just 19 years old at the time. Buterin had previously been involved in the Bitcoin community, but he became frustrated with the limitations of the Bitcoin blockchain, which did not allow for the development of more complex applications. Buterin believed that a new blockchain platform was needed that would allow for the creation of smart contracts, which could automate the execution of agreements between parties.\n\nButerin\u2019s vision for a new blockchain platform gained the support of a group of like-minded developers, including Gavin Wood, Joseph Lubin, and Jeffrey Wilcke. Together, they formed the Ethereum Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to developing and promoting the Ethereum platform.\n\nThe Ethereum Community Today\n\nSince its launch in 2015, the Ethereum community has grown to include thousands of developers, entrepreneurs, and enthusiasts worldwide. The community is known for its passion, creativity, and commitment to building a more decentralized and open future.\n\nOne of the defining features of the Ethereum community is its open-source nature. All of the code that powers the Ethereum blockchain is freely available for anyone to view, use, and modify. This has led to a vibrant ecosystem of developers building on top of the Ethereum platform.\n\nThe Ethereum community is also known for its strong culture of collaboration and innovation. Developers from all over the world work together to build new applications and services on the Ethereum blockchain. This has led to the development of a wide range of decentralized applications, including decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, prediction markets, social networks, and more.\n\nThe Ethereum Ecosystem\n\nThe Ethereum ecosystem is made up of a wide range of projects and initiatives, all working together to build a more decentralized and open future. Here are a few of the key players in the Ethereum ecosystem:\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation: The Ethereum Foundation is a nonprofit organization dedicated to developing and promoting the Ethereum platform. The foundation provides funding and support to developers working on the platform. ConsenSys: ConsenSys is a venture studio that builds decentralized applications on top of the Ethereum platform. The company has developed a wide range of applications, including decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, identity solutions, and more. MakerDAO: MakerDAO is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform built on the Ethereum blockchain. The platform allows users to borrow and lend cryptocurrency without the need for a centralized intermediary. Uniswap: Uniswap is a decentralized exchange built on the Ethereum blockchain. The exchange allows users to trade a wide range of cryptocurrency pairs without the need for a centralized intermediary. Golem: Golem is a decentralized marketplace for computing power. The platform allows users to buy and sell computing power on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nAlso, read \u2013 All About The Relationship Between: Ethereum And NFTs\n\nThe Future of Ethereum\n\nThe Ethereum community is constantly working to improve and expand the capabilities of the platform. One of the most exciting developments on the horizon is the transition to Ethereum 2.0, which will introduce a number of improvements to the platform, including increased scalability and security.\n\nEthereum 2.0 will also introduce a new consensus mechanism known as Proof of Stake (PoS), which will replace the current Proof of Work (PoW) mechanism. PoS is more energy-efficient than PoW, which will make the Ethereum platform more sustainable and environmentally friendly.\n\nThe top 5 things likely to happen in the future of ethereum:\n\nEthereum 2.0 and Proof-of-Stake: The transition to Ethereum 2.0 will be a major milestone for the platform, as it moves away from the current Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism to a more energy-efficient Proof-of-Stake model. This will allow for faster and more cost-effective transactions, while also increasing network security and decentralization. Increased Adoption of Decentralized Finance (DeFi): The DeFi ecosystem has exploded in popularity over the past few years, and Ethereum has been at the forefront of this movement. As more people become aware of the benefits of decentralized finance, we can expect to see continued growth in this area, with Ethereum as the primary platform for DeFi applications. Integration with Centralized Finance (CeFi): While DeFi has been the focus of Ethereum\u2019s development in recent years, there is also potential for integration with centralized finance. This could include partnerships with traditional financial institutions or the development of hybrid systems that combine the benefits of both decentralized and centralized finance. Increased Interoperability with Other Blockchains: As the blockchain industry continues to grow, there is a need for greater interoperability between different platforms. Ethereum is already working on interoperability solutions, such as the Ethereum-to-Polkadot bridge, which will allow for seamless transfers of assets between the two platforms. We can expect to see more of these types of solutions in the future, as the industry matures. Continued Innovation and Development: The Ethereum ecosystem is a hub of innovation and development, with new ideas and applications emerging all the time. As more developers and entrepreneurs get involved with the platform, we can expect to see even more groundbreaking projects and applications being built on top of Ethereum in the years to come.\n\nGary Gensler teached to the public that Joseph Lubin bought 10% of the ICO for himself. Whats his source? Lubin claims he never even owned half a percent of Ethereums supply. So whats up with this 10%? And did he know about how Lubin called to disguise all major investors? pic.twitter.com/zpYgnOaWNP \u2014 Mr. Huber\ud83d\udd25\ud83e\udd85\ud83d\udd25 (@Leerzeit) April 19, 2023\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Ethereum community is a diverse and dedicated group of individuals who are working tirelessly to build a decentralized future. They come from all corners of the world and bring with them a variety of backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives.\n\nThrough their efforts, the Ethereum platform has grown from a simple idea to a revolutionary technology that is transforming industries and challenging traditional power structures. From decentralized finance to NFTs, the possibilities of what can be built on Ethereum are endless.\n\nThe community\u2019s commitment to decentralization and openness has allowed for a vibrant ecosystem of developers, entrepreneurs, and enthusiasts to thrive. With a focus on collaboration, innovation, and inclusivity, the Ethereum community is driving the next wave of technological advancement and paving the way for a more equitable and just world.\n\nAs Ethereum continues to evolve and mature, we can expect to see even more groundbreaking developments emerge from this dynamic community. From scaling solutions to new applications, the future of Ethereum is bright, and the community is poised to lead the charge towards a more decentralized and equitable world."

        "content": "In a filing dated August 4, Valkyrie applied to add an Ethereum futures ETF to its Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF). However, it would seem this move was pushed back by the SEC as the asset manager has now filed a separate application to offer an Ether futures ETF.\n\nValkyrie Moves To Offer Ethereum Futures ETF\n\nIn an application dated August 16, Valkyrie seeks the United States Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) approval to offer an Ethereum futures exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nIf approved, the fund will not directly invest in Ether. Instead, it will focus on purchasing several ether futures contracts to match the total value of the ether underlying the futures contracts with the net assets of the fund.\n\nWhile this fund is relatively similar to the Bitcoin futures ETF, which has existed since 2021, it differs from the Spot Bitcoin ETF, which prominent institutional firms have filed for. Spot ETFs track the crypto asset\u2019s price, while futures ETFs focus on the asset\u2019s future contracts.\n\nValkyrie categorically noted this fact as part of its application and stated that investors looking to invest in the price of ether directly should consider investments other than this particular fund.\n\nThe application also highlighted the risks involved in investing in this fund as, according to Valkyrie, \u201cthe Fund\u2019s investments could decline rapidly, including to zero.\u201d As such, investors should understand that they could lose their entire investment.\n\nAs is common with applications such as this, applicants must prove to the SEC that the underlying asset has a regulated market of significant size. And Valkyrie\u2019s filing stated that its fund would be guided by the futures contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).\n\nETH price recovers to $1,685 | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nNo First Mover Advantage?\n\nValkyrie failed to clarify the status of its initial filing in its most recent application. The asset manager had previously tried to add ETH futures contracts to its Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF) in a bid to gain a first-mover advantage over other applicants.\n\nSeveral other asset managers, including Bitwise, ProShares, Grayscale, and Volatility Shares, have also applied to offer an Ethereum futures ETF. However, it remains uncertain in what order the SEC is likely to approve (if it does) these applications, especially with this recent development.\n\nJust like Cathie Wood has suggested regarding the pending Spot Bitcoin ETF applications, the SEC can approve multiple applications at once, which will likely eliminate the first mover advantage, or it can decide to approve them in the order in which these applications came in.\n\nDespite expectations that the regulator will approve an Ether ETF this year, the probability of the SEC approving any of these applications remains uncertain as optimism dwindles.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

According to Hoskinson, Hydra scaling solution and Mithril live on the Cardano mainnet.\n\nHe added that the team behind Cardano has designed a better way to handle transactions using \u201ctiered pricing and Babel fees.\u201d Per Hoskinson, Cardano has had a rollup strategy since the Midnight protocol was conceived four years ago.\n\nHoskinson took a shot at other proof-of-stake (PoS) networks he believes are lagging in terms of development.\n\n\u201cThe protocols and primitives had to catch up and are getting there,\u201d he said.\n\nInterestingly, Hoskinson specifically shaded Ethereum. According to him, Ethereum has a dumpster fire of a consensus layer. He added that Ethereum is being eaten alive by its own Layer-2 ecosystem.\n\nOn the other hand, he added that Cardano\u2019s sidechain plans benefit both the sidechain and Cardano.\n\n\u201cWe are living rent-free in the maxi minds. I pity them,\u201d he added.\n\nHoskinson Silences Critics\n\nMeanwhile, the prominent American entrepreneur is known for clapping back at trolls undermining Cardano\u2019s successes. As reported earlier, Hoskinson silenced critics, including VCs and crypto media, who proclaimed Cardano\u2019s death and irrelevance.\n\nHe informed these critics that \u201cCardano is here to stay\u201d while highlighting some of the network\u2019s recent achievements. According to a recent report by Santiment, Cardano is ranked as the third blockchain with the most development activities in the past month.\n\nADA Records Slight Gain While BTC & ETH Plunge\n\nHowever, Cardano\u2019s recent milestone slightly impacted the price of its native coin, ADA. At the time of writing, ADA is changing hands at $0.274, up 0.4% in the past 24 hours.\n\nIt bears mentioning that most crypto assets, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, are currently facing losses in the past day. While BTC is down 2.7% in the past 24 hours, ETH has plummeted 2.3% in the same period."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nPayPal is forced to halt crypto trade in the UK under new regulations\n\nUK regulators aim to implement strict rules on crypto, including removing advertisements\n\nPayPal continues to promise a US stablecoin despite governmental scrutiny\n\nPayPal UK (PYPL.O) announced in an email sent to customers it will be halting buying and selling of crypto tokens on its platform. The company\u2019s decision comes following a new set of regulations set forth by the UK government.\n\nTransparent Crypto Trading\n\nThe new regulations introduced by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) aim to limit advertising in the crypto market. In the meantime, the government is working on creating clear and strict guidelines for the sale of digital assets in the country.\n\nRedistricting advertisements in the British crypto space is the result of the new direction created by the FCA, where the regulating body aims to protect customers from making \u201chasty decisions.\u201d\n\nExecutive director at the FCA\u2019s consumers and competition division, Sheldon Mills, said that \u201cIt is up to people to decide whether they buy crypto. But research shows many regret making a hasty decision.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cConsumers should still be aware that crypto remains largely unregulated and high risk.\u201d\n\nTherefore, the FCA is currently ordering crypto institutions to cease any \u201crefer a friend\u201d feature on their platform as it sees it as a misleading advertising approach.\n\nMoreover, crypto companies will be forced to warn users before trading, such as \u201cDon\u2019t invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong.\u201d\n\nThe new rule set comes as part of the regulatory overhaul the UK government plans for the crypto trade as a result of collapses such as FTX and Terraform Labs.\n\nIn his proposal , Financial Services Minister Andrew Griffith said, \u201cOur view is that this reinforces the case for clear, effective, timely regulation and proactive engagement with industry,\u201d adding that \u201cThis includes a proposal to bring centralized cryptoasset exchanges into financial services regulation for the first time, as well as other core activities like custody and lending.\u201d\n\nThe drastic change in regulations may offer extra challenges to companies like PayPal in the crypto space. However, a senior personal finance analyst at the investment platform Interactive Investor sees said regulations as a positive change as he currently views the crypto market as a \u201cwild west of dubious claims and misleading information.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe challenge for the regulator is to devise a robust customer knowledge framework so that all the players involved know what good looks like.\u201d\n\nPayPal did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAnother Day At The Office In The U.S.\n\nIn the meantime, PayPal\u2019s operations in the US remain undeterred. The company is currently enjoying the hype it\u2019s gathering after the announcement of its native stablecoin PYUSD.\n\nHowever, the announcement was not met with no resistance. Members of the US government have been in a discussion regarding the company\u2019s stablecoin since its announcement.\n\nCongresswoman Maxine Waters made a statement on the 11th of August where she voiced her concerns regarding PYUSD.\n\n\u201cGiven PayPal\u2019s size and reach, Federal oversight and enforcement of its stablecoin operations is essential in order to guarantee consumer protections and alleviate financial stability concerns.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cWithout legislation on the books that establish clear and strong consumer protections at the Federal level, consumers are at greater risk of harm at the hands of bad actors.\u201d\n\nHowever, the same sentiment was not shared by the Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, Patrick McHenry, who also issued a lengthy statement on the matter.\n\n\u201cThis announcement is a clear signal that stablecoins-if issued under a clear regulatory framework-hold, promise as a pillar of our 21st-century payments system,\u201d reported McHenry. He added, \u201cClear regulations and robust consumer protections are essential to enabling stablecoins to achieve their full potential. \u201c\n\n\u201cWe are currently at a crossroads to keep America at the forefront of digital asset innovation. Congress is making significant, bipartisan progress on legislation to ensure the U.S. leads the financial system of the future. We must finish the job.\u201d\n\nA tale of two lawmakers and their response to the launch of PayPal's stablecoin: Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-NC) is jazzed, and Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) is not. pic.twitter.com/RGwtPW8eIs \u2014 Brendan Pedersen \ud83c\udfe6 (@BrendanPedersen) August 9, 2023\n\nPayPal is also maintaining the option to trade other crypto tokens on its platform in the US, as UK regulations only apply to local markets."

        "content": "Valkyrie Funds Looks to Launch Ethereum Strategy ETF\n\nSource: Adobe\n\nAsset management firm Valkyrie Funds has filed for an Ethereum Strategy exchange-traded fund (ETF) that will invest in Ether futures.\n\nAccording to a Wednesday filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the new fund, called the Valkyrie Ethereum Strategy ETF, aims to capitalize on the growing interest in Ethereum (ETH) futures.\n\nUnlike traditional investment vehicles that directly invest in assets, the Valkyrie Ethereum Strategy ETF will focus on investing in exchange-traded futures contracts on Ether.\n\nThe fund will also explore collateral investments, including high-quality securities like Treasury bonds and commercial paper, to provide investors with potential capital appreciation.\n\nIn the filing, Valkyrie Funds highlighted the unique risks associated with Ether and Ether futures.\n\nSpecifically, the company emphasized the volatility and unpredictability of these assets, noting that the value of investments in the fund could decline significantly, potentially reaching zero.\n\n\u201cEther and ether futures are a relatively new asset class,\u201d Valkyrie said in the filing.\n\n\u201cThey are subject to unique and substantial risks, and historically, have been subject to significant price volatility. The value of an investment in the Fund could decline significantly and without warning, including to zero.\u201d\n\nValkyrie Fund has already introduced a Bitcoin Strategy ETF and a Bitcoin Miners ETF to the market.\n\nEU\u2019s First Spot Bitcoin ETF Goes Live\n\nEarlier this week, London-based Jacobi Asset Management announced the release of Europe\u2019s first spot Bitcoin ETF, which will be listed on the EuroNext Amsterdam Exchange.\n\nThe ETF went live after a one-year delay due to unfriendly market conditions after it received approval from the Guernsey Financial Services Commission (GFSC) in October 2021.\n\nThe fund charges its clients a 1.5% annual management fee with authorized participants including Jane Street and DRW.\n\nThe launch of the EU\u2019s first spot Bitcoin ETF comes amid a surge in applications for such products in the US.\n\nIn June, asset management firm Blackrock filed paperwork for a spot Bitcoin ETF, prompting other players like Invesco and Wisdom Tree to follow suit or reapply for their own Bitcoin ETF products.\n\nThe Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) also filed a bid with the SEC on behalf of Fidelity for a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nHowever, the filings were returned by the SEC due to their lack of clarity and comprehensiveness.\n\nThe SEC, although approving funds that invest in Bitcoin futures, has yet to approve a fund directly investing in the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe commission has consistently cited inadequate cross-exchange market surveillance, as well as concerns of fraud and market manipulation, as reasons why it has not yet approved a Bitcoin spot ETF.\n\nIt is worth noting that the absence of a Bitcoin spot ETF has led to the growth of over-the-counter (OTC) products like Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).\n\nThese OTC products are more expensive, illiquid, and inefficient compared to ETFs."

        "content": "Crypto markets have recently faced a concerning dip, failing to find an upward momentum after extended periods of consolidation. The stalwart Bitcoin shattered its $28,000 support, sending shockwaves throughout the market. Ethereum, too, succumbed to the bearish pressure, plummeting below its $1,800 support. With fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) spreading like wildfire, questions arise: Is Ethereum headed for a steeper decline, potentially to $1,000? Let\u2019s analyze in this Ethereum price prediction article.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis: A Hopeful Retest Turns Sour\n\nEthereum showed promise with consistent movement around the $1,900 mark, following its failure to breach the pivotal $2,100 resistance. The consensus among many traders was an optimistic one; a retest of the $2,100 barrier and potential to surge past it. Yet, the market had other plans. In a rather unforeseen move, Ethereum\u2019s price didn\u2019t just dip but plummeted, settling distressingly at $1,740.\n\nThe Factors: Why is Ethereum Crashing?\n\nMultiple factors have precipitated Ethereum\u2019s price drop. Profit-taking, wherein traders sell off their holdings to capitalize on the coin\u2019s value, is a significant contributor. Concurrently, unfavorable regulatory shifts in several countries have dampened the enthusiasm around Ethereum and other cryptos. If profit-taking stands as the sole major catalyst, Ethereum might see a swift recovery back to the safer realms of $1,900.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: Ethereum Price Targets\n\nThe dynamics of the crypto market can be unpredictable, but based on recent activities, there are potential paths Ethereum might tread:\n\nOptimistic Recovery: If the decline is primarily attributed to profit-taking, there\u2019s hope for Ethereum. A rebound towards the $2,000 mark might be on the horizon. Cautionary Slippage: Should other factors play a significant role, Ethereum could further descend to its next support at $1,650. Pessimistic Decline: If market sentiments don\u2019t improve, Ethereum could further tumble to $1,400. Worst-case Scenario: In a highly bearish condition, Ethereum might even touch the alarming $1,000 mark.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might also like\n\nMore from Altcoin"

        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin price coils up for a big move and could visit the $30,400 level amid shrinking volatility and increasing open interest to drive the market.\n\nEthereum price could breach the $1,891 barricade, potentially reaching the $1,921 resistance level before pulling back.\n\nRipple price to fall 15% unless bulls leverage the 200-day EMA at $0.5766 for a quick turnaround.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is moving south, coming on the back of growing open interest growing and subsequent increases in liquidations. Ethereum is recording a similar market outlook, causing investors to wonder whether it is the work of manipulators. As BTC and ETH investors brace for a massive move, Ripple (XRP) price continues to whiplsahs and may whitewash all the ground covered on July 13 if bulls continue sitting on their hands.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin volatility signals impulsive move ahead, bulls pay a steep price to get a piece of the action.\n\nBitcoin price coils up for a grand move north\n\nBitcoin (BTC) broke off from its consolidation along the equilibrium, taking a nosedive below the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $29,339. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization could drop further to tag the $28,758 support level before a possible pullback.\n\nThe ensuing demand pressure could see Bitcoin price shatter past the EMAs and escape above the downtrend line. Such a move would clear the path for a possible breach of the $30,079 resistance level and, in a highly bullish case, tag the $30,441 resistance level. Such a move would constitute a 5% climb.\n\nBTC/USDT 12-hour chart\n\nConversely, if selling pressure increases, Bitcoin price could break below the immediate support at $28,758. Such a move would expose the BTC to a possible drop down to the $27,000 range or, in the dire case, slump lower to tag the 26,3000 range. Such a move would constitute a 10% drop from current levels.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) position below 50 adds credence to this bearish outlook and the Awesome Oscillator (AO) histograms in the negative zone.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin volatility signals impulsive move ahead, bulls pay a steep price to get a piece of the action.\n\nEthereum price to head north as open interest skyrockets\n\nEthereum (ETH) price, like BTC, is in a downtrend, but this could be corrected soon as open interest rises. With more money coming into the ETH market, the PoS token could break out 5%, overcoming the $1,891 resistance level before a possible tag of the $1,921 resistance level.\n\nFor now, however, Ethereum price is looking for a possible pivot, with the $1,8118 level presenting as a potential turnaround point for a northbound move. If this bullish outlook plays out, ETH could move above the 200-, 50-, and 100-day EMAs at $1,842, $1,852, and $1,857, respectively. Further north, ETH could breach the $1,981 level and, in a highly bullish case, tag the $1,921 hurdle. This would constitute a 5% climb.\n\nETH/USDT 12-hour chart\n\nConversely, failure of the $1,813 level to hold as support could see ETH descend toward the psychological $1,725 level.\n\nThe RS supports the downside, heading south with a potential breach of the 30 level. Similarly, the AO histograms are red and negative, solidifying bears' presence in the market.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum, XRP, Litecoin and Cardano prices could be bottoming out\n\nRipple price slump continues\n\nRipple (XRP) price continues with its southbound move and could test the 200-day EMA at $0.5766 soon unless bulls recover. With strong bearish forces, the remittance token could extend lower to the $0.5048 support level or, in the dire case, write off all the ground covered in the July 13 rally to find support around the psychological $0.4604, marking a 20% slump below current levels.\n\nThe RSI indicator, currently at 28, indicates the bearish outlook in the market, with the AO histograms also bolstering the case for the bears.\n\nXRP/USDT 12-hour chart\n\nHowever, considering the position of the RSI, XRP could be regarded as overbought if this momentum indicator crosses above the 30 range to the north. The ensuing demand pressure could send Ripple price north, potentially surpassing the $0.6840 hurdle. A sustained uptrend could fuel a climb to the $0.8193 level, denoting a 40% flight above current levels."

        "title": "Bitcoin Vs Ethereum: Is ETH Ever Going to Flip BTC in Market Cap? - CryptoTicker.io - Bitcoin Price, Ethereum Price & Crypto News",
        "content": "The crypto world has been buzzing with the notion of \u201cflipping,\u201d referring to the hypothetical event in which Ethereum (ETH) overtakes Bitcoin (BTC) in terms of market capitalization. Such a scenario would symbolize a significant shift in the crypto landscape. Here, we analyze if and how this might be possible, based on the provided current market cap figures. Let\u2019s take a look at this Bitcoin vs Ethereum article in more detail.\n\nBitcoin Vs Ethereum: Current Market Landscape\n\nETH Market Cap \u2013 TradingView\n\nBitcoin Market Cap \u2013 TradingView\n\nBitcoin Vs Ethereum: Understanding Market Capitalization and the \u2018Flippening\u2019\n\nWhat is Market Capitalization?\n\nAt its core, market capitalization (often shortened to market cap) represents the total value of an asset in the market. In the world of cryptocurrencies, it\u2019s calculated by multiplying the current price of a single unit of a cryptocurrency by the total number of units in circulation.\n\nLet\u2019s break it down with a simple analogy. Imagine you have a box of apples, and each apple is priced at $2. If you have 100 apples in that box, the total value (or \u2018market cap\u2019) of all the apples would be $200. Similarly, if each Ethereum (ETH) coin is priced at $1,670.99 and there are about 120 million ETH coins in circulation, the total value of all ETH coins would be its market cap, which is currently $200,734,697,617.\n\nThe Concept of \u2018Flipping\u2019 in Market Cap\n\nNow, if you had another box of oranges, and the total value of all oranges was $300, this box would have a higher market cap than the box of apples. The act of one asset (like our box of oranges) surpassing another asset (like our box of apples) in market cap is colloquially referred to as \u2018flipping\u2019.\n\nIn the crypto world, the term \u201cflippening\u201d specifically refers to the potential scenario where Ethereum\u2019s market cap surpasses that of Bitcoin. So, if the total value of all ETH in circulation becomes higher than the total value of all BTC in circulation, then Ethereum has \u201cflipped\u201d Bitcoin in terms of market cap.\n\nWhy Does This Matter?\n\nThe idea of Ethereum flipping Bitcoin is a significant talking point because Bitcoin has historically been the dominant cryptocurrency in terms of market cap since its inception. A flippening would symbolize a shift in market perception, indicating that the market values Ethereum more than Bitcoin. This could be due to various factors, including technological advancements, user adoption, or broader trends in the decentralized finance space.\n\nSo, when people discuss the possibility of Ethereum \u201cflipping\u201d Bitcoin, they\u2019re speculating on a major shift in the crypto landscape, where Ethereum becomes the most valuable cryptocurrency by total market value.\n\nBitcoin Vs Ethereum: What Does It Mean for ETH to \u201cFlip\u201d BTC?\n\nFor Ethereum to surpass Bitcoin in market capitalization, its market cap needs to be greater than that of Bitcoin. This can happen if:\n\nEthereum\u2019s price rises while Bitcoin\u2019s price remains stable or decreases.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price drops significantly, even if Ethereum\u2019s price remains stable.\n\nThe Mathematical Calculation\n\nTo determine how much Ethereum\u2019s price must rise for it to overtake Bitcoin\u2019s market cap, we can start with the formula for market capitalization:\n\nMarket Cap=Price\u00d7Total Supply\n\nAssuming the total supply of both ETH and BTC remains constant (ignoring ongoing mining or issuance), the price change needed can be calculated.\n\nGiven:\n\nETH Market Cap = $200,734,697,617\n\nBTC Market Cap = $512,982,754,980\n\nTo equate ETH\u2019s market cap to BTC\u2019s at the current supply:\n\nNew ETH Price=BTC Market Cap/ETH\u2019s Current Supply\n\n\\text{ETH\u2019s Current Supply} = \\frac{\\text{ETH Market Cap}}{\\text{Current ETH Price}} = \\frac{$200,734,697,617}{$1,670.99}\n\nSolving for ETH\u2019s current supply gives approximately 120,128,341 ETH.\n\nUsing this supply figure to solve for the new ETH price:\n\n\\text{New ETH Price} = \\frac{$512,982,754,980}{120,128,341}\n\nThis yields a New ETH Price of approximately $4,272.22.\n\nThus, for ETH to flip BTC at their current respective supplies, the price of ETH would need to rise to approximately $4,272.22, more than double its current price, assuming the price of BTC remains stable.\n\nBitcoin Vs Ethereum: Factors to Consider\n\nEthereum\u2019s Ongoing Development\n\nEthereum 2.0 and the transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism could have profound implications on ETH\u2019s price and market cap. Enhancements in scalability and energy efficiency might attract more users and developers to the Ethereum network.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Store of Value Narrative\n\nBitcoin\u2019s primary narrative as \u201cdigital gold\u201d and a store of value might maintain or increase its market cap, even if Ethereum experiences growth.\n\nDeFi and NFTs\n\nDecentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have propelled Ethereum into the spotlight. If these sectors continue to grow and evolve, they could significantly increase Ethereum\u2019s market cap.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile the potential for Ethereum to flip Bitcoin in market cap exists, several factors, including market dynamics, technological developments, and macroeconomic events, will determine if this occurs. As of now, based on pure arithmetic, ETH would need to see a significant price surge to surpass BTC\u2019s market cap. Only time will tell if the \u201cflippening\u201d becomes a reality.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might also like\n\nMore from Altcoin"

        "content": "Share:\n\nShiba Inu price surprisingly took a turn for the worse, trading at $0.00000935, down by almost 6% in the last hour.\n\nShibarium is the designated Ethereum layer-2 solution developed by the Shiba Inu team as a means of providing cheaper and faster transactions using SHIB as the fee token.\n\nAwaiting the launch of Shibarium, the network noted a surge in new addresses, resulting in network growth shooting up by 84% within three weeks.\n\nShiba Inu price began as a meme coin, but the Dogecoin-inspired token is now establishing its presence as a legitimate cryptocurrency network with the launch of its Ethereum-based layer-2 (L2) blockchain. Titled Shibarium, the chain will act as a medium for optimum utilization of dog-themed tokens.\n\nShiba Inu price crashes against expectations\n\nShiba Inu price is set to potentially rally and recover the recent losses following the launch of the highly anticipated Shibarium. The blockchain is Shiba Inu's first attempt at expanding the meme coin's reach. With an Ethereum L2, it will be able to attract more users and investment into the ecosystem.\n\nSince Shibarium is a layer-2 solution on Ethereum, it is significantly faster and cheaper than base layer-1 (L1)chains. Shiba Inu presently operates as an L1 chain, and the launch of Shibarium could potentially bring more users to the network. Furthermore, with the mainnet of the blockchain going live, Shibarium would promote the use of dog-themed tokens within the Shiba Inu ecosystem, including the likes of BONE, TREAT and LEASH.\n\nSHIB/USD 1-day chart\n\nAll of this was supposed to push the price up, but the opposite of the expected outcome occurred, and the Shiba Inu price crashed. Down by nearly 6% in the past hour, the altcoin is currently trading at $0.00000935. With every red candlestick, the meme coin is losing the potential for recovery with price indicators, including Relative Strength Index (RSI) as well as the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD).\n\nA further decline in the price indicators could cause the investors to lose their hope for recovery straight away since the momentum would turn bearish.\n\nInterestingly this reflects against the expectations from the chain, which was observing a sudden jump in the rate thatnew addresses are formed on the network. This measures whether or not the project is finding traction amongst crypto investors.\n\nShiba Inu network growth\n\nOver the past three weeks, this network growth has noted an 84% surge, suggesting investors' interest was rising ahead of the Shibarium launch. Going forward, as the users get acclimatized to the network, it could end up pulling the price up toward the end of the month."

        "content": "The world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum (ETH) has been under selling pressure and is currently trading under $1,800. As of press time, the ETH price is down by 1.67% and is trading at $1,795 levels with a market cap of $215 billion, as the search for liquidity continues.\n\nFor now, the next significant support for Ethereum is $1,600 where nearly 2.48 million addresses have acquired a total of 3.8 million ETH.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIf #Ethereum falls below the $1,800 mark, the next significant support level is positioned at approximately $1,600. At this level, 2.48 million addresses acquired a total of 3.8 million $ETH. pic.twitter.com/9TP6xi3R5x \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) August 16, 2023\n\nOver the past few weeks, Ethereum has been failing to break past the $1,850 level which has been a strong resistance for the crypto. It has been staying within the bearish zone and has extended its fall below the $1,820 levels.\n\nThe bearish pressure managed to drive the price beneath the $1,800 threshold. It reached a bottom close to $1,778, and currently, there\u2019s a phase of loss consolidation. A recovery upswing brought the price back above the $1,795 level. Presently, it\u2019s trading in proximity to the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level, calculated from the recent decline starting at the $1,853 peak to the $1,778 bottom.\n\nWhat Does Ethereum (ETH) Technical Chart Suggest?\n\nCurrently, Ether\u2019s trading is positioned beneath $1,830 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the hourly chart of ETH/USD, a connecting trend line with bearish implications is forming, showing resistance around $1,820.\n\nIn terms of potential gains, the price could encounter resistance around the $1,815 mark or at the trend line itself. This level aligns closely with the 50% Fibonacci retracement point, calculated from the recent descent that began at the $1,853 peak and ended at the $1,778 low. The subsequent resistance stands near $1,830, which also aligns with the position of the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThe initial significant support level rests around the $1,750 range. In case the bulls are unable to uphold the support at $1,750, there\u2019s a possibility of further declines. Following that, a significant support level emerges near $1,720. Should the downward movement continue, there\u2019s a chance that the price might approach the $1,650 level in the short term.\n\nOn the flip side, Ethereum long-term investors have continued to add more with ETH staking recently hitting a new all-time high."

        "content": "Bitcoin and other top crypto tokens were trading in deep red on Friday. A sudden liquidation over the last few hours led to suffering of $1 billion as digital-asset markets suffered one of their worst sell-offs of the year and bitcoin's price fell to a two-month low. Trading volumes of the crypto market spiked suddenly.\n\n\n\nBitcoin was under deep selling pressure as the largest crypto tokens dropped as much as 8 per cent to slip below $26,500-levels. Its largest peer, Ethereum plunged 7 per cent to barely hold $1,675-mark. Pain in the altcoins was intense as the host of tokens were bleeding up to 18 per cent.\n\n\n\nThe crypto market has continued to sharply fall for the second consecutive day. The mass sell-off in the crypto market has led to a plunge in the crypto fear and greed index, which is down 13 points and has entered the fear zone after over 5 months, with a score of 37/100, said Parth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead at CoinSwitch Ventures.\n\n\n\n\"A US judge granted approval to the SEC to file a motion to appeal the recent ruling which favored Ripple Labs regarding retail sales of XRP,\" he added. \"In other news, there has been a potential devaluation of the Chinese Yuan, which is trading at the weakest level since 2007.\"\n\n\n\nAll other top crypto tokens were bled on Friday. XRP plunged as much as 17 per cent, while Litecoin tumbled 14 per cent. Shiba Inu and Dogecoin also posted double-digit cuts to tank up to 12 per cent. Toncoin and Polygon shed 9 per cent each, while Solana was down 8 per cent.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading sharply lower, falling down to $1.06 trillion-mark as it dropped as much as 7 per cent in the last 24 hours.

        "content": "Episode 16 of Hashing It Out explores one of the most popular cryptocurrency use cases: payments. Mark Smargon, CEO of Fuse, joins host Elisha Owusu Akyaw to discuss various Web3 payment solutions and how Fuse contributes to businesses\u2019 adoption of cryptocurrency payments.\n\nSmargon explained that the payment network\u2019s strategy involves looking beyond investments to focus on everyday use cases like payments, which will likely bring more sustainable adoption. Despite the goal, Smargon recounted the difficulty in convincing people and investors that businesses would adopt blockchain payments when starting Fuse in 2019.\n\nSmargon further explained that Fuse is not competing with Ethereum but with Visa and Stripe, and that it\u2019s intended to be the main payment layer for global transactions. On whether the battle of adoption will be won by a few blockchain networks, Smargon mentioned that Fuse has never held a maximalist mindset:\n\n\u201cWe really believe that in the future, there is going to be many blockchains. There is not going to be one blockchain that will hold the entire human knowledge. We were never maximalists in that approach.\u201d\n\nSmargon believes that Web3 payments have come a long way in the last two years as things like nonfungible tokens and digital collectibles have become more popular. What\u2019s more, the increase in freelancers from developing markets who are paid in cryptocurrency and the use of cryptocurrencies for cross-border payments have been among other catalysts spearheading Web3 payment adoption.\n\nRelated: Should we ban ransomware payments? It\u2019s an attractive but dangerous idea\n\nOwusu Akyaw asked about the impact of regulations on Web3 payments and adoption in the future. Smargon called it a rollercoaster ride, due to the unstable nature of regulations across the globe. He also added that blockchain technology may need to evolve by adding new features and taking away some existing features to fit regulations and create a better connection with traditional finance.\n\nListen to the latest episode of Hashing It Out with Fuse CEO Smargon on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts or TuneIn.

        "content": "Is Bitcoin or Ethereum a better protocol for developers? A closer look reveals the answer may not be so obvious.\n\nTony Cai \u2013 CEO of Bitcoin-based DeFi platform Atomic Finance and former Ethereum builder \u2013 published a Twitter thread on Wednesday explaining the different experiences of building apps on both networks, including the strengths and weaknesses of each.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Advantage: Security and Focus\n\nAccording to Cai, Bitcoin\u2019s first advantage is the security of its programming language. The original crypto network\u2019s Discrete Log Contracts (DLCs) boast fewer attack services than Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts, which have lost users hundreds of millions of dollars due to coding mistakes and exploits over the past few years.\n\n\u201cIn ETH, one tiny mistake (like 1-2 lines of code being written in the wrong order) can lead to millions lost,\u201d wrote Cai.\n\nHaving spent time building on ETH first before pivoting to building on BTC, I've seen the best and worst parts of both communities. I'm probably gonna get some hate for this, but screw it\u2026 BTC vs ETH: An Honest Reflection from a Builder. Here are 6 things I noticed:\ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/3sBZKrZlRn \u2014 Tony Cai \u269b\ufe0f #SoundFinance (@TonyCai_) August 16, 2023\n\nThe Bitcoin development experience also benefits from \u201claser focus\u201d \u2013 clarity and emphasis specifically on innovation. According to Cai, the ETH community \u201cmoves fast\u201d and ushers in new developments every week, making it easy for builders to get lost with \u201cshiny object syndrome.\u201d\n\n\u201cBitcoin\u2019s scripting language and capabilities are intentionally limited to ensure its primary function remains robust,\u201d said Cai to CryptoPotato via DM. \u201cEthereum, on the other hand, was designed as a platform for decentralized applications, making it more flexible and versatile.\u201d\n\nEthereum has famously boasted both NFTs and tokenization for years \u2013 technologies that have only begun to emerge on Bitcoin. This limited capability keeps developers focused on securing product-market fit, rather than conjuring complex tokenomics and \u201crationalizations\u201d as to why their projects need a token at all.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Advantage: Expressiveness and Dev Infrastructure\n\nNaturally, Bitcoin\u2019s strict scripting language leaves it with some tradeoffs. Not only is development more technically limited, but more developers naturally gravitate toward\u2019s Ethereum\u2019s more welcoming programming language \u2013 Solidity.\n\n\u201cProgramming on Solidity is simple for anyone who understands the basics of Javascript. Which most programmers do these days,\u201d said Cai. It also has far greater developer infrastructure through tools like Truffle Suite and Infura, and more hackathon events for creating new tools.\n\nCai believes the fewer hackathons in Bitcoin may boil down to its relative lack of tokenization, which has led to less funding and sponsorships for the network\u2019s developers. \u201cBTC startups don\u2019t have the luxury of massive treasuries funded by a token drop / ICO,\u201d he explained.\n\nThough firms like Blockstream and Chaincode Labs have stepped in to help fund the ecosystem, Cai said Ethereum has always had a more \u201cstructured\u201d approach to funding thanks to its ICO, and the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nDeveloper culture within both camps also widely differs. Whereas Bitcoiners make changes \u201ccautiously\u201d with a focus on \u201cpreserving the integrity of the network,\u201d Ethereum development can be more of a \u201cfree for all\u201d where devs are constantly \u201cexploring new use cases.\u201d\n\nThe contrast has created a clear rift where Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cpodcasters\u201d and \u201ccontent creators\u201d often take the public spotlight, rather than its developers. It\u2019s also limited the creativity of Bitcoin applications and startups to four basic categories: lightning network micropayments, fiat on-ramps, multisig providers, and bitcoin rewards.\n\n\u201cBitcoin\u2019s grassroots, decentralized approach to funding and development has its merits, as does Ethereum\u2019s more structured approach,\u201d concluded Cai."

        "content": "Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs sink in price significantly.\n\nNFT sales for all markets tank.\n\nThe debate surrounding the cause of waning NFT interest is undecided.\n\nBored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are now priced below 30 Ethereum, per data from NFTPriceFloor.com. This marks a significant reversal from peak NFT mania, as embodied by the $69.3 million sale of Beeple\u2019s \u201cEverydays: The First 5,000 Days\u201d in March 2021.\n\nDuring the mania phase, NFTs were thrust into the mainstream, regularly featuring on conventional media outlets and sparking discussion around the sums being asked for \u201cjust jpegs.\u201d Fast forward to now, with BAYC seemingly losing its sparkle, the discussion points now center on whether NFTs are dead.\n\nBored of the Apes?\n\nThe chart below shows the BAYC NFT price floor at 28.45 ETH at the time of writing.

        "content": "The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is on course to greenlight the first-ever exchange-traded funds (ETFs) based on Ether (ETH) futures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis decision marks a substantial victory for several financial firms that have been advocating for the introduction of these products for some time.\n\nThe regulator is unlikely to obstruct the launch of these ETFs, which will be grounded in futures contracts of Ether, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, Bloomberg reports.\n\nProminent companies such as Volatility Shares, Bitwise, and others are among the nearly a dozen entities that have submitted applications to initiate these ETFs.\n\nNotably, Valkyrie is anticipated to be the first to introduce an ETF featuring Ether futures around Oct. 3 or Oct. 4, although it will encompass both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Meanwhile, Vol Shares is projected to debut the first exclusive Ether Futures ETF approximately on Oct. 12.\n\nThe approval of an Ethereum futures ETF by the SEC carries broader implications for the crypto sector. As pointed out by crypto analyst Adam Cochran, this move inherently suggests that the SEC does not classify Ethereum as a security.\n\nHe emphasized that this decision is a monumental win for Ethereum, regardless of its initial sale method, its proof-of-stake mechanism, or its primary function and application.\n\nCrypto futures ETFs allow investors to speculate on the future price of cryptocurrencies through contracts, without owning the actual coins. In contrast, spot ETFs provide investors with direct exposure to the current market price of the cryptocurrency by holding the actual digital assets.\n\nThe SEC approved several Bitcoin futures ETFs in October 2021, further fueling the bull run. However, the regulator is yet to greenlight a spot ETF."

The participants in the equity round include Blockchain.com, Human Capital, VY Capital, Sky9 Capital, Jane Street Capital, VistaLabs, CMT Digital, Foundation Capital, Lingfeng Capital, GSR, Kudasai, Krust, and others.\n\nZetaChain started in 2021 and has close to 150 contributors from all over the world. Some of the core contributors include Ankur Nandwani (ex-Coinbase, Brave, 0x, and co-founder of Basic Attention Token), Panruo Wu (early contributor to THORchain), and Brandon Truong (ex-BuzzFeed, Udacity, Yada). Other core members include former employees of Cosmos, Ignite, Consensys, and multiple other blockchain projects.\n\nZetaChain\u2019s mission is to establish a new standard for blockchain interoperability and enable users to manage all of their assets and data from a single platform, regardless of the blockchain they were created or stored on and without the need for bridges or wrapped tokens. This includes non-smart contract chains like the Bitcoin network and Dogecoin. Standardized interoperability provides developers with significant advantages as they can manage a single contract for all chains and reduce the attack surface. ZetaChain\u2019s Ethereum Virtual Machine compatible smart contract layer and omnichain toolkit empower developers to seamlessly implement Bitcoin smart contracts. This unlocks a whole world of users who were previously solely in Bitcoin, enabling them to utilize their Bitcoin within the broader DeFi ecosystem.\n\nThe ZetaChain ecosystem is thriving, with more than 27,000 dApp contracts currently deployed on the platform. These represent a diverse range of third-party decentralized applications, including cross-chain DeFi, NFTs, universal web3 social, identity, and gaming protocols. Already, more than 1.7 million users have participated on the ZetaChain testnet, which has seen over 13 million transactions completed to date.\n\n\u201cZetaChain\u2019s purpose is to simplify managing assets and data across multiple blockchains, which remains a complicated and fragmented process that\u2019s hindering hundreds of millions of new users joining the web3 ecosystem,\u201d said Ankur Nandwani, ZetaChain core contributor. \u201cOur EVM-compatible cross-chain smart contracts alleviate these issues by allowing decentralized app developers to build services that are faster, more secure, and easy to use.\u201d\n\nBuilt on top of the Cosmos SDK and Tendermint Consensus, which provide fast block time and instant finality, ZetaChain aims to overcome the limitations of traditional cross-chain solutions like bridges that rely on centralized trust models, making them susceptible to security breaches. Instead, ZetaChain operates as a transparent Proof-of-Stake blockchain, ensuring complete transparency, verifiability, and trust-minimized functionality for all transactions and activities, including cross-chain transactions."

        "content": "Ethereum gave Bitcoin the closest competition since the project launched as a top altcoin. Ever since, Ethereum (ETH) hasn\u2019t had any competition as stiff as this new hybrid meme coin with its promising 50x gains.\n\nThis article reviews the chances of this new meme coin taking over from Ethereum (ETH) and what this means for investors.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Journey as the Smart Contract Pioneer\n\nEthereum\u2019s proficiency in executing smart contracts drove it to the forefront of blockchain innovation. With smart contracts, developers automate processes and get rid of intermediaries. This tool paved the way for more efficient and transparent applications. There are a ton of DApps hosted on the Ethereum ecosystem, serving various uses from decentralized finance (DeFi) to non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Overall, Ethereum\u2019s versatility and developer-friendly setup make it an enabling and innovative platform.\n\nWith blockchain technology continuing its efforts at revolutionizing industries, Ethereum\u2019s importance in the crypto world remains fundamental and ETH price growth emphasizes that. If as an investor you need that exposure to a diverse range of projects built on a robust blockchain, Ethereum is a solid choice.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price is currently set at $1,830, which is 0.1% down in the last 24 hours. As the second-largest crypto, ETH has been going through minor loss phases in the past few days. The price chart reveals the issues ETH is having in its attempt to break above its current resistance levels. ETH technical indicators reveal mixed signals. But, the moving averages are still in a bullish shape, meaning an uptick might not be far off.\n\nNonetheless, the RSI is drifting in neutral territory, indicating an absence of clear direction. Investors and traders should pay close attention to the support level around $1,800 and the resistance level near $1,900. Should the Ethereum price break below $1,800, that might result in additional selling pressure. But a break above $1,900 could bring in fresh bullish momentum.\n\nPikamoon (PIKA) Betters Ethereum (ETH) Price Growth Offering to Investors\n\nPikamoon builds a world of adventures called the Pikaverse where the Pikamoon Adventure P2E game works as a reward initiative for gamers. Gamers get rewarded with NFTs or PIKA for their success in activities like monster battles, bounty searches, and more.\n\nThis project also adds innovative features like a marketplace, and seamless exchange, through the latest technologies and support from two blockchain networks as explained below:\n\nCome for the Game. Enjoy the Profits\n\nThe metaverse game that powers Pikamoon is for players to enjoy both online and offline. This means Pikamoon gamers have an edge over other GameFi gamers. Plus, that means more use and demand for PIKA, increasing its value growth for gamers and delivering more profits for investors.\n\nBuilt on the Ethereum Blockchain and One Other to Compete with Ethereum\n\nPikamoon (PIKA) builds on two of the best blockchains in the market and one of them is the Ethereum blockchain. It also builds on MultiversX (formerly Elrond). These networks better the metaverse gaming and NFT edge of the project, allowing Pikamoon and PIKA to scale with ease and continue to deliver explosive profits to investors.\n\nPIKA is Ready to Deliver Millions\n\nPIKA\u2019s deflationary design is the biggest factor behind its natural growth. As time goes on, the total PIKA supply reduces gradually. Combining this with gamers using the token often in the Pikamoon Adventure game leads to token scarcity. This means an increase in PIKA\u2019s value and more millions for PIKA holders as profits.\n\nPikamoon Presale\u2019s Success Delivers the First Sign of Possible 50x Gains\n\nAs Pikamoon Presale enters its third phase, it is clear that the time is in the mood to deliver GameFi gold. PIKA is selling out fast as investors recognize the potential for 50x more profits, as called by expert analysts.\n\nJoin the 50x party.

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) price is retesting a key demand zone after failure to break above the $1,900 resistance level. The smart contract cryptocurrency is changing hands at $1,787 on Thursday as the altcoin sell-off intensifies. The latest technical analysis suggests time is running out for the ETH maxis as the price hangs by a thread.\n\nOn Thursday, ETH to USD price plummeted to $1,775 before showing a brief recovery. This was the lowest level for the native asset of the top L1 platform since 21st June. On a weekly timeframe, the leading cryptocurrency is down 2.85% this week, which depicts the intensity of the downtrend.\n\nETH/BTC Pair Remains Sideways\n\nThe ETH/BTC pair shows Ethereum\u2019s strength against Bitcoin. The following chart shows that the crypto pair has been trading sideways since June 2023 in a narrow trading range. The bottom of this trading range lies at 0.0605, and the top lies at 0.0645. Currently, the pair is retesting the mid of the trading range, which might act as a support level.\n\nIn case of a breakdown below the 0.0624 level, the next stop would be the range lows of $0.0605. For Ethereum price prediction to turn bullish, ETH must break above the range highs of 0.0645 soon. A failure to break above this level could send the leading L1 asset to its fresh yearly lows in the coming months.\n\nDonald Trump Holds $2.8M In Ethereum Wallet\n\nAccording to the latest Ethereum news, the former president of the United States, Donald Trump, has been revealed to be holding $2.8M worth of ETH. The digital assets held inside his Ethereum wallet are much more than the previously disclosed figure of $250,000 to $500,000.\n\nMost of the cryptocurrency in the wallet has been received through licensing fees from the Trump NFTs collection. The former president launched his NFT collection, Trump Digital Trading Cards, in December 2022. Till now, 14,303 ETH worth of these NFTs have been exchanged on the NFT marketplace Opensea.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction\n\nA look at the following chart reveals that the Ethereum price is currently hovering within a significant demand zone. Price has retested this demand zone multiple times, resulting in solid rebounds. However, the support level is likely to break soon if the selling pressure keeps increasing in the coming days.\n\nA breakdown below the $1,780 level will be very bearish for ETH price. Therefore, the bulls need to hold this level. On a higher timeframe, the biggest resistance remains the $2,100 level, which has resulted in multiple rejections this year. Close attention must also be given to the BTC price action, which precedes the altcoin price action.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum\u2019s liquidity has continued to drop on US crypto exchanges.\n\nRegulatory uncertainty has persisted, which might lead to more drops.\n\nNavigating the regulatory environment in the U.S. has proved challenging for most cryptocurrency projects. And the consequences are becoming apparent. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) published lists of cryptocurrencies classified as securities months ago.\n\nNonetheless, assets like Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH], which were not categorized as securities, appear to be experiencing the effects of these regulatory developments.\n\nBitcoin Ethereum liquidy declines\n\nAccording to a recent report from Kaiko, Bitcoin and Ethereum liquidity in the U.S. witnessed a decline. The data revealed that the portion of liquidity for these assets on U.S.-based exchanges decreased to approximately 43%.\n\nThis was down from the 49% recorded at the start of 2023. Conversely, the liquidity depth on exchanges outside the US had risen to 57% from the initial 51%.\n\nPotential causes of the Bitcoin Ethereum liquidity decline\n\nThe ongoing legal action initiated by the CFTC and SEC against Binance and Coinbase could contribute to the liquidity decline. Back in March, lawsuits were filed alleging that Binance had operated a derivatives trading platform in the US, facilitating trades for cryptocurrencies classified as commodities.\n\nFurthermore, in conjunction with the CFTC\u2019s lawsuit, the SEC sued Binance and Coinbase. This was on the grounds of offering unregistered securities to the general public, among other accusations.\n\nFurthermore, these legal actions referenced multiple tokens. The accusations also U.S.-based exchanges should refrain from trading these tokens. Considering that Binance and Coinbase are the largest exchanges in the U.S. and globally, halting the trading of these listed tokens can significantly impact liquidity, even for flagship cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH.\n\nMoreover, the U.S. faced the collapse of Silvergate and Signature banks earlier in the same year. These banks had been crypto-friendly and instrumental in facilitating liquidity flows into exchanges. Their demise created increased difficulty for institutional players to acquire Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies using fiat currencies. Following their collapse, most crypto exchanges temporarily suspended USD deposits.\n\nDecline likely to persist\n\nWhile the 6% reduction in Bitcoin and Ethereum liquidity on US exchanges might seem modest, there exists a likelihood of this trend intensifying. This potential increase could be attributed to the growing uncertainty surrounding the regulatory landscape within the country."

        "content": "Here are the Top 10 use cases of Ethereum NFT assets that Showcase their Potential and Diversity\n\nNFTs are non-fungible tokens, unique and indivisible digital assets representing anything from art, music, games, collectibles, domain names, real estate, and more. NFTs are powered by smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, which ensure their authenticity, ownership, and scarcity. NFTs have gained popularity in recent years as a new way to create, buy, sell, and trade digital goods and services. In the digital world, NFTs can also enable new forms of creativity, expression, and interaction.\n\nHere are some of the top 10 use cases of Ethereum NFT assets that showcase their potential and diversity:\n\n1. Digital Art\n\nNFTs can help digital artists prove their authorship, protect their intellectual property rights, and monetize their work globally. NFTs can also create new digital art creation and consumption possibilities, such as interactive, dynamic, or programmable art.\n\n2. Gaming\n\nNFTs can represent in-game assets, such as characters, items, weapons, skins, or land. NFTs can also enable players to own, trade, or transfer their in-game assets across different games or platforms.\n\n3. Domain Names\n\nNFTs can represent domain names registered on the Ethereum Name Service (ENS). This decentralized protocol allows users to create human-readable names for Ethereum addresses or other resources. NFTs can also give users more control and flexibility over their domain names.\n\n4. Physical Items\n\nNFTs can be used to create digital certificates or passports for physical items that can verify their authenticity, origin, history, or condition. NFTs can also enable users to track or trace their physical items throughout their lifecycle or supply chain.\n\n5. Investments and Collateral\n\nNFTs can be investments that can appreciate over time or generate passive income from royalties or fees. NFTs can also be used as collateral locked in smart contracts to borrow or lend money or other assets.\n\n6. Tokengating\n\nNFTs can grant access to premium content, services, events, or networks only available for token holders. Tokengating can also create a sense of belonging and loyalty among token holders with common interests or values.\n\n7. Identity\n\nNFTs can store personal information, such as name, email address, phone number, or social media accounts. NFTs can verify or authenticate users\u2019 identities for various purposes, such as accessing websites, dApps, or services.\n\n8. Metadata\n\nNFTs can store additional information or data about the token or its underlying asset. Metadata NFTs can also embed functionality or logic into the token, such as programmability, interactivity, or composability.\n\n9. Social Tokens\n\nNFTs can be used to create and issue tokens by individuals or communities to represent their social capital or influence. Social tokens can also reward or incentivize users for their participation, contribution, or support in a social network or platform.\n\n10. DAOs\n\nNFTs can create and manage collective entities or projects governed by smart contracts and token holders. DAOs can also coordinate and distribute resources, decisions, or actions among token holders.\n\nThese are some ways that NFTs can be used for various purposes on Ethereum. NFTs are not just a trend or a hype but a paradigm shift in the digital economy and society.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "We Asked ChatGPT for Insights on Ethereum, Shiba Inu, and Everlodge Prices \u2013 Here's What It Said - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Today, we turned to ChatGPT, an advanced AI chatbot, to provide us with its analysis and projections for three intriguing tokens: Ethereum (ETH), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Everlodge (ELDG). It gave us a unique perspective on the market trends and factors that might influence these tokens\u2019 prices.\n\nJoin the Everlodge presale and win a luxury holiday to the Maldives\n\nEthereum (ETH): Trading in the Red\n\nChatGPT took notice of the Ethereum (ETH) weekly price charts, which have been bleeding. In fact, the Ethereum price fell by 2% in the past week alone. Also, long liquidations of more than $15M have been seen in Ethereum during that time.\n\nThis liquidation resulted from the recent news that Binance Connect would cease its operations. As a result, the generated FUD caused many altcoins like Ethereum to plummet. Moreover, this bearish trend has continued as the Ethereum value now sits at $1,824.02 with a market cap of $219B, down 0.90% overnight.\n\nNot only that, but ChatGPT also pointed to the bearish technical analysis, which shows all moving averages in red. Therefore, market analysts forecast a short-term drop to its support level of $1,200 for Ethereum.\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB): Slowly Losing Gains\n\nWhen asked about Shiba Inu (SHIB), ChatGPT acknowledged the token\u2019s popularity and vibrant community but cautioned that it operates in a speculative and highly volatile space. The chatbot emphasized that investor sentiment plays a significant role in SHIB\u2019s price movements.\n\nIn recent Shiba Inu news, the token saw a delightful 14-day period as the hype for Shibarium increased. As a matter of fact, the Shiba Inu price jumped by 16.8% in that period.\n\nHowever, it now appears those gains are slowly fading as Shiba Inu has a value of $0.000009724, which is a drop of 5% overnight. Additionally, ChatGPT took notice of the red technical indicators for Shiba Inu, which paint a bearish picture. Due to all these red charts, Shiba Inu could fall to $0.00000946 soon.\n\nEverlodge (ELDG): A Potential Market Disruptor\n\nDiscussing Everlodge (ELDG), ChatGPT highlighted the innovative approach of fractional ownership and property tokenization. It recognized the potential of blockchain technology to disrupt the real estate market and increase accessibility for investors.\n\nWhat Separates Everlodge (ELDG) From the Rest?\n\nAs per ChatGPT, Everlodge taps into the global vacation rental market, valued at $82.63B in 2022. However, it also solves plenty of issues plaguing this market and the general real estate market.\n\nFor instance, a lack of transparency and trust between parties has often hindered real estate transactions. Everlodge\u2019s use of blockchain technology ensures that all property details, titles, and ownership records are stored transparently. This reduces fraud, streamlines processes, and enhances trust.\n\nMoreover, unlike traditional real estate investment, which requires an enormous upfront cost, Everlodge allows users to invest only $100. It accomplishes this by digitizing and minting NFTs representing actual luxurious properties. Afterward, these NFTs are fractionalized. As a result, buyers from all income brackets can participate in this growing market.\n\nELDG \u2013 The Token To Keep on Your Radar\n\nCurrently, the ELDG native token is valued at $0.01 as it is in Stage 1 of its presale. But, ChatGPT also pointed to the fact that Stage 2 is coming very soon- with it \u2013 a 20% pump. With predictions that ELDG could soar by 280% before its presale ends, now is the perfect time to purchase it. Therefore, sign up below for staking rewards, trading fee discounts, and more.\n\nFind out more about the Everlodge (ELDG) Presale\n\nWebsite: https://www.everlodge.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/everlodge\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Bitcoin vs Ethereum \u2013 What is the Difference? - Money.ca",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency speculation ran wild in 2017 with a surge in prices for digital coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum. But after bottoming out in 2018, we\u2019re seeing the early stages of another cryptocurrency rally. This article will look at Bitcoin vs. Ethereum and explore the differences between these two popular cryptocurrencies.\n\nVisit Wealthsimple Crypto\n\nBitcoin basics\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is the most popular and widely held cryptocurrency, with a market cap of $221 billion and an average trading volume of $20 billion per day. It is a peer-to-peer digital currency where transactions are recorded on ledger technology known as a blockchain.\n\nThe idea of Bitcoin emerged from a 2009 white paper written by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto (whose identity remains to be confirmed). Bitcoin would be wholly decentralized from any government or bank.\n\nInstead of a central bank issuing new money as currency, new Bitcoins are \u201cmined\u201d using powerful computers to solve complex algorithms. A successful \u2018mining\u2019 adds a new block to the blockchain, and the miner is rewarded with a pre-determined number of new Bitcoins.\n\nThese coins can be stored in a digital wallet, either on a mobile device or a computer. These are known as hot or cold wallets, with the former being connected to the internet and easier to transact, and the latter being unplugged from the internet and more secure.\n\nAround 18 million Bitcoins have been successfully mined to date, but there is a finite supply of just 21 million Bitcoins. Once all of the Bitcoins have been successfully mined there will be no more supply \u2013 even if some Bitcoins are lost forever.\n\nBitcoin is strictly used as a digital currency and a store of value, similar to that of gold. The primary goal is to establish itself as an alternative monetary system. Bitcoin \u201cmania\u201d reached a fever pitch in 2017 when the price of one coin traded at just under $20,000. Today, the price of one Bitcoin is worth just under $12,000.\n\nFinally, Bitcoin trades on cryptocurrency exchanges like Wealthsimple Crypto for fiat money (i.e. Canadian or U.S. dollars), or other digital coins like Ethereum or Litecoin.\n\nEthereum basics\n\nEthereum (ETH) is safely in the number two position in terms of cryptocurrency popularity with a market cap of $42 billion and an average trading volume of $9 billion per day.\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, which is simply a form of digital money, Ethereum is an entire network that exists on a blockchain and can be used to run decentralized applications, create and enforce smart contracts, and can even create additional cryptocurrencies.\n\nEther \u2013 the cryptocurrency of Ethereum \u2013 can be sent, received, and stored as digital money. It\u2019s used to pay transaction fees on the Ethereum network.\n\nLike Bitcoin, the idea of Ethereum was proposed in a white paper written in 2013 by Russian-Canadian programmer Vitalik Buterin. In it, he described Ethereum as a \u201cdecentralized mining network and software development platform rolled into one.\u201d\n\nEther is also \u201cmined\u201d to create new tokens or coins, but it is preparing to launch Ethereum 2.0 in 2020 which will focus more on proof of stake rather than a proof of work concept (mining to solve complex puzzles). Ether will be awarded to \u201cvalidators\u201d who have an established history with the Ethereum network.\n\nThere is no limit to the number of Ether tokens that can be mined or awarded, although Ethereum 2.0 is expected to limit the creation of new supply to around 2% per year (instead of the current 10% per year inflation rate).\n\nEther trades on cryptocurrency exchanges like Wealthsimple Crypto and can be traded by currency brokers and other online digital wallets.\n\nBitcoin vs. Ethereum: Similarities\n\nBoth Bitcoin and Ether are digital currencies that can be sent, received, and held in storage. Each of these digital coins (BTC and ETH) can be traded on a cryptocurrency exchange. For instance, you can trade Bitcoin and Ethereum for free using Wealthsimple Crypto.\n\nEthereum was created as a complement to Bitcoin, not as a competitor, with Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin arguing that Bitcoin needed a scripting language for application development. But today Ethereum is seen as Bitcoin\u2019s main rival and the second most popular cryptocurrency in the world.\n\nBecause of this perception, the price of Bitcoin and Ethereum seem inextricably linked \u2013 meaning their price movements rise and fall together unlike any other digital coin.\n\nThat\u2019s where the similarities end.\n\nYahoo Finance\n\nBitcoin vs. Ethereum: Differences\n\nBitcoin only has two uses: as a digital currency and a store of value. It\u2019s much like gold, where there\u2019s no intrinsic value but its price increases or decreases with public sentiment and speculation. If investors believe that the demand for Bitcoin will increase, they will bid the price up. If investors believe the demand for Bitcoin will decrease, they\u2019ll sell and drive the price down.\n\nEthereum is more than just a cryptocurrency, making it quite different than Bitcoin. In fact, you could argue that Ethereum isn\u2019t really a cryptocurrency at all \u2013 it\u2019s a type of blockchain technology that powers an entirely decentralized network that allows developers to create applications, smart contracts, and even games (CryptoKitties, anyone?).\n\nOther key differences include:\n\nSupply \u2013 Bitcoin has a finite supply of 21 million coins, while Ethereum has no limit to the amount of Ether that can be created.\n\nMining \u2013 Bitcoin miners must use powerful computers to solve complex puzzles that reward them with new Bitcoins. Ethereum plans to move to a proof-of-stake concept that rewards loyal and trusted \u201cValidators\u201d with new Ether coins, reducing the energy required to produce new coins.\n\nBlock time \u2013 Ethereum takes 14 seconds to create a new block in the chain, versus 10 minutes for Bitcoin. Shorter block times mean faster transactions.\n\nPurpose \u2013 Bitcoin wants to disrupt the centralized monetary system and establish itself as an alternative currency. Ethereum aims to grow its decentralized application platform and smart contracts.\n\nFinal word\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are the world\u2019s number one and number two most popular cryptocurrencies. As an investment, their prices seem to rise and fall together as if they\u2019re joined at the hip. That\u2019s where the similarities end.\n\nEthereum has a much broader objective, built to operate as a decentralized network that powers applications and smart contracts. Bitcoin\u2019s main objective is to establish itself as an alternative (and decentralized) currency.\n\nBoth have been strong investments for the past five years and can be purchased on the new Wealthsimple Crypto platform."

        "title": "Is a Crypto Bull Run Coming Soon? The Ultimate Guide to Bitcoin and Ethereum Bull Run Predictions and Analysis of ... - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrencies, the term \u201cbull run\u201d often creates excitement among crypto enthusiasts and traders. A bull run occurs when the price of a cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, rises significantly over a relatively short period, fueled by increased demand, positive sentiment, and other market factors. In this comprehensive guide, we delve into the factors that some analysts consider when predicting a Bitcoin bull run, as well as research findings from various sources. We\u2019ll also discuss some of the top coins to explore before the next crypto bull market and discuss some of the leading crypto projects worth learning about ahead of the Bitcoin bull run.\n\nList of Top Crypto Bull Run Predictions\n\nBelow is a list of events that many crypto analysts are interested in when discussing bull runs.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Upcoming Halving: Scheduled for April 2024, the Bitcoin halving event is expected to reduce the supply of new Bitcoins entering the market, which historically correlates with bull market periods.\n\nEthereum 2.0 Upgrade: The final stages of the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, set to be completed by the end of 2023, could enhance scalability and have an effect on Ethereum adoption.\n\nMaturation of Crypto Infrastructure: As crypto infrastructure matures, decentralized applications (dApps) could reach a broader user base. ApeMax is one of these exciting new coins and dApps that is quickly emerging.\n\nConvergence of Crypto, AI, and the Metaverse: Some analysts believe that the integration of crypto with artificial intelligence (AI) and the metaverse could spur rapid growth and innovation in the crypto space.\n\nIt is essential to note that these predictions are speculative, and the crypto market is highly unpredictable, and that no one can foresee the future. You should approach these forecasts with skepticism and conduct thorough independent research.\n\nWhat is ApeMax?\n\nApeMax is an innovative cryptocurrency that has gained attention in the crypto community for its unique features. Token holders can engage in decentralized staking, known as Boost-to-Earn, to securely stake their tokens on entities they like and earn rewards transparently. ApeMax combines fun and utility, with seamless staking features and intriguing tokenomics, making it an interesting and fun contender among new meme coins.\n\nIn a nutshell, ApeMax offers:\n\nBoost-to-Earn Staking: ApeMax users can engage in decentralized staking, known as Boost-to-Earn. This feature allows token holders to securely stake their tokens on entities they\u2019re fans of, creating a decentralized ecosystem of backers and projects. Transparent Rewards: As users stake their tokens in the Boost-to-Earn system, they can earn rewards transparently, fostering trust and openness within the ApeMax community. Unique Blend of Fun and Utility: ApeMax is not just about staking and earning rewards. It also offers a unique combination of fun and utility, providing a refreshing and engaging experience for users, making it more than just another cryptocurrency. Innovative Tokenomics: ApeMax\u2019s intriguing tokenomics sets it apart from other meme coins. Its seamless staking features and carefully position it as an innovative player among the new generation of meme coins.\n\nWhat is the ApeMax presale?\n\nThe ApeMax presale is an exclusive opportunity for eligible buyers to acquire ApeMax tokens at presale prices. Token holders can immediately access the staking process and potentially earn rewards even during the presale phase. ApeMax\u2019s presale price increases every 24 hours, and eligible buyers can acquire Early Birds Loot Boxes, enjoying discounts on ApeMax tokens.\n\nWhat is a bitcoin bull run?\n\nA bitcoin bull run is a period of substantial upward price movement and market optimism for Bitcoin. The price of Bitcoin experiences significant growth, often exceeding previous highs and attracting increased interest. Bull runs are typically driven by increased adoption, institutional interest, positive news developments, and market speculation. However, they come with volatility, inherent risks, and are difficult to predict.\n\nIs a bitcoin bull run coming?\n\nPredicting the occurrence of a bitcoin bull run is no easy task due to the complex and volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market. Analysts who have studied past bull runs believe that a variety of factors have contributed to past bull runs, including but not limited to:\n\nInstitutional Adoption: The increasing acceptance and holding of Bitcoin by institutional investors have significantly boosted its price in the past. When large financial institutions back Bitcoin, it has often led to a surge in demand and a potential bull run.\n\nMainstream Acceptance: As more businesses and retailers start accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment, its mainstream acceptance grows, fueling optimism and potentially driving the price up.\n\nMarket Trends: Historical market trends can sometimes provide insights into potential future bull runs. However, past performance does not guarantee future results, and trends should be analyzed with caution.\n\nBitcoin Halving Events: Historically, Bitcoin halving events, where the rewards for miners are reduced, have been associated with bull runs. The reduced supply of new Bitcoins can create a sense of scarcity.\n\nIt is essential to remember that the cryptocurrency market is highly unpredictable and influenced by a wide range of variables, making it impossible to forecast with certainty. You should conduct comprehensive research and exercise prudence when making cryptocurrency-related decisions.\n\nWhy is the crypto bull run every 4 years?\n\nThe occurrence of a crypto bull run every four years is often linked to the Bitcoin halving event, which takes place approximately every four years. The halving reduces mining rewards by 50%, decreasing the supply of new Bitcoins and creating a scarcity effect that may have historically had an effect on price. However, while this pattern has been observed in the past, the crypto market is complex and influenced by various factors, making future bull run predictions uncertain.\n\nImportant Warning\n\nBefore purchasing cryptocurrencies, conduct thorough independent research, exercise caution, consult unbiased experts, and understand the risks involved. Cryptocurrencies may not be suitable for everyone and carry high risks and volatility. The purchase of ApeMax tokens is not permitted for individuals in the United States, Canada, sanctioned countries, and other ineligible countries. For a full list of ineligible countries, please refer to the official ApeMax website.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "How To Find The Best Exchange Rate For Ethereum To Naira - Nairametrics",
        "content": "Ethereum, being the second largest cryptocurrency in the world, means that it is high in demand.\n\nSo, being an ETH investor/trader, you\u2019re also in for a profitable venture. Naturally, your priority will be finding the best exchange rate especially if you\u2019re converting from Ethereum to Naira.\n\nIn this post, we\u2019ll discuss all the crucial factors and where you can find the best exchange rate for Ethereum to Naira (or Cedis). So, if you\u2019re trying to preserve the value of your crypto, you\u2019ll find the Breet app to be the most suitable for your needs. You\u2019ll see why as you read on.\n\nFactors to Consider When Finding the Best Exchange Rate\n\nThe current market price of Ethereum\n\nIt is common knowledge that the higher the value of Ethereum, the more Naira you\u2019ll get. But remember that ETH is volatile, so the exchange rate constantly fluctuates. Keep a close watch on ETH\u2019s value and try to sell when you\u2019re at a profit when possible.\n\nThe fees charged by the exchange platform\n\nTransaction fees are super important when finding an exchange rate with the best value. These fees are charged by the exchange platform to process your transaction. However, they vary from platform to platform.\n\nTo maximise your profit, it\u2019s best to trade with an exchange with low transaction fees.\n\nThe liquidity of the exchange\n\nLiquidity is when you can buy and sell an asset quickly and easily without affecting the price. Ethereum is a high-liquidity crypto in itself.\n\nHowever, the liquidity of the exchange should also be considered.\n\nAn exchange with high liquidity means that there are a significant amount of trades on the platform, so the exchange rate is more stable, and volatility is lower.\n\nBut, an exchange with lower liquidity will suffer more volatility.\n\nThe effect of a low-liquidity exchange on your Naira will be unfavourable, while a high-liquidity exchange will have you smiling at the bank.\n\nThe reputation of the exchange platform\n\nAn exchange platform with an excellent reputation means there\u2019s a good track record of reliability, security and customer satisfaction. With a reputable exchange, there\u2019s a greater chance of getting excellent returns and peace of mind while converting your Ethereum to Naira.\n\nWhere to Find the Best Exchange Rate for Ethereum to Naira\n\nCrypto-to-fiat conversion already has its own challenges, but it is even more challenging for a Nigerian.\n\nThis is mainly due to the tight regulations, so getting the most out of crypto in Naira has been a struggle.\n\nMost options are either too restrictive, expensive, or offer poor rates in exchange for crypto.\n\nThis is why I started with some factors you should consider when looking for the best exchange rates for your Ethereum to Naira conversion.\n\nThe Breet app, apart from offering one of the best exchange rates, also has a built-in crypto rates calculator that lets you see the real-time value of your Ethereum in Naira.\n\nThis is a look-before-you-leap situation where the Breet app is transparent about the rates.\n\nYou should also know that the Breet app is an Over-The-Counter (OTC) crypto trading platform that offers immediate crypto-to-fiat conversion in Nigeria and Ghana.\n\nThis means you jump several obstacles and get an almost immediate conversion to your preferred currency (Naira or Cedis) straight to your bank account.\n\nThis crypto-to-Naira solution (Breet) is highly secure, fast, and one of the most seamless transactions you can make. You can check out the crypto rates calculator and expect only the most competitive rates!\n\nYou\u2019d also be pleasantly surprised to see that after a quick sign-up, you automatically get an Ethereum wallet address generated for you.\n\nWrapping it up\n\nYou may have spent some time looking for the best exchange rate for your Ethereum to Naira (or Cedis), but that ends now.\n\nWith the Breet app, you\u2019ll get the best exchange rate, and a crypto exchange app that suits your trading needs perfectly.\n\nStart getting the most out of your Ethereum investment; use the Breet app today. Happy trading!"

        "title": "$41 Million Sold Before Ethereum (ETH) Price Crash - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market has once again sent shockwaves through the investment world with a substantial drop in the market in 2023, in an unexpected turn of events, both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) suffered a sharp drop in their price by more than 7%, plunging their respective market capitalizations to $515 billion and $202 billion.\n\nIn the midst of this drop, a major market participant managed to protect himself from the collapse through strategic actions.\n\nThe tactical move of the investor before the Ethereum (ETH) price collapse\n\nIn the midst of the recent cryptocurrency market crash, an intriguing and strategic maneuver was made by a whale-a term used to describe individuals or entities that hold a substantial amount of a cryptocurrency.\n\nThis particular whale demonstrated a shrewd understanding of market dynamics by dumping 22,241 ETH, valued at as much as $41 million, just before the flash crash occurred. The twist is that this move was not profitable; in fact, the whale suffered a loss of $1.7 million due to the timing of the sale.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that this decision, although costly, turned out to be beneficial as it helped the whale avoid the impending market crash.\n\nInsights into this move were unveiled by Lookonchain, an on-chain analytics platform renowned for its in-depth analysis of blockchain data.\n\nTheir findings highlighted how this whale\u2019s actions can be seen as a calculated risk. By selling its assets before the collapse, this investor was able to protect its portfolio from subsequent value depreciation.\n\nIn fact, this strategy may allow the whale to buy back assets at a significantly lower price in the future, taking advantage of market fluctuations.\n\nThe market dynamics surrounding this scenario extend beyond Ethereum. In particular, Coinbase\u2019s premium for Bitcoin (BTC) has increased by 3%, indicating potential buying activity among whales associated with the Coinbase exchange.\n\nThis raises the question of whether these participants are already exploiting the market decline to their advantage. Conversely, another possibility is that a whale entity may have initiated a dump on the Binance exchange, contributing to the increase in Coinbase\u2019s premium.\n\nQuantifying the decline and rise of the buy-the-dip mentality\n\nTo understand the intensity of bearish market trends, several metrics need to be analyzed. One such metric is Bitcoin\u2018s Open Interest (OI)-weighted funding rate, which fell below -0.01% for the first time since 12 March 2023.\n\nThis indicates substantial bearish sentiment, as it implies that traders are more inclined to short rather than long positions. Ethereum\u2019s funding rate, even lower at -0.0273, amplifies the narrative of pessimism surrounding these cryptocurrencies.\n\nHowever, the cryptocurrency world is renowned for its ability to view adversity as opportunity. Bearish market conditions are often seen as a prime time to accumulate assets due to their discounted values.\n\nThis sentiment is currently echoing on social media platforms, with nearly 1% of all cryptocurrency-related discussions revolving around the concept of \u201cbuying the dip.\u201d\n\nThis percentage is the highest recorded since April 2023 and indicates that investors are seizing the opportunity to strengthen their cryptocurrency portfolios amid market turmoil.\n\nThe psychology of the buy-the-dip mentality\n\nThe psychology behind the buy-the-dip mentality is rooted in the belief that market downturns are transitory and that assets will eventually recover value.\n\nThis perspective suits long-term investors who aim to capitalize on market volatility by buying assets at lower prices, with the expectation that their value will appreciate over time.\n\nWhile not without risk, this strategy is emblematic of the resilience and optimism of the cryptocurrency community.\n\nIn conclusion, the recent events surrounding the $41 million ETH dump and subsequent market crash highlight the intricate strategies whales employ to navigate the volatile cryptocurrency landscape.\n\nThe ability to anticipate market changes and act accordingly underscores the sophistication of cryptocurrency market participants.\n\nIn addition, the prevalence of buy-the-dip sentiment illustrates the resilience of investors who are willing to accept temporary setbacks to pursue long-term gains.\n\nAs the cryptocurrency market continues its roller-coaster ride, these insights offer a glimpse into the mindset and actions that shape this evolving financial ecosystem."

        "title": "Chainlink v/s Ethereum: Who takes the crown? - CryptoNewsZ",
        "content": "Since Chainlink was developed on Ethereum, people often don\u2019t get the difference between the two. Both Chainlink and Ethereum are popular cryptocurrencies based on blockchain technology. Still, they have certain technological differences, strengths and weaknesses, use cases, adoption, community support, market performance, and prospects.\n\nSo can Chainlink surpass Ethereum? Can Chainlink be replaced by the blockchain network it is built on? Let\u2019s find out in the section below.\n\nWhat is Chainlink?\n\nChainlink has been actively operating in the market since its launch in 2017, previously known as SmartContract.com. The name was changed to align with the new goals, and an ICO was launched that secured $32 million. Chainlink heavily differs from Ethereum and other competitors in various ways.\n\nFor instance, Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that off-chain sensors are crucial for operating decentralized applications or dApps. Oracles transfer data to blockchains and often monitor crypto prices for decentralized exchanges (DEXs) or dApps.\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nEthereum is the most popular blockchain in the world after Bitcoin, a network that made a brand name after entering the crypto market in 2015. Ethereum ushered in updating blockchain capabilities through the introduction of smart contracts. The strategy brought about a new digital era where dApps became the primary objective of several networks.\n\nEthereum supports ETH or the Ether crypto. The decentralized infrastructure\u2019s early entry allowed it to become a juggernaut today. The blockchain dominates the crypto market as one of the most popular dApp and DeFi protocols.\n\nChainlink v/s Ethereum\n\n1. Technological Differences\n\nChainlink differs from Ethereum technologically as it aims to connect real-world data with smart contracts. It is made possible by using a network of nodes that offer data to smart contracts and allow them to carry out on-chain actions based on events taking place around the world. Chainlink uses a unique consensus algorithm known as the LINK token that ensures the security and reliability of the blockchain-decentralized Oracle network.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum is a decentralized platform used to build decentralized applications and smart contracts. Ethereum uses Solidity, a Turing programming language that allows software developers to create complex applications to execute smart contracts on Ethereum. The blockchain network has its native crypto, ETH or Ether, used as a mode of payment to execute smart contracts on Ethereum.\n\n2. Strengths and Weaknesses\n\nBoth Chainlink and Ethereum have their own set of strengths, weaknesses, and challenges. When it comes to crypto like Chainlink and Ethereum, security becomes an integral consideration. Chainlink uses various security measures to protect client funds and provide a reliable network. Some standard security measures used by Chainlink include two-factor authentication, secure socket layer or SSL encryption, cold storage, and many more.\n\nEthereum also employs the above security measures. However, it also uses a consensus algorithm, Proof-of-Work or PoW, designed to prevent hacking and fraud attempts on the blockchain network.\n\nApart from security, both Chainlink and Ethereum face another significant challenge: scalability. Chainlink has introduced a variety of scaling solutions that include sharding, state channels, and off-chain computation. These solutions increase the efficiency and capacity of the network and enable more transactions per second.\n\nHowever, Ethereum is facing substantial scalability challenges as high transaction fees and network congestion have become major issues on the Ethereum network. Nevertheless, the Ethereum community is working on various scaling solutions, including Plasma, state channels, and sharding, to improve the network\u2019s efficiency and scalability.\n\n3. Use Cases and Adoption\n\nChainlink is used to create decentralized finance or DeFi applications, including decentralized exchanges, automated market makers, and prediction markets. It provides accurate and reliable real-world data to Chainlink smart contracts. DeFi apps can execute on-chain actions depending on real-world events like price movements in financial markets.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum is being adopted for various use cases that go beyond decentralized finance applications. Ethereum is employed for creating more advanced dApps, including identity verification, voting, supply chain management, gaming, and many more. It also serves as a blockchain platform to launch ICO (Initial Coin Offering) and create some of the most successful ICOs in the crypto market.\n\n4. Market Performance and Trends\n\nChainlink was launched in 2017 with the lowest price of $0.141 in Sept 2017 and the highest price of $50.07 in May 2021.\n\nBased on the historical price movements, Chainlink Prediction for 2024 is estimated at $16.82 and may reach a yearly high of $19.85. Based on our LINK price prediction, the price of Chainlink may reach a maximum of $37.57 by 2027. In addition, the price forecasted for Chainlink is expected to gain 900% in the next six months and reach $73.10 by 2030.\n\nEthereum was launched in 2015 and gained a market cap of 1 million USD by 2016. After the division of Ethereum into Ethereum and Ethereum Classic, the coin reached a value of $376.36, 121.4% more than its initial value.\n\nBased on historical price movements, ETH price prediction for 2024 is estimated at about $3,541 and may reach a yearly high of $5,097. Based on algorithmically generated predictions, the price of Ethereum may reach $6,564 by 2025. In addition, the price forecast for Ethereum is expected to gain significantly and reach $11,142 by 2027.\n\n5. Community Support and Development\n\nWhile comparing cryptocurrencies, community support is an essential consideration. Chainlink has an ever-expanding community of users and developers who have shown great interest in the technology and LINK\u2019s potential to revolutionize the digital industry. Chainlink has received positive feedback for introducing the most innovative approach to linking smart contracts with real-world events.\n\nEthereum has one of the most active and largest communities in the crypto industry, as the platform has existed in the market for many years with a large population of users and developers using and building decentralized applications on the ETH network. Ethereum crypto also has a strong ecosystem of developers with various resources and tools.\n\n6. Future Prospects and Evolution\n\nAs independent cryptocurrencies, both Chainlink and Ethereum have completely different objectives in the cryptocurrency space. While Chainlink uses Oracle networks to transfer secure tamperproof data, Ethereum is a smart contract token. Chainlink is built on the Ethereum blockchain and generally follows ETH\u2019s performance.\n\nAlthough Chainlink heavily relies on Ethereum, the two tokens have operated independently and performed outstandingly even during a bullish market. Ethereum certainly has a higher market capitalization than Chainlink, as it supports more decentralized applications and possesses more utility.\n\nHowever, since Ethereum has achieved tremendous value and Chainlink is built on Ethereum, LINK also has great growth potential.\n\nConclusion: Is Chainlink Better than Ethereum?\n\nChainlink continues to serve an integral niche that can improve the efficiency and performance of all other networks. In comparison, Ethereum has improved its strategy and keeps fighting other potential competitors to be an innovative and efficient force in today\u2019s crypto market.\n\nAs such, Chainlink and Ethereum protocols are working together to enhance the entire crypto market, and both are profitable to trade and invest in for the long term."

        "title": "News: SEC may approve Ethereum ETFs - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "ETFs based on Bitcoin futures contracts were approved by the SEC in late 2017: now it seems to be the turn of those based on Ethereum futures as well, according to the latest news.\n\nBloomberg reports this, citing anonymous sources familiar with the situation.\n\nNews: ETFs on Ethereum and SEC approval\n\nJust as was the case with Bitcoin, these ETFs would not be collateralized directly in ETH, but in futures contracts on the price of ETH.\n\nIndeed, to be honest, it seems a bit strange that almost five years after the approval of Bitcoin futures ETFs, those on Ethereum futures have not yet been approved.\n\nThe thing is, with regard to Ethereum, the approval path for these ETFs has been more troubled, because apparently there is a fear that the ETH market may be manipulated.\n\nHowever, as of today there does not seem to be much difference between the BTC and ETH markets anymore, so if the SEC has already approved the BTC price ETFs there seems to be no reason to believe that it could refuse to approve the ones on the price of ETH.\n\nInstead, in both cases, there is no sign any time soon that the US agency will allow ETFs collateralized directly in BTC or ETH (i.e., based on Bitcoin and Ethereum spot) to land on US markets, although in early 2024 this could happen.\n\nIn late 2021, when the first futures-based ETFs were launched on the price of BTC, the price of Bitcoin was close to its all-time high, but then the bear-market of 2022 began. However, it does not seem that something like that can happen now with ETH, as market conditions are completely different.\n\nA total of twelve companies have applied to the SEC to be allowed to issue an ETF based on ETH price futures contracts in the US markets, including ProShares, Volatility Shares, Bitwise and Valkyrie.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg\u2019s reported speculation, Valkyrie\u2019s could be approved around 3 October.\n\nWhat are the benefits of ETFs\n\nSo-called Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) are funds whose shares are traded on an exchange.\n\nIf the fund is fully collateralized with a single asset, the trend in the price of its shares actually follows that of the price of the underlying asset, allowing those who buy them to take a position on that price without having to buy the underlying asset.\n\nThe latter is especially important with regard to cryptocurrencies, both because many people want to invest in crypto without having to worry about their custody, and because ETFs can be traded on traditional exchanges bypassing crypto exchanges.\n\nHowever, to date, no ETFs collateralized directly in tokens, whether BTC, ETH or other cryptocurrencies, have yet been approved in the US.\n\nHowever, some have already been launched on Canadian exchanges, and recently also on Euronext Amsterdam.\n\nIt is worth pointing out that in addition to ETFs, there are also similar products (ETNs, ETPs) that replicate the price movement of an asset without being actual stock funds.\n\nSo while in the US there are neither ETFs, ETNs or ETPs, on spot Bitcoin or Ethereum, there are, however, ETFs collateralized with futures contracts on the price of Bitcoin.\n\nIn contrast, abroad there are also ETFs, ETNs or ETPs collateralized directly in BTC.\n\nThe comments\n\nThe news of the SEC\u2019s possible impending approval of an ETF based on ETH futures contracts apparently had no effect on Ethereum\u2019s price.\n\nHowever, the news has prompted several comments.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg Senior Analyst Eric Balchunas, this news is not a surprise, although the real game is being played on the approval of ETFs on spot BTC and ETH.\n\nThis not surprising to us, we had said they would approve Ether Futures early on in race. Nice to be validated. Now what does it mean for spot? Hard to say beyond it shows that their views/policy/tolerance can change. https://t.co/JXCxNUpj2U \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) August 17, 2023\n\nJames Seyffart of Bloomberg Intelligence, on the other hand, points out that the fee costs of the ETF on ETH futures are definitely low.\n\nUPDATE: @roundhill discloses a 0.19% management fee for their Ethereum Futures ETF ( $ETHX).\n\n\n\nThis is very low compared to BTC futures ETFs like Proshares' $BITO's 0.95%. And is still drastically lower than VanEck's $XBTF which at 0.76%. Fee war already starting in crypto ETFs https://t.co/toBBGkPpZd pic.twitter.com/5Fk34F2qAN \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) August 18, 2023\n\nOverall, the news has been well received, although this has not done much to lift the price of ETH back up after yesterday\u2019s plunge.\n\nWhat is clear is that traditional markets are increasingly interested in cryptocurrencies, but that at the same time traditional investors still tend not to want to get their hands dirty with these new technologies, as they are clearly somewhat afraid of not knowing how to handle them properly."

        "content": "Ledger has partnered with PayPal to create a secure platform for exploring digital currencies.\n\nThe partnership follows PayPal\u2019s introduction of the stablecoin PYUSD on Ethereum.\n\nLedger has unveiled its partnership with the worldwide payment leader PayPal. This joint effort aims to deliver users a smooth and safeguarded environment for delving into digital currencies.\n\nThe partnership permits individuals in the United States to adhere to state regulations and directly buy cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and Litecoin (LTC) using their connected PayPal accounts through the Ledger Live companion application.\n\nOur mission has always been to build ease-of-use and security for critical digital assets. That's why we're integrating @PayPal into Ledger Live. You can now buy crypto with PayPal and get it into your custody. Learn more here: https://t.co/XtSTRRg1Xa pic.twitter.com/MAPhD1f3tT \u2014 Ledger (@Ledger) August 16, 2023\n\nIt\u2019s worth highlighting that those who have previously procured crypto using PayPal can now make purchases via Ledger Live without requiring extra verification. The user\u2019s Ledger hardware wallet will automatically receive the acquired digital tokens.\n\nTo use this functionality, individuals can easily launch the Ledger Live application, go to the \u2018Purchase\u2019 segment, pick the cryptocurrency they want, indicate their country, and opt for PayPal as their chosen payment mode. The digital tokens will be safely dispatched to the user\u2019s Ledger device after a successful transaction through the PayPal interface.\n\nNevertheless, individuals who haven\u2019t employed PayPal for cryptocurrency dealings must either establish a PayPal account or go through the obligatory Know Your Customer (KYC) verification process.\n\nPascal Gauthier, the CEO and Chairman of Ledger, conveyed his excitement regarding the collaboration, saying,\n\n\u201cBoth PayPal and Ledger are committed to ensuring secure, fast, and seamless transactions. By integrating Ledger\u2019s unmatched security with PayPal\u2019s two-decade expertise in digital payments, we aim to provide a robust platform for cryptocurrency transactions.\u201d\n\nRegulating Stablecoins\n\nThis partnership arrives shortly after PayPal\u2019s recent declaration of its stablecoin linked to the U.S. dollar, known as PayPal USD (PYUSD), introduced on the Ethereum blockchain. PayPal\u2019s fresh stablecoin, subject to regulatory oversight from the New York State Department of Financial Services and managed by Paxos Trust Company, seeks to connect traditional currency and digital currencies, potentially bringing substantial alterations to the digital payment arena.\n\nNevertheless, the incorporation has encountered its fair share of critics. U.S. Representative Maxine Waters raised apprehensions regarding the absence of a comprehensive national structure for overseeing stablecoins like PayPal\u2019s PYUSD, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar. She emphasized the necessity for strong supervision to protect users and maintain financial stability. Waters\u2019 concerns are rooted in PayPal\u2019s extensive worldwide clientele, surpassing numerous prominent banks\u2019 customer base.\n\nAlthough there might be regulatory obstacles to overcome, Ledger, boasting more than 1.5 million active users, is steadfast in its dedication to furnishing secure and user-intuitive avenues for conducting digital currency exchanges. Through the Ledger Live application, users can engage with an expanding array of Decentralized Applications (DApps) while concurrently safeguarding the confidentiality of their private keys on their Ledger device.\n\nSince 2016, Ledger asserts to have distributed more than 6 million Ledger Nano hardware wallets, securing its position as a leading producer. In May, the company encountered controversy when it initiated a concealed recovery phrase storage service, causing bewilderment among users. The team subsequently endeavored to alleviate criticism by explaining how their wallet operates.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

At the moment, ETC crypto is making efforts to bounce back from the lower trendline within this descending wedge pattern. However, for ETC crypto to make a significant upward movement towards the upper trendline, it must attract more buyers. In the meantime, investors should exercise patience and wait for the accumulation rate to rise before engaging in trading at an opportune moment.\n\nEthereum Classic price was at $16.32 and has gained 0.49% of its market capitalization during the day\u2019s trading session. However, trading volume has decreased around 11.98% during the intraday trading session. This demonstrates that sellers are still present in the trade and may try for a pullback. Volume to market cap ratio was 4.69%.\n\nEthereum Classic Price Prediction: ETC Returning From Oversold Zone \u2013 RSI\n\nSource: ETC/USD by TradingView\n\nThe forecast for Ethereum Classic price highlights the challenge faced by ETC cryptocurrency in maintaining its position along the lower trendline of the falling wedge pattern. Currently, there\u2019s a noticeable decrease in trading volume, which should ideally see an uptick during the intraday trading session. ETC crypto needs a volume spike in order to sustain and recover towards the upper boundary of the pattern.\n\nIn addition, the Ethereum Classic cryptocurrency has experienced a decline of 8.52% over the course of a week and a 14.50% decrease within a month. ETC has slipped by approximately 10.91% over the past three months and 27.16% in the preceding six months. However, Ethereum Classic has managed to achieve a modest gain of 3.95% year-to-date. This indicates that Ethereum Classic crypto possesses the capacity to recover from its lower position in the year 2023.\n\nTechnical indicators suggest the sustainability issues of ETC cryptocurrency. Relative strength index (RSI) shows the return of ETC crypto price from the oversold territory. Whereas, moving average convergence divergence (MACD) still indicates the decline of ETC.\n\nRSI was at 26 and is trying to return from the oversold territory. The MACD line is below the signal line waiting for a crossover.

        "content": "The founder of Cardano ($ADA) Charles Hoskinson has seemingly seen a comment from a cryptocurrency investor touch a nerve after they threw shade at Cardano\u2019s developmental trajectory and alleged parallels with Ethereum.\n\nIn response to a cryptocurrency investor who suggested Cardano is following Ethereum\u2019s roadmap but was \u201ca few years behind,\u201d Hoskinson said \u201cit\u2019s getting delusion town now,\u201d and added that the Cardano community is \u201cliving rent-free in the maxi minds.\u201d\n\nOn the topic, Hoskinson added:\n\nEthereum has a dumpster fire of a consensus layer, has a terrible programming model that they can\u2019t change, and are getting eaten alive by their own layer 2 ecosystem. Cardano\u2019s sidechain plans mutually benefit both Cardano and the sidechain.\n\nor context, in March 2020, the Cardano Foundation unveiled an insightful research paper detailing Hydra, Cardano\u2019s Layer 2 scaling solution. Matthias Benkort, Technical Director of Open Source Development at Cardano Foundation, has described Hydra as an open-source framework designed to create off-chain ledgers, thereby enhancing the efficiency of blockchain usage.\n\nDeveloped jointly by the Cardano Foundation and IOG, Hydra is a state-channel solution that allows for fast-paced transactions on a private network, known as a Hydra Head. The transactions can then be settled on the main Cardano chain, making the results of the interactions available to the rest of the network.\n\nHoskinson has commented on the Hydra Head, saying simulations \u201chave shown that each \u2018Hydra head\u2019 can currently process about 1,000 transactions per second (TPS). With 1,000 stacking pools, each processing 1,000 TPS, Cardano could very well reach a throughput of a staggering one million transactions every second.\u201d\n\nAs CryptoGlobe reported, the total value locked on Cardano\u2019s decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem has recently reached a new milestone above the 600 million $ADA mark, with the amount of the network\u2019s native tokens locked on DeFi applications having tripled since the beginning of the year.\n\nFeatured image via Unsplash."

Whereas specific funds to be approved stays uncertain, while a dozen companies await the green light.\n\nNotably, this development comes in between the anticipation for the SEC\u2019s decision on many spot price Bitcoin ETFs. However, the U.S. government agency did not make any comment, while those familiar with the matter shared about the same.\n\nMultiple Reports About Ethereum ETF\n\nAccording to a report of August 17, 2023, shared by familiar sources, \u201cseveral firms could receive approval to launch an Ether-Futures ETF by October. Although, the SEC is reportedly not likely to hinder the process in any way.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, \u201cthe regulator isn\u2019t likely to block the products, which would be based on futures contracts for the second-largest cryptocurrency, according to people familiar with the matter.\u201d It is still not clear which firms will receive the approval.\n\nThe sources have provided limited information whereas the SEC has not announced it yet. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t immediately be determined which funds would get green lights. Officials have indicated that several may by October, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified discussing information that hasn\u2019t been made public.\u201d\n\nAccording to a report on August 2, 2023, regulatory approval is pending for six Ether-Futures filings. Whereas the firms seeking approval include \u201cEther Strategy ETF, Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF, Roundhill Ether Strategy ETF, VanEck\u2019s Ethereum Strategy ETF, ProShares Short Ether Strategy ETF, and the Grayscale Ethereum Futures ETF.\u201d\n\nAnother ETF Decision is Waiting\n\nThe following ETF news comes in between a standstill with Bitcoin ETFs.
