        "content": "Ethereum price is attempting a recovery wave above the $1,620 level against the US Dollar. ETH could start a fresh decline if it stays below the 100 hourly SMA.\n\nEthereum is struggling to recover above the $1,690 and $1,700 levels.\n\nThe price is trading below $1,700 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance near $1,670 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could resume its decline if it stays below the $1,700 level in the near term.\n\nEthereum Price Faces Hurdles\n\nEthereum\u2019s price declined heavily below the $1,700 level. ETH tested the $1,520 zone and recently started a decent recovery wave, similar to Bitcoin.\n\nThere was a move above the $1,550 and $1,600 levels. The price climbed above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,825 swing high to the $1,518 low. Besides, there was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance near $1,670 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nHowever, the bears are still active below the $1,680 level. Ether is also trading below $1,700 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $1,690 level. The next resistance is near $1,700 or the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,825 swing high to the $1,518 low is also near the $1,700 zone. A close above the $1,700 level could start a decent increase in the near term. The next major resistance is near the $1,750 level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $1,820 resistance, above which the price could rise toward the $1,880 zone.\n\nFresh Decline in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,700 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,640 level.\n\nThe first major support is near the $1,600 zone. If the bulls fail to protect the $1,600 support, there could be more losses. The next major support is near the $1,550 support level. Any more losses might send the price toward the $1,520 level in the near term.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now near the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,600\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,700\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "DeFi Technologies' subsidiary, Valour Inc., introduces its innovative Ethereum Physical Staking ETP under the EU-wide issuance platform, Valour Digital Securities Limited (VDSL) on XETRA. Tax benefit for investors based in Germany after holding period of one year possible for the first time in ETH .\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnologies' subsidiary, Valour Inc., introduces its innovative Physical Staking ETP under the EU-wide issuance platform, Valour Digital Securities Limited (VDSL) on XETRA. Tax benefit for investors based in after holding period of one year possible for the first time in . The groundbreaking ETP, with a 1.49% management fee, provides investors with a simplified gateway to Ethereum staking while benefiting from robust security enhancements.\n\n\n\n\n\nstaking while benefiting from robust security enhancements. Partnership with industry leaders like Copper Markets ( Switzerland ) AG and Blockdaemon ensures paramount security and a non-custodial staking environment for investors.\n\nZUG, Switzerland and TORONTO, Aug. 22, 2023 /PRNewswire/ - DeFi Technologies Inc. (the \"Company\" or \"DeFi Technologies\") (NEO: DEFI) (GR: MB9) (OTC: DEFTF), a crypto native technology company that pioneers the convergence of traditional capital markets with the world of decentralized finance (\"DeFi\"), is excited to announce that its subsidiary Valour Inc. (\"Valour\"), a leading issuer of exchange traded products (\"ETPs\") that provide simplified access to digital assets, has launched its 1Valour Ethereum Physical Staking ETP, set to redefine and simplify the Ethereum investment landscape. This innovative product aims to harness the essence of Ethereum while offering investors access to additional yield income opportunities.\n\nThe 1Valour Ethereum Physical Staking ETP (ISIN GB00BRBMZ19) is issued by Valour's new EU-wide issuance platform for physically stored digital assets Valour Digital Securities Limited (\"VDSL\"). This Jersey-based securities issuer has garnered approvals from both Swedish and Jersey regulatory entities and is underpinned by digital assets physically safeguarded by licensed custody providers.\n\nAvailable for trading on the Frankfurter Wertpapierboerse/ XETRA, the new staking ETP is poised to simplify network participation for investors. With a fixed yield, undefined expiry and a 1.49% management fee, investors have the potential to earn passive returns, sidestepping the technical challenges involved with staking, and actively contributing towards the evolving DeFi landscape. Enhanced security measures including slashing insurance and full collateralization mean investors benefit from additional transparency and security measures.\n\nCrypto staking represents a cornerstone in blockchain dynamics. It enables enthusiasts to immerse in the governance and consensus of Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchains, earning rewards for their contributions. Contrary to energy-hungry Proof-of-Work systems, PoS networks lean on validators who pledge assets to corroborate and usher new blocks. However, the staking landscape isn't without its intricacies \u2013 validators often grapple with asset lock-ups during bonding periods, as well as enduring unbonding spells prior to rewards being unlocked.\n\nOlivier Roussy Newton, CEO of Valour, comments, \"The 1Valour Ethereum Physical Staking ETP exemplifies Valour's commitment to creating innovative and trustworthy investment vehicles. We understand the challenges and complexities of crypto investments. Our mission is to bridge the gap, providing opportunities to enhance returns which are straightforward for our investors. In addition, all ETPs issued under the VDSL umbrella are endowed with the physical delivery option that might benefit investors based in Germany with a tax benefit after a holding period of one year.\"\n\nPartnering with elite entities like the VQF registered Copper Markets (Switzerland) AG for custody and industry stalwart Blockdaemon for staking services, Valour guarantees paramount security, ensuring a consistently collateralized, non-custodial staking environment.\n\nValour Inc. invites progressive investors to partake in this revolutionary venture, unlocking Ethereum's potential in the most accessible and safeguarded manner.\n\nIn addition to their novel digital asset platform, which includes 1Valour Bitcoin Physical Carbon Neutral ETP and Valour Digital Asset Basket 10 , Valour offers fully hedged digital asset ETPs with low to zero management fees, with product listings across European exchanges, banks and broker platforms. Valour's existing product range includes Valour Uniswap ( UNI ), Cardano ( ADA ), Polkadot ( DOT ), Solana ( SOL ), Avalanche ( AVAX ), Cosmos ( ATOM ), Binance ( BNB ), Enjin ( ENJ ), Bitcoin Carbon Neutral ( BTCN ) and Valour Digital Asset Basket 10 ( VDAB10 ) ETPs with low management fees. Valour's flagship products are Bitcoin Zero and Ethereum Zero, the first fully hedged, passive investment products with Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) as underlyings which are completely fee free.\n\nAbout DeFi Technologies\n\nDeFi Technologies Inc.

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin moved 600 ETH to Coinbase\n\nHis action follows a general market downturn as Ether\u2019s value dropped by 10%\n\nETH price usually drops after a transfer by Buterin or the Ethereum Foundation\n\nThere is a chance that Buterin will attempt a significant sell off\n\nOn-chain data and blockchain security platform PeckShield showed that a wallet related to an Ethereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin transmitted 600 ETH, worth $1 million, to Coinbase earlier today, August 21.\n\nThe reason for the transaction is still unknown, but transfers to exchange are typically understood to indicate a desire to sell.\n\nButerin\u2019s transaction may increase selling pressure on Ethereum, whose price has recently declined.\n\nOn-chain detective Lookonchain revealed that on August 20, Vitalik.eth wallet withdrew 1,000 ETH \u2013 about $1.67 million \u2013 and refunded 251,000 RAI on the DeFi platform Maker.\n\nDubbed \u201cvitalik.eth\u201d wallet, which contains 3,993 ETH valued at $6.5 million as of publication time, was made seven years ago. According to the Arkham Intelligence dashboard , this wallet belonged to the co-founder of Ethereum.\n\nThere are also $84,000 worth of USD Coin (USDC) and $58,000 worth of Wrapped Ethereum (WETH) in the wallet.\n\nButerin has previously transferred assets to a cryptocurrency exchange as he sent 200 ETH to Kraken in March. Buterin also sold a number of unwanted altcoins (sh*tcoins) for 439.25 ETH.\n\nButerin\u2019s Transaction Coincides with Crypto Market\u2019s Recent Decline\n\nButerin\u2019s move followed last week\u2019s (August 17) flash fall in the cryptocurrency market, when the price of ETH dropped below $1700 for the first time since June and it\u2019s still trading below that threshold.\n\nData from the blockchain analysis company Glassnode show that Ethereum owners fiercely hold their positions even as they quickly transfer assets among cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nThe data aggregator reports that 14.88 million ETH are currently held on exchanges, a figure not seen since 2018.\n\nExchange outflows are typically interpreted as a positive sign that the asset is being retained for the long term.\n\n\u201cEthereum\u2019s Transitions Vital For Success\u201d \u2013 Buterin\n\nIn June, Buterin explained that the Ethereum blockchain \u201cfails\u201d outright in the absence of an adequate scaling infrastructure to lower transaction costs.\n\n\u201cEthereum fails because each transaction costs $3.75 ($82.48 if we have another bull run) and every product aiming for the mass market inevitably forgets about the chain and adopts centralized workarounds for everything,\u201d he claimed .\n\nButerin then said that smart contract wallets represent another area of failure.\n\nHe explained that switching to smart contract wallets had certain drawbacks because managing several addresses at once presents challenges from the user experience perspective.\n\nTo effectively shift into an on-chain world with zero-knowledge rollups, Buterin said that wallets would need to secure data in addition to cryptographic assets.\n\n\u201cIn a ZK world, this is no longer true: the wallet is not just protecting authentication credentials, it\u2019s also holding your data,\u201d he added .\n\nFor the third and final shift, privacy, new identification, reputation, and social recovery mechanisms will be required.\n\nWithout the third shift, he claimed , \u201cEthereum fails because making all transactions (and POAPs, etc.) publicly visible for anyone to see is far too high a privacy sacrifice for many users and everyone moves onto centralized solutions that at least somewhat hide your data.\u201d\n\nEthereum\u2019s co-founder proposed using stealth addresses to alleviate this problem.\n\nA Turning Point for ETH\n\nEthereum is at a turning moment because the chart structure is so fragile. ETH price is expected to drop sharply if it brokes through the $1,600\u2013$1,550 level.\n\nThe monthly average of Ethereum ($ETH) addresses that are currently active is lower than the annual average, indicating little on-chain activity.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap , at the time of writing, ETH was trading at $1,667.56, that represents a 0.36% fall over the last 24 hours."

Diving deep into the charts, renowned crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen has surfaced with a noteworthy insight that raises concerns for the altcoin giant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe crux of the matter lies in ETH's breach of the dynamic support line, signified by the Bull Market Support Band indicator. This echoes a pattern last witnessed over four years ago. Back then, Ethereum suffered a pivotal level loss, paving the way for a tumultuous six-month journey where its value plummeted by a staggering 48%, only finding reprieve by the close of December 2019.\n\nIn 2019, #ETH fell below its Bull Market Support Band in July/August, just as it has in 2023. pic.twitter.com/36v6BEDch1 \u2014 Benjamin Cowen (@intocryptoverse) August 22, 2023\n\nWith history appearing to echo itself, the stakes are high for ETH's journey through the remainder of this year and the advent of 2024. An unsettling projection arises from Cowen's analysis, spotlighting the potential for Ethereum to slide toward the $900 mark per token.\n\nConvergence of perspectives\n\nNotably, Cowen is not the sole voice predicting such an outcome. Just a day prior, crypto analyst Ali Martinez , renowned in his own right, also foresaw a comparable fate for Ethereum based on meticulous technical analysis. Martinez articulated that Ethereum's fall beneath the $1,600-$1,550 range could lay the groundwork for a substantial correction ranging from 37% to 45%, ultimately targeting the $1,000 mark.\n\nAs the situation continues to evolve, it is increasingly evident that dark clouds are amassing over Ethereum, casting a shadow of uncertainty not only on the altcoin itself but also on the broader crypto market."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s number of wallets in loss reached a seven-month high\n\nMetrics and market indicators suggested that ETH\u2019s price might decline further\n\nOver the last few months, Ethereum [ETH] witnessed a decline in its network activity. This was the case as the blockchain\u2019s monthly average active addresses dropped.\n\nThe monthly average of active ETH addresses stood lower than the yearly average. This clearly indicated low activity, which could be taken as a bearish signal. While the blockchain\u2019s network activity declined, its price also failed to shoot up.\n\nIs Ethereum\u2019s reluctance to push its price up a consequence of less network activity?\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nThe reason for ETH\u2019s price drop\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, ETH was down by more than 9% in the last seven days, reflecting its sluggish behavior. At the time of writing, it was trading at $1,670.05 with a market capitalization of over $200 billion.\n\nThe price drop had a major impact on investors\u2019 portfolios. As per Glassnode Alerts\u2019 tweet, the number of ETH addresses in loss reached a seven-month high of 42,602,870.333.\n\nHowever, upon taking a closer look, the reason behind the downtrend might not have been less network activity. This was because while ETH\u2019s active addresses dropped, Layer-2s like Base, Optimism [OP], and rollups gained popularity.\n\nThe primary reason behind market participants shifting to L2s was that they offered more scalability. For reference, Coinbase\u2019s L2 Base bridged $251 million, with ETH accounting for $155 million out of the total within days of launch.\n\nA closer look at Ethereum\u2019s state\n\nA look at Ethereum\u2019s on-chain performance gave a better understanding of what was going on in the ecosystem. Upon checking, it was revealed that investors in funds and trusts, including Grayscale, have relatively weak buying sentiment.\n\nAdditionally, as per CryptoQuant, ETH\u2019s net deposit on exchanges was high compared to the seven-day average, suggesting high selling pressure. However, it was interesting to see that when ETH fell victim to the latest price correction, investors took it as an opportunity to increase accumulation.\n\nThis was evident from Glassnode Alerts\u2019 tweet, which pointed out that Ethereum\u2019s exchange outflow volume reached a one-month high during that period.\n\n? #Ethereum $ETH Exchange Outflow Volume (7d MA) just reached a 1-month high of 9,627.006 ETH Previous 1-month high of 9,608.990 ETH was observed on 20 August 2023 View metric:https://t.co/LzFffVHu6i pic.twitter.com/dhJIEP4CZO \u2014 glassnode alerts (@glassnodealerts) August 21, 2023\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today\n\nNot only metrics, but a few market indicators were also bearish. For example, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) displayed a bullish edge in the market.\n\nFurthermore, ETH\u2019s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) also registered a downtick, increasing the chances of a price decline. Nonetheless, the Money Flow Index (MFI) rebounded from the oversold zone, which can help the token increase its price."

        "content": "Vital has moved some Ethereum about a $1 million worth Ethereum to coin base. What does this mean? Well, might indicate that he's willing to sell a little bit. He moved about 600 to coin base over the weekend. Vitals, public addresses for his Ethereum holdings are out there. Most people know where they are. They're visible on most uh either scans or like Blockchain explorers out there. And for good reason, right? He's probably the most central figure head in all crypto because he's uh the front man or the image of Ethereum ecosystem, which is the largest smart contract ecosystem and the second largest coin by market cap behind Bitcoin. So when people see vital or anyone else moving money uh with that big of a name out there, they start paying attention. Of course, we don't know if he sold this Ethereum and we also don't know the reasons behind it. Maybe he just wanted to get some more cushion for uh his US D bank account. Who knows Zach? I'll throw this one up to you. I don't look at this story and be like, oh, this is like a, a big ominous bad dark cloud story. I just think our boy is, you know, he's traveling all over around the world, he needs some money. Hey, man, I'm with you. I think big picture like this is the funny thing about crypto, right? You get to watch this stuff happen, you just get to see it. You're like, oh we know that this is a wallet associative of tal and you know, he chose to keep that in the public domain essentially. And now we can sort of see the the flows of money across uh the world into these exchange addresses, right? So it is just kind of a funny feature of crypto and I never, it never, it never gets dull to me that we can have these conversations based on, on chain activity and unchain activity alone, right? We don't know his intent. We don't know why we don't know what's, what's happening. We just know that we can watch this thing move from point A to point B and deduce, maybe that there's something uh animating that, right? And I think that's a really funny feature of crypto that we can talk about these things. Um without any other knowledge, aside from the fact that we just know one wallet interacted with another, and therefore we know this one happens to be vital and we can speculate on whatever the million dollars is gonna be for if it's for, you know, I don't know, getting more travel luggage. So he can go to different places around the world or not. But, yeah, I don't know. There's not much to say here. I don't know, is gonna, like, change people's price project like projections for Ethereum. Right? Or if it change, I don't think this indicates that like, vital is any less bullish on his creation. But it is just kind of a funny thing. Um, least blotter section of like Ethereum Daily News that you can, uh, I don't know, read with your morning coffee. Well, I say really quick before I hand it over to Wendy. Uh, the funny part about this is the Ethereum Foundation, which of course is a steward of a lot that happens in Ethereum does sell the top almost every single cycle. They have like successfully sold the top on Eth and they put that money back into the Treasury to support grants for Ethereum ecosystem. So it ends up, I think being a net positive. But a lot of people look at when the Ethereum Foundation sells and then sort of make a note about that. And this one, people, obviously not at the top. We're down about, you know, 50 plus percent from the top in 2021 2022. But people might be looking at this and be like, oh, maybe we're looking at like another lower point in the future. If Italic is selling Wendy, it's a one, it's one, literally $1 million. It's really not a lot of money, especially when you're looking at Crypto Whale Wall. It's like there's so many people that are moving around a lot more capital that are loaning it out doing things. I also want to reference a story from coin desk back in March or excuse me, May 17th of 2021 vital 6 billion in ship token says he doesn't want the power so vital has kind of been infamous of doing different things with his funds and wallets that have been tracked. So I don't think it's necessarily a big deal that he moved 1 million of worth to coin base. I think if it was going to be a very, very large amount, it probably would be done. OTC. Um but maybe he just wanted the, hey, maybe he wanted to bridge the funds over to base or to um friend who knows, who knows? Yeah, Wendy, this isn't the first time Vital has sold either. So I don't think this is gonna like do anything to the markets, but I wanted to ask all of you a question based on what said, what do we think if, if vital does cash out a million dollars here, what do we think he's gonna buy? What luxury luggage does vital buy. I love his luggage post. That's one of the better blogs out there is how vital lives out of a 40 liter backpack and here's how he does it. That one is a good piece of content. A lot of 40 liter backpacks. If we're talking a million dollars, I don't think it's that hungry. Maybe he's hungry. He gotta buy snacks. A lot of backpack. All right. Don't know. Don't know."

        "content": "00:00\n\nPaul, I want to first get your take on the FCC case, maybe not as as a judge, but just as someone who watches crypto. How important was it that Ripple won at least part of that case? So I think it was actually pretty important because any step forward towards clarity is a positive step. And I think if you look at the draft legislation that's coming from Congress, it's very, very reasonable. And so all of these things, I hope, are converging towards pressure towards we should have more clarity of rules. And I think what Meltem said in your introduction was fantastic. She's right on target. Clarity is good for business. And hopefully between the legal decisions and the pending legislation, we're getting there in one small step at a time. Okay. So as we talk about the pending decisions around what is and is not a security, also all waiting with bated breath each and every day to see if a spot ETF approval actually may come or grayscale may actually have its ruling come down in the D.C. Circuit Court. Didn't happen today. We'll see if it happens on Friday. So we'll all wait for that. In regard to futures, though, and that potential ETF, that one seems like it it maybe is more likely. What real difference would that make, Paul? So I think it would make an enormous difference because we're really starting and your prior guest was amazing on this topic. We're really starting to see the difference between Bitcoin, which is a kind of digital gold, and people want to see it as potentially an inflation hedge or a global asset versus Etherium, which is becoming a global computing infrastructure. And so by having ETF for the two separate ones and specifically having Etherium ETFs, you can start to sort of take a stake in the Etherium ecosystem in the cash flow of transactions, in the value of the overall asset infrastructure that's being built there. And for people to see these two properly as separate. I think it's really important for the development of the overall marketplace. Okay. So on the subject of Etherium, you are a somewhat expert on the subject. You actually just wrote a book that was released earlier this summer, Etherium for business. It's called A Plain English Guide to How to use cases that generate returns from asset as asset management to payments to supply chains. Paul How should businesses be thinking about using this technology? So we have a very simple thing at UI, which is that we believe blockchains are going to be the glue that tie business ecosystems together. And even though everyone tends to focus on finance and DEFI and SEC rulings, in fact, Etherium is an incredible infrastructure for tokenizing assets tracking supply chains. If we look at the kind of things that we talk, I talk about in the book and that we're doing it why they are tokenizing carbon offsets, tokenizing carbon traceability, tracking pharmaceuticals, managing procurement agreements. Right. There's a tremendous amount of operational business stuff, none of which is finance related, but is essential for how companies interact with each other. And Etherium provides a neutral, decentralized infrastructure in which enterprises can transact with each other on a level equal terms. On the subject of things being level, is this a zero sum game, Paul? Are we going to head into a world where one chain actually is dominant? Etherium Perhaps. So I do believe that. I think if you look historically at the world of computing infrastructure, we like standards, right? Basically, a single operating system represents 90% of all PCs. Two operating systems represent more than 95% of all phones. We like standard standard scale really well. So I think we are headed for a global infrastructure where Etherium is the global base layer standard for digital business transactions in the same way that TCP IP is a global network standard and that others over time will gradually wither away. Just like 20 or 30 years ago, we used to have an alphabet soup of different networking standards and now we just have TCP IP. That reminds me that I love the metric system. Paul And we're kind of nowhere there in the US. Are we going to face a similar disadvantage when it comes to the global blockchain? I mean, is the US regulating itself out of competition here or not regulating itself into competition? I worry that there is some risk of that happening. I just actually got back from four weeks in Asia and it's very clear Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore and additionally Europe and the Middle East. These are all places that are moving really forward. If we look at kind of our volume of work and deals, we're up in every sector and we're up in every geography. But the places that are growing the fastest by by far in terms of our blockchain and core crypto work are Europe in preparation for the MICA Assets law and Hong Kong, which is growing rapidly at us as China tries to reopen, and then obviously Dubai in the Middle East where the regulatory environment is maturing very quickly. So the US is growing again and that part is good. And I've been telling all the people in our team, you know, summer is coming, but we are definitely lagging compared to other regions."

        "content": "Blockchain sleuths have flagged the transfer of $1 million of Ether (ETH) belonging to a wallet controlled by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin as cryptocurrency markets remain depressed after widespread weekend losses.\n\nThe publicly labeled Ethereum wallet address vitalik.eth transferred 600 ETH on Aug. 21, with the address still holding over 3,900 ETH valued at $6.5 million as per data from Etherscan.\n\nBlockchain data analysis from Lookonchain also revealed that vitalik.eth repaid 251,000 Rai Reflex Index (RAI) tokens on Maker and withdrew 1,000 ETH, worth $1,67 million, hours before the movement of ETH to Coinbase.\n\nCointelegraph also had confirmation from blockchain analytics firm Nansen that Buterin had transfered the large sum after a test transaction of 0.1 ETH two days prior, while their analysts noted that the exchange Buterin used in the latest movement differed from previous instances on record:\n\n\"Based on the wallet\u2019s history, ETH transfers in the past have typically been to Kraken. However, it\u2019s hard to say what\u2019s the purpose of the transfer so we aren\u2019t able to offer much more insight.\"\n\nA number of prominent blockchain data aggregators and publications shared insights into the transfer of 600 ETH to United States-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. The move caused a stir on social media in the hours after the transfer, with speculation around the transaction rife.\n\nButerin\u2019s transaction comes as wider cryptocurrency markets remain fragile following a sharp correction over the weekend. Bitcoin (BTC) and ETH saw losses of 11% and 8%, respectively.\n\nRelated: Vitalik dumps $700K worth of shitcoins that he never asked for\n\nAs Cointelegraph has previously reported, Buterin has admitted to selling portions of his ETH holdings on separate occasions over the past five years and has also publicly dumped tokens he has received in unsolicited alt coin airdrops.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: Deposit risk: What do crypto exchanges really do with your money?"

        "content": "After weeks of consolidation below a significant resistance level, Ethereum\u2019s price has finally demonstrated a large move to the downside.\n\nWhile there are still many support levels available, things are not looking good for ETH.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy: Edris\n\nThe Daily Chart:\n\nOn the daily chart, the price has dropped sharply below the $1,750 level and the key 200-day moving average, located around the $1,800 mark. The mentioned moving average is one of the most important trend indicators, and the market is considered to be in a bearish phase when the price trades below it.\n\nCurrently, the short-term $1,650 support level is holding the price, as a bullish pullback seems probable. Yet, the market structure has shifted bearish with the recent decline, and a retest of the $1,400 level looks probable in the coming weeks.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart:\n\nLooking at the 4-hour timeframe, it is evident that the price dropped below the large descending channel a few days ago. This breakdown has resulted in the decline being aggravated, with a large wick piercing through the $1,650 level.\n\nHowever, the mentioned level has successfully supported the price until now. The RSI indicator has also recovered from the oversold region, pointing to a potential consolidation in the short term. Yet, looking at the recent price action, lower prices are still likely.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nBy: Edris\n\nEthereum Open Interest\n\nAfter weeks of consolidation in a tight range, Ethereum\u2019s price experienced a sudden drop over the last few days. These sudden price moves are usually caused by futures market liquidations.\n\nThis chart demonstrates the Open Interest metric, which measures the total number of open positions in the perpetual futures markets. High values mostly lead to volatility.\n\nAs the chart depicts, the recent decline was accompanied by a sharp decrease in Open Interest. Therefore, it could be interpreted that the futures market was once again responsible for the recent drop, as the significant reduction in Open Interest indicates that the market went through a long liquidation cascade.\n\nAs a result, more stable price action can be expected in the short term, with fewer leveraged positions open at the moment."

Discover SCENE\n\nThere are now more daily transactions on Ethereum layer-2 Base, which was incubated and launched by Coinbase, than on Ethereum\u2014fueled in large part by the hype around social app Friend.tech.\n\nThe latest data from digital asset analytics platform Artemis Terminal shows that daily transactions on Base hit 1.37 million yesterday while on Ethereum, they stood at little over 1 million.\n\nBase is American crypto exchange Coinbase's latest product: An Ethereum scaling solution which promises to make it quicker, easier and cheaper for developers to build apps. But Coinbase has been adamant that Base will be decentralized, meaning the company's role in its governance will diminish over time.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSan Francisco-based Coinbase has said the chain will be open ecosystem for millions of new decentralized apps.\n\nAnd it has taken off with lots of projects and their tokens but right now mainly because of Friend.tech, a new decentralized social media platform build on Base which has exploded with popularity.\n\nThe reason? Friend.tech is a Twitter-linked crypto app which lets users buy and sell shares of their friends\u2019 social media profiles\u2014and it's being lapped up by celebs. It's worth noting that Ethereum researcher Evan Van Ness and Flashbots product lead Robert Miller have pointed out on Twitter: There are signs that a large portion of the transactions on Base are coming from bots and spammers trying to get an edge on Friend.tech.\n\nStill, the app's boom in popularity means that transactions are soaring on Base as more people sign up to use the app.\n\nSince its launch, the total amount generated in protocol fees is fast closing in on $6 million, according to DeFi Llama data.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe mobile platform links to Twitter accounts and tokenizes them; users who buy \"keys\" to another account gain exclusive access to that user's private chat room\u2014and ostensibly the value of that user's token, whether it rises or falls.\n\nBut Base is still lagging behind Ethereum, the second biggest blockchain, in other metrics: Volumes on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) is still the highest on Ethereum-based ones, at 836 million. On Base, which stands at a mere 8.25 million.\n\nAnd the total value locked in Base protocols is at 180 million; on Ethereum it's over 22 billion."

        "content": "Image: Shutterstock\n\nIn a significant development within the crypto realm, Ethereum (ETH) has experienced a remarkable price surge of nearly 11%, according to Bloomberg\u2019s report of August 17. The report cited multiple sources and suggested that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will likely grant approval for applications related to Ethereum Futures Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs).This sudden and substantial increase pushed Ethereum's price to around $1,700, marking an impressive 11% jump. The SEC's potential approval of ETH Futures ETFs will signify a notable shift in the regulatory body's stance towards digital assets, indicating a growing acceptance of cryptos within traditional financial systems.If the applications for these ETFs are approved, it would mark a milestone moment for the crypto market. This approval could signal a heightened recognition of digital assets by established financial institutions, potentially encouraging greater institutional participation and investment in the crypto sector.Recent market trends have been influenced by various factors, including Ethereum's 5% price decline as a response to the broader Bitcoin value downturn. Bitcoin's price drop triggered a cascading effect across the entire crypto market. Notably, other cryptos, such as Binance Coin and SUI, also experienced 5% and 10% declines, respectively.Despite these challenges, Ethereum's trading volume witnessed a remarkable surge of 185% within the span of just 24 hours. Hourly charts illustrated a concerted effort to reclaim Ethereum's price, with a series of green candles indicating renewed positive sentiment. This resurgence coincided with the news surrounding the SEC's potential approval of ETH Futures ETFs.As these events unfold, the crypto community remains vigilant and anticipatory. While an 11% upswing in Ethereum's value is seen as an encouraging advancement, it's crucial to maintain a cautious approach due to the inherent volatility of the crypto market. The crypto sector remains dynamic and fluid, requiring careful consideration and informed decision-making."

It means that despite his transfer to Coinbase, his Ethereum holdings still increased compared to just a couple of days earlier.\n\nThe choice of exchange is unsurprising, given that data clearly shows he prefers Coinbase over other exchanges.\n\nYou might also like: Vitalik Buterin prefers Coinbase over other exchanges, analysis shows\n\nMoreover, Buterin\u2019s publicly-known wallets currently hold a total of over 248,000 ETH \u2014 a number that increased by nearly 713 ETH compared to the beginning of August despite the value of those holdings falling.\n\nHis Ethereum holdings are also worth nearly $415 million, while the second most valuable asset on those wallets is Maker (MKR), worth only $544,000 or about $0.131 of his ETH holdings.\n\nIn conclusion, while Buterin has moved a significant amount of ETH to Coinbase with the likely intention to sell it for fiat, this amount pales compared to his total Ethereum exposure.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "The world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum (ETH) continues to show weakness with its price tanking by more than 10% over the last week and falling to $1,650 levels. ETH looks weak on the technical chart hinting at the possibility of another 45% correction from the current levels.\n\nPopular crypto analyst Ali Martinez writes: \u201cSlipping beneath the $1,600 \u2013 $1,550 bracket for $ETH might set the stage for a significant 37% \u2013 45% correction, targeting $1,000\u2033.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe Ethereum network fundamentals are showing signs of lagging, indicating a bearish trend. The monthly average of active Ethereum ($ETH) addresses is below the annual average, suggesting limited on-chain activity. This is a common indicator of diminished network health and utilization.\n\nWill Ethereum Futures ETF Save from the Possible Collapse?\n\nAfter Thursday\u2019s price crash last week, the ETH price saw a partial recovery as reports emerged that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission would greenlight the Ethereum futures ETF. The Volatility Shares Ether futures ETF are likely to go live by October 12 as per the current schedule.\n\nBut despite the optimistic Bloomberg report, on-chain data indicates that Ethereum whales have not embraced the bullish sentiment. In fact, they have continued to offload their holdings, even following a modest price recovery observed on Friday after a significant sell-off.\n\nAs illustrated below, the group of Ethereum whales possessing 10,000 to 100,000 coins has been consistently selling on the market since mid-July. Clearly, during the period from July 14 to August 18, they reduced their ETH holdings by 1.12 million coins. Notably, this reduction in whale holdings by 4% aligns with the 18% decrease in ETH price during the same timeframe from July 14 to August 18.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to say whether the tides would turn in favor of Ethereum investors anytime soon. However, the arrival of Ethereum Futures ETF could certainly lead to growing institutional participation in the long term.\n\nFor now, it will be interesting to see if ETH manages to sustain above $1,600 levels."

        "content": "According to on-chain data, a wallet associated with Ethereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin sent 600 Ether worth roughly $1 million to Coinbase earlier today.\n\nThe motive behind the transaction remains speculative as of press time. Usually, transfers to exchange are translated to mean an intention to sell. With Ethereum\u2019s price recently struggling, Buterin\u2019s transaction could further exert more selling pressure on the digital asset.\n\nMeanwhile, on-chain sleuth Lookonchain reported that Vitalik.eth wallet repaid 251,000 RAI on DeFi platform Maker and withdrew 1,000 ETH (around $1.67 million) on Aug. 20.\n\nThe wallet known as \u201cvitalik.eth\u201d was created seven years ago and contained 3,993 ETH, worth $6.5 million as of press time. CryptoSlate, using the Arkham Intelligence dashboard, confirmed that the wallet belonged to the Ethereum co-founder. Other digital assets in the wallet include $84,000 worth of USD Coin (USDC) and $58,000 worth of Wrapped Ethereum (WETH).\n\nThis is not the first time Buterin would transfer assets to a crypto exchange. Earlier in the year, the Ethereum co-founder sent 200 ETH to Kraken in March. Around the same period, Buterin dumped several unsolicited altcoins (sh*tcoins) for 439.25 ETH.\n\nETH price struggling\n\nButerin\u2019s transaction is coming on the heels of last Thursday\u2019s crypto market flash crash. Last week, ETH\u2019s price fell below $1700 for the first time since June and continued to trade under the mark as of press time.\n\nAccording to CryptoSlate\u2019s data, ETH traded at $1667 at the time of writing after a slight decline of 0.18% in the last 24 hours.\n\nHowever, data from blockchain analytical firm Glassnode shows that Ethereum holders are jealously guarding their holdings as they rapidly send their assets off crypto exchanges. According to the data aggregator, the amount of ETH held on exchanges is 14.88 million, a level not recorded since 2018.\n\nExchange outflows usually suggest a bullish sign that the asset is being held for its long-term benefit. Going by this, it means ETH holders are less concerned about its recent poor price performance.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Introducing Zeth \u2014The First Type 0 zkEVM\n\nSEATTLE, Aug. 22, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- RISC Zero , developers of leading general purpose zero-knowledge (ZK) virtual machine technology, today announced Zeth , a first-of-its-kind \"Type 0\" (fully Ethereum-compatible) zkEVM built on the RISC Zero zkVM and Bonsai proving service . Zeth is a new way of architecting L2's and scaling Ethereum, making this milestone release a significant step forward for ZK tech and the Ethereum ecosystem. Zeth paves the way for unprecedented ease in building powerful and efficient ZK infrastructure such as ZK rollups, ZK light clients, and ZK bridges.\n\nType 0: A new category of zkEVM\n\nIntroducing Zeth \u2014The First Type 0 zkEVM Post this\n\nEthereum was not originally designed around ZK-friendliness, so there are many parts of the protocol that take a large amount of computation to ZK-prove. Type 1 aims to replicate Ethereum exactly, and so it has no way of mitigating these inefficiencies. At present, proofs for Ethereum blocks take many hours to produce. However, using Zeth, Ethereum blocks can be proven in minutes.\n\n\"This is a watershed moment for the blockchain industry and the Ethereum ecosystem \u2013 Zeth is a compelling example of RISC Zero's mission to maximize the utility of zero-knowledge cryptography. Our technology allowed Zeth to be built at a tiny fraction of the cost of similar efforts; RISC Zero's zkVM can be used by any team to build innovative new offerings in record time.\" said Brian Retford, CEO and Co-Founder of RISC Zero.\n\nRoughly one year ago, Vitalik published The different types of ZK-EVMs . Zeth was built using standard Rust crates \u2014 the same crates used by popular full nodes like Reth . Because it makes no changes to Ethereum semantics and reuses code from popular Ethereum node software, Zeth is a new category of zkEVMs \u2014 Type 0 zkEVM (fully Ethereum compatibility and high code reuse).\n\nZK rollups and zkEVMs\n\nExisting ZK rollups and zkEVM circuits are monolithic in design and lack upgradability without a high level understanding of ZK cryptography from the developer. In contrast, RISC Zero's zkVM-based approach to Zeth enables any developer to customize and modify to suit their needs.\n\nZeth makes it possible to ZK prove a given Ethereum block without relying on a validator or sync committee in minutes. And with RISC Zero's support for onchain verification , anyone can cheaply verify those proofs on chain . Zeth provides everything needed to generate ZK proofs for EVM-based blocks. This is a key component in any zkEVM or bridge.\n\nZeth, based on revm , and can easily be adapted to support other zkEVMs and EVM-compatible chains. This ensures easy updates to Zeth for future EIPs while providing modularity that enables developers to build their own block construction logic into Zeth.\n\nAs a Type 0 zkEVM, Zeth enables developers to build ZK rollups with completely native EVM and Ethereum support. Zeth is open source , so developers can easily modify and use it in their projects. The proofs can be verified onchain (perfect for bridges and L2s) or in native apps (perfect for full nodes and light clients). For any teams and projects looking to collaborate/build on RISC Zero, please fill out this form .\n\nTo start building with Zeth, go to https://github.com/risc0/zeth\n\nAbout RISC Zero\n\nRISC Zero is revolutionizing the internet by creating the infrastructure and tooling for Web3 developers around the globe to build zero-knowledge proof software. The project is on a mission to empower Web3 developers to build with the latest zero knowledge technology, enabling individuals worldwide to leverage its benefits. Backed by notable investors, including Blockchain Capital and Bain Capital Crypto, RISC Zero has raised a $40M Series A.\n\nSOURCE Risc Zero"

        "content": "The non-fungible token (NFT) market is witnessing a noteworthy shift, with Cardano's NFT floor price index currently standing at 22% higher than Ethereum's as per data shared by Stocktwits NFTs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis comparison, based on the 7-day charts, reveals a growing interest in Cardano as a platform for NFT trading, although Ethereum has been historically dominant in this realm.\n\nHowever, despite the impressive growth in Cardano's NFT floor price, it continues to lag behind in terms of overall trading volume. According to recent data from CryptoSlam, Ethereum still dominates the market with a total trading volume of $13,279,162 and 11,197 buyers.\n\nIn contrast, Cardano ranks ninth with a trading volume of $180,637, although it has a considerable 1,555 buyers. This discrepancy points to the notion that Ethereum remains the most popular platform in terms of sheer trading volume while individual Cardano NFTs are gaining in value.\n\nSolana and Polygon come in second and third places with $1,601,313 and $1,235,318 in primary sales, respectively.\n\nThe Stocktwits NFTs' tweet further raises the question, \"Wen projects migrate to Cardano?\" hinting at the possible migration of projects from other platforms to Cardano in the future.\n\nSuch migrations could be a result of Cardano's NFT price surge and the potential benefits it offers as an NFT platform. However, it's essential to approach this shift with cautious optimism. Cardano shows promise in the NFT sector, but Ethereum's established foothold, backed by higher trading volumes and larger user bases, means it remains a significant player in the market."

Usually, it signifies the continuation of an upward trend. However, sometimes, it can indicate an upcoming reverse of the price movement.\n\nMartinez believes that should ETH slip under the $1,600-$1,550 level, this may create conditions for the further decline of the coin by a whopping 37%-45% correction with $1,000 as the main target.\n\n#Ethereum | Slipping beneath the $1,600 - $1,550 bracket for $ETH might set the stage for a significant 37% - 45% correction, targeting $1,000. pic.twitter.com/Xmo7Mgfux5 \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) August 21, 2023\n\nEthereum signals bearish trend\n\nIn an earlier tweet, Martinez also spoke of negative prospects for the Ethereum price in the near future. He tweeted that since the fundamentals of the network are still pretty weak, this signals a bearish trend coming.\n\nIn particular, the average amount of monthly active Ethereum wallets has dropped earlier than the yearly average. This shows small on-chain activity on the network. The analyst added that this is a typical sign of \"weak network health and usage.\"\n\n#Ethereum network fundamentals are still lagging, signaling a bearish trend!\n\n\n\nThe monthly average of active $ETH addresses is lower than the yearly average, indicating little on-chain activity.

However, since Aug. 17, it lost a whole 9.72%, dropping from $1,800 to the $1,625 low.\n\nOn the same day, ETH staged a recovery of 4.33% in a single green candle. Since then it has been trading in a range, with the resistance being the $1,694 level and the support staying at $1,664.\n\nAt the time of this writing, Ethereum is changing hands at $1,671."

During the recent market downtrend, numerous individuals transferred funds within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Notably, Buterin moved a substantial amount of Ethereum [ETH] recently.\n\nOn-chain data revealed that Buterin orchestrated a transfer of 600 ETH, which held a value of approximately $1 million. The ETH was moved in a single transaction to the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase.\n\nButerin\u2019s move comes amidst a recent market slump\n\nThe nature of Buterin\u2019s recent transaction is not yet known. Some speculation indicates he could be selling, leading certain people to point out this as the start of a dumping season.\n\nAlso read: Logan Paul\u2019s CryptoZoo Investors Still Waiting on Refunds 8 Months Later\n\nSome analysts also point out that if Ethereum slips below the $1,600 to $1,550 support zone, it could open the door for a major correction of 37\u201345%, potentially targeting the $1,000 level. Breaking below key support might set the stage for significant downward momentum.\n\nThe movement also comes at a time when the price of ETH is not in its best shape. ETH is down from a 30-day high of $1,904 to a low of $1,551 and is currently trading at $1,673 at press time."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn a significant move today, Ethereum's visionary founder, Vitalik Buterin, transferred 600 ETH, equivalent to a staggering $1 million, to a deposit on the prominent crypto exchange, Coinbase. The action, revealed by crypto analytics platform PeckShiedAlert, has triggered a flurry of speculation across the crypto community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdding depth to the narrative, esteemed on-chain tracker Lookonchain offers insights into Buterin's recent activities. According to their comprehensive analysis, Buterin embarked on a strategic financial maneuver. He began by settling his 251,000 RAI loan on the Maker protocol, followed by withdrawing 1,000 ETH. Notably, today's 600 ETH transfer to Coinbase constitutes a part of this larger series of transactions.\n\nSell signal or strategic play?\n\nDespite his track record as a pioneering figure in the blockchain realm, this event has cast a shadow of uncertainty. Crypto enthusiasts have widely interpreted Buterin's actions as a possible harbinger of an impending downturn.\n\nETH to USD by CoinMarketCap\n\nHistorically, insider selling or significant figures divesting from projects has been associated with an anticipation of market contractions. The Ethereum market, which has witnessed a downward trajectory since the start of today's trading session, has found itself under additional strain due to Buterin's recent move.\n\nAmid the speculation and market ripples, it is worth noting that Buterin's primary wallet, cryptically named \"vitalik.eth,\" maintains a holding of 3,935 Ethereum tokens, a stash valued at an impressive $6.57 million. This intriguing development leaves enthusiasts grappling with a pivotal question: does the transfer signal a step in the face of potential market shifts, or is it merely a strategic financial maneuver within Buterin's broader vision?"

Cardano, on the other hand, faced criticism from numerous quarters, being labeled a \u201cghost chain\u201d due to its absence of a DeFi and NFT economy. However, the NFT landscape is undergoing a shift.\n\nAccording to the weekly chart shared by Stocktwits NFTs, the Cardano NFT floor price index sits 22% above that of Ethereum.\n\nThe latest update by the platform demonstrated an increasing inclination towards Cardano as a hub for NFTs among market participants.\n\nA major factor that played a crucial role in uplifting the ecosystem is the Vasil upgrade which helped Cardano to become the third-largest NFT protocol behind Ethereum and Solana last September.\n\nVasil aims to improve block latency speed and efficiency on the blockchain, and its completion pushed the Unique Active Wallets (UAW) on the Cardano blockchain to new heights.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum\u2019s dominance in the NFT space dwindled primarily because of its network congestion issues coupled with high gas fees that prompted some users to explore alternative platforms.\n\nWhile Cardano NFTs floor price may have exceeded Ethereum\u2019s, the latter still commands position in terms of NFT sales volume over the last 24-hours.\n\nIn fact, data from CryptoSlam revealed that the latter\u2019s sales account for a whopping $65 million while that of Cardano\u2019s stands at $1.47 million."

Possible decline to $20,000 unless conditions change.\n\nEthereum price breach of trendline signals a potential 27% decline to $1,200, supported by EMA crossover and bearish indicators.\n\nRipple price retracement after SEC case resolution suggests further decline. Indicators point to $0.411 and $0.287 support levels.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price could break down unless conditions change.

Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) price remains in the woods.\n\nAlso Read: If things do not improve, another miner-induced sell-off is likely for Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin price could slump further unless conditions change\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price signals the continuation of a downward trend as prices shifted onto a bearish trajectory after breaking below the ascending trendline. Since the start of the year, price movements have adhered to an ascending channel following a substantial consolidation period. However, by market capitalization, the leading cryptocurrency underwent another consolidation phase in late July.\n\nNotably, last week, Bitcoin price breached this consolidation, descending beneath the lower boundary of the ascending channel, thereby instigating a bearish sentiment.\n\nThe pivotal support level of $26,012 holds significance, having previously functioned as a robust resistance threshold. A breach and subsequent close beneath this level would contribute to the existing downward trend, potentially propelling prices toward the critical psychological milestone of $20,000. This equates to a decline of approximately 23% from the current price level.\n\nIn conjunction, the Awesome Oscillator (AO) histograms provide clear support for the downward trajectory, evidenced by the prevalence of red and elongated bodies. Similarly, the Williams Percentage R Indicator operates within the oversold range of -80, indicating persistent short-position opportunities.\n\nHowever, the Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) positioning introduces an exciting facet. With the 50-period EMA situated above the 100-period EMA, there are indications of potential positive movements. This implies the possibility for a minor price retracement before an eventual breach of the critical $26,000 support.\n\nThe more prudent approach, therefore, would involve awaiting price confirmation below the $26,000 level before considering entry into a short position.\n\nBTC/USD 1-day chart\n\nConversely, a resurgence by sidelined investors could restore Bitcoin price into the bullish technical formation, with the potential to breach the $30,699 resistance level.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin CME gaps at $35,000, $27,000, and $21,000. Which one gets filled first?\n\nEthereum price could fall amid bearish indicators\n\nEthereum (ETH) price shows an impending downward trajectory, substantiated by the breach of the ascending trendline. The breach has also led to a dip below the critical support level of $1,687. This development has paved the way for a potential 27% price reduction, potentially reaching the psychological benchmark of $1,200, with intermediate support of $1,366.\n\nAdditional technical indicators reinforce these observations. The higher EMA 100 has recently intersected with the lower EMA 50 from a downward perspective, signifying a bearish market trend. Similarly, the histograms of the AO have transitioned to red, with robust bodies positioned beneath the zero line, indicative of heightened selling pressure.\n\nGiven this scenario, traders could consider initiating short positions in the market after a confirmed closure below the $1,620 level.\n\nETH/USD 1-day chat\n\nOn the other hand, the position of the RSI within the oversold region points to a forthcoming price reversal. If momentum is nurtured, Ethereum price could steadily restore above the $1,687 support level and elevate above the ascending trendline in a highly bullish case. Such a move would increase the chances of a continued uptrend, with a decisive foray above $2,029 confirming the uptrend.\n\nAlso Read: SEC could approve multiple Ether ETFs soon while delaying Bitcoin spot ETFs\n\nRipple price eyes key levels as the downtrend continues\n\nRipple (XRP) price reflects a significant retracement of the recent gains accrued after the favorable resolution of the SEC case. At present, indications of a continued downward trajectory are becoming apparent. The current price movement follows the path delineated by the 200-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA).\n\nThe broader context conveyed by various indicators suggests a likelihood of further price depreciation, potentially reaching the $0.411 level. This level holds significance as the second support threshold, coinciding with the lower boundary of the channel (denoted by the blue color) initiated in June. Should this level prove inadequate in upholding the value of XRP, an extended descent toward the $0.287 level becomes probable, signifying a substantial decline of approximately 45% from the current price.\n\nAn analysis of the MACD histograms shows the continuation of the southerly trajectory, substantiated by the histograms consistently manifesting in the negative region below the zero line. Furthermore, the Stochastic Oscillator's northward orientation corroborates the prevailing bearish sentiment.\n\nFollowing this analysis, the recommended course of action involves waiting for confirmation of price closure below the descending grey trendline before considering entry into a short position.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, a descending grey trendline offers preliminary support to the cryptocurrency pair, possibly facilitating a brief retracement. If the Ripple price sustains above this line, the odds of a move north increase. However, invalidation of the current bearish outlook would only occur once XRP surpasses the upper boundary of the chart pattern.\n\nAlso Read: XRP price rally to $0.60 likely with recovery fueled by developments in SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit"

        "title": "How to unlock Ethereum's potential: the complete guide to Optimism - OKX",
        "content": "Ethereum is a dynamic platform that caters to many transactions and applications, from Decentralized Finance (DeFi) to gaming, and even Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). But, a prominent challenge it faces is scalability. As it stands, Ethereum can handle about 30 transactions every second.\n\nThe reason for this limitation is rooted in Ethereum's foundational values, because it prioritizes decentralization and security. While these principles bolster the network's trustworthiness and resilience, they also impose constraints on its transactional speed or throughput. When the network demand is higher, so are the gas fees for transactions, which can be astronomical \u2014 especially for new blockchain adopters.\n\nLayer 2 (L2) can offer some tangible solutions to help enhance blockchain scalability and speed by processing transactions off the main chain (layer 1) and then periodically consolidating them. This reduces congestion and fees, allowing faster transactions without sacrificing security or decentralization. Their adoption is vital for blockchains to accommodate more users and applications.\n\nWhat is Optimism (OP)?\n\nEthereum L2 represents a suite of solutions crafted to augment Ethereum's capacity. These solutions process transactions away from the primary Ethereum blockchain, known as Layer 1 or L1.\n\nWhile these transactions are handled off the main blockchain, they still enjoy the robust security and decentralization features that Ethereum inherently offers. Think of L2 as an auxiliary system meticulously designed to expand Ethereum's transactional capabilities.\n\nLayer 2's primary mission is scalability. It adeptly manages multiple transactions, ensuring Ethereum's ecosystem is not overwhelmed. On the flip side, Ethereum's L1 has its plate full of pivotal responsibilities; it's the bastion of the system's security, data accessibility, and, crucially, decentralization.\n\nThis dynamic partnership between L1 and L2 makes sure that while the system scales up its transactional might, it doesn't compromise on its foundational security principles.\n\nOptimism as a layer 2\n\nOptimism serves as a L2 solution constructed atop the foundational Ethereum blockchain. Its inception addresses two pressing concerns for Ethereum users: exorbitant transaction fees and occasional sluggishness in transaction processing times.\n\nHow does Optimism achieve this?\n\nInstead of processing every transaction directly on the Ethereum mainnet (L1), Optimism acts as an intermediary layer where most of the transactional activity occurs. Optimism can expedite these processes by shifting much of the transactional workload off the main chain, offering users a quicker transactional experience.\n\nHowever, it's essential to understand that while the bulk of the transaction activity happens on Optimism, it doesn't operate in isolation. To ensure security and integrity, the data from these transactions is relayed back to the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nThe data undergoes validation, benefiting from Ethereum's robust security protocols. This dual-layer mechanism helps to make sure that while users enjoy swifter and more cost-effective transactions on Optimism, they can remain confident in the integrity and security of their operations, thanks to the validation on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nHow does Optimism work?\n\nIn the traditional Ethereum network, every transaction is processed on the main chain, preserving security but sometimes leading to congestion and high fees. Optimistic Rollups is a technology to shift most of the transaction processing away from the main Ethereum chain.\n\nWhen a user initiates a transaction on Optimism, it takes place on this L2 solution instead of directly on the Ethereum mainnet. This L2 is a separate blockchain running alongside Ethereum.Here's what the flow looks like:\n\nUser intent: A user initiates a transaction using Optimism on an app or platform.\n\nTransaction processing: Instead of directly broadcasting the transaction to the Ethereum mainnet, it's first processed on the Optimistic L2. This allows for faster and cheaper transactions because L2 is designed for high throughput.\n\nSubmission to Ethereum: Once processed, these transactions are then sent to the Ethereum mainnet in batches, instead of individually, reducing the overall load on the mainnet.\n\nEthereum as a data availability layer\n\nWhile Optimism deals with the bulk of transaction processing, Ethereum\u2019s mainnet still plays a vital role. It acts as the final source of truth and as a data availability layer.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nEvery transaction processed on Optimism is eventually recorded on the Ethereum mainnet. This is done by sending a cryptographic proof (a sort of summary) of all the transactions that occurred on Optimism. Even though the mainnet doesn\u2019t need to process each transaction individually, it still stores this proof, guaranteeing the data is available and verifiable by anyone.\n\nThis system makes sure that if Optimism faced an issue (like downtime), users could still retrieve and verify their transactions using the Ethereum mainnet. In short, it offers a robust security guarantee.\n\nIntroduction to Optimized batch compression\n\nOne of the standout features of Optimism is its ability to handle a large volume of transactions efficiently. This is achieved through a process called optimized batch compression.\n\nImagine you had to move a library's worth of books from one building to another. Instead of moving each book individually, you'd pack them into boxes, making the process faster and more efficient. Similarly, instead of submitting each transaction from Optimism to Ethereum one by one, they're bundled together in 'batches'.\n\nThese batches are then 'compressed' using cryptographic techniques. This means taking a large set of transaction data and converting it into a much smaller yet verifiable format.By doing this, Optimism can significantly reduce the amount of data that needs to be stored on the Ethereum mainnet, saving on fees and maintaining the efficient use of Ethereum's resources.\n\nWhat's Optimism's bedrock upgrade?\n\nBedrock is a pivotal upgrade to the Optimism protocol. It brings several performance improvements, primarily focusing on reduced transaction fees, shorter deposit times, improved proof modularity, enhanced node performance, and a more Ethereum-equivalent architecture.\n\nHere's a breakdown of these features:\n\nLower fees\n\nBedrock has implemented innovative methods to reduce transaction costs:\n\nOptimized data compression: Bedrock adopts a new data compression strategy, targeting minimal data costs. Initial benchmarks suggest this change can significantly reduce fees.\n\nElimination of L1 execution gas: By eliminating all L1 execution gas, Bedrock further drops L1 data fees to its bare minimum, offering a 10% fee reduction over its predecessor.\n\nShorter deposit times\n\nDepositing funds into the rollup system can be a time-consuming process. Earlier versions had a wait time of up to 10 minutes for deposit confirmation. However, Bedrock will help improve the speed and efficiency of deposits.\n\nHandles L1 re-organization: By introducing support for L1 reorganizations in the node software, Bedrock cuts down the confirmation time for deposits, targeting around 3 minutes.\n\nImproved proof modularity\n\nA key aspect of rollups is the proof system that guarantees correct transaction execution. Bedrock enhances this by:\n\nSeparating proof system from OP stack: This abstraction lets a rollup employ fault or validity proofs, like zk-SNARKs. Systems like Cannon can use this modularity to prove any discrepancies.\n\nImproved node performance\n\nNodes play a crucial role in maintaining and validating the rollup. Bedrock offers significant improvements in node performance:\n\nMultiple transactions in one block: Unlike the older one-transaction-per-block model, Bedrock allows the bundling of several transactions in one roll-up block. This approach amortizes the cost of Merkle tree updates over multiple transactions, reducing state growth by an estimated 15GB/year.\n\nTechnical debt removal: Technical debt can hinder performance and scalability. Bedrock addresses this by removing the requirement for a separate data transport layer node to index L1 and ensures efficient querying for transaction data from L1.\n\nImproved Ethereum equivalence\n\nFor seamless interaction and integration, Optimism must be as analogous to Ethereum as possible. Bedrock makes strides towards this through the following:\n\nRemoval of protocol deviations: Bedrock removes various deviations from Ethereum that existed in previous versions, such as the one-transaction-per-block model, custom opcodes for L1 block information, separate L1/L2 fee fields in the JSON-RPC API, and a unique ERC20 representation for ETH balances.\n\nIncorporation of Ethereum features: To stay aligned with Ethereum's ecosystem, Bedrock supports features like EIP-1559 and chain re-orgs in Ethereum's L1.\n\nBedrock represents a significant leap for the Optimism protocol. By focusing on user experience (reduced fees and shorter deposit times), technical robustness (proof modularity and enhanced node performance), and Ethereum compatibility, Bedrock provides a more efficient and seamless L2 solution for Ethereum applications.\n\nWhat's Optimism's Superchain?\n\nThe future of the decentralized web is advancing rapidly, and at its forefront is the Optimism Superchain, an innovative development poised to transform blockchain scalability and interoperability.Here's why the Superchain concept is transformative:\n\nThe essence of Superchain: The Superchain is a groundbreaking approach to horizontal scalability. It's a network of multiple chains (L2 chains), but these are not just any chains \u2014 they're chains that share unified security, a cohesive communication layer, and a holistic open-source development stack. Think of it as a cooperative web of chains, each bringing unique capabilities yet functioning cohesively as one unit.\n\nMerging Optimism Mainnet with other chains: The real magic happens when discussing how Superchain joins Optimism mainnet with other chains. Instead of each chain operating in isolation, the Superchain allows them to share a central truth source: the L1 chain. This eliminates the need for every new chain deployment to establish its own set of validators, making the entire system more efficient and streamlined.\n\nSignificance for the decentralized web: The decentralized web is all about providing robustness, security, and scalability. The Superchain, with its ability to treat multiple chains as interchangeable computational resources, paves the way for developers to craft cross-chain applications. This reduces systemic risks and significantly cuts overheads, allowing for a more efficient and cohesive decentralized ecosystem.\n\nThe revenue model of Superchain rewards both application and protocol developers. The OP Stack, the backbone on which Superchain is built, sees that revenue is reinvested into public goods, making the ecosystem sustainable, robust, and forward-looking.\n\nThe Superchain is a game-changer, ushering in a new era where multiple chains can coexist, interoperate, and benefit from shared security and resources. It's a testament to the spirit of collaboration, innovation, and the boundless possibilities of the decentralized web.\n\nHow does Optimism compare with other Ethereum layer 2 solutions?\n\nWhen diving into Ethereum's L2 scaling solutions, Polygon has also been making headlines. Here's a breakdown to grasp their differences more clearly:\n\nPolygon\n\nOriginally christened as Matic Network, Polygon has etched its identity with a versatile multi-chain approach. This means it masterfully interweaves the characteristics of both L1 and L2 solutions.\n\nAt its heart, Polygon operates through a Proof of Stake blockchain network, which serves a dual purpose: it accelerates Ethereum transactions and simultaneously slashes the transaction costs. Delving into its architectural blueprint, Polygon showcases a twin-layer setup named Heimdall and Bor.This dynamic duo streamlines the validation of transactions and enables the swift production of blocks.\n\nUnlike its counterparts, Polygon has a direct line to Ethereum through smart contracts, allowing it to function independently.Polygon offers an intricate yet efficient framework, setting itself apart with its unique integration of features to elevate Ethereum's performance.\n\nOptimism\n\nAlternatively dubbed \"Optimistic Ethereum\", Optimism is best known for harnessing the Optimistic Rollups technology. Its main aim is to amplify Ethereum's scalability. Unlike Polygon, which directly interacts with Ethereum and stands robustly on its own, Optimism takes a different route.\n\nIt groups multiple transactions together and then confirms their validity on the Ethereum network. This approach does make individual transactions on Optimism cheaper. However, it's crucial to remember that Ethereum still shoulders the broader validation costs.\n\nAn intriguing aspect of Optimism is its inherent trust in transactions, deeming them valid by default. But, if any transaction raises eyebrows, there's a 7-day challenge window to make sure everything's as it should be.\n\nUnique features of Optimism\n\nOptimistic Rollups: The major technology behind Optimism is the Optimistic Rollup. Rollups are a way of increasing the throughput of the Ethereum network without requiring each node to process every transaction. Instead, most transaction processing is done off-chain, and only the final state or a summary of transactions is committed to the main Ethereum chain.\n\nFraud proofs: Optimism uses a system where transactions are presumed valid unless proven otherwise. If someone thinks a transaction is fraudulent, they can challenge it. The transaction is rolled back if the challenge is valid, and the malicious actor is penalized. The term \"optimistic\" comes from this, as the system optimistically assumes transactions are valid.\n\nCompatibility with Ethereum: Optimism is designed to be highly compatible with Ethereum. This means that developers can easily port their existing Ethereum smart contracts to Optimism with minimal changes.\n\nSequencer: Optimism has introduced the sequencer concept to optimize the user experience. The sequencer is responsible for ordering transactions and provides a consistent transaction history. This allows for faster confirmation times than waiting for Ethereum mainnet confirmation.\n\nDecentralization with security: Despite being a L2 solution, Optimism leans heavily on the security of the Ethereum mainnet. While it processes transactions off-chain for speed and efficiency, it still uses Ethereum for the finality and security of those transactions.\n\nCompared to Polygon, Optimism's primary focus is enhancing Ethereum's scalability using the Optimistic Rollup technology. While both solutions offer increased throughput and reduced transaction costs, they achieve this using different architectures and technologies. Optimism\u2019s emphasis on compatibility and its optimistic approach to transaction validation make it a unique addition to the Ethereum scaling ecosystem.\n\nThe final word\n\nThe development of L2 solutions, like Optimism, seek to enhance Ethereum's efficiency without diluting its inherent security and decentralization strengths. Optimism operates as an intermediary, processing transactions swiftly and cost-effectively.\n\nHowever, it doesn't function in isolation. After processing, transaction data is relayed and validated on the primary Ethereum blockchain (L1). As a result, users of Optimism gain both speed and the assurance of Ethereum's robust security, enjoying the best of both worlds in Ethereum's layered approach.\n\nSuperchain's innovative approach to horizontal scalability encapsulated within Optimism can potentially revolutionize the decentralized web. Fostering a network of interconnected chains with unified security and communication heralds a future where chains don't function in silos.\n\nThe capacity for chains to share a core truth, eliminating redundant validations, suggests a streamlined and efficient future for blockchain networks. This could propel Superchain to be a cornerstone in the evolving decentralized digital landscape."

        "content": "DISCLAIMER: This article is a SPONSORED Press Release and does not constitute Finbold's editorial content nor undergo monitoring. Crypto assets/products involve significant risks. Do not invest unless you are prepared to lose your entire investment. For a full disclaimer, please click here.\n\nIn the constantly evolving landscape of digital assets, investor migration patterns often reveal the next big trend. Recently, a new contender has emerged on the horizon: Everlodge (ELDG). Notably, Everlodge is currently running a presale event, with Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) holders jumping in to secure their early access. Let\u2019s take a look at what could be driving the investor migration toward this crypto newcomer.\n\nJoin the Everlodge presale and win a luxury holiday to the Maldives\n\nEverlodge (ELDG): Huge Presale Opportunity for Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) Holders\n\nEverlodge is leading the charge as the first-ever platform to combine the allure of fractional vacation property ownership, timeshares, and the technological prowess of NFTs. Its unique approach is democratizing luxury property investments \u2013 from upscale hotels to exquisite villas \u2013 all built on a transparent blockchain framework.\n\nThe mechanism is straightforward: Properties are converted into digital tokens or NFTs. These tokens, encoded with intricate property details in their smart contracts, are then subdivided. This means users have the flexibility to invest in portions rather than the whole, and as the tangible property appreciates, the NFT\u2019s worth mirrors this ascent.\n\nA standout feature in Everlodge\u2019s holistic ecosystem is the Rewards Club. Within this system, members amass complimentary stays, redeemable at any property listed on Everlodge, further solidifying the platform\u2019s value proposition.\n\nCentral to the operations and benefits of Everlodge is the ELDG token. This native currency streamlines various platform functionalities and stands as a testament to the holder\u2019s stake. Advantages for ELDG token owners range from slashed property purchase rates to the promise of steady income via staking, not to mention the attractive loyalty incentives.\n\nAs of now, there\u2019s a window of opportunity with ELDG tokens priced enticingly at $0.010 during the first stage of the presale. However, with each ensuing phase, the price is destined to inch upward, emphasizing the benefits of early engagement.\n\nThe buzz around Everlodge isn\u2019t just smoke and mirrors. Predictions from industry insiders hint at a staggering 280% price leap during the presale alone, with prospects of a 30-fold jump when the platform officially kicks off.\n\nEthereum (ETH): Rumored ETFs and the $2,000 Resistance\n\nEthereum, the leading smart contract platform, is gaining traction among big financial players due to rumors of a potential Blackrock-endorsed ETF. This renewed interest is amplifying Ethereum\u2019s already significant presence in the market.\n\nThe solid foundation built around Ethereum is evident from its impressive $26 billion Total Value Locked (TVL). This figure highlights the growing appetite for DeFi services anchored on the Ethereum network.\n\nAt present, all eyes are on Ethereum\u2019s impending challenge of the pivotal $1,920 \u2013 $2,000 resistance bracket. A successful breach of this threshold could potentially ignite a powerful surge, catapulting Ethereum to as high as $10,000, according to some market analysts.\n\nSuch a rally would yield a substantial 5x return for Ethereum enthusiasts. While this projection offers a promising ROI for those backing the Ethereum Foundation, it\u2019s worth noting that returns like this might still be overshadowed by the potential profits awaiting early backers of Everlodge.\n\nSolana (SOL): The Significance of the $25 Support Level\n\nOnce hailed for its game-changing potential in the layer-1 market, Solana has been navigating rough waters lately. Despite showing signs of recovery in 2023, the predominant trend has been bearish for Solana over the past few years.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, Solana recently broke out from the symmetrical triangle pattern, briefly soaring from $18.70 to $32 within a week. However, this optimism was short-lived as the Solana price quickly corrected back to $22.\n\nWhat\u2019s more concerning for Solana holders is that this correction saw the asset fall below the $25 support level. This shows serious weakness in the underlying support for Solana and could be a sign of far worse to come.\n\nSolana holders are now taking advantage of this moderate price pump by selling their positions and investing in Everlodge\u2019s ELDG token instead. While Solana could still break out above resistance, Everlodge has a clear path to success and a huge potential for growth that Solana simply can\u2019t match.\n\nFind out more about the Everlodge (ELDG) Presale\n\nWebsite: https://www.everlodge.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/everlodge"

        "title": "Layer-1 And Layer-2 Blockchain Scaling Solutions, Explained - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nLayer-1 scaling solutions involve enhancing the base protocol of the blockchain to accommodate a higher number of transactions per second.\n\nImplementing layer-1 solutions often necessitates significant network-wide upgrades or even hard forks, which can lead to community discussions and potential splits in the blockchain.\n\nWhile increasing scalability, layer-1 solutions aim to maintain the core security and consensus mechanisms of the blockchain, ensuring the decentralized nature of the network.\n\nEthereum\u2019s consensus layer upgrade, incorporating Proof of Stake and shard chains, serves as a prominent example of a layer-1 scaling solution in progress.\n\nDue to the complexity of implementing changes at the protocol level, layer-1 solutions generally require longer development cycles and thorough testing before deployment.\n\nLayer-2 scaling solutions focus on processing transactions off the main blockchain, aiming to alleviate congestion and reduce transaction fees.\n\nThe key advantages of layer-2 solutions lie in their ability to offer rapid transaction processing and cost-efficient transactions compared to layer-1 solutions.\n\nHowever, achieving scalability through layer-2 solutions can sometimes involve trade-offs between security and scalability, requiring careful consideration and design.\n\nProminent layer-2 solutions include the Lightning Network for Bitcoin and Plasma for Ethereum, both of which aim to enhance scalability and improve transaction speed.\n\nAnother interesting aspect of layer-2 solutions is their potential for interoperability, allowing them to function across multiple blockchains and further enhancing the overall scalability of the ecosystem.\n\nWhat Are Blockchain Scaling Solutions?\n\nBlockchain scaling solutions are strategies and tactics created to increase the performance and scalability of blockchain networks. They solve the built-in drawbacks of conventional blockchains, such as their inefficient transaction processing, exorbitant fees, and low throughput. With the help of these technologies, blockchain networks should be able to process more transactions per second (TPS) while experiencing less congestion.\n\nLayer-1 (L1) scaling, which modifies the underlying blockchain protocol, and layer-2 (L2) scaling, which adds additional frameworks or protocols on top of the base layer to offload transactions and increase scalability, are two examples of common scaling solutions. These solutions strive to maintain the security and decentralization of the underlying technology while improving the performance, scalability, and user experience of blockchains.\n\nSharding, switching to a more effective consensus mechanism like Proof-of-Stake (PoS), or making other architectural changes are examples of L1 solutions. Higher transaction throughput and lower latency are the goals of these changes at the blockchain\u2019s foundation layer.\n\nLayer-2 solutions, like payment channels and sidechains, enable quicker and more scalable transactions while using the security and decentralization of the underlying blockchain.\n\nFurthermore, L1 and L2 solutions are implemented to overcome the trilemma, boost scalability, and preserve security and decentralization. The blockchain trilemma exists as a fundamental challenge in blockchain technology. The inherent trade-offs between scalability, security, and decentralization define the trilemma. These trade-offs result from the underlying architecture and design decisions made when developing blockchain technology.\n\nScalability Trade-Off\n\nHigh scalability demands the capacity to handle a huge volume of transactions in a timely and effective manner. However, as more transactions are made, the blockchain gets larger, creating problems with storage and bandwidth.\n\nFurthermore, it takes more time and resources to reach consensus among a large number of nodes. Trade-offs must be made, such as giving up some security or decentralization, in order to offset these problems.\n\nSecurity Trade-Off\n\nBlockchain networks use techniques like distributed validation, cryptographic hashing, and consensus methods to maintain security. But when scalability rises, maintaining strong security becomes more difficult.\n\nFor instance, scalability improvements like increasing block size or speeding up block confirmation times may result in weaknesses like a higher likelihood of forks or double-spending attacks. As a result, achieving a high level of security frequently necessitates sacrificing decentralization or scalability.\n\nDecentralization Trade-Off\n\nA fundamental tenet of blockchain technology is decentralization, which makes sure that no single party has control over the network. It encourages distrust and resistance to assaults or restrictions.\n\nHowever, maintaining decentralization while reaching great scalability can be difficult. Implementing techniques like sharding or off-chain processing (which will be explained at later stages in the article) to increase scalability frequently has an impact on the degree of decentralization.\n\nNevertheless, the fundamental idea of decentralization may be undermined if a limited number of businesses control transaction processing or block validation. The intricate problem that the blockchain community faces is highlighted by this fine line between achieving amazing scalability and maintaining the fundamentals of decentralization.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Scalability Challenges And Metrics\n\nThe dominance of Bitcoin in the cryptocurrency realm has brought to light the pressing issue of blockchain scalability. Throughput and latency significantly impact user experience quality (QoE), making them pivotal performance indicators.\n\nTransaction Throughput And Its Constraints\n\nTransaction throughput is a key concern. Bitcoin\u2019s highest transaction throughput is reported at 7 TPS, a big contrast to Visa\u2019s capability of over 4000 TPS. This difference highlights Bitcoin\u2019s limited capacity in accommodating larger trading volume.\n\nIn theory, transaction throughput hinges on the block interval and size. While a larger block increases throughput by accommodating more transactions, it simultaneously elongates block propagation time.\n\nOptimal configuration of block size and average block interval is around 1 MB and takes 10 minutes respectively for the Bitcoin network to confirm. Bitcoin aims to ensure adequate block propagation across the network. Yet, as block sizes increase to enhance throughput, system-wide bandwidth limitations act as a performance bottleneck, influencing blockchain efficiency.\n\nTransaction Confirmation Latency And User Experience\n\nTransaction confirmation latency, representing the time taken for a transaction to be confirmed, is another pivotal metric closely tied to user experience. With the surge in Bitcoin transactions, block size limitations hinder the inclusion of all submitted transactions. Miners, therefore, prioritize high-fee transactions, leading to extended latency for transactions with lower bids.\n\nKey Lessons: Bitcoin Data Processing Times\n\nIn essence, the capacity of Bitcoin to process transactions is contingent upon the size and frequency of transaction blocks. Larger blocks have a higher transaction capacity, albeit with longer confirmation times. To strike a balance, Bitcoin aims for blocks of approximately 1 megabyte in size, with a new block being appended to the blockchain every 10 minutes. This strategy aids in the even distribution of transaction processing.\n\nHowever, as Bitcoin tries to handle more transactions at once by making the blocks bigger, it hits a limit on how much data can be sent through the Bitcoin network at once, making transaction confirmation slower and less efficient.\n\nUnderstanding The Layers Of Blockchain Architecture To Address Scalability\n\nIn the context of addressing the scalability challenges of blockchain technology, the existing solutions can be grouped into two distinct layers: layer-1 and layer-2.\n\nLayer-1\n\nLayer-1 primarily focuses on improving scalability addressing issues related to consensus mechanisms, network infrastructure, and the fundamental data structure of the blockchain. These improvements are implemented directly within the main on-chain blockchain framework.\n\nLayer-2\n\nLayer-2 adopts a different route to scalability by employing off-chain methods. These methods include utilizing off-chain channels, side-chains, and cross-chain protocols to enable the blockchain to scale out more effectively.\n\nDeep Dive On Layer-1: On-Chain Scaling Solutions\n\nOn-chain scaling solutions, sometimes referred to as layer-1 scaling solutions, are techniques used to boost the efficiency and capacity of the underlying blockchain network. These solutions concentrate on enhancing the blockchain\u2019s basic layer, which comprises the fundamental protocol and consensus mechanism.\n\nTo encourage wider adoption and handle rising transaction volumes, it is necessary to overcome the scalability restrictions of blockchain networks, such as low transaction throughput and high latency. layer-1 solutions attempt to increase the network\u2019s capacity, speed, and overall performance by strengthening the base layer.\n\n1.0 Segregated Witness (SegWit)\n\nWorking Principle Of Segregated Witness (SegWit)\n\nSegregated Witness (SegWit) was introduced in August 2017 as a soft fork to enhance Bitcoin\u2019s efficiency by splitting transactions into two parts and removing unnecessary information. This removed information refers to the transaction signatures, also known as witness data, which are a part of Bitcoin transactions.\n\nBenefits of the SegWit\n\nImproved space efficiency: Transaction signatures can be quite large and occupy significant space in each block. SegWit helps scale the blockchain throughput by separating transaction signatures from the rest of the transaction data, storing them in a distinct structure known as the Witness structure.\n\nEfficient verification: With SegWit, only essential parts of a transaction are included in the main blockchain, while witness data is stored more efficiently. This streamlined verification process ensures that accidental changes to transactions are prevented.\n\nSmaller transaction records: By implementing SegWit, the overall size of Bitcoin\u2019s transaction records is reduced. This makes the blockchain\u2019s history of transactions more compact and manageable.\n\n2.0 Case Study On Increasing The Block Size: Hard Fork Of Bitcoin Blockchain To Bitcoin Cash\n\nCase Study Of Bitcoin Cash\n\nIn 2017, due to scalability concerns, Bitcoin encountered a hard fork resulting in a division into two blockchain branches: Bitcoin and Bitcoin-Cash, where Bitcoin-Cash opted to increase its block size to 8MB, a significant jump from Bitcoins 1MB version.\n\nAs Bitcoin Cash increased the block size to 32MB, despite these adjustments, the blockchain still kept the original 10-minute block time. In theory, this enhances transaction capacity, however, issues arise when trying to solve scalability by enlarging the block size. As the block size in MB increases, challenges emerge from both theoretical and practical standpoints.\n\nAs the continual expansion inflates block sizes, making transfer challenging due to intra-blockchain bandwidth limitations. These larger blocks trigger centralization concerns. As individual users struggle to efficiently propagate blocks and verify numerous transactions within a set timeframe, this situation may ultimately lead to a scenario where only a centralized entity can function as a full node.\n\nDrawbacks of Bitcoin Cash\n\nThe Bitcoin Cash hardfork presented several drawbacks:\n\nIntra-blockchain bandwidth constraints : As block sizes kept inflating, it made transfers challenging due to intra-blockchain bandwidth limitations. These larger blocks trigger centralization concerns.\n\nCentralization concerns : The enlargement of block sizes raised concerns about centralization, as individual users struggled to efficiently propagate larger blocks and validate numerous transactions in a timely manner.\n\nPotential full node centralization : The culmination of these challenges could potentially lead to a scenario where only a centralized entity could feasibly function as a full node, contradicting the decentralized ethos of blockchain technology.\n\n3.0 Block Compression: TXID\n\nWorking Principle Of Txilm\n\nTxilm, protocol based on BIP-152 employs a unique approach to enhance the efficiency of transactions within the blockchain. BIP-152 compresses transactions in each block to save the network\u2019s bandwidth. It is achieved by utilizing shortened codes to represent individual transactions. This technique not only conserves space but also improves the overall efficiency of data storage within blocks.\n\nThe core idea is to reduce the amount of data required for transmitting transactions across the network.\n\nBenefits Of Txilm\n\nSignificant reduction in data footprint: The reduction in data footprint contributes to more efficient data transmission across the blockchain network.\n\nOptimized data storage within blocks: The use of shorter codes for transactions allows more transactions to be accommodated in each block.\n\nClever \u201cSALT\u201d codes: To prevent potential conflicts arising from identical short codes, Txilm introduces extra information called \u201cSALT\u201d code which ensures that each transaction remains unique and distinguishable.\n\nEmpirical evidence: Txilm\u2019s implementation has showcased the reduction of data usage by up to 80 times improving efficiency gains and highlighting its real-world advantages in terms of data efficiency and network performance.\n\n4.0 Storage Scheme Optimization\n\nCUB\n\nConsensus-unit based (CUB) introduces an innovative strategy by grouping nodes into Consensus Units. Each unit is responsible for storing specific block data segments. To better understand, one may think of \u2018grouping nodes\u2019 as people and \u2018Consensus Units\u2019 as teams, where each unit is responsible for storing specific parts of the blockchain data puzzle sections. Each node in the consensus unit or team has a specific section of the blockchain data puzzle to work on.\n\nInstead of everyone working on the same blockchain puzzle together, which slows down the process, the blockchain puzzle gets divided into smaller parts and each person or node is assigned what to work on.\n\nCUB optimizes the way data is stored and accessed, which helps reduce storage costs and makes the blockchain system work faster and more effectively.\n\nLayer-1: Scaling Mechanisms\n\nThis section discusses different scaling methods of blockchain and some optimizations proposed to improve the scalability of blockchain:\n\nSharding\n\nWorking Principle of Sharding\n\nThe primary concept of sharding involves breaking down a large and complex network into smaller, manageable segments called \u201cshards.\u201d Each shard operates independently as a subset of the larger network. This technique, initially designed to enhance the efficiency of extensive business databases, segments data within sizable databases into fragments stored across separate servers.\n\nBy doing so, it alleviates the load on a central server, resulting in improved search speed and expanded storage capability for the entire database system.In the context of blockchains, sharding involves dividing a blockchain network into multiple shards, where each shard functions as its own mini-blockchain.\n\nBenefits Of Sharding\n\nImproved scalability: Sharding enables handling more transactions via parallel processing.\n\nFaster transaction processing: Transactions can be processed simultaneously in separate shards.\n\nEnhanced network performance: Sharding reduces congestion and boosts overall speed.\n\nHorizontal scaling: Sharding allows a network to grow by adding more shards.\n\nEfficient resource usage: Each shard can work on its transactions without affecting others.\n\nDrawbacks Of Sharding:\n\nCross-Shard communication costs: Cross-shard transactions can lead to higher communication costs and slower confirmation times.\n\nTransaction placement complexity: Properly assigning transactions to shards requires balancing factors like shard distribution and cross-shard transaction volume.\n\nProtocol limitations: Some sharding protocols, like Elastico, have specific drawbacks: Frequent identity and committee generation: Frequent operations may affect transaction efficiency. Inefficient transaction execution: Transaction processing might not be optimized. Cross-shard transaction atomicity: Ensuring the consistency of cross-shard transactions can be challenging.\n\n\n\nDelegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)\n\nIn DPoS, a small group of elected delegates are responsible for creating and validating blocks unlike traditional proof-of-stake (PoS). Blockchains like Tron and EOS use this method for salability purposes.\n\nDPoS works in two main steps. First, token holders in the network vote for the delegates they trust to create blocks. The top 21 delegates with the most votes then become the block producers. This way, the network lets those who hold tokens choose trustworthy delegates who can help the blockchain work well.\n\nWhen a delegate creates a block, it\u2019s checked by other delegates. If at least 15 out of the 21 top delegates agree, the block is confirmed. This voting process keeps going, and if a delegate doesn\u2019t do their job (create a block) for a day, they are replaced by someone else. Also, if a delegate doesn\u2019t do well in the past, they have a lower chance of being picked in the future. This whole system helps keep the blockchain secure and efficient.\n\nBenefits of DPoS:\n\nSpeed and scalability: DPoS can process transactions faster compared to other consensus mechanisms like proof-of work (PoW) or PoS. The smaller group of elected delegates can make decisions more quickly.\n\nEnergy efficiency: DPoS is more energy-efficient than Bitcoins PoW, as it doesn\u2019t require the massive computational power needed for solving complex puzzles.\n\nDecentralization: While DPoS involves a smaller group of delegates, it can still maintain a degree of decentralization, as token holders participate in choosing these delegates.\n\nSecurity: The continuous voting and verification process helps ensure that only trustworthy delegates are chosen, making the network more secure against attacks.\n\nGovernance: DPoS systems often allow token holders to have a say in the development and direction of the blockchain by voting for delegates. This can lead to more community involvement and decisions.\n\nDrawbacks of the DPoS:\n\nCentralization concerns: While DPoS is more decentralized than traditional systems like PoW, the power is still concentrated among a relatively small number of delegates. This can lead to centralization risks if a few powerful delegates collude or control a majority of the network.\n\nVulnerability to vote buying: In some cases, delegates may try to buy votes or offer rewards to token holders in exchange for their votes, which could undermine the fairness of the system.\n\nReduced security under certain conditions: DPoS systems might be more vulnerable to attacks if a majority of delegates become malicious or compromised, as they control the consensus process.\n\nLimited participation: Token holders who have a small number of tokens might have less influence in the voting process compared to those with more tokens, leading to potential inequality in decision-making.\n\nNetwork reliability: DPoS systems heavily rely on the availability and honesty of elected delegates. If a delegate goes offline or behaves dishonestly, it can impact the overall network performance.\n\nUnderstanding Layer-2 Scaling Solutions\n\nNow, let\u2019s picture layer-1 as a bustling highway, occasionally bogged down by excessive transactions, akin to too many cars on the road. layer-2, on the other hand, is akin to constructing an exclusive express lane positioned above the highway, designed exclusively for the swiftest vehicles. These vehicles navigate without hindrance, evading congestion and facilitating an expedited journey overall.\n\nLayer-2 offers a shortcut for transactions as it takes some transactions away from the main road (layer-1) and processes them separately. This way, the main road doesn\u2019t get clogged up, and everyone can complete their transactions faster.\n\nAs Bitcoins projected limit of 21 million BTC approaches experts are concerned about potential security vulnerabilities. For instance, after the 21 million limit is attained, miners\u2019 validation motivation will shift entirely from newly created coins to transaction fees. This scenario could lead to transaction fees becoming high or security significantly compromised.\n\nAmidst these apprehensions, a set of innovative solutions known as layer-2 technologies\u201d have emerged. These technologies offer a distinct approach to enhance blockchain functionality without altering the core protocol. Rather than modifying the fundamental blockchain protocol at layer-1 level, these technologies will interface with the primary infrastructure.\n\nTheir primary function involves leveraging the underlying blockchain to cryptographically validate entire groups of transactions as a single settlement. An advantage of layer-2 technology is the potential to enhance scalability and preserve the security strengths inherent to the blockchain.\n\nLayer-2 technology has been proposed as a means to segregate transaction settlement and validation processes, where a promising path may be laid out in maintaining security integrity while significantly boosting blockchain scalability.\n\nTypes of Layer-2 Scaling Solutions For The Bitcoin Blockchain\n\n1.0 Payment Channels\n\nPayment channels are like having a tab at your favorite ice cream shop. Instead of paying for each scoop separately, you open a tab, have as many scoops as you want, and settle the bill later.\n\nPayment channels work similarly by letting people do lots of transactions without putting every single one on the main blockchain. The Lightning Network is a layer-2 scaling solution for the Bitcoin blockchain network, designed to enable faster and more cost-effective transactions by facilitating off-chain microtransactions.\n\nLightning Network\n\nThe Lightning Network is designed to facilitate fast and low-cost transactions by allowing users to create payment channels directly between themselves without the need to broadcast every transaction to the main blockchain.\n\nThese payment channels are like private channels between two parties and can be opened, closed, and maintained without needing to interact with the main blockchain for each transaction. This enables micropayments and increases the transaction throughput of the network.\n\nBenefits of the Lightning Network\n\nFast transactions: Transactions within payment channels are virtually instant.\n\nLow fees: Since transactions occur off-chain, the associated fees are significantly lower.\n\nScalability: The Lightning Network helps alleviate congestion on the main blockchain by handling a large number of transactions off-chain.\n\nMicropayments: The network enables microtransactions that were previously impractical due to high on-chain fees.\n\nDrawbacks of the Lightning Network:\n\nWallet complexity: Wallets can be more complex than traditional on-chain wallets , posing a challenge in finding user-friendly options that seamlessly integrate with the network.\n\nSecurity concerns: The need for payees to sign a recovery transaction and the requirement for a hot wallet, which could expose private keys in case of security breaches.\n\nChannel management: Channels require ongoing attention and may involve closing and reopening channels to maintain balance, potentially inconveniencing users who prefer a hands-off approach.\n\nLimited network coverage: Reliant on a network size and the channel availability. Users might resort to on-chain transactions if recipients lack network access or have limited channel capacity, removing the intended benefits.\n\n2.0 Sidechains\n\nSidechains serve as innovative solutions that expand functionality and scalability to blockchain systems. Imagine them as parallel tracks running alongside the main blockchain, each acting as a self-contained environment for conducting transactions and executing smart contracts.\n\nThese sidechains are interconnected but separate, allowing users to carry out specific activities without burdening the primary blockchain with every detail. This segregation enables faster and more efficient transactions, enhancing overall network performance.\n\nWhen necessary, the sidechains can communicate with the main chain, facilitating interoperability and ensuring that data can be securely shared between the two layers. This layer-2 architecture introduces flexibility, enabling blockchain networks to manage varying workloads and optimize resource allocation. They maintain integrity and security of the main blockchain.\n\nRootStock (RSK)\n\nRSK is a sidechain project that aims to bring smart contract functionality to the Bitcoin blockchain. It allows developers to build and deploy dApps on the RSK sidechain using Ethereum-compatible smart contracts.\n\nRSK uses a two-way peg to enable the movement of Bitcoin to the RSK sidechain. Bitcoin is locked on the Bitcoin blockchain, and an equivalent amount of Smart Bitcoin (RSK-BTC) is created on the RSK sidechain. RSK-BTC can be used within the RSK ecosystem for executing smart contracts and dApps.\n\nPegging-In (Moving Bitcoin to RSK)\n\nBitcoin holders begin by transferring their Bitcoins to a multisignature (multisig) address on the Bitcoin blockchain, acting as a secured vault for the bitcoins. Once deposited, a cryptographic\n\nSimplified Payment Verification (SPV) proof is generated to validate the bitcoin deposit on the Bitcoin blockchain. This SPV proof is transmitted to a bridge smart contract on the RSK sidechain, which verifies and acknowledges the deposit. In response, an equivalent amount of RBTC (RSK\u2019s native currency) is minted on the RSK sidechain, representing the pegged-in Bitcoin and becoming available for the user.\n\nPegging-Out (Moving RBTC back to Bitcoin)\n\nWhen users wish to move their RBTC back to the Bitcoin blockchain, they initiate a reverse process. They send their RBTC to a bridge smart contract on the RSK sidechain. The bridge smart contract confirms the transaction and produces an SPV proof for the RBTC transaction. This SPV proof is then forwarded to the Bitcoin blockchain, where it is verified to authorize the release of the initially pegged-in bitcoins\u2019 equivalent amount.\n\nRootStock (RSK) Benefits:\n\nCompatibility with Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts: RSK allows developers to send their Ethereum smart contracts onto its platform, increasing interoperability between the two ecosystems.\n\nImproved scalability for decentralized applications (dApps): RSK\u2019s sidechain architecture enhances scalability, enabling faster and more efficient execution of dApps compared to the main Bitcoin network.\n\nUtilizes Bitcoin\u2019s security through merged mining: RSK leverages Bitcoin miners\u2019 computational power, providing a high level of security and protection against potential attacks.\n\nSupports DeFi solutions and stateful smart contracts: RSK enables the creation of advanced decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and complex smart contracts that retain state, expanding the scope of possibilities.\n\nExpands Bitcoin\u2019s functionality without altering its core protocol: RSK\u2019s compatibility with Bitcoin allows for the development of new features and functionalities without modifying the underlying Bitcoin network.\n\nRootStock (RSK) Drawbacks:\n\nPotential centralization due to the federation of functionaries: RSK\u2019s reliance on a federation of functionaries for certain tasks could introduce centralization risks if not well-distributed or managed.\n\nRSK-BTC lacks the same security level as the Bitcoin network: While RSK benefits from merged mining with Bitcoin, its security may not match the robustness of the original Bitcoin blockchain due to differences in hashing power and network size.\n\n3.0 State Channels\n\nImagine you and your friend are playing a game, and you keep track of the score on a piece of paper. You only write down the final score when the game ends, instead of every single point. State channels work similarly by keeping track of lots of transactions off-chain and only record the final result on the main blockchain.\n\nThey allow users to conduct transactions and perform tasks independently, reducing congestion on the main blockchain while maintaining the ability to interact with it when needed. The Lightning Network serves as a real-world illustration of state channels in the Bitcoin network.\n\nBy establishing a multi-signature wallet on the Bitcoin blockchain, two parties open a payment channel, as explained above. The state of the channel can then be updated by them doing several transactions off-chain. Because they are not published on the main blockchain, these transactions are scalable and cost-effective.\n\nWhen they are done, the channel is closed, and the last state of the channel is stored on the Bitcoin blockchain. In this approach, many transactions take place off-chain, with only the opening and closing transactions being recorded on the main blockchain.\n\nA summary of the differences between sidechains and state channels can be found in the table below:\n\n4.0 Layer-2 Scaling Solutions For The Ethereum Blockchain\n\nEthereum and other Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-based blockchains have encountered a challenge with scalability. The limited processing capacity of these networks, coupled with the surging demand for decentralized applications, has resulted in elevated transaction fees and sluggish transaction processing times.\n\nHowever, a set of layer-2 scaling solutions has emerged to tackle these issues. In this piece, we will delve into these technologies and their transformative impact on EVM-based blockchains. These solutions leverage techniques such as state channels, sidechains, and rollups to enable swifter and more cost-effective transactions.\n\nPlasma\n\nPlasma, one of the prominent layer-2 scaling solutions, was initially conceptualized by Vitalik Buterin in 2017. This framework introduces the concept of \u201cchild\u201d chains, interconnected with the primary Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThese child chains have the capacity to process a substantial volume of transactions, periodically summarizing their state to the main chain. This approach effectively reduces the data load on the main chain, thereby lowering transaction fees and boosting network performance.\n\nBenefits Of Adopting Plasma As A Layer-2 Scaling Solution:\n\nScalability: Plasma chains significantly improve the scalability of Ethereum by enabling the execution of transactions off-chain while maintaining a connection to the Ethereum mainnet. This allows for a larger number of transactions to be processed compared to the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nReduced transaction fees: By offloading a significant portion of transactions to the Plasma chains, users can experience lower transaction fees since they are not competing with the congestion on the mainnet.\n\nFaster transaction processing: Since Plasma chains can process transactions off-chain, they can achieve faster transaction confirmation times compared to the Ethereum mainnet, where network congestion can cause delays.\n\nInteroperability: Plasma chains can be designed to focus on specific use cases or industries, enabling tailored solutions while still benefiting from the security of the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nDrawbacks Of Adopting Plasma As A Layer-2 Scaling Solution:\n\nSecurity and complexity: Plasma chains are more complex to implement and require careful design to ensure the security of the assets locked within them.\n\nLimited use cases: While they can offer increased throughput, they might not be optimized for executing more complex smart contracts or interactions.\n\nChallenges in implementation: Developing and deploying a secure Plasma chain can be challenging and resource-intensive.\n\nLimited decentralization: Depending on the design and architecture of the Plasma chain, there may be concerns about the level of decentralization achieved compared to the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nRollups\n\nRollups, another noteworthy layer-2 scaling solution, function as smart contracts that bundle multiple transactions into a single transaction, subsequently submitted to the primary chain. This aggregation significantly reduces the data volume on the main chain, leading to swifter transaction processing times.\n\nNotably, Rollups are categorized into two distinct types: Optimistic Rollups and ZK Rollups.\n\nOptimistic Rollups\n\nAre a type of layer-2 blockchain scaling solution that aims to improve scalability by processing transactions off-chain and then batching them for inclusion on the main Ethereum blockchain. In this approach, validators process transactions off-chain, and witnesses verify them before adding them to the main blockchain.\n\nZero Knowledge (ZK) Rollups\n\nFocusing on improving scalability and privacy, ZK Rollups utilize zero-knowledge proofs for secure and private transaction verification. A zero-knowledge proof is a cryptographic method that allows one party (the prover) to prove to another party (the verifier) that a statement is true without revealing any specific information about the statement itself.\n\nInstead of fully processing transactions off-chain like in Optimistic Rollups, ZK Rollups bundle transactions and then use zero-knowledge proofs to provide cryptographic evidence of their validity. This approach offers enhanced privacy while maintaining security, but it may come at the cost of slightly lower scalability compared to Optimistic Rollups.\n\nA summary of the differences between optimistic rollups and ZK rollups can be found in the table below:\n\nBenefits Of Adopting Rollups As A Layer-2 Scaling Solution:\n\nScalability: Provide a significant scalability boost aggregating multiple transactions into a single transaction that is submitted to the Ethereum mainnet. This reduces congestion on the mainnet and increases the number of transactions that can be processed.\n\nReduced gas fees: Help reduce gas fees for users by consolidating multiple transactions into a single one, making transactions more cost-effective and accessible.\n\nCompatibility with smart contracts: Capable of supporting smart contracts, making them suitable for a wider range of use cases beyond simple token transfers.\n\nEnhanced speed: Transaction processing times are improved since Rollups can process multiple transactions in a single batch, reducing the time required for individual transactions.\n\nDrawbacks Of Adopting Plasma As A Layer-2 Scaling Solution:\n\nData availability: Rollups rely on data availability and require users to monitor and ensure the availability of the necessary data to interact with the smart contracts on the mainnet.\n\nLatency for data availability: The need for data availability verification can introduce some latency between transaction submission and finality.\n\nDevelopment complexity: Implementing and integrating Rollup solutions can be complex due to the need for robust data availability mechanisms, compatibility with existing smart contracts, and security considerations.\n\nLimited decentralization: The degree of decentralization in Rollup solutions can vary, and some trade-offs may be made to achieve scalability and efficiency.\n\nComparison: Layer-1 Vs. Layer-2 Scaling Solutions\n\nLayer-1 and layer-2 scaling solutions represent two distinct approaches to addressing the scalability challenges of blockchain networks.\n\nLayer-1 Scaling Solutions\n\nLayer-1 scaling solutions focus on improving the base layer of a blockchain network. They involve making fundamental changes to the blockchain\u2019s protocol, consensus mechanism, or architecture to increase its capacity to handle more transactions per second (TPS).\n\nAdvantages Of Layer-1 Scaling\n\nSecurity and decentralization: Layer-1 blockchains, like Ethereum, are highly secure and decentralized due to their robust consensus mechanisms.\n\nFlexibility: Developers have direct access to the base layer, allowing for innovative features and functionalities.\n\nSelf-contained: Layer-1 scaling solutions do not require additional layers or systems for implementation.\n\nDisadvantages Of Layer-1 Scaling\n\nUpgrade challenges: Implementing changes at the base layer can be complex and may require community consensus.\n\nSlow development: Major upgrades may take time to develop, test, and deploy, causing delays in addressing scalability issues.\n\nRisk of centralization: Rapid protocol changes can lead to centralization if a small number of entities control significant portions of the network.\n\nLayer-2 Scaling Solutions\n\nLayer-2 scaling solutions work on top of existing blockchains (layer-1) and aim to increase throughput by moving some of the transaction processing off-chain. They include various techniques like payment & state channels, sidechains, rollups and plasma.\n\nAdvantages Of Layer-2 Scaling:\n\nScalability: Layer-2 solutions significantly increase the transaction throughput of the main blockchain.\n\nFast transactions: Off-chain processing allows for near-instantaneous transaction confirmation and settlement.\n\nCost efficiency: Reduced congestion on the main chain leads to lower transaction fees.\n\nDisadvantages Of Layer-2 Scaling:\n\nSecurity considerations: Layer-2 solutions rely on the security of the underlying layer-1 blockchain.\n\nInteroperability challenges: Interactions between different layer-2 solutions or between layer-2 and layer-1 can be complex.\n\nCentralization risk: Some layer-2 solutions might require trusted intermediaries, leading to potential centralization.\n\nIn summary, layer-1 scaling solutions involve making changes directly to the blockchain\u2019s protocol, while layer-2 solutions build on top of existing blockchains to improve scalability. Layer-1 solutions offer enhanced security and decentralization but may require longer development cycles.\n\nLayer-2 solutions focus on boosting transaction throughput and reducing fees, but may introduce security and centralization concerns. The choice between these approaches depends on the specific requirements and goals of the blockchain network.\n\nSummary of the differences between layer-1 and layer-2 scaling solutions can be found in the table below:\n\nPopular Blockchain Networks And Their Scaling Solutions\n\nSolana\n\nSolana is a high-performance blockchain platform renowned for its scalability and quick transaction processing. It makes use of innovative technologies such as Tower BFT consensus and PoH, which enable thousands of transactions per second at cheap costs. Its objectives are to enable dApps and promote a vibrant development and user ecosystem.\n\nSolana stands apart in the blockchain scene due to its distinctive scaling method, which makes use of a number of cutting-edge technologies to achieve high throughput and low latency.\n\nProof Of History (PoH)\n\nPoH is a cryptographic timestamping method that Solana uses to establish a historical record of all transactions on the blockchain. This saves time and resources by allowing nodes to confirm the timing and order of transactions without the need for recurrent consensus.\n\nTower BFT Consensus\n\nSolana uses a high-performance consensus technique called Tower BFT, which speeds up transaction finality and optimizes the block confirmation process. This guarantees speedy and secure confirmation of transactions.\n\nParallel Processing\n\nSolana uses a method called \u201cSealevel\u201d to process several transactions concurrently across various nodes. With thousands of transactions per second (TPS) possible because of its parallel processing capabilities, the network\u2019s transaction throughput greatly rises.\n\nSharding\n\nSolana employs a technique known as \u201cProof of Replication\u201d sharding to divide the network into smaller sections, or \u201cshards.\u201d The processing of individual transactions by each shard increases scalability and eases congestion.\n\nLow Transaction Fees\n\nCompared to certain other blockchain networks, Solana can handle a huge number of transactions with efficiency thanks to its high throughput characteristics.\n\nBenefits of Solana\u2019s scalability solutions\n\nSolana\u2019s scalability solutions offer:\n\nScalability: Solana is well suited for decentralized applications (dApps) with strict performance requirements because of its novel approach to scaling, which enables it to handle a large number of transactions per second.\n\nLow latency: Solana offers low transaction confirmation times thanks to its quick block confirmation times and finality, which improves the user experience and permits real-time interactions.\n\nCost-effectiveness: Solana is a cost-effective choice for users and developers, especially for applications that demand frequent transactions, because of its cheap transaction costs and high throughput.\n\nEcosystem development: Solana\u2019s scalability and efficiency draw developers and projects to its platform, enabling the growth of a robust dApp and DeFi ecosystem.\n\nCardano\n\nScalability is of utmost importance in the dynamic world of blockchain technology. The capacity of a blockchain network to handle an increasing number of transactions becomes crucial as more users and apps enter the market.\n\nA third-generation blockchain platform called Cardano has adopted a novel strategy for scalability, deliberately positioning itself within the layer-1 vs. layer-2 paradigm. The Ouroboros protocol, a ground-breaking invention created to overcome the shortcomings of current blockchain scalability approaches, is at the core of Cardano\u2019s scalability solution.\n\nCardano\u2019s Positioning In The Layer-1 vs. Layer-2 Paradigm\n\nWhether to grow a blockchain protocol\u2019s base layer or create other layers that function on top of the base layer is at the center of the argument between layer-1 and layer-2 solutions. Here\u2019s an overview of how Cardano aims to scale without sacrificing security and decentralization :\n\nOn-Chain Solutions\n\nBlock size increase: The transaction capacity has been increased by 12.5% (from 64KB to 72KB); further modifications are expected based on network performance.\n\nPipelining : Aiming for quicker block dissemination and enabling scalable updates, pipelining improves block propagation time by combining validation and propagation.\n\nInput endorsers: By grouping transactions into pre-built blocks, enhancing consistency, and allowing for larger transaction rates, input endorsers increase throughput.\n\nMemory/CPU efficiency: Optimizes the chain\u2019s use of memory for hash representation, stake distribution, live stake distribution, and processing of unspent transaction output (UTXO).\n\nPlutus script optimizations : Smart contract optimization includes reference inputs (CIP-0031) for input inspection without spending and Plutus Datums (CIP-0032) directly attached to outputs for simplified usage.\n\nNode enhancements : Improves stake and reward computations distribution, memory usage efficiency, and peak load management, boosting scalability.\n\nOn-disk storage : Storing parts of protocol state on disk reduces memory requirements, easing scalability bottlenecks, enabling greater blockchain state growth.\n\nOff-Chain Solutions\n\nSidechains: Sidechains are separate blockchains that are linked to the primary blockchain in a bidirectional manner. This allows for frictionless asset transfer between chains, increases flexibility, and supports a wide range of functions. A single main chain can support a variety of functionally separate, interoperable sidechains.\n\nHydra: Hydra introduces a collection of layer 2 protocols, such as isomorphic state channels, to increase throughput, decrease latency, cut costs, and reduce the amount of storage needed. By effectively processing transactions off-chain and using the main-chain ledger for secure settlements, Hydra remains a popular solution.\n\nOff-chain computing: Asynchronous Contract Execution (ACE), a type of computation that is off-chain, improves the performance of the core network. Through a trust paradigm, transactions can be quick and inexpensive while still taking place off-chain.\n\nMithril: It is critical to address the complexities of operations related to participant numbers logarithmically in order to increase scalability. Mithril improves chain synchronization while maintaining trust and bringing about effective multi-signature aggregation without jeopardizing security.\n\nEthereum\n\nThe dApp and smart contract revolution has been led by Ethereum, a ground-breaking blockchain platform. However, due to its quick growth, significant scalability issues with its initial design have come to light, mostly with the layer-1 protocol.\n\nBy creating a more scalable and effective architecture, the Ethereum consensus layer upgrade (The Merge), which took place in September 2022, hoped to overcome these issues. The Ethereum ecosystem has also adopted a number of layer-2 solutions to temporarily address the scaling difficulties while switching to PoS consensus mechanism to address scalability and energy related issues.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Layer-1 Scaling Challenges\n\nLayer-1, commonly referred to as the basic layer, of Ethereum had significant problems with scalability, transaction throughput, and network congestion.\n\nNetwork congestion: When there is a rush in demand, Ethereum\u2019s limited capacity for processing transactions is made clear by an increase in transaction fees, which makes the platform less usable for users and DApps.\n\nSlow transaction confirmation: Compared to conventional payment systems, Ethereum\u2019s Proof of Work (PoW) consensus process results in slower transaction confirmation times, which limits real-time use cases.\n\nHigh gas costs: During network congestion, gas costs, which users pay to perform transactions and deploy smart contracts, can soar to absurdly high levels that they negatively affect the user experience and deter modest transactions.\n\nScalability limitations: Due to its low throughput, Ethereum is unable to handle many concurrent transactions without experiencing delays and potential bottlenecks.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Transition To Proof-Of-Stake Consensus Method\n\nBy adopting the PoS mechanism in 2022, Ethereum undertook a substantial transformation that is credited with improving security, consuming less energy, and being better suited for the incorporation of novel scaling solutions.\n\nValidators are at the center of the proof-of-stake paradigm. Validators are in charge of processing transactions on the Ethereum network, acting similarly to miners in the proof-of-work model and significantly contributing to the network\u2019s security.\n\nBy staking (depositing) a minimum of 32 ETH into the designated contract, anyone can join the PoS network and become a validator. The protocol then uses a randomized method to choose participants for making suggestions for and casting votes against adding additional blocks to the chain.\n\nAn execution client, a consensus client, and the validator software itself are required to become validators on Ethereum. This extensive collection of tools works together to provide effective transaction validation and strong involvement in the PoS system.\n\nFurthermore, every 32 slots, or around 6.4 minutes, an epoch takes place in the context of Ethereum\u2019s PoS ecosystem. Each of these time slots designates a specific period of time for the committee of validators to carry out important tasks. These committees are made up of teams with at least 128 validators.\n\nAn epoch contains tasks like adding new blocks to the blockchain and voting on them to confirm their legality. The efficiency, consistency, and security of Ethereum\u2019s transaction validation process are optimized by this coordination of validator committees functioning within well specified epochs.\n\nEthereum\u2019s use of the PoS paradigm, which is intimately linked with the ideas of validators and epochs, underlines its dedication to developing the network\u2019s capabilities while upholding security, energy efficiency, and scalability standards. This change highlights both Ethereum\u2019s adaptability and endurance in the constantly changing world of blockchain and cryptocurrencies. It also represents technological advancement.\n\nLayer-2 Scaling Solutions On The Ethereum Blockchain\n\nThe constraints of the Ethereum blockchain\u2019s scalability have been addressed by layer-2 scaling solutions, which have emerged as a game-changing strategy. The ability of Ethereum to process a large number of transactions becomes increasingly important as its popularity grows. While preserving the security and decentralization that Ethereum is renowned for, layer-2 solutions present an inventive way to reduce congestion and improve efficiency.\n\nBy adding to the existing Ethereum blockchain, layer-2 scaling solutions essentially create supplementary layers that process a sizable amount of transactions off-chain. This tactic speeds up transaction processing while easing the load on the main Ethereum network. Optimism and Arbitrum are two well-known layer-2 solutions that have attracted attention.\n\nOptimism\n\nThe optimistic rollup method is employed by Optimism to increase Ethereum\u2019s scalability. In this approach, transactions are off-chain processed optimistically and combined into a single \u201crollup\u201d transaction that is regularly published to the Ethereum mainnet. Thus, Optimism drastically lowers the volume of transactions that are handled directly on-chain, resulting in lower fees and quicker confirmation times.\n\nThe interoperability of Optimism with current Ethereum smart contracts is one of its main features. With only a few adjustments, developers can migrate their contracts to the Optimism network. This function facilitates optimism\u2019s adoption and hastens its adoption within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nArbitrum\n\nAnother layer-2 solution that prioritizes a flawless user experience and improved scalability is Arbitrum. Arbitrum utilizes an optimistic rollup process, much like Optimism. Off-chain transaction processing is done, and it regularly sends compiled data to the Ethereum mainnet for verification. This procedure ensures that transaction integrity is upheld while easing network congestion.\n\nBy placing a strong emphasis on usability and interoperability, Arbitrum stands out. Developers can easily move their smart contracts to the Arbitrum network and take advantage of its scalability without making significant code revisions.\n\nA comparison summary table of summary of the differences between Bitcoin scaling solutions and Ethereum scaling solutions can be found in the table below:\n\nCan Bitcoin Scale Without Layer-2? A Future Outlook\n\nThe rapid expansion of Bitcoin\u2019s influence, from the emergence of applications for Bitcoin-based exchange-traded funds in the United States to El Salvador\u2019s acceptance of Bitcoin as legal tender, has amplified the demand for enhanced scalability within the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nAs mainstream adoption continues to surge, the need for solutions that can accommodate greater transactional capacity and efficiency becomes paramount. Adam Back, an eminent figure in the Bitcoin development community and the CEO of Blockstream, a prominent blockchain technology company, emphasizes the potential of layer-2 networks to address this challenge.\n\nLayer-2 Networks: Pioneering Scalability\n\nAs this article has outlined layer-2 networks represent a groundbreaking approach to scaling the Bitcoin blockchain. As mentioned earlier, the function as secondary protocols built on top of existing blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, these networks bear resemblance to the evolution of the internet\u2019s protocol stack. Which is a protocol that addresses the implementation of a computer networking protocol suite or protocol family.\n\nOne of the notable figures advocating for layer-2 solutions is Adam Back. As the CEO of Blockstream, a company deeply involved in blockchain technology and development, Back\u2019s insights into layer-2 technology hold significant weight.\n\nIn a video interview with YouTube channel Forkast News. News. Adam Back outlined the role of layer-2 networks in resolving the scalability issues faced by blockchain systems. He compared these networks to segments of transactional capacity optimized for specific use cases.\n\nBack mentioned that while it might be challenging for all potential Bitcoin users to directly conduct transactions on the main chain, layer-2 networks provide an alternative by enabling different use cases that can leverage Bitcoin in distinct ways. He emphasized that this approach enables the onboarding of more users while reducing the data load on the main chain. Back acknowledged that layer-2 networks involve certain trade-offs, but they offer assurances akin to those of the primary Bitcoin chain, recognizing that a single protocol cannot be universally optimal for all scenarios.\n\nLayer-2: Where Innovation Thrives\n\nThe concept of layer-2 networks gains prominence in the context of Bitcoin\u2019s development trajectory. The pace of upgrades to the Bitcoin network has been deliberate, with significant upgrades such as the SegWit soft fork in 2017 and the more recent Taproot upgrade in 2020. Given the measured and occasionally uneven pace of these upgrades, many innovative developments within the Bitcoin blockchain ecosystem have found their home in layer-2 solutions.\n\nDrawing a parallel with the internet\u2019s architecture, Back highlighted that while the core TCP/IP protocol has remained largely unchanged for decades, innovation has flourished in the layers above, particularly at the application layer. This architecture, Back explained, promotes robustness by allowing the best technology to evolve in the most flexible layers, similar to how layer-2 solutions are facilitating innovation while maintaining the integrity of the underlying blockchain.\n\nInsights And Perspectives\n\nAdam Back\u2019s views extend beyond the technical realm, encompassing the societal and economic impacts of Bitcoin\u2019s growing adoption. He envisions a scenario where the widespread adoption of Bitcoin could influence the valuation of traditional assets like stocks, real estate, gold, and artwork. The potential reduction in the monetary premium attached to these assets could have both positive and negative effects.\n\nWhile it might lead to more affordable real estate, it could also challenge the conventional methods of preserving value. He notes how El Salvador\u2019s adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender has led to remarkable progress in financial inclusion, with the number of Bitcoin wallet users surpassing the count of individual bank accounts within a short span.\n\nReflecting on the \u201cblock war\u201d of 2017, Back contends that the market ultimately determined the fate of competing blockchain forks, reinforcing the decentralized nature of the decision-making process.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Future Strategy\n\nTransitioning to proof-of-stake in 2022 marked a crucial move to prepare the Ethereum platform for the next phase of enhancements as explained by Vitalin Buterin during EthCC 2022, involving four pivotal upgrades known as Surge, Verge, Purge, and Splurge. Here\u2019s a concise overview:\n\nThe upcoming Surge upgrade introduces the concept of sharding, specifically Danksharding in Ethereum\u2019s case. Sharding partitions the network into separate sets of validators, simultaneously handling distinct transactions. Notably, Ethereum ensures communication between shards and the base layer, maintaining the network\u2019s unified truth source. This was unfeasible under proof-of-work, which requires every node to process and record each transaction, leading to inefficiencies. Ethereum\u2019s current capacity is around 15-20 transactions per second.\n\nSharding revolutionizes this scenario, drastically reducing data requirements for node maintenance\u2014from several gigabytes to a manageable level for phones or personal computers. Moreover, sharding facilitates the utilization of roll-ups. Roll-ups enable transactions to be bundled, cryptographically linked, and processed off-chain before being presented as a single entry to the network.\n\nVerkle trees, a commitment scheme similar to Merkle trees but with compact witnesses, will be made available through the Verge upgrade. Smaller node sizes and optimized storage are promised by this. By enabling block validation without keeping a copy of the whole blockchain history, verkle trees open the door for stateless clients. This represents a major step towards improved protocol decentralization.\n\nState expiry will be implemented in relation to the Perge upgrade. After this phase, Ethereum clients will destroy data that is older than a year. The difficulty comes in keeping old data after it has been thrown away. The mechanisms causing this are still unknown. The Perge enhances Ethereum in several ways:\n\nReduced hardware needs for nodes (less storage)\n\nDeletion of the legacy transaction-specific code\n\nClients sync less data, reducing the network\u2019s bandwidth use\n\nThe Splurge phase completes the blueprint for Ethereum\u2019s upgrading. It includes features that were not included in earlier releases. Timing and implementation specifics are scarce. According to Vitalik Buterin, The Splurge might be unneeded if Ethereum scales effectively with earlier releases.\n\nConclusion\n\nBlockchain scalability was always going to be a continuous challenge throughout the crypto space and is addressed through layer-1 and layer-2 scaling solutions. layer-1 solutions involve direct changes to blockchain protocols, while layer-2 solutions create parallel networks to offload transactions.

        "content": "The Ethereum cofounder transferred 600 ETH to Coinbase amid a week of negative price action for the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap.\n\nVitalik Buterin, the cofounder of Ethereum, deposited 600 ETH worth over $1 million to crypto exchange Coinbase on Monday, data from blockchain explorer Etherscan shows.\n\nThe tokens were sent from the wallet address labelled \u201cvitalik.eth,\u201d which currently still holds 3,993 ETH worth $6.5 million at current prices.\n\nButerin\u2019s transfer comes amid a week of volatility for ETH, which is down 10% over the last seven days. A sharp selloff late on Thursday last week saw crypto traders suffer $1 billion worth of liquidations, with ETH liquidations alone accounting for $302 million over 24 hours.\n\nBefore sending the 600 ETH to Coinbase, Buterin repaid 251,000 Rai Reflex Index (RAI) tokens on the Maker protocol and withdrew 1,000 ETH worth $1.67 million.\n\nAlthough several market participants speculated that Buterin sent the ETH to the crypto exchange to sell, the reason behind the transfer remains unknown. Over the last few years, however, Buterin has sold ETH after similar transfers to crypto exchanges, along with other lesser known tokens that people have sent to his wallet.\n\nIn fact, earlier this year, Buterin moved $3.6 million ETH to crypto exchanges Kraken, Gemini and Coinbase, according to data from Arkham. Incidentally, the timing of these transfers also coincided with a drop in ETH\u2019s price.\n\nOn Sunday, another Ethereum wallet address which had acquired ETH during the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in 2014, moved 191 ETH worth around $320,000 to another address after more than eight years of leaving it untouched."

        "content": "Mon 21 Aug 2023 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Fenelon L.\n\nOver the past week, the crypto market has suffered a significant fall, affecting all assets. The flagship altcoin, Ether, recorded a 10.31% drop on Thursday. Nevertheless, a clever whale managed to dodge the turbulence by liquidating a significant amount of ETH just before the crash.\n\nThe Ethereum whale\u2019s winning strategy: Anticipation before the storm\n\nLast week saw a violent upheaval on the crypto market. The widespread crash resulted in a loss of around $1 billion of the market\u2019s total capitalization. This tumultuous episode was largely triggered by SpaceX\u2019s decision to liquidate its Bitcoin (BTC) holdings, worth an estimated $373 million.\n\nHowever, this news had a snowball effect, leading to a massive sell-off and causing a 12% reduction in the price of Bitcoin, in turn leading to a series of declines for ETH and other cryptos.\n\nFor example, ETH fell from $1,808 to $1,615. This trend was accentuated by the largest single liquidation on the ETH market, reaching almost $55.92 million in a single day. In total, liquidations on the ETH market reached some $308 million.\n\nIn the midst of all this turmoil, however, one Ethereum whale demonstrated a noteworthy strategic decision. According to Lookonchain, it sold 22,341 ETH worth around $41 million just before the market slowdown.\n\nThe whale was very smart and dumped 22,341 $ETH ($41M) before the market crashed.\n\n\n\nEven though he lost ~$1.7M this time, he successfully avoided the market crash.\n\n\n\nPerhaps he will buy $ETH back at a cheaper price in the future.\n\n\n\nFollow this smart whale.\ud83d\udc47https://t.co/S4Wv8XRlhW pic.twitter.com/BcdzdpmbIA \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) August 18, 2023\n\nThis initiative was hailed by the analysis team as a smart move. Although it recorded losses of around $1.7 million, the stock managed to mitigate the effects of the widespread crash.\n\nDespite recent setbacks, Ethereum\u2019s prospects are bright. The coming months look set to be good ones, buoyed by developments linked to Ether-futures ETFs in the USA. Indeed, the US SEC is preparing to approve the first Ether-future ETF on US territory.\n\nSeveral asset managers, such as Bitwise, ProShares, Grayscale, VanEck, and Valkyrie, have submitted applications to offer Ether-futures ETFs to US investors. Sources indicate that most of these applications could receive approval by October.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "Bitcoin dropped during the early trading session on Monday, while other top crypto assets were trading mixed. Bitcoin posted its worst weekly decline since the FTX crash in November 2022. The court battle between Grayscale and US regulators weighed on the crypto prices, while traders will be looking at macroeconomic cues due later this week.\n\n\n\nBitcoin continued to remain under selling pressure as the largest crypto token dropped further but managed barely to hold above $26,000-levels. Its largest peer, Ethereum, gained about half-a-per cent to hold above $1,675-mark. Price action in the altcoins was on the mixed side.\n\n\n\nBitcoin is currently priced around the $26,000 level. This may be because of widespread token selling by traders spurred by unrelated triggers like a lack of clarity in the Grayscale versus US SEC case for a Bitcoin ETF, SpaceX writing down the value of their Bitcoin reserves, and China\u2019s Evergrande group filing for bankruptcy, said Edul Patel,Co-Founder & CEO at Mudrex.\n\n\n\n\"Meanwhile, Ethereum is maintaining a position above $1,600. Over the past 24 hours, altcoins Ripple, Litecoin, and Stellar have each grown in value by more than 3 per cent,\" he said.\n\n\n\nAll other top crypto tokens were trading mixed on Monday. Among the gainers, Litecoin surged more than 3 per cent, followed by XRP with posted similar gains. Tron and Toncoin gained as much as 2 per cent each. Among the losers, Solana and Shiba Inu shed 2 per cent each, while Dogecoin was down a per cent.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading flat, slightly up to $1.06 trillion-mark as it inched up less than half-a-per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes dropped almost 9 per cent to $22.04 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\nTech View by Giottus Crypto Platform\n\nCardano (ADA),trading at $0.27, is currently trying to reverse its decline from last week's decline. ADA managed to regain some of its losses over the weekend and is attempting a breakout from descending wedge. Its RSI levels (currently at 38) display positive divergence within the falling wedge pattern, which may increase the chances of a bullish reversal leading to an upside breakout.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe token can have a rally if it manages to break the key resistance level of $0.30 (its 50-day EMA). On the flip side, $0.23 is likely to be a strong support zone.\n\n\n\nMajor Levels:\n\nSupport: $0.25, $0.23\n\nResistance: $0.30, $0.32\n\n\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

This buyer congestion remains critical for the resumption of the uptrend, even as Ethereum dodders at $1,664.\n\nETH Price On The Cusp Of Another 17% Sell-Off\n\nEthereum has from April, following the Shapella upgrade rally to the 2023 highs of $2,144, been facing a weakening market structure. The tug of war between bulls and bears confined Ether in a rectangle pattern, with resistance at $2,000 and support at $1,650 \u2013 call it consolidation.\n\nWithin the rectangle, a narrow range formed with Ethereum holding onto higher support at $1,800. Following, the losses incurred last week, ETH price now faces a crossroads:\n\nA break below the rectangle support at $1,650 could trigger another breakdown, where Ethereum may drop 17.76% to $1,56. On the other side of the fence, if this support holds, bulls will likely be encouraged to double down their efforts and push for a breakout above $2,000.\n\nIn the short term, the outcome is likely to be bearish based on the outlook exhibited by the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator as it moves further below the mean line (0.00).\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI), although in a sustained downtrend from the overbought region in early July, is not quite oversold. This suggests that sellers still have room to wiggle, pushing the price further down.\n\nUncertainty About the SEC\u2019s Spot ETF Approval Dampens Crypto Markets\n\nInvestors are jittery when it comes to seeking more exposure to crypto products, as revealed by CoinShares\u2019 digital asset investment products report.\n\nDigital asset investment products recorded outflows of up to $55 million last week compared to $29 million in fund inflows in the previous week.\n\nAlthough the market-wide sell-off may have contributed to the dismal numbers in digital asset investment products, the CoinShares report argued that it may be attributed to a \u201creaction to recent media highlighting that a decision by the US Securities & Exchange Commission in allowing a US spot-based ETF is not imminent.\u201d\n\nAccording to John Reed, a former SEC attorney, the SEC is unlikely to approve a spot ETF. Reed cited insights from Better Markets who wrote a letter to the SEC urging the agency not to approve any spot ETFs.\n\nWill the SEC Approve Any Of The Recent Bitcoin Spot ETF Applications? People often ask for my opinion on whether the SEC will approve any of the recent spate of bitcoin spot ETF applications, which is an interesting and important question. My take is that the current SEC will\u2026 pic.twitter.com/lPXebl03Y4 \u2014 John Reed Stark (@JohnReedStark) August 13, 2023\n\nAlthough Bitcoin was the most hit by the uncertainty surrounding the ETF approval, Ethereum saw $9 million in outflows, which erased the $2.5 million it recorded in the week before.\n\nCrypto markets are likely to remain in this dilapidated environment, especially with the Federal Reserve considering more rate hikes in September.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "content": "The transfer of ETH by Buterin or the Ethereum Foundation is usually followed by a fall in ETH\u2019s price.\n\nThere is a possibility of Buterin going for a massive selloff.\n\nEthereum [ETH] co-founder Vitalik Buterin transferred 600 ETH worth $1 million to crypto exchange Coinbase [COIN] on 21 August.\n\nOn 20 August, Buterin had repaid 251,000 RAI and withdrew $1.6 million in ETH. RAI is an ETH-backed non-pegged stablecoin.\n\nThe move is surprising as the crypto market is witnessing a major slowdown again. The prices of Bitcoin [BTC] and ETH declined by more than 10% over the last week. At press time, BTC was trading at a little above $25,900 and ETH was trading at a little above $1,650.\n\nWhat the Ethereum transfer means amidst a bearish market\u2026\n\nThe transfer of ETH tokens by Vitalik Buterin or the Ethereum Foundation is usually followed by a fall in ETH\u2019s price. While we are yet to know the reason behind the recent transfer, there is a possibility of Buterin committing to another massive selloff. However, there is also the possibility of him making the transfer for a single-time sale only. Social media is rife with speculations.\n\nAnalysts and market experts now predict that Ethereum will tumble dramatically if its value falls below the key support level of $1,550-$1,600. The total market cap of the crypto industry fell more than 10% over the last seven days. At press time, the total crypto market cap stood at $1.05 trillion.\n\nAs far as Coinbase is concerned, it was facing regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. at the hands of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In early June, the regulator sued the exchange for allegedly violating securities law by acting as an unregistered broker-dealer.\n\nMeanwhile, COIN\u2019s value on Nasdaq fell nearly 9% over the last week. At press time, it was trading at $73.9."

        "content": "Investors continued to accumulate more ETH as its supply outside of exchanges increased.\n\nXRP was up by more than 4% in the last 24 hours, and a few metrics were bullish.\n\nOver the last few days, the crypto market has witnessed a massive downfall. This caused most cryptos to shed their values by nearly double digits, including Ripple [XRP] and Ethereum [ETH]. While the market remained under bears\u2019 influence, it has opened the right opportunity for investors to increase their accumulation.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nInterestingly, the latest data suggested that most altcoins were in the underbought zone, which can cause an uptick in buying pressure, in turn, changing the market condition around.\n\nA massive price correction\n\nThough there might have been multiple factors at play that caused the entire market to turn red, a major reason might have been SpaceX\u2019s dump of Bitcoin [BTC] worth millions of dollars. Thanks to this, Ethereum went under the $1,600 mark for a short while.\n\nHowever, Santiment\u2019s latest tweet revealed that several altcoins went into the underbought zone over the last few days. Not only were altcoins underbought, but the overall trading sentiment remained low.\n\n? Market caps have fallen considerably over the past week, and traders are very polarized. Many believe a quick recovery is coming, while others see this as just the beginning of the dump. But undeniably, average #crypto returns are in a mathematically historic opportunity zone. pic.twitter.com/oVlLQ6ZuB1 \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) August 19, 2023\n\nAs per CoinMarketCap, the 24-hour trading volume dropped by more than 30%, reflecting investors\u2019 reluctance to actively trade. However, while the market remains sluggish, it might be the right opportunity for investors to accumulate more before the market turns bullish. In fact, investors were already accumulating the king of altcoins.\n\nAs per Santiment, ETH\u2019s supply on exchanges dropped substantially while its supply outside of exchanges increased. Additionally, whales\u2019 confidence in the king of altcoins was high as the supply held by top addresses went up.\n\nAre Altcoins entering a bull rally?\n\nSurprisingly, while ETH\u2019s price was still slow-moving, XRP, on the other hand, showed high volatility. According to CoinMarketCap, the altcoin was up by more than 4% in the last 24 hours, which was remarkable, considering the current market condition.\n\nAt press time, it was trading at $0.5288 with a market cap of over $27.9 billion. The recent price uptick helped XRP increase its MVRV Ratio slightly. Additionally, positive sentiment around the token was relatively high.\n\nNot only that, but ETH\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) was in an oversold zone, which is a bullish development. Moreover, CryptoQuant\u2019s data revealed that ETH\u2019s exchange reserve was declining, suggesting that buying pressure was increasing.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 XRPs worth today\n\nThis happened while the market\u2019s Fear and Greed index had a value of 34. When the metric\u2019s value remains low, the chances of a price uptick increase. Therefore, investors might consider this a good opportunity to increase their accumulation to enjoy profits during the next bull run.\n\nHowever, taking into account the unpredictable nature of the crypto market, the possibility of a further downtrend can\u2019t be ruled out."

Despite the bearish crypto market, the Ethereum coin continues to reach significant milestones.\n\nFollowing announcements that former U.S. president, Donald Trump, holds $2.8 million in ETH, Ledger has made another bullish announcement. The hardware wallet provider has now made ETH purchases available via PayPal.\n\nToday, the Ethereum price is down by 0.75%, as the broader crypto market is in bear territory. Despite this, crypto experts are bullish about the price of Ethereum. Now trading at $1,822.9, Ethereum has been predicted to reach a 2023 high of $3,200 in a bull market.\n\nShibarium Development Report Sparks Shiba Inu (SHIB) Excitement\n\nFollowing reports that the Shiba Inu community will finally get a look at the Shibarium mainnet tomorrow, a team member has dropped an exciting report. According to the report, hundreds of projects are already building on the layer 2 network.\n\nCrypto experts are bullish about this report as it would finally add more utility to the Shiba Inu coin.

These investors are now doubling down on Everlodge ahead of a surge that might result in a 35x gain in price.\n\nInvesting in vacation homes is traditionally reserved for the wealthy due to the hefty overhead costs connected with real estate. Everlodge is introducing a hybrid shared ownership model using blockchain and fractional NFTs to solve this problem.\n\nThe property marketplace will list luxury homes, hotels, and vacation apartments as fractional NFTs, giving investors the chance to buy fractions for as little as $100. The team will work with prominent hotel chains and premium real estate developers all around the world to secure the properties.\n\nThe idea of giving hundreds of thousands of investors the opportunity to invest in the timeshare industry is expected to drive up the price of ELDG. In the beta presale stage, the currency is now trading at $0.010 and is expected to climb 35x and trade as high as $0.35 when it launches.\n\nFind out more about the Everlodge (ELDG) Presale\n\nWebsite: https://www.everlodge.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/everlodge\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "South Korea, known for its tech-savvy populace and a strong inclination towards crypto investments, has thrown a new trend into the spotlight concerning XRP.\n\nA recent report from the South Korean news outlet News1 Korea indicates that the nation\u2019s Generation Z (GenZ) displays a marked preference for altcoins, most notably XRP, over the more established giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nGenZ\u2019s Shift To Altcoins\n\nThe report undertook a detailed study of investment data on Bithumb, one of South Korea\u2019s leading crypto exchanges. The findings from this analysis illuminate the distinctive investment behaviors of different age groups, especially emphasizing the choices made by GenZ investors.\n\nThe investment propensity based on age revealed that GenZ or those in their 20s are more inclined towards \u201caggressive\u201d investment proneness. This emerging generation of investors is displaying a pronounced preference for altcoins, alternatives to the dominant cryptos such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).\n\nIn this study, Bitcoin and Ethereum are categorized as \u201clong-term\u201d and \u201cstable investments\u201d owing to their perceived low volatility in the market.\n\nThe report reveals that roughly 82.5% of GenZ investors have poured their money into altcoins, excluding ETH. But it\u2019s XRP that stands out amongst the crowd. Approximately one in five GenZ investors, or 20.7% to be precise, have chosen this token as their primary altcoin for investment.\n\nThe Larger Context And XRP\u2019s Role In It\n\nThis surge in the altcoin\u2019s popularity among younger South Korean investors is juxtaposed with a contrasting trend for the slightly older age bracket.\n\nInvestors in their 30s were found to have a higher affinity for Bitcoin and Ethereum. It suggests that while GenZ is more open to exploring newer and potentially riskier altcoins, the previous generation is still aligned mainly with the tried and tested crypto leaders.\n\nFurther shedding light on this trend, a crypto derivatives platform Bitget report stated that nearly half of the crypto copy traders on the exchange belong to the GenZ demographic.\n\nSpeaking of the token, Crypto lawyer John Deaton has recently explained that the US Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) legal tussle with Ripple over the XRP token may have significantly set the altcoin\u2019s trajectory back in the US market by three years.\n\nYou could NEVER underestimate the damage the SEC\u2019s lawsuit has caused \u2013 NOT ONLY AGAINST RIPPLE \u2013 BUT #XRP. THREE YEARS OF ADOPTION \u2013 that\u2019s what it\u2019s caused. Just how long is 3 yrs \u2013 in crypto years? People seem to forget how much Coinbase promoted #XRP before the lawsuit.\u2026 https://t.co/1fZ3r8WCSd pic.twitter.com/GLu4kFUU38 \u2014 John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) August 22, 2023\n\nMeanwhile, the cryptocurrency currently trades for $0.52, up by 1.9% over the past 24 hours, with a 24-hour trading volume of $1 billion.\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, Chart from TradingView"

        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has left the entire community bewildered after sending as much as 600 ETH to Coinbase: everyone is wondering the motivation for this move and what influence it will have on the crypto\u2019s price.\n\nAt a time when the cryptocurrency landscape is no stranger to price fluctuations, regulatory uncertainties, and a turbulent market, Buterin\u2019s action seems to carry significant weight.\n\nWill the weight of the action of Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin have a negative influence on the price of ETH?\n\nAccording to data from the Ethereum blockchain explorer website, etherscan, Buterin\u2019s transfer has attracted attention and raised questions about the motivations behind such a move.\n\nThe transfer coincided with a tumultuous period for ETH, the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nOver the previous seven days, ETH had fallen 10%, reflecting a broader market decline that led traders to witness liquidations of about $1 billion on several digital assets.\n\nThe cryptocurrency community held its breath as prices fluctuated and investors looked for signs of stability amid uncertainty.\n\nDespite the current market disquiet, there was a breath of optimism on Monday as Ethereum managed to regain some of the lost ground.\n\nWith growth over the past 24 hours, the cryptocurrency\u2019s value hovered around $1,700, signaling a tentative recovery.\n\nHowever, the abruptness of Buterin\u2019s move has raised more questions than answers, particularly in light of another recent financial maneuver.\n\nEthereum: some keen observers had already noticed Vitalik Buterin\u2019s activities, but how will the price react?\n\nOn the day just before the move, Sunday, Buterin\u2019s activity had attracted the attention of keen observers.\n\nThe records of the on-chain tracer known as lookonchain revealed that he had repaid 250,000 RAI and simultaneously withdrawn a hefty sum of $1.6 million in Ether.\n\nRAI, an unanchored stablecoin backed by ETH, added another layer of mystery to the narrative.\n\nYet amid the uncertainty and speculation, one question looms large: why did Ethereum\u2019s co-founder choose to transfer a considerable sum of Ether to the centralized exchange platform Coinbase?\n\nThe answer to this question remains unclear, and the cryptocurrency community continues to piece together the puzzle.\n\nPossible explanations\n\nOne plausible explanation revolves around the need for liquidity. Although Buterin is an influential figure in the blockchain space, he may have sought to leverage the liquidity available on Coinbase to obtain funding for various initiatives.\n\nIt is no secret that the cryptocurrency market can be unpredictable, and maintaining a certain level of liquidity can be beneficial, especially for someone actively involved in the industry.\n\nAlternatively, this move could reflect a strategic stance. By transferring a substantial amount of Ether to Coinbase, Buterin may have paved the way for future potential ventures.\n\nCoinbase, with its status as a leading crypto exchange platform, offers access to a wide range of resources, collaborations, and opportunities that could be leveraged for projects aimed at promoting the growth and adoption of Ethereum.\n\nIt is also worth considering the broader implications for the cryptocurrency market. The actions of prominent figures like Vitalik Buterin can often set the tone for market sentiment.\n\nObservers and investors closely follow such movements, looking for potential trends or patterns that could influence their own decisions.\n\nButerin\u2019s move could signal his confidence in Coinbase\u2019s security and services, potentially allaying concerns about the platform\u2019s reliability after several security breaches that have affected the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nBottom line on the story\n\nIn light of this, as the cryptocurrency space continues to evolve, unexpected events such as these remind us of the complexity and intrigue that characterizes this nascent industry.\n\nThe lack of a clear explanation behind Buterin\u2019s move only adds to the mystery, leaving room for speculation and interpretation.\n\nIn an industry marked by innovation and disruption, even seemingly ordinary transactions can carry underlying messages that shape the course of the cryptocurrency.\n\nIn conclusion, Vitalik Buterin\u2019s recent transfer of more than $1 million in Ether to Coinbase has sparked curiosity and speculation within the cryptocurrency community.\n\nAs the co-founder of Ethereum, Buterin\u2019s actions carry weight and significance, and the motivations behind such a transfer are open to interpretation.\n\nWhether it is a strategic move, a liquidity optimization strategy, or an indicator of broader market sentiment, the cryptocurrency world continues to observe and learn from the actions of its key players.\n\nAs the industry matures, unexpected moves like this one remind us that the landscape is constantly evolving and full of surprises."

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin Transfers $1M Worth Ethereum (ETH) to Coinbase - The Coin Republic",
        "content": "Based on on-chain data, a wallet linked to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin transferred 600 Ether, which is valued at approximately $1 Million to Coinbase earlier today.\n\nAt press time, the exact reason for this transaction is subject to speculation. Traditionally, transfers to exchanges are often interpreted as potential indications of an intention to sell. Given the recent challenges in Ethereum\u2019s price performance, Buterin\u2019s transaction might contribute to additional selling pressure on the digital asset.\n\nAdditionally, on-chain tracking service Lookonchain has noted that the Vitalik.eth wallet made a repayment of 251,000 RAI on the Maker DeFi platform and subsequently withdrew 1,000 ETH, amounting to roughly $1.67 Million, on August 20th, 2023.\n\nThe wallet identified as \u201cvitalik.eth\u201d has been in existence for seven years and currently holds 3,993 ETH, valued at $6.5 Million at the present time. The Arkham Intelligence dashboard has corroborated that this wallet is indeed associated with Ethereum\u2019s co-founder.\n\nAdditionally, this wallet contains other digital assets, including $84,000 worth of USD Coin (USDC) and $58,000 worth of Wrapped Ethereum (WETH).\n\nIndeed this is not the first instance of Buterin transferring assets to a cryptocurrency exchange. Back in March 2023, the Ethereum co-founder sent 200 ETH to Kraken. During the same timeframe, Buterin also sold off a number of unsolicited altcoins, converting them into 439.25 ETH.\n\nButerin\u2019s recent transaction coincides with the aftermath of last Thursday\u2019s sudden crash in the crypto market. During the previous week, Ethereum\u2019s price dropped below the $1700 threshold for the first time since June 2023 and has remained below that level as of the present moment.\n\nEthereum Founder Not Transferring for First Time\n\nIt\u2019s true that historically when ETH tokens are transferred by Vitalik Buterin or the Ethereum Foundation, it has often coincided with a decrease in ETH\u2019s price. While the rationale behind the recent transfer remains unclear, there\u2019s a chance that Buterin might be considering another substantial sell-off.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s also possible that this transfer is a one-time occurrence for a specific sale. Speculations are circulating on social media, as the community tries to decipher the potential implications of this action.\n\nMarket analysts and experts are currently projecting a significant decline in Ethereum\u2019s value if it drops below the critical support range of $1,550-$1,600. The broader cryptocurrency industry has experienced a substantial drop, with the total market capitalization decreasing by over 10% in the past week. As of the present moment, the entire cryptocurrency market capitalization is situated at $1.05 Trillion."

        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has made headlines once again with a significant transaction. Earlier today, Buterin transferred 600 Ether, valued at over $1 million, from his wallet to the popular cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. The reasons behind this move remain unclear, but such transfers are often interpreted as a precursor to a sale.\n\nMoreover, this transfer comes when selling pressure on Ethereum has been increasing. Consequently, Buterin\u2019s transaction may further contribute to the price downward pressure on the cryptocurrency.\n\nHowever, it is essential to note that Buterin has a history of moving funds to cryptocurrency exchanges. In March of this year, he contributed 200 ETH to the Kraken exchange. Around the same time, he sold 439.25 Ether in exchange for various alternative cryptocurrencies.\n\nAdditionally, on August 20, the \u201cvitalik.eth\u201d wallet reportedly returned 251,000 RAI on the DeFi platform Maker and withdrew 1,000 ETH, equivalent to about $1.67 million. This information comes from on-chain investigator Lookonchain. Significantly, the \u201cvitalik.eth\u201d wallet was created seven years ago and currently holds 3,993 ETH, or nearly $6.5 million. CryptoSlate, using the Arkham Intelligence dashboard, has verified that the wallet indeed belongs to the Ethereum co-founder.\n\nBesides Ether, the wallet also contains other assets. It holds USD Coin (USDC) valued at $84,000 and Wrapped Ethereum (WETH) valued at $58,000. Hence, Buterin\u2019s recent transfer to Coinbase is not an isolated incident, but part of a broader pattern of transactions.\n\nButerin\u2019s transaction follows closely after last Thursday\u2019s flash crash in the crypto market. Last week, the price of ETH dropped below $1700 for the first time since June and has remained below that level as of this writing. Currently, ETH is trading with bullish sentiment, showing a price increase of 0.07% and trading at $1,674.79."

        "content": "In a recent analysis, popular crypto market analyst Ali Martinez issued a cautionary note to cryptocurrency investors, highlighting the critical importance of Ethereum (ETH) maintaining its support within the $1,600 \u2013 $1,550 range.\n\nMartinez\u2019s warning emphasized that a breach of this key support zone could expose Ethereum to substantial downside risks, potentially triggering a significant correction of 37% to 45%. Such a correction could potentially drive the price of the popular crypto token to as low as $1,000.\n\nOn August 21, the expert revealed that Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, moved 600 ETH worth more than $1 million to Coinbase, citing on-chain data from blockchain intelligence platform Arkham.\n\nAccording to Martinez, the move could signal that Buterin is \u201ccashing out before the anticipated ETH dip to $1,000.\u201d\n\nButerin moving 600 ETH to Coinbase. Source: Ali Martinez Twitter\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nAt the time of publication on August 22, ETH was changing hands at $1,657, down 1.17% in the past 24 hours.\n\nThe second-largest crypto asset by market cap fell by more than 10% on a weekly basis and 12% on the month, losing over $26 billion in market cap during this period.\n\nETH 1-week price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nYear-to-date, ETH remains up over 38%, though significantly underperforming Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) 56% surge.\n\nWhy is Ethereum falling?\n\nThe latest drop in price coincides with a broader downturn in the cryptocurrency market, which has been driven by concerns of potential interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve.\n\nAdditionally, investor sentiment has been influenced by unresolved uncertainties surrounding the legal conflict between the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Grayscale.\n\nThis dispute pertains to Grayscale\u2019s pursuit of converting its GBTC bitcoin trust into an exchange-traded fund (ETF) backed by spot BTC, leaving market participants awaiting further regulatory clarity.\n\nPseudonymous crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto said on Tuesday that Ethereum\u2019s recent dip below $1,570 presented a \u2018fantastic buy\u2019 opportunity for the number two cryptocurrency.\n\nHowever, CrediBULL\u2019s views differ from Martinez\u2019s as he believes that Ethereum\u2019s bottom is likely behind us and that ETH may be one of the first altcoins to follow the lead of Bitcoin to the upside despite the bearish stance on ETH/BTC pairing in the short term.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "Bitcoin Spark\u2019s Initial Coin Offering (ICO) presents an enticing proposition for Ethereum and Solana investors. Bitcoin Spark offers investors an opportunity that mirrors Bitcoin\u2019s early days when one BTC was going at $1. BTCS offers ETH and SOL investors a chance to participate in a project that could potentially reshape the cryptocurrency mining arena.\n\nBitcoin Spark (BTCS)\n\nBTCS strives to revolutionize mining, rewards, and consensus mechanisms in the blockchain world. A diversion from traditional cryptocurrencies, BTCS employs a unique Proof-of-Process (PoP) consensus mechanism, featuring merged PoS and PoW protocols. This innovative approach ensures fair rewards distribution and enhances network security, making it a potential game-changer in the crypto landscape. The BTCS ecosystem offers miners the opportunity to contribute processing power through an application, earn rewards, and participate in a secure and accessible mining process. With its focus on profitability, simplicity, and decentralization, Bitcoin Spark seeks to carve its path in the world of digital currencies outpacing Solana and Ethereum.\n\n\n\n\n\nBTCS is running an exciting ICO currently in phase two at $1.75, with a 15% bonus. Holders of phase two can witness their investment skyrocket by 657% at launch. Prospective investors can get assurance of a solid infrastructure and compliant systems through BTCS KYC certification and ContractWolf smart contracts audit.\n\nWhat to mine after Ethereum\n\nAfter Ethereum\u2019s long-awaited merge, a switch to proof-of-stake occurred. Now that the energy-intensive PoW is discontinued, what next for Ethereum miners? Fortunately, there are several alternative cryptocurrencies that miners consider mining. However, when choosing a cryptocurrency to mine after Ethereum, consider factors such as the mining algorithm, hardware compatibility, potential profitability, and the project\u2019s fundamentals. Bitcoin Spark tops the list of best cryptocurrencies to mine after Ethereum. Bitcoin Spark offers a unique Proof-of-Process consensus mechanism that combines elements of PoS and PoW. It aims to provide more accessibility and security for miners. The rewards are distributed fairly and in a nonlinear way to ensure that mining power doesn\u2019t find its way into the hands of a few individuals. In addition, it provides an application where miners can rent out computational power to those in need. In such an arrangement, mining becomes possible and anyone can mine. If you\u2019re interested in a new and innovative approach to mining, BTCS could be worth exploring. Other options include Dogecoin (DOGE), Litecoin (LTC), and Ethereum Classic (ETC) among others.\n\nIs Solana a good investment\n\nSolana has gained recognition for its cutting-edge blockchain technology that prioritizes rapid transaction speeds, scalable infrastructure, and minimal fees. What sets Solana apart is its distinctive methodology which distinguishes it from other platforms. The expansive Solana ecosystem encompasses a wide array of elements, ranging from NFTs and cryptocurrency wallets to dApps and DeFi solutions.\n\nWhile Solana presents a compelling case with its innovative technology and growing ecosystem, Bitcoin Spark\u2019s strategic approach, improved tokenomics, and clear roadmap position it as a strong contender to surpass Solana\u2019s success. The two projects will likely contribute to the industry\u2019s growth and transformation, offering investors unique opportunities to participate in the ongoing crypto revolution. Moreover, with its innovative vision and promising trajectory, Bitcoin Spark could be poised to make a significant impact and potentially outpace Solana in the crypto market.\n\nFind more here:\n\nWebsite: https://bitcoinspark.org/\n\nBuy BTCS: https://network.bitcoinspark.org/register"
