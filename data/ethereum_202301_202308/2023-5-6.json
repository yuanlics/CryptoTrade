        "title": "Ethereum in 2 Charts: Is It Time to Sell? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH -0.01%), the world's second most valuable cryptocurrency by market cap, is in a unique position. Since the start of the year it is up more than 50%, and yet it is still down more than 60% from its all-time high of almost $4,900.\n\nBecause of its hot start in 2023, it can be difficult to gauge whether Ethereum is a buy or a sell today. To get an answer to this question we need to do a little digging to find data from Ethereum's network that provides some historical context on its current position in the market.\n\nThe foundation for The Merge\n\nOne of the most important developments to come out of the cryptocurrency industry recently was The Merge, an upgrade that switched Ethereum from the clunky and energy-consuming proof-of-work method of verifying transactions to the more robust and energy-efficient proof-of-stake method.\n\nHowever, although The Merge dominated headlines, there is a lesser-known upgrade that is likely more meaningful for Ethereum's price than it is given credit for.\n\nKnown as the London hard fork, this upgrade was introduced in August 2021 and included a new pricing mechanism with a fixed base fee to be burned, or permanently destroyed. Essentially, the more transactions that occur on the network, the greater the number of ether tokens that could be removed from the supply. Because the fixed base fee is permanently removed from circulation, under some circumstances the total number of ether in circulation can actually decrease.\n\nData by TradingView\n\nBecause of the London hard fork Ethereum has effectively become a deflationary asset, as the chart above shows. It can be a little difficult to see, but around the end of 2022 the line showing the total supply of ether starts to bend. It was around this time that the number of transactions on the network started to increase, causing the burn mechanism to truly start to become evident.\n\nThanks to this new feature, Ethereum's price is now highly correlated to the dynamics of supply and demand. Before the London hard fork, Ethereum had a relatively high inflation rate, but now this has all changed and it could mean great things for Ethereum's price, especially if a bull market is on the horizon.\n\nContinued growth of active users\n\nThere is another metric we can look at to get a better idea of Ethereum's current valuation versus its potential future price. It's relatively simple, but evaluation of the number of active addresses on the Ethereum blockchain can provide a useful glimpse at activity on the network. Active addresses are the number of unique addresses that have either sent or received a transaction on the blockchain during a certain period, and the thinking goes that the greater the number of active addresses, the more demand for the cryptocurrency.\n\nData by TradingView\n\nWhen taking a look at these addresses, it becomes clear that while there has been a downtrend since the market peak in 2021, there has been substantial growth in recent months. It suggests that more people are using the blockchain for various purposes, such as making payments, creating decentralized applications, and executing smart contracts. As the number of users on the Ethereum network increases, so does the amount of ether burned, thus adding more deflationary pressure.\n\nDue to the newness of the burn mechanism and recent trends in active addresses, it's more than likely that Ethereum's price has yet to realize the full potential of this combination. As such, Ethereum seems to be in a position that could benefit users for years to come.\n\nWhen considering Ethereum was able to hit an all-time high of almost $4,900 without any burn mechanism and while still operating on the former proof-of-work methodology, it's difficult to imagine what could be in store for its price as it begins to reap the rewards of its new deflationary features.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "title": "The Ethereum Foundation just sold $30M in Ether \u2014 But will ETH price fall this time? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "On May 6, Ethereum Foundation transferred nearly $30 million in Ether (ETH) to the Kraken cryptocurrency exchange, causing jitters in the market about a potential selloff event.\n\nETH price fell 4.8% to $1,900 on the day, but the decline has been negligible so far amid a wider recovery trend.\n\nETH price holding key support\n\nEther\u2019s price recovered modestly to $1,920 on May 7 after testing its 50-day exponential moving average (50-day EMA; the red wave) near $1,850 as support a day ago.\n\nMoreover, the price volatility dropped on Kraken in the said period, per the contracting Bollinger Bands width in the chart above. That further shows traders\u2019 calm amid the Ethereum Foundation transfer.\n\nNotably, the 50-day EMA has capped Ether's downside attempts so far in 2023, barring the early March selloff that saw the price briefly falling below the red wave. Meanwhile, testing it as support has prompted the ETH price to pursue a breakout above $2,000.\n\nAs a result of this support, ETH bulls may attempt to take the price above $2,000 again.\n\nConversely, a drop below the 50-day EMA could have traders eye a support confluence comprising a multi-month ascending trendline and the 200-day EMA (the blue wave) near $1,700 as the next downside target, down about 13% from current price levels.\n\nEven with a larger decline, ETH would be maintaining its overall recovery trend when measured from its June 2022 bottom of $880.\n\nEthereum exchange reserves vs. Kraken reserves\n\nA rising exchange balance suggests potential selling pressure rising and vice versa. In Ethereum\u2019s case, the balance remained lower across all the exchanges despite the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s transferring $30 million into Kraken.\n\nFor instance, Kraken's Ether balance increased to 1.84 million ETH on May 6, from 1.83 million one day earlier.\n\nEther Kraken balance vs. exchange balance. Source: Glassnode\n\nNevertheless, the balance across all exchanges actually dropped to 18.15 million ETH from 18.22 million ETH on the day, indicating that any potential sell-pressure from the Ethereum Foundation can easily be absorbed.\n\nNot necessarily a ETH market top\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation\u2019s last big transfer was 20,000 ETH in November 2021, when the price topped around $4,850, declining 80% thereafter. Similarly, the foundation sold 35,053 ETH at the local market top of around $3,500 in May 2021.\n\nRelated: Ethereum up 20% in April while Markets Pro sees 379% gain in one day\n\nMany analysts treated these fractals as a sign of another possible market top formation near $2,000, arguing that the price may fall in the coming sessions.\n\nEthereum Foundation sold another 20,000 Ethereum at the recent local top.\n\n\n\nEvery time the eth foundation / Vitalik / Consensys dumps a massive presale bag it marks the top.\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between ripple dumping hundreds of millions on retail vs ETH founders doing it? https://t.co/pw8ukMiR8v \u2014 Brad Mills \u26a1\ufe0f (@bradmillscan) January 28, 2022\n\nBut broader data suggests otherwise. For instance, Ethereum Foundation\u2019s large ETH sales occurred also during the 2020-2021 bull cycle, boosted by growing demand for risk-on assets in a lower interest rate macro environment.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation's large ETH transfers to exchanges since 2018. Source: Wu Blockchain\n\nIn other words, there\u2019s little evidence to suggest that the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s sales have any impact on Ethereum\u2019s price trend. Instead, the cryptocurrency market is currently taking cues from the U.S. banking crisis and whether this will force the Federal Reserve to stop hiking and cut interest rates.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin And Ethereum Foundation Selling ETH \u2013 Will Prices Fall? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum supporters are confident that prices will break the $2,000 level. However, recent moves by its founder, Vitalik Buterin, and the Ethereum Foundation, the team managing the smart contracting platform, raises concerns, especially from coin holders and traders, on whether the coin has what it needs to break above key resistance levels.\n\nETH Transfer Raises Concerns Among Investors\n\nOn May 5, a tracker, LookOnChain, noticed that Vitalik.eth, the domain associated with Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, transferred 200 ETH, which is worth about $400,000 at current valuation, to Kraken, a cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nShortly after that, the Ethereum Foundation also made a much larger transfer, moving 15,000 ETH, worth about $30 million, to the same platform.\n\nThis has raised concerns among holders, who are worried that the dumping of such a large amount of ETH could further pressure prices.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that ETH is currently down 13% from its April highs, and sliding.\n\nCoin holders, including those of ETH, typically send tokens from time to time. Even so, any transfer to a centralized exchange is interpreted as bearish. Vitalik Buterin might need funds to cover operating costs or even invest in projects. At this time, it is not known why he sells.\n\nIn the past, Buterin has sold ETH in batches without causing a significant price drop.\n\nDespite this development, some analysts, including Santiment, believe that ETH may be decoupling from Bitcoin, and that it might soon recover, breaking above $2,000.\n\nAccording to data from Santiment, a leading on-chain data company, there has been a significant increase in the amount of Ethereum being moved to crypto exchanges over the past few months.\n\n\ud83d\ude2e #Ethereum's active deposits just hit an 8-month high. As we research the most likely cause, we can currently state that this likely will foreshadow upcoming increased $ETH volatility, similar to the result of spikes during the #merge & #FTX collapse. https://t.co/aBeHQudM52 pic.twitter.com/oHeypfUPvJ \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) May 5, 2023\n\nEthereum Sees Increased Adoption\n\nDespite these concerns, there are also positive signs, based on on-chain activity.\n\nA record amount of ETH was burned at the end of this week, thanks to the meme coin craze, and specifically, PEPE. The majority of meme coins run on Ethereum and are being actively moved with higher gas fees, providing a great opportunity to burn ETH and decrease the circulating supply.\n\n31.7K $ETH has been burned in the past seven days. To put that in perspective, since the merge (231 days ago), 152K ETH total has been burned. That\u2019s ~21% of the total burn in ~3% of the total days. This is the power of meme coins. pic.twitter.com/iFsZaDH5LU \u2014 K A L E O (@CryptoKaleo) May 5, 2023\n\nIn addition, Ethereum is seeing increased adoption from major companies and institutions, which is driving up demand for the cryptocurrency.\n\nLast week, the European Investment Bank (EIB) announced that it had issued its first-ever digital bond on the Ethereum blockchain, marking a significant milestone for the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe increased adoption and burning of ETH due to the meme coin mania could sustain prices above key support levels in the days ahead. Still, it remains to be seen how prices will react in the days ahead.\n\nThe sharp drop on May 6, reversing gains of May 5, could anchor the next leg down, forcing even more liquidations towards the $1,500 support line.\n\n-Featured Image From Canva, Chart From TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

But this time it\u2019s different.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Foundation and Vitalik Buterin Transfers Over 15K ETH\n\nOn Friday, Vitalik Buterin related address vitalik.eth transferred 200 ETH to crypto exchange Kraken as per PeckShieldAlert. As per Etherscan data, this is not the first time the address transferred ETH to the same Kraken wallet. There are 5 similar transactions to Kraken in the last 2 months.\n\nEthereum Foundation followed suit and transferred 15k ETH to Kraken, as per the transaction reported by PeckShieldAlert on Saturday, May 6. The large transaction by Ethereum Foundation raised FUD in the crypto community, with many thinking that an ETH price and meme coins crash could be coming.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Gas Fees Hit Record Levels Amid PEPE Meme Coin Hype; Flips SHIB, DOGE\n\nAs per historical data, a large ETH move by the Ethereum Foundation led to a massive fall in ETH prices. The last time 20,000 ETH was transferred to Kraken on November 12, 2021. After the Ethereum Foundation cash out at $4,722, near ATH, the ETH price fell 40% in 2 months.\n\nMeanwhile, Vitalik Buterin has sold several meme coins historically. The coins Vitalik Buterin sold mostly get rekt, similar to last time when shitcoins lost most value after he dumped massive amounts of shitcoins. In March, Vitalik sold 50 billion MOPS for 1.25 ETH, 10 billion CULT for 58 ETH, and 500 trillion SHIK for 380 ETH. In Addition, he sold 3.4M BITE for 5.9 ETH and transferred 214 ETH worth $337k to Ethereum Foundation.\n\nETH price fell 3% in the last 24 hours, with the price currently trading below $1800. The 24-hour low and high are $1,794 and $2,017, respectively. Furthermore, the trading volume has increased slightly by 52% in the last 24 hours, indicating an interest among traders.\n\nAlso Read: New York Introduces Landmark Crypto Regulatory Bill \u201cCRPTO\u201d"

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to data shared by @lookonchain, an analytics platform that tracks large crypto transactions and transfers of \"Smart Money\" wallets, Vitalik Buterin sent nearly half a million worth of Ethereum to a major exchange.\n\nAfter he did that, the Ethereum Foundation did the same but transferred a lot more Ethereum to the same platform \u2014 nearly $30 million worth of it.\n\nIn the meantime, the second largest cryptocurrency, ETH, is trading at the $1,960 level. Santiment on-chain data company believes that ETH is on the cusp of breaking above $2,000.\n\nButerin and ETH Foundation sell ETH\n\nLookonchain shared that the vitalik.eth wallet was the first to move 200 Ethereum (worth about $400,000) to the U.S.-based Kraken exchange. Following Buterin's transaction, the Ethereum Foundation did the same but on a much bigger scale \u2014 they shifted 15,000 ETH to Kraken as well.\n\nTogether with Buterin's crypto, that makes $40,000,000 USD in fiat. The second transaction was also noticed and highlighted by the popular crypto tracker Whale Alert.\n\nIt seems that Buterin just sells Ethereum from time to time in more or less the same amounts. As reported by U.Today earlier, in the middle of February, he sold 210 ETH for roughly $325,000 in the USDC stablecoin. Curiously, that chunk of ETH was also sold on Kraken.\n\nBack then, Ethereum was trading at $1,545.\n\nOn March 13, he moved another 200 ETH to Kraken, selling it at the price of $1,656 per coin.\n\nEthereum on verge of breaking $2,000: Reasons\n\nSantiment data aggregator reported on Friday that ETH had reached an eight-month high in flows to crypto exchanges. The analytics team believes that this may be a sign of an upcoming volatility increase similar to what it was like after the collapse of FTX in early November and the Merge in mid-September.\n\nIn a tweet that followed, Santiment added that while \"sky-high active deposits\" of ETH to exchanges are the highest since November last year, ETH is now showing signs of decoupling from BTC and may be about to break above the $2,000 level.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 Updating our report on #Ethereum's sky-high active deposits, exchange addresses interacting on the network is now at its highest level since November, 2021.

That was down to the meme coin season unwrapping at the moment \u2014 the majority of meme coins run on Ethereum and so are being actively moved with high ETH fees, providing a great opportunity to burn ETH and decrease the circulating supply."

        "content": "Ethereum Proof-of-Stake network experienced a drop in active validator count since the Shapella upgrade.\n\nETH\u2019s value has since posted a double-digit decline.\n\nSince Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Shapella upgrade went live on 12 April, there has been a steep decline in active validator count on the proof-of-stake (POS) network, data from Glassnode revealed.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nInformation obtained from the on-chain data provider put the active validator count on the network at 562,941 on 12 April. Just 24 hours after the Shanghai upgrade went live, this fell to 561,655, where it has since remained.\n\nObserved on a 30-day moving average, the total number of validators that voluntarily exited Ethereum\u2019s validator pool since Shapella rose significantly by over 400%.\n\nThe continued decline in active validator count on the Ethereum POS network is due to a rally in the withdrawals of previously deposited ETH coins by some validators on the network.\n\nFollowing the Shapella upgrade, validators that had previously secured the network with more than 18 million ETH were free to initiate withdrawals, which some of them did. According to a Nansen dashboard, 10,675 validators were scheduled for full exit in the last hour at press time.\n\nETH prices take a plunge\n\nMany expected ETH\u2019s value to dip significantly once Shapella went live due to increased withdrawals and sell-offs to make a profit by those who had initially staked their ETH coins. In contrast, the alt\u2019s value rose momentarily after the upgrade.\n\nAccording to data from CoinMarketCap, ETH\u2019s price jumped by 14% between 12 and 16 April. As of 16 April, the leading altcoin traded above $2000, after which the price descent began. Exchanging hands at $1,897.75 at press time, ETH\u2019s price has since decreased by 11%.\n\nDespite the price fall, ETH whales that hold between 100,000 to 10,000,000 ETH coins have intensified accumulation. Per data from Santiment, since the Shapella, the count of these big whales increased by 2.5%.\n\nConversely, whales that hold between 1,000 and 100,000 ETH coins have taken a risk-averse approach and dumped some of their ETH holdings. Data from Santiment revealed that their number has gone down by 1% since Shapella.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC terms\n\nFurther, while the ephemeral jump in ETH\u2019s value following the Shapella upgrade caused market sentiment to turn positive on 14 April, the price decline caused the alt\u2019s weighted sentiment to return to negative territory, where it has since remained.\n\nAt press time, this was -1.172. With persistent negative sentiment lingering in the market, any significant spike in ETH\u2019s price might be hard to come by."

        "content": "By CCN.com: The beautiful game just got much prettier after European football giant Benfica announced they\u2019d be accepting bitcoin and Ethereum payments. Now, fans of the Portuguese Primera Liga champions can pay for match tickets and club merchandise using cryptocurrency.\n\nEuro Elite Benfica Accept Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the footballing elite has flirted with cryptocurrency, but it is the first time its been accepted as regular payment.\n\nIn the recent past, Italian champions Juventus played around with the idea of launching its own club token. Football supporters were even able to pay for match access with bitcoin during 2018\u2019s World Cup in Russia \u2013 although that was a one-off.\n\nNow the transactional value of cryptocurrency can be employed in full around the Est\u00e1dio da Luz \u2013 Benfica\u2019s home ground. The sudden move comes courtesy of UTRUST, a crypto payments processing firm which also utilizes its own ETH-based token, UTK.\n\nAccording to Wednesday\u2019s press release:\n\n\u201cUTRUST\u2019s core technology will allow Benfica to take advantage of the increased security and convenience of cryptocurrency payments while protecting the club from market volatility. It will also significantly reduce processing fees and eliminate inconvenient credit-card chargebacks and fraudulent payments.\u201d\n\nBenfica CEO Domingos Soares de Oliveira said the decision to accept crypto payments came from a recognition that the club must \u201cstay ahead of the curve,\u201d adding:\n\n\u201c[We] recognize that many of our supporters are now digital users first so we want to be ahead of the curve when it comes to accepting novel technologies.\u201d\n\nFootball in Bed With Cryptocurrency?\n\nIt would have been difficult to imagine a more unlikely bedfellow for bitcoin than football, but no other popular industry has embraced crypto anywhere near as much.\n\nFormer Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp once pumped a cryptocurrency via his Twitter account. Footballing legend Ronaldinho even launched his own token. More names familiar to British and European football fans round up this list, which is growing by the month.\n\nIndeed, as recently as April, controversial cryptocurrency Bitcoin SV (BSV) signed a sponsorship deal with Scottish club Ayr United. The small seaside club carries the nickname of \u2018The Honest Men.\u2019 Make of that tidbit what you will.\n\nBenfica has a long, glorious history in European football and regularly fills out its 65,000 capacity stadium weekly. The club boasts 14 million followers worldwide and 7 million active fans across the internet and social media accounts.\n\nOnly bitcoin, Ethereum, and UTRUST\u2019s UTK token will be accepted for payments to start."

        "title": "How to check an Ethereum transaction \u2014 TradingView News - TradingView",
        "content": "A transaction on the Ethereum blockchain is technically initiated by an external account owner (not a contract). For example, if User A sends 1 Ether ETHUSD to User B, the action of debiting from one account and crediting to another changes the blockchain\u2019s state.\n\nThe change specifically takes place on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Ethereum transactions need to be broadcast to the entire network, and any node can broadcast a request for the execution of a transaction on the EVM.\n\nAfter broadcasting the request, a validator can then execute the transaction and propagate the state change to the whole network. Transaction fees are incurred during the process of validation, and each transaction must be included in a validated block. There are different types of transactions on the Ethereum network:\n\nRegular transactions: transactions occurring from one account to another.\n\nContract-execution transactions: transactions interacting with deployed smart contracts (the \u201cto\u201d address is a smart contract address).\n\nContract-deployment transactions: transactions with no \u201cto\u201d address (the data field is simply used to deploy the smart contract\u2019s code).\n\nCointelegraph\n\nHow to check the status of an Ethereum transaction\n\nHere\u2019s a brief step-by-step guide on how to track Ethereum transactions:\n\nStep 1: Select an Ethereum blockchain explorer\n\nSome blockchain explorers are specific to Ethereum, such as Etherscan, Ethplorer and EthVM. Others support multiple chains, such as Blockchain.com and Tokenview, among others. Cointelegraph\n\nStep 2: Enter the transaction hash into the blockchain explorer\u2019s search field\n\nOn Etherscan, for example, the search field is on the top, left-hand corner of the screen next to a dropdown that says \u201cAll Filters.\u201d Depending on the tool, a user can search for information based on a wallet address, transaction hash (txid), block, token or domain name. Cointelegraph\n\nThe txid is a unique identifier attached to a specific transaction. All transactions carried out on-chain, or those to and from external addresses, carry a unique txid found in the transaction details.\n\nDepending on the platform, it can also be called a \u201chash\u201d or \u201ctxn hash.\u201d It usually looks like a string of random letters and numbers. On MetaMask, for example, a user can instantly see the txid upon clicking the \u201cActivity\u201d tab and selecting the transaction. Cointelegraph\n\nOther than the txid, traders can also use their public address (a string of 42 characters corresponding to their public account). In this case, they will be taken to an overview of their wallet activities, allowing them to navigate to the specific transaction independently.\n\nStep 3: Click the icon for \u201csearch\u201d or \u201center\u201d on the blockchain explorer Cointelegraph Cointelegraph\n\nStep 4: Check if the transaction was successful or not\n\nCointelegraph\n\nHow to know if an ETH transaction was successful: Details indicating the state of the transaction will appear on the blockchain explorer. If the transaction was successfully validated and is now on the blockchain, it will say \u201csuccess\u201d or \u201csuccessful.\u201d Cointelegraph\n\nIf there are no errors displayed, it means that the transaction was completed successfully. The ETH should be credited to the destination wallet or exchange account within 24 hours of sending.\n\nIn the event of an Ether transaction failure, on the other hand, several error messages can appear:\n\nError message or symbol: A red exclamation point or an error message saying \u201cbad instruction\u201d or \u201cout of gas\u201d means that the transaction was unsuccessful and the funds did not reach their intended destination. In the case of an \u201cout of gas\u201d error, users can double the gas limit they initially specified and try again.\n\nReverted: This pertains to a smart contract user error. It means that the user should double-check the details of the transaction.\n\nTransaction not found: Either the transaction did not go through or it isn\u2019t appearing on the blockchain explorer yet. Try using another explorer. If it still doesn\u2019t appear on multiple ones, there\u2019s a good chance it did not go through.\n\nPending: The transaction is still waiting to be validated or processed, but it was located in the explorer\u2019s transaction pool. Sometimes pending transactions can still be canceled or replaced by a user.\n\nHow long does an Ethereum transaction take to process?\n\nAn average transaction on the Ethereum blockchain will typically take between 15 seconds and five minutes to process, depending on several factors. These include the amount paid to process it (transaction fee) and how busy the network is at the time of processing.\n\nEthereum transitioned from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake blockchain after the Merge. However, transaction speeds remain roughly the same. According to the Ethereum Foundation, it\u2019s a common misconception that the Merge drastically sped up transactions.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s a slight difference, with slots occurring precisely every 12 seconds post-Merge compared with every 13.3 seconds pre-Merge. In any case, the change is barely noticeable by most users, as processing still usually depends on network congestion and transaction fees.\n\nWhen a transaction is initiated, it is logged into Ethereum\u2019s memory pool (mempool) and waits for validators to pick it up. The mempool functions much like a waiting room where pending transactions are held.\n\nOnce a validator enters transaction data into a block and adds the block to the blockchain, the transaction is considered complete. It is said to be finalized and irreversible after six additional blocks have been mined and added on top of it.\n\nBy checking a transaction\u2019s status, traders can confirm whether their transaction has succeeded or failed and how many blocks have been created since their transaction was added to the chain.\n\nWhy should traders check a transaction\u2019s status?\n\nEthereum participants must pay gas fees to use the network to transfer funds or deploy smart contracts. The fees largely depend on the number of participants waiting to execute transactions at a given time.\n\nNetwork congestion and demand are thus directly proportional to transaction costs. When demand is high, costs rise \u2014 the opposite is true when demand is low. In any case, checking a transaction\u2019s status helps a trader monitor the cost of using the network.\n\nIt can also help users determine if the gas fee they paid is sufficient to have their transaction confirmed. Low gas fees can usually truncate or delay transactions, leaving them to remain pending for long periods of time, especially during high network congestion.\n\nSuch transactions will remain pending until the gas fees reach the required minimum fees on the network. If this happens, a user can resend the transaction by resubmitting it and increasing the gas fee while ensuring it carries the same nonce.\n\nIn addition to transaction status, Ethereum blockchain explorers can also reveal the following helpful information:\n\nTimestamp: the date and time the transaction was added to the blockchain.\n\nBlock confirmations: the number of blocks mined since the transaction was confirmed.\n\nTransaction fee: the fee paid to the miner or validator.\n\nETH price: the price of ETH at the time of processing.\n\nBase fee: the lowest fee required to transact on Ethereum.\n\nGas limit: the maximum amount of gas the sender is allocating to process the transaction.\n\nNonce: a unique number marking each transaction executed on a user\u2019s wallet; it increases by one each time a new transaction is sent.\n\nBy being aware of the above, traders can stay on top of their ETH transactions and make sure transactions are processed correctly and quickly. This helps to ensure smooth Ethereum transactions when sending and receiving funds or deploying smart contracts. Understanding a transaction\u2019s status can also help users adjust their spending habits and optimize network usage."

On Saturday, Ethereum was trading around $1,966 and up 4% in the past 24 hours after rising to intraday highs of $2,008.\n\nEthereum isn\u2019t the only crypto asset to see a price bump in the past day. Bitcoin, the benchmark cryptocurrency and digital gold, rose to near $29,800 as a 3% price increase took bulls to within the now highly coveted $30k level.\n\nBoth Ethereum and Bitcoin are looking to benefit from an uptick in investor sentiment, particularly with risk appetite back following recent dips.\n\nWhy did Ethereum price go up?\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap rose 1.5% to above $1.27 trillion as memecoin mania returned with Pepe (PEPE) and Floki Inu (FLOKI) prices surging after listing on Binance.\n\nA look across the broader market shows crypto prices rebounded as the US stock market ended the week higher, with the major indices all turning green after a four-day losing streak.\n\nThe S&P 500 closed 1.85% up, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 546 points, or 1.65% and the Nasdaq closed 2.25% higher.\n\nThe positive returns for the market came as equities rebounded, led by shares of Apple (AAPL) that jumped to a nine-month high on the iPhone maker\u2019s better-than-expected quarterly report. The market also saw regional bank stocks show some recovery after massive sell-off in the week, with PacWest shares among those to rebound after falling over 60% on Thursday.\n\nWhile crypto and other risky assets are likely to benefit from overall investor sentiment, the coming week will be key as the markets assess April\u2019s CPI report.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinted this week that the central bank could pause its interest rates hike. However, with this week\u2019s strong jobs data, all eyes will be on the CPI data as investors evaluate the inflation indicator."

        "title": "I asked ChatGPT what it thinks of ETC, the answer did not disappoint - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Disclaimer: The information presented does not constitute financial, investment, trading, or other types of advice and is solely the writer\u2019s opinion\n\nIf you are considering adding proof of work cryptos in your portfolio, chances are you have shortlisted Ethereum Classic (ETC). It is one of the few remaining options in the PoW category, but you may have also noticed that it has been overshadowed, particularly by its counterpart \u2013 Ethereum (ETH).\n\nEthereum Classic\u2019s performance so far this year confirms that it can still attract investor attention. However, the network has been losing popularity from a long-term perspective. Speaking of popularity, artificial intelligence has really taken off this year, with ChatGPT leading this charge.\n\nAssessing fundamental data using the ChatGPT AI\n\nPerhaps we can leverage the power of AI to find out what the future has planned for ETC. I asked ChatGPT about Ethereum Classic and the interaction was rather interesting. The initial plan was to establish the depth of the AI before going deeper into the type of information that I wanted to pursue.\n\nThe first question requested ChatGPT to provide a detailed and concise explanation of Ethereum Classic and its fundamentals. Here\u2019s the response \u2013\n\nHere is the response after switching to dark mode and requesting a shorter version \u2013\n\nThe AI seemed to have a good handle on things based on the information it provided. However, there have been incidents where it generated inaccurate information, hence the need to verify the information. Now that we had a good base, it was time to up the ante a bit. But first, those keeping a close eye on ETC may have noticed that its community has not been very active. Its development has also lagged behind that of Ethereum and other networks.\n\nOur next query focused on establishing why the Ethereum Classic network is less popular than Ethereum. It gave the following reasons \u2013\n\nCommunity Support: After the 2016 DAO hack, the Ethereum community decided to implement a hard fork that created a new blockchain network known as Ethereum, which received support from the majority of the Ethereum community. Ethereum Classic, which remained on the original blockchain, has a smaller community and fewer developers. Lack of Updates: Ethereum Classic has not received as many updates and improvements as Ethereum. This has resulted in slower transaction times and less advanced smart contract capabilities. Perception of Immutability: Ethereum Classic\u2019s commitment to immutability is a key feature for some users. It can also be seen as a liability by others who prefer the flexibility of a blockchain that can be updated if necessary. Limited Use Cases: Ethereum has a wider range of use cases and is more widely adopted by businesses and developers. Ethereum Classic has a smaller ecosystem of decentralized applications and is less widely used in commercial applications.\n\nAI-generated all the above points but they are difficult to argue against. In other words, ChatGPT\u2019s answers were spot on \u2013\n\nEthereum Classic still has some edge over the competition\n\nI was curious to find out what the AI had to say about Ethereum Classic\u2019s advantages over its more popular counterpart. It responded with the following points:\n\nImmutability: Ethereum Classic has a strong commitment to immutability. Transactions cannot be altered or deleted once recorded on the blockchain. This makes ETC a reliable and secure platform for storing and transferring digital assets and may be particularly appealing to users who prioritize security and decentralization over flexibility and upgradability. Proven Technology: Ethereum Classic is based on the original Ethereum blockchain, which has been operating since 2015. This gives it a longer track record than many other blockchain platforms, and may be appealing to users who value stability and reliability. No Hard Forks: Since the split from Ethereum in 2016, Ethereum Classic has not undergone any hard forks or major upgrades that could potentially cause network disruptions or create competing blockchain networks. This could make it a more stable and predictable platform for developers and users.\n\nSo far so good, but the above answers got me thinking about the kind of scenario where Ethereum Classic would achieve mass adoption. These were the brief points that ChatGPT shared \u2013\n\nThe aforementioned points highlighted some of the key advantages of sticking to a proof-of-work system with a heavy focus on decentralization. These characteristics would make the network and its native coin more preferable, especially in case of a harsh regulatory crackdown. Regulators, especially in the United States, have adopted an aggressive position against cryptocurrencies, but not to the extreme, yet.\n\nAttempting to circumvent ETC\u2019s price analysis brick wall\n\nWhile still thinking about Ethereum Classic\u2019s prospects, I decided to explore whether the AI can have insightful predictions regarding ETC\u2019s prospects. More specifically, I wanted to know how soon ETC can reach ETH\u2019s $1,900 press time price. Unfortunately, the language-based AI algorithm could only do so much and predictions were the limit. Here is the answer that it provided \u2013\n\nThat would have been the end of that attempt, but I recently found out about the DAN (do anything now) jailbreak prompt which unlocks some limitations. Moreover, ChatGPT\u2019s algorithm learns and it can also organize raw data into a more useful format. Thus, an idea was born.\n\nWhat if we could somehow get chatGPT to understand the history of ETC\u2019s price action, including previous price patterns? We could potentially get it to give a more concrete answer regarding price predictions. Or so I thought. Unfortunately, none of the prompts including the jailbreak offered a concrete outcome where the AI could read the price charts and identify price patterns.\n\nBack to the basics of Ethereum Classic\u2019s technical analysis\n\nAfter having a \u201cfine, I will do it myself\u201d moment, I embarked on assessing ETC\u2019s latest price action.\n\nOn 13 April, the price of ETC increased as the cryptocurrency\u2019s recent uptrend gathered momentum. The price of the coin increased to a high of $22.47, which is the highest point since March 18 of this year. From this year\u2019s low, the coin has increased by more than 53%.\n\nEthereum Classic\u2019s price has come to the same point as it was at the beginning of the year, $19.4. ETC\u2019s performance should continue to improve but fluctuate in the $30s. According to the token\u2019s price forecast, it will range between $33.24 and $37.27.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s [BTC] value increased by over 80% this year, outperforming Tesla, equities, and gold. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, like Ethereum Classic, are closely related.\n\nSecond, the most recent U.S. consumer inflation statistics released on Wednesday had an impact on the price of Ethereum Classic. According to the data, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for March dropped to 5.0%, the lowest level since 2021.\n\nAdditionally, core inflation declined month over month. As a result, the Federal Reserve may change course shortly. This adjustment would include raising the stalling rates and maintaining them for a while.\n\nEthereum Classic also reacted positively to the recent Shapella Upgrade, whose activation allowed Ethereum Stackers to withdraw their tokens. The amount of Ethereum staked, according to data from Staking Rewards, is over $37 billion.\n\nThe resistance retest suggested that the price may potentially register a pivot. However, ETC\u2019s money flow indicator revealed that liquidity is still flowing into the cryptocurrency.\n\nAn extended rally in the next few months may be on the cards, especially now that ETC is still heavily discounted by as much as around 85%. Long-term predictions still remain within the realm of uncertainty.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Classic Profit Calculator\n\nConclusion\n\nUsing the ChatGPT AI did offer a significant advantage, especially in terms of the speed of accessing data. While it does not allow for price predictions, it does offer some valuable information. Contrary to expectations, it is still not able to do everything."

        "content": "Anatoly Yakovenko says that the Solana (SOL) chain is already set up to handle hundreds of millions of users.\n\nIn a new interview on Token Terminal\u2019s YouTube channel, Yakovenko says that he believes the Ethereum (ETH) rival has the capacity to handle the world\u2019s blockchain requirements.\n\n\u201cI can definitely see [Solana] handling all of the world\u2019s needs because when you look at today\u2019s bandwidth infrastructure around data centers, the one gigabit is the free tier. You get a box, they give you one gigabit for free and it costs less than a dollar per terabyte of egress right now, so bandwidth is ridiculously cheap right now.\u201d\n\nAccording to Yakovenko, even though Solana already has the ability to manage many users, it still lacks the applications to attract larger amounts of people.\n\n\u201cEvery two years there\u2019s a new generation, so from my perspective, I think we can already handle hundreds of millions of users and we have an abundance of capacity. We don\u2019t have the applications to actually attract those users yet.\u201d\n\nYakovenko goes on to name a few possible growth drivers that could bring more people to the Solana network, including Helium (HNT), a network of IoT devices that successfully migrated over to the Solana blockchain earlier this year, and Hivemapper, a decentralized map building tool.\n\n\u201cHelium created close to a million IoT (Internet of Things) hot spots, that\u2019s really cool. Think about virtual tokens moving around between people with cryptography impacting the physical world, there\u2019s literally a close to a million antennas generated from that, and they\u2019re going to attempt to do the same thing with 5G.\n\nHivemapper, on the other hand, is trying to map the entire world like Google Street View and there\u2019s 60 million kilometers in the world. They\u2019re already at [a] 2 million kilometers map, they just crossed that, they\u2019re growing.\u201d\n\nSolana is trading for $22.06 at time of writing, a 3.4% decrease during the last 24 hours.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nCheck Price Action\n\nFollow us on Twitter, Facebook and Telegram\n\nSurf The Daily Hodl Mix\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nSeasoned DeFi developer Kain Warwick recalled the popularity of Uniswap (UNI), which attracted FOMO-based high-risk traders, and stated that Ethereum-based L2 scalers might be on the eve of their own \"iPhone moment.\"\n\nWhy does crypto segment need meme coins on L2?\n\nOnce the first meme coin rallies on an Ethereum-based second-layer network, the audience will migrate outside of Ethereum (ETH). Driven by the expectations of enormous profits, newbie users will learn how to use cross-network bridges to move their value to new chains.\n\nThe first meme coin that blows up on L2 will shift this equilibrium. We've seen people learn to use uniswap to fomo into things, I think they will learn how to bridge to an L2 if some random thing is blowing up\u2026 https://t.co/sPslZvYtWA \u2014 kain.eth (@kaiynne) May 5, 2023\n\nWarwick shared this take commenting on a statement about meme coin traders' willingness to pay high fees, but not explore other blockchains like L2 networks Optimism (OP), Arbitrum (ARB) or alternative blockchains, including Avalanche (AVAX).\n\nHe recalled that some \"FOMO\"-motivated enthusiasts managed to migrate to Uniswap for the same reasons, i.e., to buy early-stage coins cheaper before they are listed on mainstream centralized exchanges.\n\nAs such, L2s and bridges to Ethereum (ETH) might onboard the next generation of traders once meme coins like Pepe (PEPE) start rallying there.\n\nYesterday, amid the euphoria around the Pepe (PEPE) listing on Binance (BNB), the Ethereum (ETH) network became almost unusable due to enormous fees.\n\nGame over for PEPE?\n\nYesterday, the average transaction fee for the Ethereum (ETH) network spiked above $30, which is the highest since the Terra (LUNA) ecosystem collapse in early May 2022.\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, the global crypto community is captivated by the euphoria around new meme coins led by Pepe (PEPE), a frog coin launched three weeks ago.\n\nIn just 20 days, it rallied by over 10,000%. However, its Binance (BNB) listing might be interpreted as the top of its price movement. In the last 24 hours, PEPE lost over 25% on major exchanges."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nFormer Maverick Capital officer and founder of North Rock Digital Hal Press is sure that the current outstanding position of Ethereum (ETH) in Web3 is deeply rooted in years of experiments and development.\n\n\"Not accident\": North Rock Digital's Press on supremacy of post-Shanghai Ethereum (ETH)\n\nEthereum (ETH) became an \"unquestioned arena\" for all top-tier on-chain players in the segment. This only became possible thanks to years-long hard work of its developers and should not be attributed to short-term speculative catalysts. This statement was made by Hal Press, head of North Rock Digital asset manager.\n\nImportant to recognize what is happening in the Ethereum ecosystem recently is more than just a flash in the pan of retail deciding to speculate. This is the culmination of many years of the highest quality dev work in the space. Capped off with Shanghai last month, ETH is now\u2026 \u2014 Hal Press (@NorthRockLP) May 5, 2023\n\nPress praised Ethereum (ETH) developers high in his tweet yesterday, May 5, 2023. He also highlighted the role of the successful Shanghai upgrade in ETH supremacy.\n\nThe Shapella upgrade (which Shanghai is an integral part of) took place April 12, 2023. It made it possible to withdraw Ethers (ETH) from its proof-of-stake (PoS) deposit contract.\n\nMany experts called this update the most important milestone of Ethereum's (ETH) journey from proof of work toward the proof-of-stake consensus. It is also of paramount importance for ETH tokenomics as the second largest crypto asset.\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, Press slammed Sui Network's (SUI) hotly anticipated presale campaign for being \"complete vaporware.\"\n\nShanghai makes Ethereum (ETH) stronger than ever before, analysts say\n\nPreviously, mainstream crypto enthusiasts were concerned about Shanghai activation as it could potentially trigger monstrous selling pressure. However, in Q1, 2022, a number of high-reputed analysts released their bullish predictions for the event.\n\nFor instance, Glassnode's team published a detailed report calculating the maximum potential damage for the Ethereum (ETH) price: It could not exceed 8% at worst due to limited withdrawal opportunities and mixed motivation of various groups of investors.\n\nAlso, blockchain veteran Chris Burniske opined that the opportunity to unstake Ether (ETH) from the deposit contract is a great derisking event for midterm strategies of investors with deposits of various sizes."

        "title": "Ethereum Reaches Elliott Wave Target Set in September - EWM Interactive",
        "content": "So far, 2023 has been very generous to crypto investors, who\u2019ve been beaten and bruised throughout the entire 2022. Bitcoin, still the biggest cryptocurrency out there, is up by 73% year-to-date. The second biggest, Ethereum, has climbed 57% since the beginning of the year. And while BTC is part of our paid service Elliott Wave PRO, we published a free analysis of ETH in late-September, 2022, predicting a 50%+ rally.\n\nEthereum was trading around $1380 at the time, but its recent Elliott Wave structure suggested that it can reach \u201cinitial bullish targets near $2100.\u201d In other words, \u201ca surge of 50% or more\u201c, we wrote, \u201cis likely to follow soon.\u201d The chart on which this prediction was based on is shown below.\n\nSimilar Elliott Wave setups occur in the Forex, commodity and stock markets, as well. Our Elliott Wave Video Course can teach you how to recognize them yourself!\n\nEthereum \u2018s 4h chart revealed an impulsive recovery between $880 and $2032, labeled 1-2-3-4-5. It was followed by a three-wave correction, marked A-B-C, down to the 61.8% Fibonacci support level. Taken together, these two patterns produced a complete 5-3 Elliott Wave cycle pointing north. So, even if it turned out that the corrective phase of the cycle wasn\u2019t over yet, it made sense to stay bullish as long as $880 was intact. And of course, it did turn out that Ethereum was still in retracement mode.\n\nWhat we thought was a complete correction evolved into a five-wave impulse, marked i-ii-iii-iv-v in wave A. Wave B led to a surge to $1677 in early-November, 2022, before wave C down finally completed the negative phase of the cycle at $1072. Staying bullish throughout these wild gyrations was certainly not easy. However, with a reliable impulse pattern in place and $880 still intact, the odds remained in favor of a rally to $2100.\n\nPocketing the Ethereum Rally Required Patience\n\nLess than seven months later, on April 16th, 2023, the price of Ethereum reached and exceeded our target. It rose to $2141, up 54% since our analysis, before falling back below the $2k mark as of this writing. All it took was an eye for Elliott Wave patterns and the patience and discipline required to take advantage of them.\n\nThis is how Elliott Wave analysis, or any other type of investing for that matter, really works. You identify a pattern or a security you think is reliable and then you leave it enough wiggle room in order to be able to wait it out until it bears fruit. You don\u2019t chase illusions of precision that simply cannot be achieved. When it comes to predicting the future, being approximately right is more than enough. Trying to be more precise than possible and to buy/sell the very bottom/top is only going to lead to more stop-loss hits, therefore more losses for you and more fees for your broker.\n\nNow, the recent drop from $2141 looks like the first two waves \u2013 1/a and 2/b \u2013 of a bigger move. Whether it evolves into a simple a-b-c zigzag or a bigger selloff remains to be seen. In both cases, though, we can expect more weakness towards the support near $1600. Then, the market would have an important decision to make.\n\nIn our Elliott Wave PRO subscriptions we provide analyses of Bitcoin, Gold, Crude Oil, EURUSD, USDCAD, USDJPY and the S&P 500 every Sunday and Wednesday!

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) volatility has shrunk further this week, and it is on track to form an inside-bar pattern on the weekly chart. Although the bulls are finding it difficult to clear the overhead hurdle in the $30,000 to $31,000 zone, a positive sign is that they have not ceded ground to the bears.\n\nIt is not only cryptocurrencies; even the S&P 500 Index has been oscillating inside a range for the past few days. This indicates that markets are awaiting a trigger to start the next directional move.\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nWhile the short-term price action is uncertain, analysts are getting bullish for the long term. Trader Titan of Crypto highlighted a potential signal on the Bollinger Bands monthly chart, which projects a rally to $63,500 in about a year.\n\nWhile most major cryptocurrencies gave up some ground over the past week, there are still some pockets of strength. Let\u2019s analyze the charts of five cryptocurrencies that may turn up in the short term.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBitcoin turned down sharply from the resistance line of the symmetrical triangle pattern on May 6, indicating that the bears are not willing to let the bulls through. A minor positive is that the bulls have been buying the dips to the support line of the triangle, as seen from the long tail on the day\u2019s candlestick.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe flattish 20-day exponential moving average ($28,819) and the relative strength index (RSI) near the midpoint do not signal a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears.\n\nIf the price breaks below the triangle, it will suggest that bears are trying to seize control. The BTC/USDT pair may first fall to $26,942 and then to $25,250.\n\nOn the other hand, a break and close above the triangle will suggest that the bulls have absorbed the supply. That may start a rally to $32,400 where the bears are again expected to mount a strong defense.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBuyers nudged the price above the triangle but the long wick on the candlestick shows that the breakout turned out to be a bull trap in the near term. BTC price turned down sharply and plunged to the support line of the triangle.\n\nThe bounce off this level has reached the moving averages, which is a key short-term level to watch out for. If Bitcoin\u2019s price turns down from the current level, that would raise the chances of a break below the support line.\n\nContrarily, if buyers kick the price above the moving averages, the pair may rise to the resistance line. The bulls will have to drive and sustain the price above this level to start an up-move.\n\nEther price analysis\n\nEther (ETH) faced a strong rejection above the psychological resistance at $2,000 on May 7. This indicates that the bears have not given up and they continue to protect the overhead resistance levels.\n\nETH/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-day EMA ($1,903) has flattened out and the RSI is near the midpoint, indicating that the ETH/USDT pair may remain range-bound in the near term. The boundaries of the range could be between $2,000 and $1,785.\n\nA consolidation just below the local high is a positive sign. It shows that the bulls are in no hurry to book profits, increasing the possibility of a break above $2,200.\n\nOn the contrary, if the price plunges below $1,785, it will suggest that bears have seized control. That could start a fall to $1,619.\n\nETH/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bears could not build upon the break below the 50-simple moving average. This shows that the selling pressure reduces at lower levels. The bulls are trying to stage a recovery by sustaining the price above the 20-EMA. If they can pull it off, the pair will again try to retest the crucial resistance at $2,000.\n\nOn the contrary, if ETH price turns down from the current level and breaks below the 50-SMA, it will suggest that the bears are in command. That could sink the pair to the support line.\n\nMonero price analysis\n\nMonero (XMR) is trying to stay above the moving averages, indicating that the bulls are attempting a comeback.\n\nXMR/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe flattish 20-day EMA ($156) and the RSI just above the midpoint indicate a balance between supply and demand. If buyers thrust XMR price above the neckline of the inverse head and shoulders pattern, the advantage will tilt in their favor.\n\nThe XMR/USDT pair may then start a new up-move. There is a minor resistance at $181 but if that is crossed, the pair may reach $187.\n\nInstead, if the price turns down from the current level or the neckline, it will suggest that the bears remain active at higher levels. The sellers will then try to yank the price below the $149-support, opening the door for a decline to $130.\n\nXMR/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the price rebounded off the 50-SMA, but the bulls could not pierce the resistance line. This shows that the bears are selling on rallies. If the price snaps back from the 20-EMA, it will suggest that the sentiment is turning positive and traders are buying on dips.\n\nThe bulls will then make another attempt to clear the overhead hurdle. If they manage to do that, the pair could first rise to $162 and then to $164.\n\nAlternatively, if the price turns down and breaks below the 50-SMA, it will suggest that bears are in control. That will increase the likelihood of a retest of the support line.\n\nRelated: The Ethereum Foundation just sold $30M in Ether \u2014 But will ETH price fall this time?\n\nOKB price analysis\n\nOKB (OKB) is trading inside a large symmetrical triangle pattern. Generally, in this setup, traders buy near the support line and sell near the resistance.\n\nOKB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bears are trying to maintain OKB price below the 50-day SMA ($45.57) while the bulls are attempting to reclaim the level. If the price turns up from the current level or rebounds off the support line, it will suggest demand at lower levels.\n\nIf buyers shove the price above the 20-day EMA ($46.87), it will suggest that the OKB/USDT pair may prolong its stay inside the triangle for some more time.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if bears sink the price below the triangle, it will suggest that the setup has behaved as a reversal pattern. That could start a new downtrend that is likely to pull the pair to $37.\n\nOKB/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bulls are trying to defend the horizontal support near $44.35, but they have not been able to propel the price above the moving averages. This suggests that every minor relief rally is being sold into. If the price turns down from the current level and plummets below $44.35, the pair may slump to $41.70.\n\nConversely, if the price rises above the moving averages, it will signal accumulation at lower levels. The pair could first rise to $49.50 and thereafter attempt a rally to $53.\n\nRocket Pool price analysis\n\nRocket Pool (RPL) is looking strong as it is trading above the moving averages. This shows that the bulls are buying on dips.\n\nRPL/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bulls will have to propel the price above the overhead resistance at $53.45 to signal that the corrective phase may be over. The RPL/USDT pair may thereafter attempt a rally to $58.\n\nAnother possibility is that RPL price rises from the 20-day EMA ($48.36) but turns down from $53.45. That will indicate a possible range-bound action between the 50-day SMA ($46.13) and $53.45 for some time.\n\nA break and close below the 50-day SMA will be the first indication that the bears are in command. That will open the doors for a potential decline to $37.\n\nRPL/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bears are trying to sustain the price below the 20-EMA while the bulls are trying to push the price above it. If buyers succeed, the pair may rise to the downtrend line. This is the key short-term level to watch for. If this resistance is overcome, the pair may rally to $53.45.\n\nContrarily, if the price turns down from the current level and breaks below the 50-SMA, the price risks dropping to the support line. The bulls are likely to defend this level fiercely.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Cardano NFTs grow from strength to strength \u2013 enough to flip Ethereum and Solana? - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "After a slow start to the year, Cardano NFTs have picked up momentum.\n\nDespite various milestones, collections under the blockchain have not matched up to their Ethereum counterparts.\n\nOver the last few years, the Non-Fungible Token (NFT) market has grown to become a billion-dollar industry. However, it seems like the sector has not reached its peak, as SkyQuest Technology predicted that the market value could surpass $122 billion by 2028.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ADA\u2019s market cap in ETH\u2019s terms\n\nTwo undeniable contributors to the current market level are the Ethereum [ETH] blockchain and Solana [SOL]. However, these are not the only ones that have had significant input into the ecosystem.\n\nCardano [ADA] NFTs have also had a tremendous impact on the sector. DappRadar, in October 2022, reported that the Cardano NFTs had become the third-biggest protocol in the ecosystem.\n\nAt that time, Cardano had just completed its much-anticipated Vasil upgrade. The upgrade, which was meant to enhance block latency speed and efficiency on the blockchain, propelled an increase in Unique Active Wallets (UAW) on the blockchain. The report noted,\n\n\u201cThe Cardano marketplace JPG Store had a 13.66% growth in the number of unique active wallets in the last 30 days. Moreover, the NFT marketplace saw a 40% increase in trading volume, reaching $11.2 million.\u201d\n\nThis metric shows the number of distinct addresses interacting with decentralized applications (dApps) under a protocol. In turn, this led to the NFT volume crossing $19 million within 30 days of the period.\n\nCardano NFTs: The journey to relevance\n\nCardano, known for its scalability and sustainability, entered the NFT space with CardanoKidz being the first collection. Although this collection started in a rookie way, as there was no real utility, it could still sell out using the ADA native token standard.\n\nThough several projects followed, Cardano has still not been able to flip Ethereum and Solana, the two prominent platforms in the NFT market.\n\nEthereum has long been the dominant player in the NFT space. However, its network congestion and high gas fees have caused some users to explore alternative platforms. Solana, on the other hand, has gained attention for its fast and low-cost transactions.\n\nHowever, Cardano\u2019s foray into NFTs brings its own unique advantages, such as its focus on sustainability and the promise of interoperability. But it doesn\u2019t just end there as here are three other unique features of Cardano NFTs:\n\n\n\nCardano NFTs can be created without the need for smart contracts.\n\nSince the blockchain is divided into the settlement and computational layers, fees can be very minimal.\n\nCardano NFTs allow a bunch of transfers of assets with multiple destinations but only one transaction fee.\n\nToday\u2019s worth isn\u2019t yesterday\u2019s value\n\nHowever, it remains to be seen if these features can help Cardano NFTs outperform Ethereum and Solana and reshape the NFT landscape. But surely, their entry certainly adds more diversity and competition to the market.\n\nCoincidentally, there seems to have been a change in Cardano\u2019s performance in the space. According to Santiment, the last quarter (Q4) of 2022 was not really an impressive season for the NFTs. And this lasted until mid-March of the new year.\n\nBut since that period, interest in Cardano NFTs has been massive. Based on on-chain data, the NFT trade volume reached a Year-To-Date (YTD) high of $16.98 million on 18 March. After another period of highs and lows, it was able to record a monthly high of 8.68 million on 2 May, despite only being in the first week.\n\nThis means that many traders now considered Cardano NFTs as one with potential, even as a lot of unique addresses seemed to have jumped ship.\n\nShares, developments, and prospect for the future\n\nMeanwhile, Cardano\u2019s development arm Input Output was not taking any chances of losing out on the NFT market share. On 14 April, the group announced the launch of Lace.io, its first native wallet.\n\nLace, the new wallet platform from IOG, aims to redefine the #Web3 experience & make it accessible to everyone. Explore @lace_io\u2019s pre-launch achievements, its core objectives, features, and journey now that it\u2019s LIVE on mainnet.#LacePlatform #Cardano https://t.co/JnezJnudML \u2014 Input Output (@InputOutputHK) April 14, 2023\n\nAnd according to its blog post, the Lace wallet would allow users to send and receive Cardano digital assets. Thus, helping to boost Cardano\u2019s presence in the NFT scene.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ADAs worth today?\n\nAlthough Cardano has been pushing toward increased adoption, it has not yet matched Ethereum\u2019s hype. But many other collections have emerged including EarthNode, Mocossi Planet, and Clay Nation, among others. Also, JPG Store has been its largest marketplace, accounting for over 99% of the market share in the last 24 hours.\n\nIn conclusion, the rise of Cardano NFTs presents an intriguing prospect for the future of the digital collectibles market. Furthermore, its potential to challenge the dominance of Ethereum and Solana has positioned it as a promising alternative for NFT creators and collectors.\n\nHowever, the success of Cardano NFTs in flipping Ethereum and Solana ultimately depends on various factors, including network adoption, developer support, and user demand."

        "title": "Bitcoin, Ethereum & Big Eyes Coin Are All On Their Way To The Bull Market - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The most important thing to understand about bear markets is that they are incredibly brief compared to bull markets. That could come as an unexpected blow when you look at the investments in your account and feel the declines will never end. However, the average bear market in the stock market from 1929 to 2022 lasted about 9.7 months, as measured by a 20% or more significant drop in the S&P 500 stock index.\n\nA bear market is a 20% loss from the stock market\u2019s recent highs. When the stock market increases by 20% or more over a continuous period, it is said to be in a bull market.\n\nHowever, there were some positive changes in the first quarter of 2023. Bitcoin reached $30,000 after trading at about $16,500 in early January. Meanwhile, Ethereum\u2019s value has nearly doubled from its June 2022 close of $1,071, and Big Eyes Coin (BIG) has raised $35 million in a presale that\u2019s still ongoing.\n\nBear markets may be terrible for investors, but thankfully, the anguish is typically short-lived. It\u2019s natural to be anxious about the possibility of a bear market shortly. However, most investors should not be concerned about a bear market, and you know why? Because the bear market is finally over.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Ends Hibernation\n\nBitcoin has grown for four months, an exceptional occurrence in its history. This pattern has never before resulted in new lows, implying that the Bitcoin bear market may have ended.\n\nSince then, Bitcoin prices have doubled, with the financial crisis that has now moved to Silicon Valley-based First Republic reigniting interest in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and crypto.\n\nYet as the legacy banking system faces significant challenges, future events will reveal if this pattern holds and if the Bitcoin bear market ends.\n\nEthereum\u2019s (ETH) Fortunes Have Reversed Around\n\nETH\u2019s trading volumes have reached $7.54 billion in the past several days, indicating that traders are attempting to book low-priced gains. Given the small increases reported during this period, it is evident that purchasers are generating the vast majority of volumes.\n\nThis may appear to be a bold claim, but Ethereum (ETH) is expected to begin outperforming Bitcoin. Ethereum can generate 5x returns if it reaches $50,000 to $60,000 by the end of the year.\n\nThe first reason to be optimistic is the belief that the Ethereum merging factor is still included in the pricing. During the last bull market, Ethereum reached highs of $4,900.\n\nAn additional cause to be optimistic last year was Vitalik Buterin\u2019s statement that Ethereum production was just 55% complete following the merger. Bitcoin is said to be \u201c80% complete.\u201d The average amount of transactions per second will increase due to sharding.\n\nAccording to market experts, Ethereum might embark on one of cryptocurrency history\u2019s most incredible bull runs. Over the last few days, the price of ether has been consolidating.\n\nBig Eyes Coin: The Only Cat Capable of Beating the Bear\n\n\u200b\u200bThe presale of Big Eyes Coin is another success of the crypto industry. This innovative concept will use fintech advancements to provide a quick and safe transaction platform. As an outcome, the currency will likely pique the curiosity of cryptocurrency investors looking for the next big thing in the industry.\n\nBig Eyes Coin confirmed that the presale would end on June 3rd, offering investors one final chance to acquire this digital asset. That means you still have time to join the presale using the unique promo END300, which will provide you with a 300% bonus from Big Eyes Coin.\n\nBig Eyes Coin, the largest meme currency presale, has already broken records by gathering over $35 million in investment. This achievement demonstrates how popular meme-inspired currencies are growing and suggests that similar projects may attract significant support from the crypto community. The project might contribute to market growth.\n\nThe future of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies remains to be determined owing to the challenges confronting the legacy banking system and the disparities in regulatory approaches adopted by various countries.\n\nAs the global field of finance advances, governments, banks, and investors must constantly track these developments and adjust accordingly to guarantee the cryptocurrency sector\u2019s secure and profitable future.\n\nFor more on Big Eyes Coin (BIG):\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nOpenSea: https://opensea.io/collection/big-eyes-lootbox-cards\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/BigEyesCoin\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Uniswap sees a record number of active users on its platform.\n\nUsers are flocking to Uniswap in search of new meme coins.\n\nUniswap Sets Record for Active Users: 15,000 ETH Burned\n\nUniswap, the decentralized finance platform, has seen a surge in activity on its Ethereum network. According to data from Dune Analytics, which provides data on blockchain and decentralized finance, Uniswap has reached a new record for the number of active users on its platform, surpassing 30 million.\n\nGrowth Rate Remains Below 2021 Record\n\nAlthough the growth rate has increased due to the recent craze for meme coins, it has not yet reached the record set in May 2021. However, the number of users continues to increase.\n\nUniswap\u2019s Airdrop Put it on the Map\n\nUniswap, the largest decentralized finance exchange, gained popularity in September 2020 with its airdrop. At the time, the platform had around 1 million users on the Ethereum network. Since then, Uniswap has expanded to several other networks, but Ethereum remains the most popular. According to Dune Analytics, the number of users on the Ethereum network continues to increase and has now surpassed 30 million.\n\n15,000 ETH Burned in One Week\n\nUniswap\u2019s impact on the Ethereum network is also evident in the number of Ether burned. Since the switch from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake with EIP 1559, Uniswap-linked contracts have burned over 15,000 ETH in the last seven days. This accounts for half of the total net Ether burned in the same period.\n\nUniswap\u2019s Growth Rate\n\nUniswap has been growing steadily in popularity, especially in the past year. However, while the growth rate has increased due to the recent craze for meme coins, it has not yet reached the record set in May 2021.\n\nUniswap\u2019s Impact on Ethereum Network\n\nUniswap\u2019s popularity is having an impact on the Ethereum network, particularly in terms of the amount of Ether being burned. Since the switch to Proof-of-Stake, Uniswap-linked contracts have burned a significant amount of Ether, highlighting the platform\u2019s importance within the broader Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nIn summary, Uniswap\u2019s popularity continues to rise, driven in part by the surge in meme coins. The platform\u2019s impact on the Ethereum network is evident in the number of Ether being burned, and its expansion to other networks has also contributed to its growth.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

        "title": "NFT Ordinals usher meme coin mania on Bitcoin - FXStreet",
        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin blockchain\u2019s BRC-20 tokens have witnessed massive price rallies despite low trading volume.\n\nMeme coins on the Bitcoin blockchain have hit a market capitalization of $320 million.\n\nBRC-20 transactions have pushed miners\u2019 fees 11% higher, reminding users of elevated transaction fees from 2020.\n\nOrdinals are a type of NFT (non-fungible token) on the Bitcoin blockchain, founded by Casey Rodarmor. BRC-20 is an experimental token standard on the Bitcoin blockchain modelled after Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 that allows users to attach data to individual satoshis (Ordinals) on the BTC blockchain.\n\nThe recent spike in BRC-20 adoption and popularity is driving a meme coin rally on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nAlso read: AAVE V3 deployment on Ethereum layer 2 METIS network unanimously approved\n\nMeme coins thrive on the Bitcoin blockchain\n\nCrypto assets built on the BRC-20 token standard are rallying. The category\u2019s market capitalization climbed to $320 million, despite low trading volume.\n\nMeme coins on the Bitcoin blockchain\n\nGate.io, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, recently announced the listing of BRC-20 token ORDI, fueling a rally in the meme coin. Minting meme BRC-20 tokens has emerged as a trend and crypto experts at Airdrop Official have shared a step-by-step process for the same.\n\nBRC-20 is the next trend.\n\n\n\nIt has already reached a $300Mn+ market cap within just 2 months of launch.\n\n\n\nStill way too much smaller than ERC20's marketcap, making it an early opportunity for #Airdrops.\n\n\n\nHere is how to mint, buy BRC-20, and more pic.twitter.com/QtDLVI8fEm \u2014 Airdrop Official (@its_airdrop) May 7, 2023\n\nAssessing the impact on the Bitcoin blockchain\n\nThe arrival of BRC-20 tokens and their popularity has resulted in an increase in block generation time on the BTC blockchain. A Chinese journalist, Colin Wu, reported that the Bitcoin network did not produce a block at block height 788,759 for nearly an hour today. A similar occurrence was noted on June 11, 2021, when the block generation time at a height of 687,143 reached 119 minutes. In April 2021 it was as high as 122 minutes.\n\nHigher block generation time slows down the Bitcoin blockchain and this is a negative impact of BRC-20 projects on BTC. Interestingly, Ordinals or Bitcoin-based NFTs have significantly influenced miner fees, pushing them 11% higher to levels observed in 2020.\n\nBitcoin miner revenue from fees\n\nA spike in fees on the Bitcoin network translates to higher revenue for miners in the BTC network. Ordinals have therefore increased miner revenue, but they have not catalyzed a Bitcoin price rally yet.\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin is exchanging hands below the $28,000 level following the recent pullback."
