        "title": "Ethereum's Shanghai upgrade could supercharge liquid staking derivatives \u2014 Here's how - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The crypto market witnessed the DeFi summer of 2020, where decentralized finance applications like Compound and Uniswap turned Ether (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) into yield-bearing assets via yield farming and liquidity mining rewards. The price of Ether nearly doubled to $490 as the total liquidity across decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols quickly surged to $10 billion.\n\nToward the end of 2020 and early 2021, the COVID-19-induced quantitative easing across global markets was in full effect, causing a mega-bull run that lasted almost a year. During this time, Ether\u2019s price increased nearly ten times to a peak above $4,800.\n\nAfter the euphoric bullish phase ended, a painful cool-down journey was exacerbated by the UST-LUNA crash which began in early 2022. This took Ether\u2019s price down to $800. A ray of hope eventually arrived in the third quarter as the market experienced a positive rally led by the Ethereum Merge narrative.\n\nThe shift to an environmentally-friendly proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism was a big step forward. The event also reduced Ether inflation post-merge. During a lead-up to the Merge on Sept. 15, 2021, ETH peaked at over $2,000. However, the bullish momentum faded quickly, turning the Merge into a buy-the-rumor and sell-the-news event.\n\nA similar bullish opportunity could be brewing in Ether as the upcoming Shanghai upgrade scheduled for March 2023 grabs the market spotlight. The upgrade will finally enable withdrawals from Ethereum staking contracts, which are locked presently. The upgrade will significantly reduce the risk of staking ETH.\n\nIt will provide an opportunity for liquidity staking protocols to grow. The governance tokens of some of these protocols have jumped since the start of the new year as hype builds around.\n\nThere\u2019s a possibility that the upgrade can push these tokens toward last year\u2019s Merge highs. Moreover, Ethereum\u2019s staking space is still in its early stages, providing a market opportunity for the growth of these protocols.\n\nThe percentage of staked Ether is low\n\nCurrently, 13.18% of Ether\u2019s total supply is staked on the Beacon Chain, which is low compared to other PoS chains like Cosmos Hub with a staking ratio of 62.5%, Cardano with 71.8%, and Solana at 71.4%. The reason for Ethereum\u2019s low staking ratio is that the Staked Ether (stETH) is locked in its current state, but this will change in March.\n\nEthereum has the lowest staking ratio compared to other L1 blockchains. Source: Staking Rewards\n\nThe upcoming Shanghai upgrade will include a code known as EIP 4895 that will allow Beacon Chain staked Ether withdrawals, enabling a 1:1 exchange of staked Ether for Ether. Ethereum\u2019s staking ratio should reach parity with other leading PoS networks after this update. A significant portion of which will likely move to liquid staking protocols.\n\nDe-risking of liquid staking derivatives\n\nLiquid staking protocols like Lido and Rocket Pool let Ether holders stake without running a validator node. Since Ether is pooled, a single user doesn\u2019t have a minimum threshold of 32 ETH (worth around $40,000) for staking. People can stake fractions of Ether, reducing the entry barrier for staking.\n\nThe protocols also enable liquidity provision for staked assets, which would otherwise be locked in the staking contracts. The DeFi contracts give a derivative token (for instance, Lido\u2019s stETH) in exchange for staked Ether on the proof-of-stake (PoS) network. A user can trade with stETH while earning yields from the staking contract.\n\nAs Ethereum\u2019s staking ratio increases after March\u2019s update, the use of liquidity staking protocols will likely increase with it. Currently, the liquid staking protocols account for 32.65% of the total staked Ether. Due to the benefits mentioned above, their market share should remain near or above current levels after the Shanghai upgrade.\n\nThe governance tokens of liquid staking protocols could also benefit from their increased locked value, similar to DeFi tokens, which benefited from a rise in total locked value (TVL) in the latest bull run.\n\nHow are LSD governance tokens performing ahead of Shanghai?\n\nLido DAO (LDO)\n\nLido DAO is the leader of the liquid staking space with higher annual yield and market share than other protocols. Lido commands 88.55% of the total Staked Ether in these protocols.\n\nLet's take the amount of staked Ether as a proxy for evaluating the protocol. We again find that Lido has the most competitive market capitalization to Staked Ether ratio.\n\nSource: Coingecko, Dune Analytics\n\nThe weak point of the project\u2019s token economics is that LDO is a governance token. It doesn\u2019t entitle holders to a share of the generated yield or fees. Moreover, the token has additional inflation from investor token unlocking until May this year.\n\nLDO 4-hour price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nTechnically, the LDO token broke above the short-term resistance of around $1.17 with significant buying volume. Bulls will likely target $1.80, capitalizing on the hype around the Shanghai upgrade.\n\nThe token is heavily shorted in the futures market after the recent 26% rise in its price since Jan. 1. The funding rate for LDO perpetual swap turned negative with a large magnitude, providing an opportunity for a further uptrend in a short-squeeze. The current support levels for LDO are $1.17 and $1.\n\nRocket Pool (RPL)\n\nRocket Pool is similar to Lido, albeit smaller in size. The market capitalization to the stETH ratio of the platform is five times larger than Lido, which likely makes it overpriced.\n\nNevertheless, the RPL token has additional utility besides governance as an insurance token for users. Node operators stake RPL as insurance, where users receive the staked RPL in case of losses due to the operator's fault.\n\nThe Ethereum Merge high of RPL in September 2021 was $34.30. Since the start of 2023, its price has increased by 10%, last trading at $22.40. If buyers are successful in building support above the $20 level, there\u2019s a possibility that RPL can reach last year\u2019s high of $30, which was attained around the Ethereum Merge.\n\nAnkr (ANKR)\n\nAnkr is a blockchain infrastructure provider which offers API endpoints and runs RPC nodes besides staking solutions. Similar to LDO, ANKR is only used for governance purposes.\n\nThe token\u2019s price has stayed relatively flat over the last few days. The market capitalization to the staked Ether ratio of Ankr is on the higher side at par with Rocket Pool, which is a negative sign.\n\nStill, if the hype around Shanghai upgrade increases, ANKR can reach August 2021 highs of $0.05. The recent breakdown level of $0.03 will act as resistance for buyers. Currently, the token is trading around $0.015.\n\nStakewise (SWISE)\n\nStakewise offers the highest staking yield of 4.43%. Its governance token is comparatively less inflated than RPL and ANKR in the market capitalization to Staked Ether ratio, making it cheaper than RPL and ANKR.\n\nHowever, the token distribution is adversely skewed towards private investors and the founding team, which have 46.9% of SWISE\u2019s total supply. According to data from Nansen, wallets identified as \u201csmart money\u201d have been slowly accumulating SWISE since April 2021.\n\nSmart wallet holdings of SWISE tokens. Source: Nansen\n\nThe Ethereum Merge high for SWISE was $0.23, which will be the likely target for buyers. The support lies near 2022-lows around $0.07.\n\nShared Stake is flagged red because the protocol was suspected of an insider exploit, which caused a 95% decline in the token\u2019s price in June 2021. The high staking return of the Shared Stake compared to others is also an eyebrow-raising detail to take note of. On the other hand, Cream Finance has discontinued its Ether staking service.\n\nThe upcoming Ethereum Shanghai upgrade provides an opportunity for the liquid staking space to grow. Lido DAO is the clear leader in this space with an optimum market price. The de-risking of ETH staking and hype around the event could translate to a series of rallies that could push the price of LDO and other liquid staking protocols back to their Merge highs from last year.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Ethereum merge - what it means for investors, users, miners, and the climate - iTMunch",
        "content": "A major event took place in the crypto industry in 2022. On September 15, Ethereum made the switch from the energy-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) model to the energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) model. Dubbed the \u201cmerge\u201d this event was a major highlight across the global crypto sector for several reasons.\n\nGreg King, the Founder and CEO of Osprey Funds, says that this transition is similar to the upgrade from fiberoptics to dial-up modems that made the internet more accessible for numerous applications including music streaming, online storage, and more.\n\nWhile proponents of the \u201cmerge\u201d saw the transition coming from afar, it took others by surprise. Regardless of what side of the spectrum lie, the bottom line is the \u201cmerge\u201d is done and it is time to focus on the future.\n\nAlmost six months into the merge, it is a good time to ask yourself what it means for you. Are you an investor, an ETH miner or a user?\n\nThis article examines the impact of the Ethereum merge on investors, ETH miners, the environment, and crypto users.\n\nLet us begin by understanding the merge.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE: Is proof of reserve enough to revive customer confidence and trust in custodial institutions?\n\nEthereum merge explained\n\nThe Ethereum \u201cmerge\u201d is nothing but an essential upgrade that primarily changes how new crypto transactions will take place on the blockchain.\n\nHow have things changed now? Before the upgrade, the Ethereum blockchain worked on the proof-of-work model. This means that it involved nodes \u2013 individual computers that are part of a larger network of computers that are up against one another to solve complex math problems. A successful node can then proceed to mine the next block of a certain transaction to create new coins.\n\nThe model is energy-intensive and a huge threat to the environment in the long run. Naturally, as the alarm bells for climate change and global warming grew louder, the need to shift to an energy-efficient model was the need of the hour.\n\nThe model is energy-intensive and a huge threat to the environment in the long run. Naturally, as the alarm bells for climate change and global warming grew louder, the need to shift to an energy-efficient model was the need of the hour. But what makes the proof-of-stake model energy efficient? In this case, an algorithm chooses a node that holds more of a particular network\u2019s currency.\n\nBut what makes the proof-of-stake model energy efficient? In this case, an algorithm chooses a node that holds more of a particular network\u2019s currency. In simple words, their \u201cstake\u201d in the network is rewarded rather than the computer power that is essentially rewarded in the proof-of-work system.\n\nWhy was Ethereum merge needed?\n\nAdvocates of the merge say that the upgrade enables the Ethereum network to minimize energy consumption by as much as 99%.\n\nAs mentioned before, the proof-of-stake model uses less energy than the proof-of-work model, which is what the Bitcoin network uses. Many cryptocurrency sceptics and supporters alike have emphasized the detrimental environmental effects of cryptocurrency transactions, therefore Ethereum\u2019s switch to the less energy-intensive proof-of-stake is seen as a big advancement.\n\nAdditionally, it will also lay the foundation for other elements of the network\u2019s roadmap, such as improving transaction efficiency.\n\nImpact of the Ethereum merge\n\nNow that we have a basic idea regarding the merge, let\u2019s understand the impact it has on different sets of people and the environment.\n\nEthereum merge: Impact on investors\n\nWhile the merge leads to a greener and environmental-friendly future, it is highly unlikely that it will make the network faster or reduce transaction costs anytime soon. However, investors will see the compounded benefits over a longer period.\n\nAccording to King, at this point, no outcome is certain. However, the merge is likely to be bullish for crypto investors in the long run as it lays a solid foundation for ecosystem development and future upgrades.\n\nEventually, we expect faster transactions and lower fees, which in turn would attract more users, increasing the overall value of Ether (Ethereum\u2019s native crypto). If we see a rise in the number of investors, the supply will naturally take go down.\n\nAll in all, we predict that the adoption of the PoS will grow in the future.\n\nEthereum merge: Impact on users\n\nThe merge has happened and users are naturally curious to find out what it means to them. Well, the merge brings some good news for climate-conscious users. While there is no doubt that this approach is cleaner and greener than the proof-of-work model, not much will change other than that, at least in the short term.\n\nEthereum transactions may eventually become much quicker than they are at the moment. That said, we have a long way to go. Why do we say so? According to the Ethereum Foundation, it is largely because the shift to proof-of-stage will mean that the blocks are produced at a 10% faster speed than they are on the proof-of-work network.\n\nNaturally, quicker Ethereum transactions would be wonderful. Similar to when you buy things with a credit card, it gives a sense of security and satisfaction when the transaction is complete. However, with the PoS network, it would take some time for things to speed up.\n\nEthereum merge: Impact on crypto miners\n\nHow are crypto miners responding to the merge? How are they getting on with things in the post-merge era? As of now, miners have come up with different ways to adapt to last year\u2019s merge.\n\nFor example, AntPool, the mining pool associated with Bitmain, announced that it will invest around $10 million to develop applications for Ethereum Classic. Further, Ethermine, which is also the largest Ethereum mining pool in the world, said that it will roll out a Beta version of its staking pool service \u2013 EtherMine Staking.\n\nSoon after the merge, multiple reports stated that Ethereum miners will oppose the merge by hard-forking, or fundamentally altering, the network. However, that has not happened yet and we do not see how the miners will succeed in the future. Luxor Technology, one of the leading providers of full-stack bitcoin (BTC) mining software and services, has invested in Ethereum mining despite understanding the possibility of further changes in the future.\n\nAlthough most miners would have preferred that the Ethereum blockchain stayed with the PoW model, they are rooting for Ethereum to succeed.\n\nEthereum merge: Impact on climate\n\nWhat is the future of cryptocurrency? While there are multiple facets involved in fully understanding what the future of cryptocurrency looks like, one thing is certain, we are heading toward an eco-friendly future.\n\nThe move to the PoS model is expected to play a significant role in minimizing Ethereum\u2019s energy consumption by a staggering 99.95%. Now isn\u2019t that something? At some point last year, the cryptocurrency network consumed as much electricity as the entire nation of Bangladesh. Naturally, when such humongous amounts of energy are consumed, it results in unwanted levels of carbon dioxide pollution, expediating climate change.\n\nWill the merge put an end to Ethereum\u2019s glaring problems related to the environment? If things go as planned, the upgrade will trim Ethereum\u2019s environmental footprint by a considerable margin. As mentioned earlier, the PoS model eliminates the existing challenges in the PoW model i.e., consumption of unprecedented amounts of electricity and powerful hardware required to keep the blockchain up and running.\n\nProof of stake requires validators to lock up cryptocurrency tokens as collateral, which serves as an alternative to employing exorbitant energy costs to dissuade unethical behaviour. In this approach, the validators have the incentive to maintain the accuracy of the ledger. The offender forfeits any staked tokens if someone else on the network discovers that they have added invalid blocks to the chain. As the merge is expected to slash Ethereum\u2019s energy consumption by 99.95%, we are expected to see considerable energy savings in the future.\n\nFuture of cryptocurrency \u2013 a greener future on the horizon\n\nWe have seen the impact of the Ethereum merge on users, ETH miners, investors, and the climate. What have we managed to find out? It is still unclear whether the upgrade will lower the transaction fees or accelerate crypto payments. However, we are certainly taking the right steps toward a cleaner and greener crypto industry.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE: Are decentralized exchanges the answer to crypto exchange liquidity problems?\n\nStay tuned and continue reading iTMunch to know more about the latest blockchain trends, news, and more!\n\nFeature Image Source: Photo by Zoltan Tasi on Unsplash\n\nImage 1 Source: Photo by Kanchanara on Unsplash\n\nImage 2 Source: https://www.rawpixel.com/"

According to their tweet, an order has been placed of 26,000 Ethereum put options. The strike price for it was set at $400, the options will expire June 30 this year.\n\n\n\nThe strike price of a put option implies that when the option expires, a trader can sell the underlying asset at this price level even if it goes lower.\n\nRecently, there has been a large order of 26,000 ETH put options with a strike price of $400 and an expiration date of Jun 30. Some traders believe this is the tail management behavior of crypto whales. According to @Blofin_Official pic.twitter.com/VmYC44939h \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) January 7, 2023\n\nThus, some whales are likely to bet on the second largest cryptocurrency to drop to the $400 level, which was last seen in late 2020. However, Wu added that this could also be tail management behavior as whales are buying large amounts of put options to protect their positions.\n\nA user in the comment thread assumed that the whales might be expecting the ETH price to plummet that much once the Ethereum locked in the ETH 2.0 deposit contract is allowed for withdrawals after the Shanghai upgrade. This upgrade is scheduled for the first quarter of this year \u2014 half a year after the Merge took place in mid-September.\n\nI think they believe strong selling pressure after unlock ETH from ETH 2.0 \u2014 Cryptoalert \ud83d\udef8 (\ud83d\udc99,\ud83e\udde1) (@cryptuj_alert) January 7, 2023\n\nAs the Merge was implemented, Ethereum switched to the proof-of-stake consensus protocol from the proof-of-work one, thus becoming more energy saving compared to Bitcoin, LTC, DOGE and other first generation cryptos that are mined via PoW.\n\nAt press time, Ethereum is changing hands at $1,263, having shown a small rise of 1.53% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data."

        "content": "Ethereum Classic\u2019s hash rate bounced back slightly, potentially indicating increased network activity.\n\nETC\u2019s bullish momentum might be limited, according to its MA indicators.\n\nEvery once in a while, Ethereum Classic [ETC] registers a large price pump that is usually associated with whale activity. The latest such event occurred on 4 January, when ETC bulls pulled off a surprise attack and pushed the token up by over 20% in one day.\n\nRead Ethereum Classic\u2019s [ETC] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nThis ETC surge meant that the token had outperformed some of the top cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum [ETH] and Bitcoin [BTC]. A potential reason for this was the pivot in Ethereum Classic\u2019s hash rate. The latter had an undeniable impact on ETC\u2019s price action.\n\nThe Ethereum Classic hash rate declined for most of December and pivoted towards the end. It may not have achieved a major recovery, but the minor upside does demonstrate a shift in miner activity. This could be because of higher miner profitability, which would indicate that there is a significant surge in transactions.\n\nThe idea that ETC transactions have increased in the last few days is supported by a surge in volume. This has been the case in the last two days, during which Ethereum Classic\u2019s volume soared to a new monthly high.\n\nWhy the upside of ETC might be limited\n\nThis strong volume surge resulted in a sizable uptick in ETC\u2019s price action, which traded at $18.63 at the time of writing. In contrast, it traded as low as $15.83 during the 4 January trading session. However, this rally might be restricted, especially now that ETC has come into contact with its 50-day moving average.\n\nETC\u2019s price has also crossed above the 50% RSI level. So far, the price has experienced some selling pressure, indicating that profit-taking has intensified after the rally. In addition, the MFI is now overbought, hence the chances that the rally will be capped are notably higher.\n\nThere are other observations that suggest a higher chance that the bears will regain control. For example, the weighted sentiment indicates that many analysts are still leaning toward the bearish side.\n\nHow many ETCs can you get for $1?\n\nThe Binance funding rate confirmed a surge in derivatives demand for ETC. However, this upside was limited, suggesting that the demand wave might be weak. It also does not help that Ethereum Classic has seen relatively low development activity in the last few weeks.\n\nThe lack of strong development activity may fail to facilitate a strong favorable sentiment. We can thus conclude that ETC\u2019s short-term prospects may still favor the bears. Nevertheless, this might not necessarily be the case if the market sees an unexpected surge in demand."

        "content": "Lido DAO (LDO) surged 34.5% in the last seven days leading up to Friday afternoon trading close in Asia, as Ethereum\u2019s upcoming March upgrade is expected to resolve current risks in ETH, or Ether staking. BitDAO also gained 22% with its buyback plan that attracted users who sought greater transparency.\n\nSee related article: What the FTX collapse means for the future of crypto\n\nFast facts\n\nLido DAO (LDO) fell 4% in the last 24 hours to 5 p.m. in Hong Kong to US$1.29, while BitDAO (BIT) lost 0.42% to US$0.41, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nDAO, or decentralized autonomous organization, is a blockchain-based entity with no central leadership, giving token holders rights to contribute to its governance such as crypto issuance and management. LDO and BIT are the governance token of Lido and BitDAO, respectively.\n\nLido DAO provides indirect liquidity and additional rewards to ETH stakers by pegging Lido Staked ETH (stETH) to the value of their assets locked in the smart contract. The staking service is currently the second largest decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol with US$6.15 billion in total value locked, according to DefiLlama.\n\nLDO\u2019s price surge has been attributed to Ethereum developers\u2019 recently setting the date for the blockchain\u2019s upcoming Shanghai hard fork. The upgrade, set to take place before March, plans to enable Ether stakers to withdraw their assets from the proof-of-stake Beacon Chain, which was previously unavailable to them.\n\n\u201cThe risk of not knowing when they can withdraw their [staked] assets is a factor of price discount,\u201d Paik Hoon-jong, the chief operating officer of South Korea-based blockchain fintech firm DA:Ground told Forkast in a video interview. \u201cThe announcement resolved a lot of anxiety about ETH 2.0,\u201d said Paik, adding that the relief prompted many investors to look into ETH-related products and services, such as Lido.\n\nBitDAO is an entity built on Ethereum where holders of BIT vote on proposals and contribute to its investment decisions in crypto and the DeFi ecosystem. It is backed by Bybit exchange, billionaire venture capitalist Peter Thiel and Pantera.\n\nLast week, the BitDAO community approved a proposal to buy back US$100 million worth of BIT in USDT for supply maintenance. BitDAO started the 50-day, US$2 million -per-day buyback on Jan. 1.\n\nSee related article: Biggest blockchain trends for 2023 and beyond"

        "content": "Jan 06, 2023 at 12:30 // News\n\nCoin Idol Author\n\nEthereum (ETH) price forecast is bullish, but $1,260 is a strong resistance level that will limit the uptrend.\n\nETH/USD opened the day at $1,214.96 on January 4. It has a high of $1,256.95 and a low of $1,212.89. ETH eTH/USD is currently trading at $1,251.37 and is up 2.94% in the last 24 hours. Also, the price has risen more than 3% in the last week.\n\n\n\n\n\nVitalik Buterin adoption of Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4884\n\nThe creator of the Ethereum smart contract platform (ETH), Vitalik Buterin, discusses his top investment ideas for 2023. In a roadmap diagram posted on Twitter, he expresses confidence that Ethereum will reach the \"basic roll-up scaling\" milestone on December 3. That milestone, Buterin said, requires the adoption of Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844.\n\nReaching the \"basic rollup scaling\" milestone in my roadmap diagram.\n\n\n\nThat means:\n\n\n\n* EIP-4844 rolled out\n\n* Rollups partially taking off training wheels, at least to \"stage 1\" as described here https://t.co/qNQonDQkzG pic.twitter.com/7HePctWw1l \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) December 31, 2022\n\nEIP-4844 adds a new transaction type to Ethereum that allows data \" blobs \" to be temporarily stored in the beacon node. These changes are fully compatible with Ethereum's scaling strategy, and the size of the blobs is manageable to reduce disk usage.\n\nIn addition, EIP 4844 is part of Ethereum's surge development on Twitter, which aims to increase the transaction processing speed of the leading smart contract platform to 100,000 transactions per second or more.\n\nButerin defines the \"basic roll-up scaling milestone\" as \"partially removing training wheels\" for roll-ups. He claims that removing the training wheels means operating a legal or fraud-proof system.\n\nThe change could be beneficial to the Ethereum network. As a result, the value of ETH/USD could increase.\n\nEthereum Volatility\n\nOver the past two weeks, Ethereum volatility has decreased, as has the volatility of the rest of the market. Ethereum's network activity is low despite its increased stability.\n\nThe number of daily Ethereum transactions dropped to 742,000 on January 1, according to Etherscan.io, the Ethereum blockchain's block explorer. The last time it was seen on the mainnet was April 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe daily average for mainnet transactions is at 948,000 at the time of writing. Despite a slight improvement in recent days, the statistic is still near its lows. Transaction metrics need to improve for the price of ETH /USD to recover in the coming days.\n\nDaily Technicals & Ethereum Price Forecast\n\nSupport Resistance 1207.67 - 1220.58 1200.79 - 1226.61 1194.76 - 1233.49\n\nPivot point: 1213.70\n\nEthereum Price Prediction\n\nEthereum is currently trading for $1,247, with a 24-hour trading volume of $4.8 billion. With a 2.5% increase, Ethereum has found immediate support at the $1,235 level.\n\nUptrend resistance for ETH remains above $1,260, and a positive breakout could take the price to $1,280 or $1,300.\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport is still at $1,235, but a break below that level could allow further selling to $1,205. The RSI, MACD and 50-day simple moving average are all bullish. So look for buying opportunities today, especially above the $1,235 level.\n\nAlthough support is currently at $1,235, a drop below that level could allow for further selling down to $1,205. Bullish indicators include the RSI, MACD, and the 50-day simple moving average. Therefore, look for buying opportunities today, especially above $1,235.\n\nDisclaimer.

        "content": "I\u2019ve been working on consumer products for about a decade, having contributed to teams that have built and scaled apps to hundreds of millions of users. For the last six years I\u2019ve been 100% focused on crypto. A large part of that has been working on scaling solutions for large-scale, consumer-crypto products.\n\nI\u2019ve been part of teams that have built and launched products on Ethereum, Stellar and Solana, and have evaluated most of the other major blockchains and layer 2 scaling options, which has included spinning up basic proof-of-concepts. In particular, I\u2019ve looked deeply at the benefits and tradeoffs of Polygon \u2013 the dominant scaling option for Ethereum today.\n\nTanner Philp is a senior blockchain developer and currently the head of operations and go-to-market for Code, an upcoming self-custodial crypto wallet app built on Solana.\n\nWeb2 developers planning to jump into Web3 often wonder which blockchain they should start with. Most of these discussions end up focusing on Solana and Polygon. It\u2019s a debate that\u2019s only grown more heated in the weeks since Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s crypto trading empire collapsed, given he was one of Solana\u2019s most prominent supporters.\n\nAlthough many see the downfall of FTX as a potential death knell to Solana, the network remains a promising technological solution to blockchain\u2019s scaling issues. Even Ethereum co-creater Vitalik Buterin has noted the strength and gumption of developers building on Solana. And, developer activity is one of the best leading indicators of value creation over time.\n\nGiven this I thought it would be helpful to share my perspective as someone experienced in different crypto networks on the pros and cons of Solana and Polygon. Note: This article primarily focuses on Polygon POS (proof-of-stake), the dominant product within the Polygon product suite, with which I have direct experience. This article also contemplates other Polygon products currently in development, based on the information I\u2019m able to gather publicly, which will be noted when referenced.\n\nStory continues\n\nSee also: Why Solana Was Decimated by Bankman-Fried's Downfall | Opinion\n\nThere\u2019s three criteria I think are both critically important and materially different between the two chains: performance, approach to scaling and security.\n\n1. Performance\n\nIt might be an unpopular opinion to say that transactions-per-second (TPS) is a bad metric. What really matters is seconds-per-transaction (SPT). These are not the same; let me explain.\n\nTransactions-per-second is calculated by taking the number of transactions in a block and dividing that by the time it takes for validators or miners to produce a block, a.k.a. block time. This method misses an important nuance in how block time feels for crypto users.\n\nLet\u2019s say a blockchain produces a block once every hour, but that block contains a billion transactions. This blockchain would technically boast 277,000 TPS, but anyone using it wouldn\u2019t think so. The median seconds-per-transaction (assuming normal distribution of transaction submission across the hour) would be 30 minutes. This is why block time matters.\n\nOn Solana, the block time (referred to as \u201cslot time\u201d) is ~0.4 seconds. On Polygon the block time is ~2 seconds. This might seem like splitting hairs but the difference between 2 seconds and a half second is a big deal. When a user experiences more than a second of latency in an app (the brain processes information it sees at <0.15 seconds), it can feel like an eternity. I\u2019ve seen this phenomenon first hand while working on consumer apps. Moreover, every millisecond counts when price discovery and execution are so tied for financial applications.\n\nAnother technical consideration when comparing block times is that Polygon (like other EVM chains) uses a mempool where transactions are indexed before being added to a block. Solana takes a different route, where transactions are submitted directly to the leader in the validator set. So while block time on Polygon is ~2 seconds, there is no guarantee a transaction will make it into the next block since it could get stuck in the mempool \u2013 especially in times of high volatility.\n\nThis phenomenon of getting \u201cstuck\u201d or \u201cdelayed\u201d is a result of the block size. Imagine Venmo ran an app on-chain and needed to fill dozens of orders per second, if it chose a blockchain with 0.01-second block times that could only fit one transaction in a block, the observed SPT would be sluggish.\n\nOn Solana, blocks can theoretically reach a maximum size of 128MB. The Solana Turbine protocol breaks a block into 1280 byte packets called shreds. Through Solana\u2019s Tower BFT protocol, these can be verified concurrently by separate validators, enabling parallelized computation.\n\nOn Polygon, the block size for the POS chain is currently between 50-120KB. There is a product in development called Polygon Avail that should increase this capacity. Avail is a data availability protocol that sits on top of the Polygon POS chain to increase storage. It is currently spec\u2019d at 2MB per block with a 20 second block time though may scale to 128MB (with a theoretical minimum block time for a block that size of 5 seconds).\n\nBlock capacity manifests in fee markets, which we can see today. The average transaction fee on Polygon is ~$0.02 whereas Solana is ~$0.0002. According to 0x, when block utilization approaches 80%, the fee markets start increasing substantially, and as block utilization approaches 95%, it starts increasing exponentially.\n\nPolygon is designed to scale through parallelized sidechains, which opens up the option to increase total block capacity through more chains, so that could bring the fee markets down. Although, this approach to scaling carries bigger systemic risks that, depending on what you\u2019re building, may make building on Polygon challenging.\n\nThis is where I believe the biggest divergence in the two chains is, and is the subject of the next section.\n\n2. Approach to scaling\n\nA one sentence summary of how Solana and Polygon differ on their approach to scaling would be: Solana is built to keep everything on a single chain and Polygon is built to add more concurrent chains that merge state periodically.\n\nTo expand on this, a Solana cluster (set of validators contributing to consensus) has a leader schedule. This leader schedule enumerates which validator will be verifying each block (a.k.a. a slot on Solana). With a predefined leader schedule, transactions are forwarded to the scheduled leader, cutting down on unnecessary coordination.\n\nSee also: Solana Co-Founder Sees Upside From Ethereum's Merge\n\nIn the near future, Solana should also see multiple block leaders which will improve performance and mitigate downtime. All of this is uniquely enabled by Solana\u2019s proof-of-history consensus protocol that aligns the network around a shared clock. Without a shared time-keeper, the network has to be reactive to emergent leaders in the validation schedule.\n\nProof-of-history combined with the Turbine protocol enables fast streaming of large amounts of data that all lives on one chain.\n\nPolygon has a similar system of defining a block leader through its Bor protocol, but the approach to scaling is different. Polygon is set up to scale by adding more sidechains running in parallel and merging state periodically through a commitment to Ethereum. That\u2019s why you may see Polygon POS and Plasma referred to as a \u201ccommit chain.\u201d Multiple, parallel sidechains may mean it\u2019s possible for two users to be on separate sidechains using the same app, which would mean users are beholden to the latency of the state merge between chains and developers have to build for complexity.\n\nThis way Polygon scales may also introduce the risk a blockchain could see a \u201cre-org\u201d (where transactions are rolled back) since a user cannot reliably consider their transaction \u201cfinal\u201d until block height reaches a certain threshold. There\u2019s no magic number for this, but as an example, stablecoin issuer Circle waits for 372 blocks to pass on Polygon (~20 minutes) before they consider a transaction \u201cfinal\u201d and 1 block (~0.4 seconds) on Solana.\n\nPolygon\u2019s variant finality is a substantial drawback, and may impact what type of apps could be built on it. For instance, crypto apps might put a user\u2019s funds on hold until a transaction is considered final or allow users to transact immediately and accept the risk of a double spend exploit (like accepting credit card chargeback risk). This is a step backwards from crypto\u2019s supposed elimination of financial counterparty risks.\n\nA single chain will always be better than a collection of sidechains, assuming the single chain can scale. A single chain has less coordination complexity, less aggregation latency and less surface area for attack.\n\nThe question is, can Solana support the same scale that Polygon claims to? Based on a recent demo from Kevin Bowers at Jump Crypto, it seems it can. The team at Jump Crypto has built a new validator client for Solana called Firedancer that demonstrated 1.2 million transactions per second, while maintaining the sub-second slot time. To put that into perspective, if you counted every Twitter, WhatsApp and Instagram interaction as a transaction, they could all run concurrently on Solana without any performance degradation.\n\nPolygon also has a substantial set of technical improvements in development. Specifically, the investment in zero-knowledge (zk) rollups should result in substantial performance improvements. However, zk rollups must settle on the layer 1 (currently Ethereum) to be considered valid \u2013 meaning while they open up capacity they also add latency.\n\n3. Security\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to be high performing and scalable, but we also need confidence in the network. Both Solana and Polygon have had significant soak time, so the chance of a critical bug lying in plain sight is diminishing (although not impossible).\n\nGiven this, potential blockchain developers should focus on a network\u2019s resiliency to bad actors trying to influence state. This is most objectively measured by the Nakamoto Coefficient (NC), a metric that quantifies the number of validators that would need to collude to corrupt a network.\n\nAt the time of this writing the Solana NC is 32 and Polygon is 4. Both are proof-of-stake networks so distribution of stake matters. Solana has approximately 1,900 validators and Polygon has roughly 100. What the Nakamoto Coefficient says here is that the top 32 validators on Solana and the top four validators on Polygon could take down the network.\n\nBoth networks would do well to increase security on this vector, and I think they both will, and both Polygon and Solana have seen an increase in their NC over the last year. As more validators come online, Polygon\u2019s NC will grow, and other technical improvements in development like zk rollups will improve security.\n\nIt\u2019s argued that Polygon has higher security because it commits state periodically to Ethereum. This is a bit misguided though because the Polygon network is the one updating state to Ethereum, so if four validators colluded to corrupt the ledger, in theory a commitment could be made to Ethereum with the corrupted ledger. This is a solvable problem the Polygon team and broader ecosystem are working on.\n\nWhile I do think there is a divergence in security today, I think both blockchains will see big improvements here over time and we may see some convergence coming from a mix of technical and social advancements. This is probably the hardest one to project.\n\n4. Bonus: community\n\nWhile not a technical criteria, community is nonetheless an important variable in the success of a network. Polygon has an advantage in being connected to Ethereum where there is an objectively larger developer and consumer community than Solana. Further, the Polygon Foundation has done a good job cultivating brands and developers to build on its network \u2013 I would expect this to continue.\n\nAnd given Polygon plans to bridge to multiple blockchains, they\u2019ll be able to leverage existing communities bringing even more developers and consumers into the fold.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a moat, however. It\u2019s early in crypto with most of the world still on the sidelines, I think performant applications will bring them in, and the developer, creator and consumer communities will congregate where the best apps and the most users are. That\u2019s why I think the technical criteria above are a leading indicator of future community development.\n\nWhile Solana had to overcome a cold-start problem, in less than three years it has grown to one of the most active developer, creator and consumer communities. There is a diverse set of developers making the core more performant and robust, while others are adding services and tooling to make the developer experience better.\n\nSee also: The Fake Team That Made Solana DeFi Look Huge\n\nThat foundation has enabled talented teams to build strong consumer experiences across the major categories in crypto. I would expect this cycle to continue, bringing more talented people into the ecosystem as the talent density compounds.\n\nI do think both Polygon and Solana serve important needs in the broader crypto ecosystem, but I do think it is important for developers to understand the pros and cons. I hope this helps."

        "title": "Binance's stablecoin BUSD hasn't always been 1:1 backed, report - Protos",
        "content": "Listen to this article.\n\nBinance has previously undercollateralized its stablecoin, BUSD, on its own blockchain, according to on-chain data revealing that the wallet backing the BUSD bridged from Ethereum\u2019s blockchain onto Binance\u2019s blockchain did not consistently equal one dollar\u2019s worth of assets for each Binance-pegged BUSD.\n\nInvestigative reporter Jonathan Reiter of Data Finnovation collaborated with Patrick Tan of Novum Alpha to initially publicize the shortfall. Reiter has published five scholarly articles and specializes in stablecoin research. Both firms are based in Singapore. Their joint analysis shows insufficient backing of BUSD trading on BNB Chain for several months.\n\nNot-so-stablecoin BUSD\n\nBUSD is the world\u2019s third-largest stablecoin with a market capitalization exceeding $16 billion. Binance worked with blockchain infrastructure firm Paxos to promise 1:1 backing.\n\nHowever, Paxos only promises 1:1 backing of BUSD on Ethereum. For a while, the public assumed that BUSD on any blockchain was fully backed \u2014 especially Binance\u2019s own blockchain. Eventually, Paxos disclaimed responsibility for non-Ethereum-based BUSD.\n\nAiming to distance itself from non-Ethereum-based BUSD, Paxos clarified, \u201cBinance-Peg BUSD is strictly a Binance product; it is not issued by Paxos nor regulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services.\u201d\n\nRepeatedly assuring the public about BUSD\u2019s 1:1 backing and dollar peg is of paramount importance for Binance. Binance itself holds 25% of its assets \u2014 a staggering $13 billion \u2014 in BUSD. Incredibly, the company forcibly liquidated customer holdings of competitors\u2019 stablecoins USDC, USDP, and TUSD in order to increase BUSD adoption last year.\n\nBinance claims that BUSD reserves are audited monthly in compliance with all relevant regulations. Paxos affirms that it holds assets to back all BUSD tokens on Ethereum with fiat currency and US Treasury bills in US banks. However, Paxos does not back BUSD on BNB Chain, which have occasionally been undercollateralized.\n\nOrange line represents Paxos-linked $BUSD on Ethereum intended to back the equivalent $BUSD circulating on Binance Smart Chain.\n\n\n\nGreen line is the $BUSD that was circulating on Binance Smart Chain that ought to have been backed by the equivalent on Ethereum. pic.twitter.com/LgXgZnYey6 \u2014 Patrick Tan (@patrick_novum) January 3, 2023 The green line should always have been lower than the orange line.\n\nBinance wanted you to believe\n\nSkepticism is understandable regarding so-called stablecoins, many of which have failed to maintain their stability. Many stablecoins have collapsed all the way to $0.\n\nFans of Binance believed BUSD was different. Binance wanted to differentiate its stablecoin from a long history of lies by other stablecoin issuers. It convinced the world that it would fully back all BUSD at all times, no matter what. It failed.\n\nOf course, many stablecoins maintain their peg for years \u2014 trading at $1 until the very end, then suddenly crashing to $0. Terra (UST) traded at $1 for over a year and a half. Then, within one month, it traded from $1 to below one penny and never recovered, losing $18 billion dollars in market capitalization.\n\nIn fairness, Binance seems to have resolved these past issues with BUSD. Despite months of historical shortfalls, it currently backs Binance-peg BUSD 1:1.\n\nConclusion\n\nBinance promised that BUSD was fully backed without precisely qualifying that its promise applied only to BUSD on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain. Worse, many BNB Chain users believed that assets at Paxos ultimately backed all BUSD on a 1:1 basis. We now know that Binance-peg BUSD was not always backed.\n\nProtos was able to verify, as documented by Data Finnovation, that the Ethereum-based backing wallet listed in Binance\u2019s documentation occasionally undercollateralized BUSD tokens bridged onto BNB Chain. In other words, unbacked BUSD have circulated in the past. Subsequently, Binance topped-up funds in that backing wallet, albeit in a manner inconsistent with the official bridging process described in Binance\u2019s documentation.\n\nTherefore, Protos can\u2019t attest that Binance didn\u2019t hold sufficient assets to back all Binance-peg BUSD at all times. We\u2019re only certain that it didn\u2019t fully back all Binance-peg BUSD with assets in its official Ethereum-based backing wallet. Today, Binance-peg BUSD is fully backed.\n\nFor more informed news, follow us on Twitter and Google News or listen to our investigative podcast Innovated: Blockchain City."

Whalestats shows that the meme crypto was among the top ten most purchased tokens among the top 2,000 largest Ethereum investors as of this week.\n\nWhat is fueling the high whales\u2019 appetite is the much-awaited Shibarium. It is a layer-2 platform expected to improve the performance of Shiba Inu. Speculations were heightened that Shibarium could be launched soon after the ecosystem\u2019s lead developer Shytoshi Kusama remarked on the same. \u201cLove meeting with the team from UnificationUND about Shibarium. Aligning. Onboarding. Finalizing. Soon. Very Soon,\u201d Kusama said.\n\nDescribed as the foundation for the Shiba Inu ecosystem, Shibarium features a decentralized exchange (DEX), blockchain games, and the metaverse \u2013 all of which have been under development. Shiba Inu currently relies on Ethereum, with shortcomings being slow transactions and high gas fees. However, that is bound to change within the layer-2 solution. Shibarium will take most of the transactions off Ethereum while still using the blockchain as a security layer.\n\nShibaSwap Governance Token BONE Jumps Double-Digit\n\nBONE, a governance and utility token, has gained the most from the sentiment among the five major tokens in the Shiba Inu ecosystem. The digital asset, capped at 230,000,000 tokens, has gained 10% in the past week, according to data from CoinGecko. On the other hand, SHIB declined by 0.36% in the same period.\n\nLEASH and TREAT are the other tokens expected to play a key role in the upcoming Shibarium. Both tokens can be staked for rewards in Shiba Inu liquidity pools. Also in the plan is SHI, a utility stablecoin. The Shibarium developers have also added a token burn mechanism to cut the supply of SHIB.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe latest data from the Shiba Inu burn tracker, Shibburn shows that the number of burned SHIB to date was 410,384,382,996,444 as of the time of writing these lines. The canine-themed token launched with an initial supply of a quadrillion tokens, out of which that in circulation stands at 562,850,341,247,185."

According to a tweet from the official account of the meme coin, the token has recorded a total of 4,623,518 transactions over the past 14 days, a figure that surpasses Ethereum's 1,831.79 million by more than 50%.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBONK became a sensation in the crypto community as it paraded itself as the first dog-focused token on the Solana blockchain network. With the crypto ecosystem in search of so much thrill, many jumped on board to buy the token, pushing its price to a significantly high pedestal.\n\nAt the time of writing, Bonk is changing hands at $0.000001925, down 56.68% over the past 24 hours. Despite the massive daily slump in the price of the token, it is still up by more than 2,000% over the past seven days.

        "content": "To add USDT (Tether) to MetaMask, you need to copy its address and import it as a custom token.\n\nAfter you\u2019ve imported it as a custom token, you\u2019ll be able to send and receive USDT.\n\nTether is hosted on the Ethereum blockchain, so you need to make sure that the \u201cEthereum Mainnet\u201d network is selected.\n\nBy default, the \u201cEthereum Mainnet\u201d network is selected.\n\nHence, you don\u2019t need to add a new network.\n\nTether is a stablecoin, which means that it\u2019s always worth $1.00 (1-to-1 matching fiat currency).\n\nIts aim is to stabilize cryptocurrency valuations.\n\nMetaMask is a safe way to store your USDT as compared to a cryptocurrency exchange because you own your private keys.\n\nHere\u2019s how to add USDT (Tether) to MetaMask:\n\n1. Copy the USDT contract address\n\nBefore you can add USDT (Tether) to MetaMask, you need to copy its address.\n\nThis is because USDT is not automatically added on MetaMask.\n\nHence, you need to import it as a custom token.\n\nFirstly, go to CoinMarketCap.com and search for \u201cUSDT\u201d.\n\nUnder \u201cContracts\u201d, click on the duplicate icon to copy the USDT address.\n\nYou can find the USDT token on CoinMarketCap here: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/.\n\n2. Log in to your MetaMask wallet\n\nAfter you\u2019ve copied the USDT contract address, you can now import it to MetaMask.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have MetaMask, you need to install it on Chrome and create a new wallet.\n\nThe wallet creation process involves choosing a password and storing a recovery phrase.\n\nIf you already have a MetaMask wallet, you can either enter your password or import it using your secret recovery phrase.\n\nTo log in to your MetaMask wallet, click on the MetaMask extension, enter your password, and click on \u201cUnlock\u201d.\n\n3. Click on \u201cimport tokens\u201d\n\nAfter you\u2019ve unlocked your MetaMask wallet, you\u2019ll need to import USDT.\n\nFirstly, you need to make sure that the \u201cEthereum Mainnet\u201d network is selected.\n\nThis is because USDT is hosted on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nBy default, the \u201cEthereum Mainnet\u201d network will be selected.\n\nIf it\u2019s not, click on the network dropdown box and select it.\n\nNext, scroll down and click on \u201cimport tokens\u201d to start importing USDT as a custom token.\n\n4. Paste the USDT contact address\n\nAfter you\u2019ve clicked on \u201cimport tokens\u201d, you\u2019ll land on the \u201cSearch\u201d tab.\n\nOn the \u201cSearch\u201d tab, you\u2019ll be able to search for \u201cUSDT\u201d and add it as a custom token.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s better to add it as a custom token.\n\nFirstly, click on \u201cCustom Token\u201d to start adding a custom token.\n\nNow, you\u2019ll see 3 fields\u2014\u201dToken Contract Address\u201d, \u201cToken Symbol\u201d, and \u201cToken Decimal\u201d.\n\nAll you have to do is to paste the USDT address into the \u201cToken Contract Address\u201d field.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve pasted the USDT address, the rest of the fields will be auto-populated.\n\nLastly, click on \u201cAdd Custom Token\u201d to add USDT to your MetaMask wallet.\n\n5. Send or receive USDT\n\nAfter you\u2019ve clicked on \u201cAdd Custom Token\u201d, USDT (Tether) will be added to your MetaMask wallet.\n\nYou can see the token under the \u201cAssets\u201d tab.\n\nNow, you\u2019ll be able to send or receive USDT.\n\nTo send USDT, click on the USDT token, click on \u201cSend\u201d, and paste the receiver\u2019s address.\n\nTo receive USDT, copy your wallet address by clicking on the duplicate icon under \u201cAccount 1\u201d and share it with the sender.\n\nYou\u2019ve successfully added USDT to MetaMask!\n\nConclusion\n\nAn alternative way to add USDT to MetaMask is to go to the USDT token page on CoinMarketCap.\n\nOnce you\u2019re there, click on the MetaMask icon under \u201cContracts\u201d.\n\nAfter you\u2019ve clicked on the MetaMask icon, you\u2019ll receive a MetaMask notification.\n\nClick on \u201cAdd Token\u201d to add USDT to your MetaMask wallet.\n\nRecently, MetaMask has also improved its token detection.\n\nHence, you can also add USDT by searching for it on the \u201cSearch\u201d tab.\n\nYou can do so by navigating to your MetaMask wallet > import tokens > search for \u201cUSDT\u201d > Next > Import Tokens.\n\nInstead of holding your USDT in your MetaMask wallet, you can hold it in an interest account like BlockFi.\n\nBlockFi has a USDT interest rate of 9.25%.\n\nYou can sign up for BlockFi here: https://blockfi.com/?ref=ebaebea5 and deposit your USDT there.\n\nIf you want to buy USDT, you can create an account on Binance or Coinbase.\n\nBuy USDT by creating a Binance account: https://accounts.binance.com/en/register?ref=73583477.\n\nBuy USDT by creating a Coinbase account and get $10 USD in free Bitcoin: https://www.coinbase.com/join/lim_di1.\n\nFurther reading\n\nHow to Add Fantom (FTM) to MetaMask\n\nHow to Add Avalanche (AVAX) to MetaMask\n\n10 Binance Statistics to Know in 2022"
