Read preview\n\nCrypto did not have the best year in 2022. While the rest of the economy was on a downward slide, crypto was in a freefall.\n\n\n\nThe average value of bitcoin \u2014 the largest held and most well-known cryptocurrency \u2014 dropped 64% based on figures from Google Finance. And then came the implosion of FTX, a company that had plastered ads across America for most of 2022. Wall Street banks \u2014 which previously sought partnerships with crypto firms to offer access to customers \u2014 are newly skeptical about the space. And FTX cofounder Sam Bankman-Fried pleading not guilty to federal charges promises the fallen crypto bro will stay in the public eye.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nSo, yes, there are many reasons to be pessimistic about crypto in 2023. But Bernstein analysts Gautam Chhugani and Manas Agarwal offer crypto true believers a few reasons to keep the faith.\n\nIn a note published on January 3, they wrote that despite a catastrophic 2022, the larger crypto ecosystem still has potential. Its decentralized nature allows it to bounce back even after debacles like FTX, it has a strong foundation in Ethereum, and crypto will likely benefit from the regulation it will be unable to avoid.\n\nIn their words, crypto has a \"survival instinct.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCrypto keeps bouncing back\n\nThe past year was not the first \"crypto winter.\" Bitcoin saw large price drops in 2014, when annual returns fell by 58%, and prices stayed depressed until 2017. In 2018, Bitcoin plunged in value for nearly 18 months. But it managed to rally both times.\n\nEthereum \u2014 the other large crypto token \u2014 followed nearly the same pattern of steep declines followed by a sharp rally from 2018 to 2020.\n\nAs Ross Gerber put in during a 2021 appearance on Yahoo Finance Live: \"Bitcoin and Ethereum are like cockroaches. They're just not going to die.\"\n\nOne reason cyrpto is a cockroach is it's a largely decentralized system. Chhugani and Agarwal point out the contagion impact from FTX has not spread widely.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"FTX was terrible for the reputation of the sector and affected the faith of institutional investors, who invested in FTX,\" the analysts said. \"But FTX was 10% of the global trading volume and used mainly by wholesale participants such as brokers, trading firms, and large traders.\"\n\nMuch of the crypto space remains decentralized. Take decentralized finance, or DeFi, which uses the same distributed network of computers to provide financial services to people.\n\nChhugani and Agarwal said FTX's collapse had hastened DeFi adoption, which makes DeFi a bright spot in crypto investing, according to crypto VCs.\n\nDeFi's rise\n\nWith DeFi projects largely insulated from FTX's impact, the Bernstein analysts noted investor interest might shift towards Ethereum and its mainly application-based ecosystem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum forms the basis of many crypto applications like NFT-based gaming, decentralized social media, and some commerce. These tend to use either the Ethereum blockchain to build or use the Ethereum currency to power transactions. Chhugani and Agarwal said crypto only touches 5% of total internet users, and the primary way of growing the space is through applications.\n\n\"We believe value within crypto will migrate from the speculative crypto assets to more utility and application-driven ecosystems such as Ethereum,\" they said.\n\nThe benefits of regulating the wild west of finance\n\nAgarwal and Chhugani believe regulation is coming for the crypto space and see it benefiting the market.\n\nCrypto enthusiasts typically deride moves to regulate their space. The blockchain and bitcoin began as a reaction to the 2008 financial crisis, and its first adopters had visions of leaving behind the tightly controlled world of traditional finance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut as crypto began moving into the mainstream, investors demanded regulation. And after the fall of FTX, those calls have only increased.\n\nThe analysts said even if regulation brings about adjustments in the crypto market, policies bring in a more sustainable ecosystem and attract more institutional investors. In their view, regulated onshore exchange companies will survive the current cycle.\n\nFor Agarwal and Chhugani, crypto still has strong potential to grow, particularly as people stop seeing it as a quick money-making speculative asset and instead focus on its ability to be a part of the infrastructure of the next decade of internet development."

        "title": "What is Wrapped Ethereum (WETH)? - OKX",
        "content": "Wrapped Ether (WETH) is essentially a version of Ether (ETH) but differs in numerous ways. WETH can be used on various platforms and decentralized applications (DApps) that support the ERC-20 token standard. WETH is pegged to ETH at a 1:1 ratio and can easily get converted. This leads to better interoperability on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nETH can be wrapped manually by interacting with the WETH smart contract. WETH can also be created using decentralized exchanges (DEXs) such as Uniswap.\n\nThis guide will cover everything you need to know about Wrapped Ethereum (WETH).\n\nWhat are wrapped tokens?\n\nA cryptocurrency that's built on top of one blockchain network to be used on a different blockchain needs to be wrapped. Each token, or coin, is also built on specific standards.\n\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi) use cases and DApps support specific standards. If the coin or token in question isn't supported by the blockchain, it needs to be wrapped.\n\nWrapped tokens make it a possibility to get a much higher level of utility for specific coins or tokens. Wrapped tokens solve incompatibility issues, and are supported by crypto wallets.\n\nThe procedure of wrapping a token is to swap one token for another token in an equal amount. This typically occurs through the usage of a smart contract or code on the blockchain, which can store or send funds.\n\nBoth tokens represent the same value. However, the Wrapped WETH version gets a higher level of compatibility. Wrapped tokens can be bought directly, or a merchant can convert their existing cryptocurrency and wrap it. The merchant, in this case, would send the person's crypto to a custodian.\n\nThe custodian would lock up the coin or token in a vault. Once the coin is locked, the custodian can create a wrapped token.\n\nThe wrapped token will represent the original coin, and this is a process known as minting.\n\nWhat Is Wrapped Ethereum (WETH)?\n\nWrapped Ethereum (WETH) is essentially an ERC-20 token standard-compliant cryptocurrency that's pegged to the value of Ether (ETH). Ethereum\u2019s native token, ETH, is used for paying gas fees on the network.\n\nWrapped Ethereum WETH can't be used for the payment of gas fees on the Ethereum network. WETH however, has a wider range of use cases when compared to ETH, specifically within the field of Decentralized Finance (DeFi).\n\nAny cryptocurrency wallet that supports the ERC-20 token standard supports WETH.\n\nNot every token built on Ethereum is alike. The network lets developers create new rules and standards for cryptocurrencies. There's the ERC-721 format, for example, that enables non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to operate on top of Ethereum. These are different when compared to ERC-20 tokens.\n\nThe majority of crypto wallets support ERC-20.\n\nMost Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications accept ERC-20 tokens for investment, staking, adding liquidity, borrowing, or lending, alongside other functionalities.\n\nIf we want to, for example, add Ether (ETH) to a liquidity pool and use it as collateral, it's better to have an ERC-20 version of the coin. In other terms, on Ethereum, almost all fungible tokens follow ERC-20. The standard was created to have a standardized set of rules for tokens. The aim is to simplify the new token launches and make them comparable to each other.\n\nThere are mandatory rules that all ERC-20 tokens follow, such as totalSupply, balanceOf, transfer, transferFrom, approve, and allowance.\n\nEther by itself doesn't comply with this token standard.\n\nWETH is built to increase interoperability between blockchains and make Ether usable in dApps.\n\nAdvantages of Wrapped Ethereum (WETH)\n\nCurious about what Wrapped Ether is, and what are some of its advantages? Let\u2019s go over that now.\n\nEthereum (WETH) has numerous advantages, including:\n\nWETH is an ERC-20-compliant token and follows all of the pre-specified rules.\n\nWrapping Ether enables the direct and seamless exchange between Ether and ERC-20 tokens.\n\nWETH solves the issue surrounding interoperability and enables the easy exchange of tokens.\n\nWETH can be used in any supporting DeFi service or DApp that supports the token standard on Ethereum.\n\nWETH is pegged 1:1 to the value of ETH.\n\nDisadvantages of Wrapped Ethereum (WETH)\n\nEthereum (WETH) has numerous disadvantages as well, including:\n\nCustodians are required for the procedure of wrapping or unwrapping WETH.\n\nIf any issues occur with the operations of the custodian, they can affect the minting or burning procedure.\n\nThe reliance on custodians can lead to a higher level of centralization.\n\nETH vs WETH\n\nSome traders find themselves confused about ETH and WETH. But let's \"unwrap\" the distinctions between these two tokens and explore the decentralized possibilities.\n\nETH (Ethereum)\n\nEthereum, the blockchain platform, has its native token known as ETH. This digital currency serves as the lifeblood of the Ethereum network, enabling users to conduct transactions and pay gas fees. However, while ETH is a fundamental component of Ethereum, it has certain limitations regarding DeFi applications.\n\nETH is the native token used for transactions and gas fees on the Ethereum blockchain\n\nTraders must exchange ETH to complete transactions on the Ethereum network\n\nETH isn't ERC-20 compliant, which can restrict its seamless integration with some DeFi applications\n\nWETH (Wrapped ETH)\n\nEnter Wrapped Ether, or WETH, the enchanting counterpart to ETH in the DeFi realm. WETH acts as a container, embracing the original ETH tokens and wrapping them in an ERC-20 compliant standard. This transformative process breathes new life into ETH, making it compatible with many DeFi apps.\n\nWETH serves as a container, wrapping and embracing the original ETH tokens\n\nWrapped in an ERC-20 compliant standard, WETH becomes seamlessly usable in various DeFi applications\n\nWETH was created to enable ETH's use in decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and various DeFi applications\n\nERC-20 Standard\n\nThe ERC-20 standard plays a pivotal role in differentiating ETH from WETH. While ETH doesn't follow this standard, WETH wholeheartedly embraces it. This compliance empowers WETH to integrate with other ERC-20 tokens, fostering interoperability in the DeFi space.\n\nETH isn't ERC-20 compliant, whereas WETH adheres to this standardized token format\n\nThe ERC-20 standardization enables seamless integration of WETH with other ERC-20 tokens, promoting interoperability\n\nValue equivalence\n\nOne might wonder if wrapping ETH into WETH alters its inherent value. Fear not \u2014 the enchantment of WETH doesn't tamper with the worth of its underlying ETH. For every one ETH wrapped, one WETH emerges with an identical value, maintaining a 1:1 equivalence.\n\nWrapping ETH into WETH doesn't affect its original value. 1 ETH remains equivalent to 1 WETH\n\nNo loss or gain of value occurs during the wrapping process\n\nOperational flexibility\n\nWETH provides flexibility for its users, allowing them to quickly unwrap it and convert it back to ETH with a few clicks. This conversion is effortlessly facilitated through DEXs or DEX aggregators, making the process seamless and swift.\n\nUsers can quickly unwrap WETH and convert it back to ETH through DEXs or DEX aggregators\n\nFacilitating DEXs\n\nThanks to WETH's ERC-20 compliance, DEXs can operate smoothly, enabling traders to swap different tokens seamlessly. These tokens often must be wrapped first, paving the way for frictionless exchanges on DEX platforms.\n\nWETH's ERC-20 compliance supports the smooth functioning of DEXs\n\nWrapping tokens makes DEXs more efficient, allowing seamless exchanges between tokens\n\nToken creation in DApps\n\nThe ERC-20 format of WETH empowers users to create their own tokens for their DApps, fostering a realm of innovation within the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nWETH's ERC-20 format enables users to create custom tokens for their DeFi apps, fostering innovation\n\nHow to Wrap Ether (ETH)?\n\nOne of the most popular ways through which Ether is wrapped is through Uniswap. As such, in this guide, we'll be creating WETH using Uniswap.\n\nTo do so, all users need to do is visit Uniswap and then connect their wallet. Each user will also need to ensure that Ethereum is selected as the network.\n\nNext, ETH needs to be selected in the top field, and then WETH needs to be selected in the bottom field.\n\nOnce a user clicks on the \u201cSelect a Token\u201d section, they'll be able to type in \u201cWETH\u201d in the field.\n\nNow, all that's left for a user to do is input the amount of ETH they want to convert. Next, click on the \u201cWrap\u201d button.\n\nAll that's left for each user to do is confirm the transaction in their crypto wallet and also pay the gas fees.\n\nAfter the user reviews the details of the transaction, they can click on \u201cConfirm.\u201d\n\nHow to Unwrap Ether (WETH)?\n\nNow that we understand the basics of wrapping ETH, we can now go over how to unwrap WETH.\n\nNavigate again to the Uniswap website, and connect with your wallet. Make sure the Ethereum network is selected.\n\nSelect the wallet icon on Uniswap, and connect your wallet.\n\nUsers will need to go to the \u201cSwap\u201d section and select WETH at the top and ETH at the bottom.\n\nNow, users can type in the amount they need to unwrap and confirm it. Each user will need to confirm the operation on their wallet.\n\nWETH will now turn into ETH and will be stored in the wallet directly.\n\nThe impact Wrapped Ethereum (WETH) has on the blockchain space\n\nWrapped Ethereum (WETH) is essentially the wrapped or packaged version of Ether (ETH) that lets each investor use it to interact with the Ethereum ecosystem of dApps. Its additional level of utility to holders is the main reason behind its existence.\n\nWETH can be staked, used for yield farming, lent, and used for providing liquidity to a variety of liquidity pools. Unlike ETH, which doesn't conform to its own ERC-20 standard, WETH has a much higher level of interoperability.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat is a WETH Coin?\n\nWETH isn't a coin but a token. ETH is the coin, and the wrapped version of the coin becomes the WETH token. It's a token that follows the ERC-20 token standard. Due to this, it can be used for yield farming, lending, and used for providing liquidity to a variety of liquidity pools.\n\nAre WETH and ETH the same?\n\nWETH and ETH aren't the same. The former conforms to the ERC-20 token standard, while ETH doesn't conform to the ERC-20 token standard. WETH is pegged at a value of 1:1 to ETH. However, WETH can be used by DApps and in the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nWhich is better ETH or WETH?\n\nEach cryptocurrency has its own pros as well as cons. WETH is better for usage in DeFi and DApps. However, ETH is a far more established cryptocurrency and is held by a lot more investors.\n\nIs WETH Worth Anything?\n\nWETH does indeed have a value associated with it. The token is pegged 1:1 to the value of ETH. This means that ETH and WETH have the same value, as they are connected in this regard.\n\nWhat is Wrapped Ether used for?\n\nETH is wrapped into WETH for usage on different DApps or networks aside from Ethereum. WETH leads to an increase in liquidity, capital efficiency, and interoperability. It can be used for yield farming, lending, and providing liquidity to a variety of liquidity pools.\n\nCan you convert Wrapped ETH to ETH?\n\nYou can convert Ether (ETH) to Wrapped Ethereum (WETH) or the other way around. This is typically done through a custodian or through decentralized exchanges (DEXs).\n\nIs Wrapped ETH better?\n\nThere are indeed ways through which Wrapped Ethereum (WETH) is better than Ether (ETH). If you want to use ETH coins in a DApp or DeFi ecosystem, it needs to be wrapped. WETH is better in the sense that it enables enhanced functionality, compatibility, and interoperability."

However, reports are emerging that the commission has tightened its focus on the XRP lawsuit ignoring Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX debacle.\n\nDid Ripple pushed the limits?\n\nCharles Gasparino, journalist at Fox business in a series of Tweets gave out undisclosed details over the XRP lawsuit. He mentioned that the autopsy of the SEC Vs Ripple lawsuit is a work in progress. However, It is worth asking the commission why it focused on the XRP lawsuit amid the FTX collapse.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAs per reports, the commission believes that Ripple management was flouting the SEC authorities by continuing to sell XRP. This happened even after the notice was issued to Ripple to stop. He added that how Ripple was selling XRP seemed to establish the token designation as a security.\n\nHowever, Charles Gasparino noted that the Ethereum foundation did possibly one sale and then they just stopped. He highlighted that the SEC didn\u2019t file any kind of case against them. He mentioned that he is not picking sides and just reporting the facts.\n\nEarlier, Coingape reported that the XRP lawsuit has become more critical than ever for the commission. As after, failing to take proactive measures against the FTX and SBF, the Ripple lawsuit was most important for them. Read More XRP News Here..\n\nGeneral Counsel hits back\n\nStuart Alderoty, General Counsel of Ripple stated that if these reports are true then, this only shows how the SEC works. The commission\u2019s unelected bureaucrats believe that they have unchecked power to issue indiscriminate closed door edicts under pain of punishment to some who don\u2019t blindly obey.\n\nRipple Counsel added that they have crossed from regulation by enforcement to hubris most foul."

        "content": "Mining activity is surging on a raft of proof-of-work blockchains still riding tailwinds from Ethereum\u2019s switch to proof-of-stake five months ago.\n\nThose beneficiaries of Ethereum\u2019s long awaited Merge, which activated last September and sent the blockchain\u2019s miners out of business, include Dogecoin, Litecoin and Syscoin.\n\nAt the time, smaller networks minable with high-end GPUs \u2014 a la pre-Merge Ethereum \u2014 immediately saw a major hash rate uptick. Ethereum Classic\u2019s hash rate (a measure of the network\u2019s computing power) ballooned 160% in a single day and RavenCoin\u2019s jumped 80%.\n\nLike Bitcoin, Dogecoin and Litecoin can only really be efficiently mined with specialized ASIC rigs attuned to their hashing algorithm, Scrypt. Those networks, which command far less hash rate than Bitcoin, didn\u2019t book a sudden hash rate boost in September, unlike Ethereum Classic.\n\nBut they\u2019ve since set fresh record highs. Dogecoin and Litecoin are \u201cmerge-mined,\u201d meaning they can be mined simultaneously without sacrificing performance, leading their hash rates to correlate.\n\nLitecoin\u2019s hash rate chart looks pretty much the same, hitting all-time high in late December\n\nSyscoin\u2019s hash rate is also hovering around highs set in October, although it can\u2019t be mined efficiently with GPUs. The network can, however, be merge-mined with Bitcoin, which itself is maintaining record levels set late last year \u2014 even as its price has plummeted.\n\nMore hash rate typically equates to more security, as bad actors require more computing power to pull off effective 51% attacks. But are displaced Ethereum miners responsible for Dogecoin and Litecoin\u2019s hash rate pumps?\n\nA spokesperson for Litecoinpool.org, an aptly-named Litecoin mining pool, doesn\u2019t believe so. Common Ethereum mining rigs, such as the RTX 3080, could contribute around 100 MH/s to the network\u2019s hash rate, but less than two MH/s to Litecoin, good for a factor of about 50.\n\nEthereum\u2019s hash rate was roughly 1,000 TH/s before the Merge. So, if all the miners on Ethereum were to switch to Litecoin, per back-of-the-napkin math, those miners should expect to add about 20 TH/s to Litecoin\u2019s hash rate.\n\nLitecoin\u2019s hash rate has climbed far more than 20 TH/s. It was just over 400 TH/s in September. It\u2019s now sitting around 600 TH/s, a 50% jump.\n\n\u201cI think we can safely say that this jump cannot be attributed to GPUs coming from Ethereum mining, but rather to more Scrypt ASICs entering the market,\u201d the Litecoinpool.org rep said.\n\nThey added that Litecoin\u2019s third halving is just a few months away, which means miners may well be looking to get more bang for their buck before issuances are reduced.\n\nLitecoin and Dogecoin soar since Merge\n\nAt times, mining Litecoin and Dogecoin to sell for BTC can be more profitable than mining Bitcoin directly. A source familiar with the mining industry told Blockworks that some mid-sized mining operations keep Scrypt ASICs on hand for that exact purpose.\n\nRead more: Is Bitcoin Mining Still Profitable? The Economics Explained\n\nThe source was granted anonymity because they are not authorized to talk to the media.\n\nSarah Manter, director of communications for mining platform PROHASHING, told Blockworks that rather than directing old Ethereum GPUs to Scrypt, it was more likely that miners have been buying up used ASICs from those who capitulated when the market crashed \u2014 and pointing them at Dogecoin and Litecoin.\n\nEither that, or they\u2019re selling GPUs and buying new ASICs to mine what\u2019s now profitable.\n\nEthereum Classic\u2019s hash rate has retraced since its post-Merge bump\n\n\u201cI have no knowledge of GPUs being repurposed to mine Litecoin, because GPUs haven\u2019t been able to profitably mine Litecoin/Dogecoin for quite some time,\u201d Manter said.\n\nAdded Manter: \u201cI know a lot of GPU miners have either been getting out of the game altogether in favor of other endeavors such as staking, or buying, trading or turning off their workers to wait it out and see what pulls ahead and becomes profitable again.\u201d\n\nLitecoin has increased 24% since the Merge, increasing the odds of profiting from mining the blockchain. Price, though, is just one factor, alongside energy and equipment expenditures, impacting profit.\n\nDogecoin is up 16% over the same period.\n\nManter said that no GPU algorithm (and, accordingly, associated blockchains) seems to be pulling ahead of its peers in the same vein as Ethereum\u2019s dominance.\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean one won\u2019t eventually, as the market improves [and] hash rate shifts,\u201d Manter said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

It is up by more than 4% in the last 24 hours, and the price of Ethereum Classic now stands at $18.73.\n\nAccording to the crypto analytics platform Santiment , Ethereum Classic is enjoying a pretty nice rally of its own. Not only is volume high, but ETC is also being shorted big time by traders on exchanges.\n\nThis latest cryptocurrency news could be the major catalyst driving ETC higher. The broader crypto market had a positive start to the week but is now retreating. The total crypto market cap stands at $817 billion, down by less than 1% in the last 24 hours.\n\nBitcoin and Ether continue to maintain their prices above the $16,800 and $1,250 levels, respectively.\n\nKey levels to watch\n\nThe ETC/USD 4-hour chart is bullish as Ethereum Classic has been performing well over the last few days. The technical indicators show that ETC is outperforming the broader crypto market.\n\nThe MACD line is deep within the positive territory, indicating that the bulls are in charge of the market. The 14-day relative strength index of 78 shows that ETC could enter the overbought region if the rally continues.\n\nWith the bulls in charge, ETC could surge past the first major resistance level at $20.12 before the end of the day. In the event of an extended rally, ETC could trade above the $23 psychological level for the first time since November 2022.\n\nWhere to buy Ethereum Classic now"

        "content": "More than 70% Ethereum stakes were underwater at press time\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade would enable unstaking once deployed\n\nStaking Ethereum [ETH], particularly after the Merge, prompted several conversations. The topics of discussion ranged from dominant staking pools to OFAC-compliant blocks, as well as the threats that a combination of the two posed to Ethereum and the transactions that used ETH.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2025-2030\n\nHowever, some groups of stakers can be concerned about something completely different in relation to staking: the amount of profit their investments generated.\n\nStake at a loss?\n\nAccording to Hildobby\u2019s data from Dune Analytics, some ETH stakers were currently making a profit, while others were at the breakeven threshold. Yet, others were experiencing a loss. According to Dune Analytics, 77.5% stakers were at a loss at press time, while only 22.5% were in profit.\n\nAccording to the chart, the various phases of profit were decided by the price of Ethereum at various stages of entry into different staking pools by stakers.\n\nAccording to the above data, there were currently over 15k ETH staked, and the entire staked amount equaled 13.18% of ETH\u2019s total supply.\n\nFears of a huge sell-off following the Shanghai upgrade have been popular. This is because of the proportion of ETH that was currently locked in staking pools and the current loss that a larger proportion of stakers were experiencing.\n\nETH in a daily timeframe\n\nAccording to the daily timeframe chart shown, ETH\u2019s price movement was relatively flat. As of this writing, the price was seen to have increased by over 3% over the previous 48 hours, bringing it to approximately $1,253. The token had made some progress in bouncing back, according to the Relative Strength Index metric (RSI).\n\nIndicating a positive trend, the RSI line was shown to be above the neutral zone. If the press time upward momentum continues, the location of the RSI line could strengthen the bullish trend.\n\nA sustained upward push might cause ETH to overcome different resistances and retake the $2,000 area, turning most of the staked ETH into profit.\n\nLong-term Ethereum holders at a loss\u2026\n\nThe Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio for ETH over the last 365 days revealed that holders were holding at a loss throughout that time. Given the challenging year that cryptocurrencies experienced, ETH holders were holding at a loss of 27.57% as of this writing, which seemed like a minimal loss."

According to Arcane: \u201cA Reg M would cause a massive arbitrage strategy of selling crypto spot versus buying GrayscaleTrust shares. If this scenario plays out, crypto markets could face further downside.\u201d\n\nWinklevoss has been vocal on the alleged DCG liquidity issues, previously tweeting an update in December that global investment bank Houlihan Lokey had presented a plan on behalf of the Creditor Committee to provide a pathway for the recovery of assets."

        "content": "Ethereum layer-2 scaling platform StarkNet has overhauled its in-house Cairo coding language to make Web3 development accessible to developers.\n\nAn announcement shared with Cointelegraph outlines the upgrades to Cairo 1.0, which is touted to emulate characteristics of the popular programming language Rust. The overhaul intends to allow developers with general coding experience to begin building decentralized applications on StarkNet\u2019s Ethereum layer-2 network.\n\nStarkWare co-founder and president Eli Ben-Sasson told Cointelegraph that making layer-2 development more accessible to developers of varying backgrounds was the main reason for Cairo\u2019s revamp:\n\n\u201cThe primary drivers were safety and ease of use, and conducting the overhaul presented a terrific opportunity to remove the entry for developers with conventional language backgrounds.\u201d\n\nThe technical specifications outlined in the Jan. 5 launch encompass a host of improvements to Cairo\u2019s language, including improved syntax and language constructs, a holistic type system, intuitive libraries, optimized code and strong typing by demanding specification of data types.\n\nStarkNet highlighted Sierra \u2014 which stands for Safe Intermediate Representation \u2014 as the main addition to Cairo\u2019s overhaul. Sierra acts as a new intermediate representation layer between Cairo 1.0 and Cairo byte code.\n\nAs Ben-Sasson explained, Sierra is an important aspect of ensuring a permissionless network. The upgrade enables reverted transactions to be included in StarkNet blocks, helping the protocol to avoid adding complex \u201ccrypto-economic mechanisms.\u201d\n\nRelated: StarkNet makes Cairo 1.0 open source in first step toward community control\n\nBen-Sasson said that Sierra will allow StarkNet to \u201cinherit the full censorship-resistance of Ethereum\u201d and mainly protects against Sequencer denial-of-service attacks.\n\nAs previously reported by Cointelegraph, Ben-Sasson pioneered zk-STARK cryptography alongside other computer scientists. Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent Arguments of Knowledge is a proof system that encrypts and verifies transaction data to provide security, scalability and resistance to quantum computing.\n\nAccording to StarkNet, Cairo is the fourth most popular smart contract language by total value locked. It is the base of applications that have processed over 300 million transactions, minted 90 million nonfungible tokens and facilitated $790 million worth of trades settled on Ethereum."

        "content": "In the third episode of the Hashing It Out podcast, Cointelegraph\u2019s Elisha Owusu Akyaw discusses the future of noncustodial cryptocurrency wallets with Kosala Hemachandra, CEO of MyEtherWallet.\n\nRecent issues with centralized platforms have put the spotlight on decentralized applications (DApps), and self-custody \u2014 where users keep their funds completely under their responsibility \u2014 has become a major trend.\n\nCheck the whole library of Cointelegraph podcasts here.\n\nMyEtherWallet is one of the oldest noncustodial wallets with a focus on the Ethereum blockchain. According to Kosala Hemachandra, the wallet went live just two weeks after the Ethereum mainnet launch. The CEO of MyEtherWallet explained that the company chose to make a decentralized wallet because it believed it was the only proper way to interact with blockchain technology.\n\n\u201cBlockchain, at its core, is a decentralized solution, so why would we create products that are centralized? Because we are defeating the whole purpose of using blockchain.\u201d\n\nHemachandra explains that MyEtherWallet started as a hobby project that became more demanding since there were no examples to look at during its development. The developer had to write new Ethereum libraries in Javascript.\n\nThe need to build a foundation of codebases that could accelerate growth in the Ethereum landscape was the reason the team opted to make the code open source. What\u2019s more, the open-source nature of the code allows the platform to have more eyes on its codebase to prevent potential vulnerabilities.\n\nDespite growing competition, MyEtherWallet has over 3 million monthly users, mainly from the United States and Japan. To catch up with the likes of MetaMask, the decentralized wallet is adding support for more blockchain networks and recently launched a multichain browser extension. Hemachandra also pointed out that the first two weeks after the FTX saga brought in many new users looking for decentralized alternatives to store their crypto.\n\nRelated: Crypto trader regrets not catching the top of the bull run\n\nOn trends in the industry, Hemachandra mentioned that MyEtherWallet has yet to make plans to do an airdrop for its users despite rumors that some of its competitors may launch their own tokens soon. According to the CEO, MyEtherWallet doesn\u2019t see any use cases for tokens released by wallet applications at the moment.\n\nIn the episode, Elisha and Hemachandra also cover:\n\nNew features for decentralized wallets.\n\nThe Ethereum ecosystem and the popularity of layer-2 platforms.\n\nA multichain future in the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nHashing It Out is a new Cointelegraph podcast series covering innovations and important stories in the blockchain industry, featuring interviews with thought leaders in the space hosted by Elisha (GhCryptoGuy).\n\nFor more discussion with Hemachandra, listen to the full episode of Hashing It Out on the new Cointelegraph Podcasts page or Spotify, Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts or Amazon Music.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here and in this podcast are the participants\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."

The deal was disclosed during a bankruptcy hearing on Tuesday, per reports.\n\nCelsius hired Core Scientific to provide hosting services for the crypto lenders\u2019 BTC mining business. The crypto mining company also received $54 million in funding from Celsius in 2021 as part of a $200 million fundraising effort.\n\nCore mounted legal pressure on Celsius in October 2022 claiming that the crypto lender owed around $5.4 million in hosting fees. Core Scientific lawyers told the court that powering Celsius mining machines cost the company $53,000 in losses on a daily basis. The company also told U.S. Judge David R. Jones that the hosting capacity provided to Celsius could generate roughly $2 million in revenue per month.\n\nOn Tuesday, both entities agreed to unplug 37,000 mining machines owned by bankruptcy crypto lender Celsius. It\u2019s unclear if the deal includes a payment of $5.4 million in hosting fees claimed by the troubled cryptocurrency mining company last year.\n\nCore Scientific Bankrupt, Riot Blockchain Rebrands\n\nA myriad of crypto companies collapsed amid sunken crypto prices and massive corporate failures among industry stakeholders. Core Scientific, previously a Bitcoin mining giant, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in December 2022 citing market conditions.\n\nAnother crypto miner, Riot Blockchain, rebranded as Riot Platforms in a bid to diversify as rising power costs in the U.S. threatens mining businesses.\n\nArgo Blockchain also announced plans to sell its Helios mining facility in Texas to Mike Novogratz\u2019s Galaxy Digital for $65 million. Argo also secured an additional $35 million loan to help stave off bankruptcy in the bear market."

        "content": "Ethereum recorded 338 more transactions in 2022; co-founder Vitalik Buterin shares what he\u2019s bullish about this year Photo : BCCL\n\nNew Delhi: Even as Bitcoin maintains the top spot in terms of online search interest, Ethereum surpassed the token in terms of total transaction volumes. The world's second-largest cryptocurrency recorded 338 per cent more transactions in 2022 as compared to Bitcoin, as per the data from Nasdaq and Ycharts.\n\nOn the Ethereum network, there were 408.5 million transactions, more than the 93.1 million on the Bitcoin network. This translates to the average daily number of transactions on Ethereum at 1.1 million while they were 2,55,000 on the Bitcoin network.\n\nEven though Ethereum emerged as the winner in transaction volumes, the Bitcoin network saw more consistent and regular transaction volumes as compared to the former. This was attributed to times of increased demand, such as during the launch of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and other activities.\n\nThe success rate in Ethereum's transaction volumes continued in 2023 too as the number of transactions on its network on January 2 touched 924,614, a 300 per cent jump compared to the Bitcoin network on the same day (229,191), according to Cointelegraph.\n\nVitalik Buterin on what he\u2019s bullish on\n\nCo-founder of the crypto token recently shared some bullishness for the year ahead while confirming the launch of the Ethereum Improvement Protocol (EIP) 4884 sometime in 2023.\n\nOn New Year's Eve, December 31, Buterin replied to a post by former chief technology officer of Coinbase, Balaji Srinivasan, in which he asked users what they were bullish on for 2023? In the comment section, the Ethereum co-founder shared that he was looking forward to reaching the \u201cbasic rollup scaling\u201d milestone as outlined in the Ethereum roadmap.\n\nThis means the rollout of The Surge-related Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)-4884 and rollups partially taking off training wheels at least to stage 1 referring to a November 22 post on the \u201cEthereum Magicians forum\u201d, which details three stages of the \u201ctrust model\u201d based on how mature a project\u2019s tech was.\n\nMeanwhile, the 28-year-old had on December 30 tweeted on what he believes a \u201cGood Crypto Future\u201d might look like. In his post, the Ethereum boss highlighted several areas of crypto that would need to be fixed, including scaling, privacy, user experience and making user accounts more secure for average users than centralized services.\n\nFurther, Buterin is of the view that payments and decentralized finance (DeFi) will be a part of this future."

        "content": "If 2022 was anything to go by, the cryptocurrencies industry remains a highly innovative one with new developments always in the offing.\n\nHowever, not all developments were positive, indeed many contributed negatively to the industry and its reputation. As another year gets to speed, with help from several Dune dashboard, these are some of the trends we will be watching out for in 2023.\n\n1.) ETH Staking\n\n2022 was always going to be a significant year for Ethereum due to its transition to a full Proof-of-Stake blockchain, christened \u2018the Merge.\u2019\n\nStaking on the beacon chain was already an established trend through 2021, but in 2022 it grew to new heights.\n\nAccording to this dashboard by Dune Analytics, almost 7 million $ETH was deposited to the Beacon Chain throughout 2022, and the number of validators grew by more than 215,000.\n\n15.84 million ETH is now staked, 13.14% of the entire supply.\n\nContinuing an established trend from 2021, liquid staking remained the largest staking category and continued growing in 2022:\n\nWithin the liquid staking space itself, Lido remained the market leader, increasing its marketshare from 18% to ~30% throughout the year.\n\nThis all helped to propel the network to a successful Merge and relatively seamless switch to Proof-of-Stake.\n\n2.) The Rise of L2 Rollups\n\nBefore the much awaited Merge, a key trend on Ethereum was the emergence of L2 scaling solutions. In 2022, these platforms grew significantly, in particular Optimism & Arbitrum.\n\nThis is well captured by this ashboard showing the growth in active addresses during 2022:\n\nDaily transactions have also been rising as those on Ethereum itself steadily fall.\n\nFor the first half of 2022, Optimism & Arbitrum combined were doing less than 200k daily transactions. By Q4 2022, this figure was regularly hitting 1 million:\n\n3.) The Flight to Self Custody\n\nThe collapse of once important platforms like LUNA/UST, Celsius, Voyager, BlockFi, and most recently, FTX/Alameda, elicited a rise in self custody.\n\nThis dashboard illustrates a flight in assets from centralized platforms (CEX) throughout the year. We can even see upticks around the time of major blow-ups in May, June and November 2022:\n\nThis is definitely one development to keep an eye on as we get into 2023 proper.\n\n4.) Wash Trading\n\nIn early 2022, NFT trading seemed to explode hitting several billion dollar\u2019s worth of weekly volume for the first time.\n\nHowever, as analyzed in this recent article, more than 80% of NFT trade volume was wash trading \u2013 a form of market manipulation where users trade NFTs between different wallets that they own, typically with the goal of accruing trading rewards or boosting metrics of a specific piece or collection.\n\nWash trading is thought to account for 58% of NFT trading volume in 2022. As overall NFT volume dropped significantly from May 2022 onwards, wash trading remained at over 50%:\n\n5.) Investors Flee DeFi\n\nIn 2021, DeFi was one of the main stories in crypto, but the 2022 winter caused a noticeable flight to safety from market participants.\n\nInvestors withdrew their stablecoins from smart contracts, with the share of DAI, USDC & USDT held by smart contracts plummeting throughout the year with noticeable spikes.\n\nIt will be worth keeping an eye on these contracts in 2023, if just to get a bearing of the market condition.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nFollow us on Twitter for the latest posts and updates\n\nJoin and interact with our Telegram community\n\n_____________________________________\n\n_____________________________________"

Following this, security firms CertiK and PeckShield flagged the transactions as an exploit that drained $3.4 million worth of GMX tokens from a GMX whale.\n\nAccording to data analysis platform Lookonchain, the hackers took control of 82,519 GMX tokens and exchanged the assets for 2,627 Ether (ETH). Then, the attackers cross-chained the assets to the Ethereum network using Hop Protocol and Across Protocol.\n\nHacker\u2019s wallet address. Source: Etherscan\n\nAs the hack happened, the token\u2019s value dropped to $38 before recovering shortly. At the time of writing, GMX trades at around $41. This sudden price drop may have been caused by the hack alarming community members. One user tweeted:\n\nAs some community members observed the hack\u2019s effect through the charts, comments on the negative side of self custody were seen on social media. One Twitter user said that the event highlights \u201cthe dark side of self-custodial wallets.\u201d\n\nRelated: Here's how Defrost Finance plans to refund users following $12M hack\n\nOn Jan. 1, Bitcoin (BTC) core developer Luke Dashjr claimed that he lost BTC to hackers. Because of this, members of the crypto community voiced their opinions that the exploit highlights the risks that come with opting to self-custody digital assets. Various community members echoed these sentiments, saying that if a top developer didn\u2019t secure his BTC, normal people would have no hope.\n\nDeFi hackers have been active during the holiday season. On Dec. 25, $12 million worth of digital assets were taken through a flash loan attack, liquidating Defrost Finance users. A day later, another DeFi hack was seen, with hackers draining about $8 million from Bitkeep wallets through compromised Android Package Kits (APKs)."

        "content": "The total transactions on the Ethereum network tore through that of Bitcoin by more than fourfold in 2022, data from DollarGeek has shown.\n\nData from Nasdaq and Ycharts have also shown that there were 338% more Ether transactions in 2022 (408.5 million) than Bitcoin transactions (93.1 million).\n\nThis notwithstanding, Bitcoin managed to retain its crown when it comes to online search interest, according to google trend searches. About 28.41 million people googled Bitcoin during the year.\n\nMore details on this: The Ethereum blockchain averaged a daily transaction count of around 1.1 million for ETH, while that of Bitcoin\u2019s network stood at 255,000 for BTC.\n\nAlthough the Ethereum network led the charge, transaction volumes on the Bitcoin network were steadier and more periodic than on the Ethereum network, which experienced much more volatility in transaction volumes.\n\nThis was due to spikes in demand at certain times such as NFT launches and other gas fee-intensive events such as XEN minting.\n\nMore on Ether\u2019s performance: Ether, the native token of the Ethereum network, has seen its supply drop since October 8., 2022 which marked the Ethereum network\u2019s first deflationary move.\n\nThe deflationary move happened when the network switched from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) via the Merge in September 2022.\n\nAfter the update, a portion of the Ethereum network gas fee, otherwise known as the transaction fee, is permanently removed from the Ether circulation. Simply put, more ETH gets burned in a high-demand environment.\n\nWe began to see the Ethereum network\u2019s deflationary functionality after October 8, when a new crypto project named XEN Crypto increased network traffic. At the time, XEN Crypto accounted for the burning of 4,490 ETH tokens against 16,690.52 ETH tokens on the day, which represents 26.90% of the total transactions burned.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s unending relevance: It is believed that people\u2019s interest in Bitcoin remains relatively high as experts assess quality compared to other crypto assets in the industry.\n\nCNBC reported that Venture capital investor, Tim Draper, explained that weaker coins will become relics amid the ongoing crypto winter, benefitting BTC. According to him, this is an indicator that the top cryptocurrency could reach $250,000 per token.\n\nEthereum\u2019s heftier transaction volumes have continued into the new year, with the Ethereum transaction count on Jan. 2 reaching 924,614, a 300% increase compared to Bitcoin\u2019s 229,191 on the same day, according to Bitinfocharts.\n\nThe analyst who posted the metrics explained that he was sceptical about people saying that a \u201cflippening,\u201d could happen someday, and further added that those advocating for it have reason to do so now.\n\nA flippening occurs when one chain surpasses a higher-ranked one for the same metric, in this case, transactions and activity.\n\nWhile there is a clear distance between Ethereum and Bitcoin\u2019s transaction volumes, the distance could be more significant than we are reading. This is because the charts do not include layer 2 transactions, which would put Ethereum even further ahead of Bitcoin for this metric.\n\nAccording to L2beat, the number of L2 transactions per second actually surpassed those on layer 1 Ethereum in mid-October and has remained above it ever since."

        "content": "Ethereum Name Service (ENS) experienced a highly successful year in 2022, with over 80% of the total ENS domains created since its inception being registered during that year, despite the challenging market conditions for cryptocurrencies.\n\nHappy New Year everyone! \ud83c\udf89\n\n\n\n2022 was an incredible year for ENS! \ud83d\ude80\n\n\n\nOver 2.2m ENS names were registered in 2022 (that's 80% of ALL names created) \ud83e\udd2f\n\n\n\nIf you're ready for 2023, drop your ENS below \u2728 \u2014 ens.eth (@ensdomains) January 1, 2023\n\nAccording to data from Dune, as of January 2nd, ENS had approximately 2.82 million names registered and 631,393 owners of ENS domains. It also saw the most ENS registrations of the year, with 459,054 domains registered.\n\nSource: Dune\n\nAdditionally, May 2022 was a successful month for ENS, with many .eth domain registrations likely being influenced by the low gas fees on the Ethereum network at the time. The data shows that it recorded about 64,594 new addresses in May.\n\nSource: Dune\n\nEthereum Name Service (ENS) is a decentralized database that enables users to register and manage domain names on the Ethereum blockchain using the ENS token. The token is used for transferring ownership of these domains and for payment when registering and managing domain names.\n\nTo register a domain name with ENS, users need to send a certain amount of Ether (ETH) to an address provided by ENS. This ETH will cover the transaction fees and other costs associated with registering the domain name.\n\nTo transfer ownership of an ENS domain name, the current owner will need to send a certain amount of ENS tokens along with information about the new owner, like their address and signature. It can be done through exchanges or wallets that support ERC-20 tokens, like MyEtherWallet.\n\nEthereum (ETH) & ENS Price Analysis\n\nAs of now, Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, is trading at $1,249.01. It has seen a 2.65% increase in the past 24 hours and a 4% increase over the past week, according to Coinmarletcap.\n\nSource: Tradingview\n\nIn 2022, Ethereum saw a significant drop in value, falling from over $1,600 to under $1,100. In December, it briefly rose above $1,300 before falling back again. It is also down 75% from its all-time high of $4,878 in November 2021.\n\nAdditionally, the data shows that Ethereum Name Service is trading at $11.73. The token\u2019s price is promising in both daily and weekly charts by 4% and 7.72%, respectively. The token\u2019s trading volume is also rising significantly, and it is currently increased by about 48.81% in the last 24 hours.\n\nSource: Tradingview.com\n\nRelated Reading | Solana\u2019s Meme Token BONK Is Booming On Its Ecosystem"

        "content": "Coinbase has recently said that they will be not supporting the native tokens of Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ethereum Classic (ETC) an others\n\nTechnical indicators of ETC are favoring the upside move. ETC/BTC pair has seen a gain of over 8% in intraday session.\n\nEthereum Classic is a decentralized, open-source blockchain platform that was created in 2016 as a result of a hard fork of the original Ethereum blockchain. It was created to allow users to build and deploy decentralized applications (dApps) on the Ethereum Classic network.Like Ethereum, Ethereum Classic is powered by smart contracts \u2013 self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. This allows for the creation of a wide range of applications, including financial applications, games, and even voting systems.One of the main differences between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic is that the latter adheres to the original philosophy of the Ethereum project, which is to maintain a decentralized platform that is not controlled by any single entity. This means that Ethereum Classic is resistant to censorship and is more democratic in nature.\n\nEthereum Classic has gained a lot of popularity in recent years, but has seen a decline in the transactions. Various analysts are expecting a strong momentum in the future\n\nBulls Of ETC Are Ready For A Marathon\n\nSource: tradingView\n\nThe weekly technical chart of the ETC suggests a consolidated trend in price. On coming to the daily chart it is trading near $17.6 with a gain of 10.8%.ETC has broken the consolidated trend and is ready to move for a new high.

        "title": "Lido DAO Price Pumps 42% In A Week Ahead of Much-Awaited Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade - Inside Bitcoins",
        "content": "Don\u2019t invest unless prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, you shouldn\u2019t expect to be protected if something goes wrong.\n\nJoin Our Telegram channel to stay up to date on breaking news coverage\n\nLido DAO price surges another 7.5% in 24 hours, bringing the total cumulative gains in the last seven days to slightly above 42%. The decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) token, which supports the staking of multiple assets, is trading at $1.35 at the time of writing, although it recently hit a three-week high of $1.45.\n\nInvestor interest in LIDO is growing by the day, bolstered by continued community engagement via channels like Twitter. According to the latest report from Lido Finance, staking deposits for Ethereum (ETH) grew by 0.21% to 4,637,760 in the seven days ending January 2.\n\n(1) Lido on Twitter: \u201c\u26a1\ufe0f Lido Deposits Ethereum: 4,637,760 ETH (7d: +0.21%) Polygon: 58,025,885 MATIC (7d: +3.32%) Solana: 2,335,230 SOL (7d: -6.13%) Polkadot: 2,522,827 DOT (7d: +1.89%) Kusama: 99,290 KSM (7d: +0.38%) https://t.co/zQw07WF6Se\u201d / Twitter\n\nStaking despots for Polygon (MATIC) went up 3.32% to 58,025,885 in the same period. Staking deposits for Solana (SOL) fell by -6.13% to 2,335,230, while deposits in Polkadot (DOT) increased by 1.89% to 2,522,827.\n\nLido DAO Price Sustains Winning Streak Ahead of the Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade\n\nGovernance tokens like Lido DAO, SWISE and RPL exploded this week despite Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) staying relatively unchanged. The uptick in the price of tokens that allow investors to retain the liquidity of their assets despite being locked (staked) in a smart contract started after Ethereum developers announced their commitment to enabling withdrawals of ETH staked in the Beacon Chain since December 2020.\n\n\u201cMost recently, liquid staking derivatives [tokens] have had a nice uptrend. This is thanks to the Shanghai upgrade expected in a few months, which will enable withdrawals of staked ETH. As withdrawals are enabled, many believe more users will stake their ETH,\u201d CroissantEth, a pseudonymous analyst said via Twitter.\n\nStaking refers to the process of locking up crypto assets in a smart contract to support network development; in return, investors earn rewards. The term can loosely be compared to investing in a fixed-income security like a government bond.\n\nLiquid staking platforms like Lido DAO allow investors to access the staked value, including the rewards earned via a derivative token, representing the claim on the assets. Users can then utilize this derivative token to generate more revenue elsewhere in the market.\n\nThe release of Ethereum staked in the Beacon chain will encourage other investors to lock up their assets. Since Liquid staking platforms make up 40% of all the staked Ether, their popularity is bound to grow.\n\nData from Messari, a crypto analytics platform, reveals that Ethereum has the lowest ratio in the Layer-1 asset class at 14%. In other words, there is a lot of room for growth in Ethereum\u2019s staking rate relative to the total supply.\n\n(1) David Alexander II on Twitter: \u201cQuick ?on the Shanghai upgrade and $ETH staking: As withdrawals on staked $ETH now have a tentative release date, this has led to increased staking activity \u2013 the highest monthly volume since April. However, this upgrade also has many implications for staking providers \u2b07\ufe0f https://t.co/A8UuSuikai\u201d / Twitter\n\nLido DAO is now at the helm of the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector after displacing major platforms like MakerDAO and AAVE based on data from DefiLlama.\n\nLido DAO Price Stalls Ahead of Another Breakout\n\nLido DAO price has retreated to exchange hands at $1.35 after failing to clear resistance provided by the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (in purple) at $1.35. Profit booking could drive the pullback, but more buyers are expected to scoop up a lower-priced LDO.\n\nThe bullish outlook in Lido DAO is still intact according to the position of the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator above the mean line. Similarly, a buy signal confirmed at the beginning of the year implies bulls have the upper hand.\n\nLido DAO price rally will likely continue to $2.40, a 108% falling wedge pattern\u2019s breakout target. This bullish pattern often marks the end of a substantial downtrend. Traders who fired up their buy orders above the upper trend line saw their positions immediately turn profitable and might be cashing out amid the ongoing retracement.\n\nIt is worth remembering that the 108% target equals the distance between the widest points of the wedge extrapolated above the breakout point. Traders should wait until LDO closes the bearish candle and starts printing another green candle before entering new buy orders. A break above the 200-day EMA would affirm a strong bullish grip on the price. Key resistance levels to keep in mind are $1.70, $2.10 and $3.10, respectively.\n\nAltcoins to Consider in 2023\n\nInvestors considering changing the contents of their holdings may be interested in up-and-coming altcoins with the potential to return above-average gains following their first debut on exchanges. In the presale stage, the tokens offer investors a unique opportunity to get in when the price is still very low.\n\nFightOut (FGHT)\n\nAs the fitness industry expands its wings from Web2 to Web3 platforms, it is becoming difficult for investors to decide the projects to back. However, FightOut presents a model that has yet to be seen among other M2E projects like SweatCoin, Step App and STEPN.\n\nFightOut\u2019s idea is to open the fitness industry to everybody and bring down the prohibitive costs that continue to hinder mass adoption. A fitness app will be used to track the progress of all members and distribute rewards earned by completing workouts and challenges.\n\nFightOut is conducting a presale to raise money to help develop the ecosystem and purchase a series of gyms worldwide where users can grow within a community of like-minded people.\n\nFGHT presale is underway and has raised $2.6 million by selling 1 FGHT for 1 USDT.
