        "title": "Ethereum's Next Upgrade To Focus on Blobs - Blockworks",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s developer community has had time to recover from the Shanghai-Capella (Shapella) upgrade a little over two weeks ago. Now, they have turned their attention to planning what will ship next.\n\nThe consensus on Thursday\u2019s bi-weekly all-core devs call, was that the upgrade, known as Cancun-Deneb \u2014 shortened to \u201cDencun\u201d \u2014 will focus on a feature vital to the success of the network\u2019s rollup-centric roadmap: proto-danksharding, the nickname for Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844.\n\nProto-danksharding introduces a new transaction type \u2014 the \u201cblob-carrying transaction\u201d \u2014 a temporary data storage mechanism that is expected to reduce transaction costs for users on layer-2 rollups, by orders of magnitude.\n\nP\u00e9ter Szil\u00e1gyi, team lead at the Ethereum foundation, summed up the overarching view in the Zoom room: \u201cI kind of feel that 4844 should be the thing that everybody focuses on, and the rest is \u2018nice to have\u2019.\u201d\n\nSzil\u00e1gyi was the chief proponent of making 4844 a priority back in January, when he suggested it should take precedence over the withdrawal of staked ether in Shapella, but was overruled by his peers.\n\nThis time, he\u2019s all but certain to get his wish. There was no disagreement that Cancun \u2014 the execution layer part of the upgrade that was the focus of the call \u2014 will have proto-danksharding front and center.\n\nBut what goes into Cancun besides 4844?\n\nDeactivate SELFDESTRUCT\n\nIt may sound like an urgent task for your movie hero of choice, but in Ethereum-speak it\u2019s an \u201cattempt at getting rid of the SELFDESTRUCT opcode in order to pave the road for statelessness.\u201d\n\nThe concept of a stateless Ethereum goes back to co-founder Vitalik Buterin\u2019s October 2017 post. \u201cState\u201d refers to all the key information at a point in time for the blockchain: all Ethereum accounts, their balances, all deployed smart contracts and the storage associated with these.\n\nA future upgrade or set of upgrades will shift responsibility for storing the blockchain\u2019s full state to more specialized \u201carchival nodes,\u201d allowing for a much larger set of full nodes to store much less. That would make it even easier for anyone to run a node, furthering the goal of network decentralization.\n\nFor now, this precursor EIP-6780 was agreed to merit inclusion in Cancun by all client teams.\n\nCall moderator and project coordinator Tim Beiko concluded that \u201cclearly the self-destruct [proposal] is the second most mentioned EIP beyond 4844.\u201d\n\nHe noted that an external auditor has been hired to ascertain, using on-chain data, whether currently deployed smart contracts could be broken by the change. The results are about a month away, Beiko said, yet there was no objection to making plans for the destruction of SELFDESTRUCT now and, as pseudonymous Geth developer lightclient said, \u201crevisit it after the report comes.\u201d\n\nTransient storage\n\nOne EIP that was eighty-sixed from Shapella, despite being ready to go, was EIP-1153.\n\nEIP-1153 proposes new, cost-effective ways to temporarily store data in Ethereum smart contracts, improving communication between different parts of a transaction. This update would support various applications, such as enhanced security features and streamlined token approvals.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see much effort to push it out, so I don\u2019t see a point for it to be delayed,\u201d Lukasz Rozmej from the Nethermind client team said on the call.\n\nJustin Florentine from the Besu client team said, while he would stop short of calling 1153 \u201ca must-have,\u201d he remained in very strong support.\n\nEIP-1153, or \u201ctransient storage\u201d is popular enough to have its own \u201cfan page,\u201d and was pushed hard by the Uniswap team in late 2022, in a manner that rubbed some Ethereum developers the wrong way.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nBut, in the intervening months, the proposal has truly become uncontroversial, and Erigon\u2019s Andrew Ashikhmin tipped the consensus in favor of its inclusion when he singled it out for endorsement on the call as \u201ca small EIP that people are mostly in favor of.\u201d\n\nEOF remains a ways off\n\nOne upgrade that was also originally a part of Shanghai, known as EVM Object Format (EOF), was broadly lauded by the assembled core developers, but once again considered a poor match for the 4844-centered Cancun plan \u2014 essentially reaffirming the consensus from late March.\n\nThe EVM Object Format (EOF) is an extensible and versioned container format for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) that introduces a one-time validation during contract deployment. It aims to improve code and data separation, making it easier to introduce new features or deprecate old ones.\n\nLong-time Ethereum core developer Greg Colvin articulated the importance of getting EOF implemented from his perspective.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been discussing this for 7 years,\u201d Colvin said.\n\nOther developers were of the opinion that EOF was \u201ctoo big to be the second place in a fork,\u201d as Ansgar Dietrichs, a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, put it. He suggested it should be the focus of the next major upgrade, called Prague.\n\nDanno Ferrin, principal software engineer at Swirlds Labs concurred. \u201cAs much as it hurts, I think it\u2019s the right decision,\u201d he told his colleagues on the call.\n\nBeiko analogized the pair of major upgrades \u2014 4844 and EOF \u2014 to the prior two \u2014 the Merge and withdrawals \u2014 telling Colvin, \u201cI think the strongest commitment we can make is to have it be the main thing for the next fork, but even that is not something we can 100% commit to today.\u201d\n\nEOF remains a \u201cquick follow\u201d candidate, meaning developers would likely make it a priority within six months after Cancun.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just time,\u201d Colvin said. \u201cI\u2019ve got work I\u2019ve been wanting to do on the [Ethereum Virtual Machine] for 7 years that I can\u2019t do until this is in.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler may have appeared to sidestep questions recently on whether Ethereum and other crypto assets are securities\u2014but he certainly seemed confident back in 2018.\n\nA video has emerged on Twitter showing the top regulator giving a lecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In it, he says that Ethereum is \u201cnot a security\u201d in the eyes of the SEC.\n\nEthereum is the second biggest cryptocurrency, with a market cap of $227 billion at the time of writing. In the past, regulators have struggled with how to label the asset.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIn 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission has said regardless of what it might have been in [2014],\u201d Gensler said, referring to when Ethereum launched and announced an ICO using Bitcoin to buy it, \u201cit\u2019s now sufficiently decentralized that we\u2019ll consider it not a security.\u201d\n\nAnd another one... - The below clip is from a Fall 2018 Graduate MIT course called \"Blockchain and Money\" Gary Gensler - the current President of the SEC, was the professor. Once again, I will let the below video speak for itself. Lecture 6: Smart Contracts and\u2026 pic.twitter.com/hsTvJ82XmM \u2014 zk-\ud83e\udd88 (@ZK_shark) April 28, 2023\n\nGensler, a civilian at the time and speaking only in his capacity as a professor, appeared to simply be relaying the opinions of the SEC back in 2018\u2014specifically, the opinion expressed by former Director of Corporate Finance William Hinman in his much-cited \"sufficiently decentralized\" speech from June of that year.\n\nStill, the irony wasn't lost on Crypto Twitter\u2014especially when juxtaposed against Gensler's recent duel with Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-NC) during an appearance before a House Oversight Committee. Repeatedly asked to give his opinion as to whether Ethereum should be classified a security, and even confronted with Hinman's comments from 2018, Gensler refuses to answer the question.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe clip of Gensler's lecture at MIT is one of many recently surfaced by Twitter user \"ZK_shark.\" Earlier this week, another clip shared by ZK_shark was retweeted by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, whose company is currently in the SEC's crosshairs over its Ethereum staking product. In the clip, Genlser says he believes most of the crypto market is made up of \"non-securities.\" It's a statement that directly contradicts more recent comments as chair of the SEC in which he said he believes the \"vast majority\" of tokens in the crypto market are securities.\n\nMany have jumped in to criticize the regulator and former MIT teacher\u2014but crypto lawyer Preston Byrne chimed in on Twitter by saying that Gensler speaking as a professor and then as a top regulator are two different things. \u201cAs a professor, he can talk about what things are in the abstract,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAs a law enforcer, he\u2019s required to enforce the laws as they\u2019re written.\u201d\n\nGensler's refusal to answer lawmakers on whether Ethereum is security or a commodity is nothing new: Last year, he also refused to give a clear-cut answer when pressed. And crypto industry bigwigs\u2014from lawyers to CEOs\u2014have poked fun at the fact that Gensler has failed to answer straightforward questions in the past.\n\nI see a lot of people giving Gary Gensler a hard time over this but it\u2019s important to note the different capacities in which he\u2019s speaking. As a professor, he can talk about what things are in the abstract. As a law enforcer, he\u2019s required to enforce the laws as they\u2019re written. https://t.co/mYhd7Hm8I9 \u2014 Preston Byrne (@prestonjbyrne) April 26, 2023\n\nA security is a tradable financial asset that has monetary value\u2014like stocks or bonds\u2014that meets a specific legal definition as outlined by the so-called Howey Test.\n\nUnder U.S. law, an asset meets the definition of a security if it is an investment of money in a common enterprise from which there is an expectation of profit based on the efforts of others.\n\nGensler has said that Bitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, is not a security\u2014but rather a commodity. It's the only crypto asset for which he's currently willing to give a public opinion.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe SEC has launched an intense crackdown on the crypto industry during Gensler's tenure\u2014most recently targeting three U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchanges in as many months: Kraken, Bittrex, and Coinbase.\n\nSome political leaders in the U.S.\u2014especially Republican lawmakers\u2014have criticized the regulator for his latest actions. They claim he is stifling regulation in the world\u2019s largest economy and forcing American tech companies overseas."

        "content": "A Guide to Ethereum Exploits and Security Best Practices\n\nBy Boring Security\n\nRead 7 min Beginner\n\nSHARE\n\nAs a technology continues to evolve, it necessarily faces unique security challenges. Ethereum is no exception, and navigating this new world presents a host of pitfalls that can be intimidating for new users. Indeed, it seems every day we see another member of our community scammed.\n\nHowever, you don\u2019t have to be a security expert to keep your assets secure. Operating safely can be boiled down to a few simple rules. In this article, we\u2019ll talk about the scams that run rampant in the space today, and how to prevent yourself from becoming a victim.\n\nUnderstanding Self-custody\n\nThe beauty of Ethereum is that each user becomes the custodian of their own assets. There is no need for banks, debit cards, trading hours, or intermediaries. The chain runs 24/7, and remains available to anybody at any time, without bias. During peak hysteria, when centralized exchanges crash, the chain chugs along. You can always transact, though sometimes you may have to pay a pretty penny to do so.\n\nSelf-custody can be daunting. Because you control your own funds, you are also responsible for keeping them safe. Scammers know that less knowledgeable users can be exploited, and with no intermediaries to protect you, there\u2019s little to no recourse after losing your assets.\n\nsetApprovalForAll: Explained\n\nFirst, let\u2019s dispel a common misconception: a malicious smart contract can\u2019t steal your NFTs. In order to move an NFT governed by Contract A, Contract B would first require you to approve it to do so by using Contract A\u2019s setApprovalForAll function. This requires a separate transaction, and although setApprovalForAll is used in scams, it\u2019s not executed in this manner. This is important because it means that no degen mint can steal your assets as long as you verify that the contract you\u2019re interacting with is the degen mint contract, and not of some other asset you own.\n\nThough a contract can\u2019t be used to submit a malicious SAFA request, a website can. If a site unexpectedly asks you to setApprovalForAll (SAFA), it is almost surely a scam. They\u2019ll simply ask you to sign boredApeYachtClub.setApprovalForAll instead of degenMint.publicMint, and if you sign it, they are free to take all of your Bored Ape Yacht Club tokens. Most Ethereum wallets will provide a warning when you are about to sign a SAFA request, so always be extra cautious when you see one. If you aren\u2019t expecting to sign a SAFA request, then you shouldn\u2019t.\n\nThere are, of course, legitimate reasons to use SAFA. NFT Marketplaces like OpenSea or Blur require approval to move your NFT if somebody buys it. If you see a SAFA while listing an NFT on a marketplace you trust, you are safe to proceed. For the same reason, P2P trading sites like NFTTrader require approvals to execute a swap. However, there are a lot of scammers who utilize this transaction type to scam you. Let\u2019s take a look at a few below.\n\nMost Popular Scam Methods That Utilize the \u201cSAFA\u201d\n\nNFT Trading Scams\n\nThese types of scams use social engineering techniques to convince you to take part in their private trade. Next, they will send you a fake trading site. Since marketplaces will ask you to setapprovalforall, the process might seem trustworthy. However, instead of approving a marketplace\u2019s smart contract, a scammer will trick you into approving their wallet. At that point, the scammer can steal your NFTs and block your future messages.\n\nTo avoid this particular scam, bookmark reliable platforms such as OpenSea, LooksRare, X2Y2, NFTTrader, and SudoSwap. For some other similar tips, check out the Boring Security guide on how to trade securely.\n\nFake Revoke Sites: Another way that scammers might request a SAFA from you is to claim that there is a new exploit on a particular marketplace like Blur or OpenSea. Next they direct you to a fake site to revoke approvals. Since revoking approvals prompts a SAFA transaction, it can be difficult to tell if it is legitimate or not. Signing the wrong transaction approves the scammer\u2019s address to steal your NFTs. To avoid this, bookmark your preferred revoke site, such as http://revoke.cash and https://approvals.xyz.\n\nAirdropped NFTs with WETH offers: If you\u2019ve asked yourself, \u201ccan I accept that WETH offer on the junk NFT that appeared in my wallet?\u201d, you\u2019re not alone. The answer is yes, and no. The NFT itself can\u2019t harm you \u2013 remember, contracts can\u2019t steal your other NFTs. So what are they all about? First of all, the WETH offer is fake \u2013 if you try to accept it, the transaction will fail. The reason it\u2019s there is to draw your eyes to something else: the item description. In the description, you\u2019ll find a link to an external website where, you guessed it, they\u2019ll ask you to sign a malicious transaction. You can read more on this technique in this twitter thread by Quit.\n\nAccusing You Of Being A Scammer: A popular method lately has been to make accusations that you are scamming people in discord, complete with (doctored) screenshots of you scamming in DMs. This is particularly nasty because you are naturally inclined to attempt to protect your reputation. The end goal here is to lure you into a fake discord server that uses an imitation of Collab.Land or Vulcan for verification. When you go to verify your identity, the imitation site requests a SAFA or a seaport signature (more on that below) from you! Keep yourself safe from these by ignoring any accusations of scamming.\n\n\n\nOther Methods: We\u2019ve seen fake derivative sites, fake mints, staking sites, airdrop claims, hacked accounts on Twitter linking phishing sites, Function name collision obfuscation (too long to talk about in this article, but explained beautifully here), and many more. We couldn\u2019t possibly get through them all, but you should know the components of an Approval transaction, what to look for, and what to watch out for with existing approvals. Check out this article written by Boring Security about approvals for more information. The bottom line is: be extremely careful where and what you give approvals to, what you sign, and where you sign it!\n\nSeaport Signatures\n\nNow that we know how to avoid SAFAs, let\u2019s look at another, potentially more devastating SAFA-related scam: the Seaport Signature. This scam has risen in popularity over the past few months as SAFA awareness grows, and is now the culprit for the majority of scams we see every day.\n\nIt is commonly assumed that if a website requests a gasless signature, it\u2019s safe to sign. That couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. In fact, the most devastating scam out there leverages gasless signatures to steal bundles of NFTs all at once.\n\nRemember that marketplaces require approvals in order to move your NFTs, for example, when it must move a listed NFT to its new buyer. On the other end, these marketplaces use signatures to verify that the listing is valid before finalizing the sale.\n\nA valid signature contains specific data; the token(s) name, the listing deadline, the price of the assets, and more. Any number of tokens can be included in a listing. But it\u2019s not just NFTs, setting approvals works for ERC-20 tokens such as $USDC and $APE as well.\n\nAll a scammer needs to do to take advantage of this is request a signature from you that includes all of your tokens as assets, and a price of 0. Once you sign it, they can submit that signature to Seaport to \u201cbuy\u201d the new listing, transferring all of your assets to them. That leaves nothing for you.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that only tokens that you\u2019ve approved to Seaport are at risk of this attack, and prevention is fairly simple. The OpenSea signature is verbose and hard to decipher. If a website you don\u2019t trust prompts you for a signature and you can\u2019t understand what it means, don\u2019t sign it. This is the best way to keep safe \u2013 signatures are required to prove ownership on many sites, but legitimate use cases should always be human-readable messages like \u201cWelcome to collab.land!\u201d. If you want to get into the finer points of signature types, and some screenshot examples, head on over to Boring Security\u2019s \u201cSafe Signing 101\u201d article shown here.\n\nOutside of being careful about what you sign, you should also practice good asset segregation. Since only the NFTs you\u2019ve approved to OpenSea or other marketplaces are vulnerable to this type of attack, you don\u2019t need to worry about it on wallet addresses that don\u2019t carry any open approvals. You should always keep your most valuable NFTs in a vault wallet with no approvals. Then when you need to sell, transfer them to an intermediate wallet and list them for sale from there. Since your vault has not approved anything to any exchanges, you don\u2019t have to worry about gasless signature scams. Using this method, you successfully close off the entryway for the most common and deadly attack.\n\nAlso note that while less common, Blur signatures and approvals are also subject to this type of scam. To explain, Blur signatures will appear as a random hex string. This is perhaps even more unreadable than a Seaport signature.\n\nETH_SIGN\n\nAlthough most major wallets have this setting disabled by default, it is worth mentioning. You may decide to enable it for things like Opensea Pro.\n\nThere is another type of gasless signature that can be dangerous: the eth_sign. At its core, a blockchain transaction is simply a signed message that when decoded, includes fields like Gas Price, Nonce, Value, To Address and more. So attackers using this method will assemble a valid transaction and then ask you to sign it. That\u2019s because, once signed, anybody can submit the transaction. If all of the parameters are still valid (i.e. your nonce hasn\u2019t changed), the transaction will be executed as if you submitted it yourself. . This raw transaction signing is called an eth_sign, and luckily it is now disabled by default using most major wallets.\n\nIf you do happen to sign one, there can only be a single transaction executed using that signature. Once the damage is done, you are safe to continue using your wallet as normal.\n\nAddress Poisoning\n\nAddress poisoning happens when an attacker sends fake tokens from your address to an address that resembles one from your transaction history. They can do this very effectively and cheaply using something called event spoofing. Rest assured that not only is your address still secure, but these tokens aren\u2019t even actually moving. The scammer hopes that some time in the future, you will copy and past a destination you sent to in the past, and accidentally choose their lookalike address over the real one. Avoid falling victim by double checking your destination before confirming any transactions!\n\nPrivate Key Compromise\n\nThe most devastating attack of all is the private key compromise. Thankfully, this also happens to be the attack that is most easily avoided. If you are not using a hardware wallet, your private keys are saved somewhere (hopefully encrypted) on your device. A malicious program will be able to locate and extract these keys, giving an attacker full control of your wallet.\n\nPrivate key compromises are the hardest type to track down the source of, because there\u2019s nothing on-chain that can hint at source. Any malware can be responsible for stealing your private keys. To explain, anything you download and run on your device can potentially be the culprit.\n\nSocial Engineering Scams\n\nThe most common method is a social engineering scam. The top three scams we\u2019ve seen in 2023 have been:\n\nGame Beta Testing: A scammer will offer you money in exchange for beta testing a \u201cgame\u201d that they\u2019re building. Testing the game will require downloading and installing it, of course. To follow, the installer will attempt to hijack your wallet\u2019s private key. If successful, they drain the wallet\u2019s contents. Additionally, an automated sweeper will be attached to extract any assets sent to the address in future. IP Royalty Contract Scam: A scammer will offer you royalties and payments for the usage of your NFT\u2019s IP. This is the dream, right? Passive income. Unfortunately, they will either get you to sign a scam transaction, or have you download a fake PDF that contains a private key stealing virus. Collaboration Request/Contract: Founders and those involved in projects with high-value NFTs are targeted by all types of companies attempting to appear legitimate. These are getting more prevalent, and use the same method as above. They may also even get on calls with you to buy credibility with you.\n\nIf your private key has been compromised, your only option is to abandon the wallet and start fresh. If there are assets remaining in the compromised wallet, for example, assets that were staked or otherwise not immediately apparent to an attacker, those assets can sometimes be rescued using a flashbots bundle by whitehat hackers in the Flashbots discord server.\n\nIf you use a hardware wallet, your keys are protected from the internet. This keeps them safe from things like malware, as long as you don\u2019t manually store them somewhere online. Ledger devices use a secure element chip, meaning they are some of the most secure hardware wallets in existence. To be properly protected while using a hardware wallet, you should keep your seed phrase written down offline, on paper, or better yet, using metal. To learn more, make sure to check out the article on how to protect your recovery phrase.\n\nFinal Thoughts From Boring Security\n\nThe world of Ethereum and NFTs is an exciting and rapidly evolving space, but it is essential to remain vigilant and well-informed to avoid falling victim to scams and malicious actors. Safeguard yourself by thoroughly understanding the potential risks associated with malicious smart contracts, SAFA requests, Seaport signatures, ETH_SIGN, and private key compromises. Exercise caution when signing transactions, approving contracts, or downloading and installing new software, and always pay close attention to any warning signs.\n\nKeep your assets vaulted. If you value something, leave it in a wallet that has no open approvals.\n\nUtilize hardware wallets to provide an additional layer of security for your private keys, ensuring that they stay safely stored offline. Bookmark and rely on trusted platforms for conducting transactions and managing your assets to avoid inadvertently accessing malicious websites. By following these guidelines and consistently staying up-to-date on emerging threats and best practices, you can confidently engage with the Ethereum ecosystem and the world of NFTs while effectively safeguarding your valuable assets from potential risks.\n\nHave any questions or want to learn more about web3 security and stay up to date on the most current security information, scams, and tactics?

        "title": "Better Buy: Ethereum or Bitcoin? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Despite a recent pullback in the crypto market, both Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) continue to be two of the best-performing cryptos. Bitcoin is up about 80% for the year, while Ethereum is up about 60%. On the surface, it would appear that Bitcoin is clearly the superior investment in 2023.\n\nHowever, two market indicators paint a different picture of what's happening in the crypto market right now. Here's a closer look at how Ethereum stacks up with Bitcoin on a relative basis.\n\nBitcoin's correlation with Ethereum\n\nCorrelations are incredibly important in the crypto markets. For example, any time the correlation of Bitcoin with gold tightens, it usually signals that investors are about to pile into Bitcoin as a safe-haven investment. Investors also use the correlation of Bitcoin with broad market indexes such as the S&P 500 or the Nasdaq 100 to gauge how the market currently views crypto as a risky asset. The tighter the correlation between Bitcoin and the Nasdaq, the thinking goes, the more that investors are viewing Bitcoin as just a slightly riskier tech stock.\n\nBut there's another correlation that many investors are not talking about, and that's the correlation between Bitcoin and Ethereum. The conventional wisdom is that the correlation between the two is very close to 1.0, so it's not really worth tracking. However, Coinbase Global (NASDAQ: COIN) made waves earlier this month when it published a report showing how the correlation between Bitcoin and Ethereum appears to be declining, from a level of 0.95 in mid-March to a level of 0.82 in mid-April. That might not seem like a big deal, but it is for institutional investors. It directly impacts risk management and sophisticated hedging techniques.\n\nThere are a number of different factors that might be responsible for this shift, including Ethereum's recent tech upgrade in March. If this trend persists, it could signal that Ethereum is finally uncoupling from Bitcoin and going its own way. That would be a net positive for Ethereum because it would fundamentally challenge the simplistic \"Bitcoin is gold, Ethereum is silver\" investment narrative.\n\nThe Ethereum/Bitcoin currency pair\n\nSince both Bitcoin and Ethereum are digital currencies, it makes sense to evaluate them from the perspective of a foreign exchange trader. One way of doing this is by tracking the performance of the Ethereum/Bitcoin currency pair over time. By doing so, you can immediately see when Ethereum is \"strengthening\" against Bitcoin and when it is \"weakening\" against Bitcoin. In much the same way, a foreign exchange trader could see when the U.S. dollar is strengthening or weakening against the Euro (or some other currency).\n\nData by Trading View\n\nAs can be seen from the chart above, the current value of the Ethereum/Bitcoin currency pair is approximately 0.066. This is derived from dividing the current price of Ethereum ($1,915) by the current price of Bitcoin ($28,964). The value of the Ethereum/Bitcoin currency pair has traded, by and large, in a relatively narrow range of 0.06 to 0.08 since mid-2021. From a historical perspective, this value is actually quite high. In the period from 2019 to 2021, for example, the value typically ranged from 0.02 to 0.03. The big breakout came during the last crypto bull market rally when the number of possible use cases for Ethereum exploded. On the graph, it's possible to see a huge spike right around March 2021.\n\nPutting all this together, it's possible to create an investment thesis around Ethereum and Bitcoin. Ever since 2021, Ethereum seems to be gaining in value on a relative basis vs. Bitcoin. Another way to think about this is that as Ethereum continues to introduce new technological upgrades and expand its ecosystem, it is \"strengthening\" against Bitcoin and becoming a better investment. If you think about the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem as an economy, then this becomes intuitively clear. In the same way, one would expect the U.S. dollar to strengthen if the U.S. economy strengthens.\n\nDoes the data favor Ethereum?\n\nOverall, a case can be made that Ethereum is not just a better investment than Bitcoin right now, but that it's also becoming a better investment over time. Ethereum clearly has a more diversified blockchain ecosystem than Bitcoin and offers a whole range of products and offerings -- such as NFTs, blockchain gaming, metaverse worlds, and decentralized finance (DeFi) -- that Bitcoin simply can't match. Bitcoin is, first and foremost, a method of payment.\n\nThus, if you're a Bitcoin maximalist, you might want to take a closer look at the changing relationship between Bitcoin and Ethereum. Right now, it looks like Ethereum after The Merge is stronger, better, and more diversified than it has ever been, and investors are starting to recognize this. At some point, say some crypto investors, Ethereum could eventually \"flip\" Bitcoin and become the most valuable cryptocurrency in the world."

        "content": "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler may have appeared to sidestep questions recently on whether Ethereum and other crypto assets are securities\u2014but he certainly seemed confident back in 2018.\n\nA video has emerged on Twitter showing the top regulator giving a lecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In it, he says that Ethereum is \u201cnot a security\u201d in the eyes of the SEC.\n\nEthereum is the second biggest cryptocurrency, with a market cap of $227 billion at the time of writing. In the past, regulators have struggled with how to label the asset.\n\n\u201cIn 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission has said regardless of what it might have been in [2014],\u201d Gensler said, referring to when Ethereum launched and announced an ICO using Bitcoin to buy it, \u201cit\u2019s now sufficiently decentralized that we\u2019ll consider it not a security.\u201d\n\nAnd another one... - The below clip is from a Fall 2018 Graduate MIT course called \"Blockchain and Money\" Gary Gensler - the current President of the SEC, was the professor. Once again, I will let the below video speak for itself. Lecture 6: Smart Contracts and\u2026 pic.twitter.com/hsTvJ82XmM \u2014 zk-\ud83e\udd88 (@ZK_shark) April 28, 2023\n\nGensler, a civilian at the time and speaking only in his capacity as a professor, appeared to simply be relaying the opinions of the SEC back in 2018\u2014specifically, the opinion expressed by former Director of Corporate Finance William Hinman in his much-cited \"sufficiently decentralized\" speech from June of that year.\n\nStill, the irony wasn't lost on Crypto Twitter\u2014especially when juxtaposed against Gensler's recent duel with Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-NC) during an appearance before a House Oversight Committee. Repeatedly asked to give his opinion as to whether Ethereum should be classified a security, and even confronted with Hinman's comments from 2018, Gensler refuses to answer the question.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe clip of Gensler's lecture at MIT is one of many recently surfaced by Twitter user \"ZK_shark.\" Earlier this week, another clip shared by ZK_shark was retweeted by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, whose company is currently in the SEC's crosshairs over its Ethereum staking product. In the clip, Genlser says he believes most of the crypto market is made up of \"non-securities.\" It's a statement that directly contradicts more recent comments as chair of the SEC in which he said he believes the \"vast majority\" of tokens in the crypto market are securities.\n\nMany have jumped in to criticize the regulator and former MIT teacher\u2014but crypto lawyer Preston Byrne chimed in on Twitter by saying that Gensler speaking as a professor and then as a top regulator are two different things. \u201cAs a professor, he can talk about what things are in the abstract,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAs a law enforcer, he\u2019s required to enforce the laws as they\u2019re written.\u201d\n\nGensler Says Proof-of-Stake Assets Could Be Securities: Report\n\nGensler's refusal to answer lawmakers on whether Ethereum is security or a commodity is nothing new: Last year, he also refused to give a clear-cut answer when pressed. And crypto industry bigwigs\u2014from lawyers to CEOs\u2014have poked fun at the fact that Gensler has failed to answer straightforward questions in the past.\n\nI see a lot of people giving Gary Gensler a hard time over this but it\u2019s important to note the different capacities in which he\u2019s speaking. As a professor, he can talk about what things are in the abstract. As a law enforcer, he\u2019s required to enforce the laws as they\u2019re written. https://t.co/mYhd7Hm8I9 \u2014 Preston Byrne (@prestonjbyrne) April 26, 2023\n\nA security is a tradable financial asset that has monetary value\u2014like stocks or bonds\u2014that meets a specific legal definition as outlined by the so-called Howey Test.\n\nUnder U.S. law, an asset meets the definition of a security if it is an investment of money in a common enterprise from which there is an expectation of profit based on the efforts of others.\n\nGensler has said that Bitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, is not a security\u2014but rather a commodity. It's the only crypto asset for which he's currently willing to give a public opinion.\n\nThe SEC has launched an intense crackdown on the crypto industry during Gensler's tenure\u2014most recently targeting three U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchanges in as many months: Kraken, Bittrex, and Coinbase.\n\nSome political leaders in the U.S.\u2014especially Republican lawmakers\u2014have criticized the regulator for his latest actions. They claim he is stifling regulation in the world\u2019s largest economy and forcing American tech companies overseas."

        "title": "How to Reduce Ethereum Gas Fees? - LCX",
        "content": "Ethereum gas fees have been an important issue for those who use the platform. Gas fees are the fees that consumers must pay for each Ethereum transaction. The greater the fee, the quicker the transaction will be processed. However, gas prices can be an obstacle for some users, particularly those with modest transactions.\n\nThe Ethereum gas fee is the cost incurred whenever a transaction is executed on the blockchain. The operation of the Ethereum blockchain requires a certain level of processing effort, which is performed by cryptocurrency miners using Ethereum-based mining software.\n\nUtilize Simulation Via DeFi Saver\n\nThe actual gas price is unknown until they complete the payment process and pay for the gas. However, to stimulate the transactions with the DeFi Saver app. First, develop an instruction for Ethereum activities, then virtually execute it. The real-world simulation will provide the anticipated and maximum ETH gas fee. It can then be modified to complete the instruction to reduce gas costs. Now, implement this instruction on the Ethereum network to reduce the gas fees.\n\nTransaction Timing Improvement\n\nOvercrowding is one of the main causes of higher gas prices. However, the volume of Ethereum transactions fluctuates throughout the day. Occasionally, the gas charge for the exact same transaction that cost an additional ETH a few hours ago will be lower.\n\nHowever, learning about such instances can be monotonous. It will also hinder productivity, as it will need to continually check gas prices at various times. Therefore, users can view a detailed graph of weekly gas prices on the Ethereum Gas Charts webpage. Users can also perform a trick by avoiding work on weekdays. Even if they must submit a transaction during the week, do so after midnight. They may wish to delay their trip until the weekend, when gas prices are typically lower.\n\nSort Transaction Types.\n\nDepending on the sort of transaction, the gas fee varies on the Ethereum blockchain. To save money on gas fees, users may wish to organize and implement similar transactions simultaneously. Consider that they have two Ethereum addresses, each containing 1,000 tokens. Now, if users intend to store all tokens in a new DApp\u2019s crypt in order to earn higher returns. To avoid spending money on gas fees, it is possible to send every token to a single address and then secure 2,000 tokens in only one transaction.\n\nUtilize DApps Offering Rewards and Reduced prices on Ethereum Gas Fees.\n\nThere are Ethereum ventures and DApps with lower or subsidized gas compared to the market. Balancer is a platform of this type. It offers up to 90% gas fee reimbursement in the manner of the BAL token. Balancer significantly reduces the gas fee for high-frequency traders by performing trades without exiting the vault.\n\nSome DeFi applications, such as KeeperDAO and Yearn\u2019s V2 Vaults, consolidate user transactions. Each user pays the gas fee collectively rather than individually. This strategy substantially reduces the price.\n\nUtilize Gas Tokens\n\nWhen users delete data elements on the Ethereum network, they can receive reimbursements in the form of ETH. It is the foundation for gas tokens. When the fee is low, a substantial quantity of gas tokens can be minted. When users need to conduct a transaction on the network, they must exchange their gas tokens for ether. Use the rewarded ETH to pay for the gas. GasToken.io is a well-known initiative that enables the minting of gas tokens.\n\nReduced Ethereum gas fee benefits\n\nReducing Ethereum\u2019s gas fees has multiple benefits for consumers. It could make the system readily available to small-scale business users who were previously priced out due to high gas costs. This can boost the adoption of decentralized applications and encourage growth on the platform.\n\nReduced gas fees can make it less costly for users to conduct transactions on the platform, leading to an increase in usage and adoption. This can contribute to the development of an ecosystem that is stronger for designers, investors, and consumers.\n\nMoving to reduced gas fees can help enhance the platform\u2019s overall user experience. By reducing gas fees, users can appreciate more rapid and affordable transactions, which can be an important obstacle for them.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe reduction of Ethereum\u2019s gas fees is a crucial step in making the platform affordable, readily available, and user-friendly. Considering that Ethereum gas fees are the \u201cfuel\u201d of the Ethereum network, comprehending them is essential for executing transactions on the network. By following a few simple guidelines, such as waiting for weak-traffic instances before offering a transaction, adjusting the user wallet\u2019s fee settings, comparing rates, and utilizing scaling solutions such as Polygon, they can save on gas fees and ensure that all the transactions undergo processing easily and swiftly."

        "title": "Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade Explained, Key Metrics to Track and Future Predictions - Nansen",
        "content": "On April 12th, at 22:27 UTC, one of the most highly anticipated upgrades in Ethereum's history, the Shapella upgrade, was triggered. This upgrade is a combination of two separate upgrades: the Shanghai and Capella upgrades. It marks the first simultaneous upgrade of both Ethereum's consensus layer (Shanghai) and execution layer (Capella). Among the two, the Shanghai upgrade garnered the most attention, with supporters and critics alike actively monitoring its impact.\n\nWhat is the Shanghai Upgrade?\n\nIn short, the upgrade enables the withdrawal of ETH that has been staked on the Beacon Chain.\n\nEthereum consists of two layers: an execution layer and a consensus layer. The execution layer processes transactions and is the layer that you interact with and analyze on analytics tools such as Nansen or block explorers like Etherscan. The consensus layer, also known as the Beacon Chain, is responsible for maintaining the network's overall consensus, or agreement, on the current state of the blockchain. Since the launch of the Beacon Chain in December 2020, ETH holders have been able to stake their ETH but had no ability to withdraw it until now.\n\nSo, have validators been waiting to sell?\n\nNot exactly. While token unlocks have been associated with holders dumping in the past, Ethereum's situation is different. What the Shanghai upgrade enables is more like a typical Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain withdrawal mechanism than a vested token unlock.\n\nThree reasons why validators would want withdrawals enabled besides selling:\n\nValidators only earn yield on the principal 32 ETH that they\u2019ve staked. Without withdrawals enabled, validators are not able to re-stake their accrued rewards and hence are unable to compound their yield. There has been significant innovation and progress in ETH staking methodologies, and validators may want to reallocate their staking positions based on their priorities. For instance, stakers who have been solo staking or using illiquid Staking-as-a-Service options may want to switch to liquid staking protocols to maximize their yield. Enabling withdrawals also reduces the liquidity risk associated with staking ETH. This reduction in risk is likely to lower the barrier that deterred holders from staking their ETH, which could result in an increase in participation.\n\nHow do Ethereum withdrawals work?\n\nProbably the most important thing to understand about Shanghai is how withdrawals work. Ethereum withdrawals function differently from other PoS systems. While other PoS chains have a fixed unbonding period, which is the duration before users can access their staked tokens after submitting their withdrawal request, Ethereum has a variable one.\n\nThere are two types of withdrawals: partial withdrawals and full withdrawals. Both types of withdrawals have different triggers, and full withdrawals take significantly longer to process. But before we dive into both mechanisms, there's one crucial step that validators need to take to be eligible for withdrawals.\n\nHow do validators enable withdrawals?\n\nIn order for validators to be eligible for withdrawals, they have to update their withdrawal credential, which tells the network which address to send the withdrawn ETH to. Withdrawal credentials include one of two potential prefixes: 0x00 or 0x01. Only validators that have updated their credentials to the 0x01 prefix will be eligible for withdrawals. The maximum number of validators that can switch their prefix is 16 per block (12 seconds).\n\nOn the day of the upgrade, only about 43% of validators had updated their credentials. That number has now risen to 83.3% and will likely reach 100% as time goes by.\n\nThe rationale behind this number eventually reaching 100% is that every validator would want their accrued rewards to be withdrawn since they are only earning yield on the principal 32 ETH. It is not an indicator of their desire to exit and sell their ETH.\n\nWhat are partial withdrawals and how do they work?\n\nPartial withdrawals are withdrawals of accrued rewards while leaving the minimum 32 ETH required to operate as a validator intact, keeping the validator active. They are processed via an automated process and validators can expect to see their withdrawals reflected in their withdrawal address every 2-5 days.\n\nA common misconception with partial withdrawals is that they only occur every 2-5 days, but that's not the case. The protocol constantly scans through the validators and processes withdrawals for eligible validators. Up to 16 validators are processed per block (12 seconds) and \"2-5 days\" is the amount of time to complete one round of withdrawals across all validators. Note that this automatic withdrawal process is the same procedure that full withdrawals go through to complete their withdrawals.\n\nWhat are full withdrawals and how do they work?\n\nFull withdrawals are withdrawals of the entire balance of a validator and happen voluntarily or if the validator has been slashed. Full withdrawals take longer than partial withdrawals and are a multi-step process:\n\nExit queue (minimally 5 epochs, or 32 mins)\n\nMinimum validator withdrawability delay - 256 epochs (27.3 hours)\n\nAutomatic withdrawal queue (2-5 days)\n\nExit queue\n\nValidators must first exit the consensus layer before going through the same automatic withdrawal process as partial withdrawals. Validators are entered into the exit queue when they declare their interest to exit or when they are slashed. The primary purpose of the exit queue is to maintain the security of the network, not to accommodate ETH transaction speeds. If too many validators exit too quickly, the network would become unstable and vulnerable to attack.\n\nIn the best-case scenario, it takes a minimum of 5 epochs (32 minutes) to clear the exit queue. The queue length is based on the number of validators exiting and the churn limit, which is the maximum number of validators that can exit per epoch (every 6.4 minutes).\n\nChurn Limit = max(4, [active_validators/65536])\n\nA minimum number of 4 validators can exit per epoch and the church limit increases by 1 for every 65,536 new validators in the network once there are 327,680 active validators. At the current validator count, the churn limit is 8 and a maximum of 1800 validators can exit per day.\n\nWithdrawal delay and automatic withdrawal queue\n\nAfter going through the exit queue, validators are put through a minimum validator withdrawability delay of 256 epochs (27.3 hours) before they are eligible for withdrawals under the same automated withdrawal process that partial withdrawals undergo. The 27.3 hours delay is put in place to give the network time to detect harmful activity, preventing bad actors from negatively impacting the network and exiting without penalties.\n\nKey Shanghai upgrade metrics to monitor\n\nThere\u2019s a ton of potential data points to look at and each of them provide an additional layer of insight but in this article we\u2019ll focus on the 4 main ones to monitor.\n\nETH deposits vs withdrawals\n\nNansen's data highlights changes to the liquid supply of ETH. Deposits are ETH sent to the beacon deposit contract, withdrawals are principal ETH deposited, and accrued rewards sent to wallets. The chart above is a good way to gauge the flow of ETH between a locked & unlocked state. Use the cumulative sum (purple line) to estimate changes to liquid supply of ETH and not solely the size of deposit/withdrawal bars. Decrease in the cumulative sum = increase in liquid supply.\n\nCommon mistake: Assuming withdrawals = selling.\n\nPartial withdrawals happen automatically and will occur regardless of a validator\u2019s desire to remain active or exit. Full withdrawals are the more important factor to look at as these are full exits and have to be manually triggered by the validator or an implication of getting slashed.\n\nThe exit queue and who\u2019s withdrawing ETH\n\nMonitoring these two data points allows you to get a holistic sense of unlocks in the coming days.\n\nThe exit queue\n\nThe number of validators waiting for full withdrawals on Nansen include validators currently in the exit queue and validators that have gone through the queue but have not had their withdrawals processed yet.\n\nWho\u2019s withdrawing\n\nAs Nansen has labeled millions of wallet addresses, we are able to monitor who\u2019s in the withdrawal queues and who has withdrawn. This allows us to get an idea of the potential motivation behind the withdrawals.\n\nCurrently, most of the ETH waiting for withdrawals and being withdrawn belong to centralized exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, Kraken and Huobi and not large whales exiting the network. A large bulk of this is due to regulatory crackdown and pressures faced and not voluntary withdrawals. It\u2019s likely that we see users of those exchanges restake their ETH using other platforms such as Lido or Rocket Pool.\n\nPotential long term implications of the Shanghai upgrade?\n\nThis segment contains the opinions of the author and not meant to be taken as fact or investment advice of any kind.\n\nIn the short run, there is likely to be a level of volatility around withdrawal amounts. Partial withdrawals have two years of accrued rewards to be withdrawn, and events such as Kraken being forced to wind down their staking practice in the US, along with general reshuffling and reallocation of staked ETH among staking platforms, will cause initial spikes in withdrawals.\n\nHowever, in the long run, it is likely that withdrawals will settle along a baseline number of partial and full withdrawals happening each day, with spikes in the event of any unforeseen circumstances. On top of that, there are other potential implications that arise from the Shanghai upgrade.\n\nIncrease in the amount of ETH staked\n\nIt would not be surprising to see the percentage of ETH's total supply being staked increase over time.\n\nSource: Stakingrewards.com\n\nCompared to other major layer-1 blockchains, Ethereum has one of the lowest staking ratios. The lack of a withdrawal function has been one of the reasons for the low staking ratio, despite the prominence of liquid staking protocols. Although liquid staking protocols allowed users to swap their liquid staking tokens (LSTs) for ETH on DEXes, LSTs often traded at a discount due to the lack of withdrawals. As we approached the expected upgrade date, we saw a rapid increase in the amount of ETH staked, suggesting that the lack of withdrawals indeed reduced the attractiveness of staking.\n\nHowever, ETH\u2019s staking ratios may not reach the levels of the other chains. This is due to the large NFT ecosystem, for which ETH is a currency of exchange, and the large and ever-growing DeFi ecosystem which presents alternative yield farming opportunities. The varied use cases and the presence of alternative opportunities to utilize ETH set it apart from other major L1 tokens. There is a case where liquid staking protocols and the liquidity they offer allow the vast majority of ETH to be staked without holders incurring much opportunity cost. In that scenario, we could very well see the vast majority of ETH\u2019s total supply being staked, with liquid staking protocols being the main driver of that.\n\nIncrease in rate of innovation and competition amongst staking services\n\nThe increase in the portability of staked ETH means that staking services are in constant competition amongst themselves to offer the best possible service to the end user. Users will easily be able to vote with their ETH by switching their staked allocation as better solutions arise. Illiquid staking services will likely see the biggest increase in competition as this is the first time that users are able to withdraw their ETH. Liquid staking protocols are not spared from this change either. Now that LST de-pegs are almost non-existent, there\u2019s little to no switching cost. Liquid staking protocols will have to continue to improve and embody the ethos of Ethereum holders for their market share to grow.\n\nIncrease in utilization of liquid staking tokens in DeFi\n\nAs highlighted in a previous article on liquid staking tokens, the vast majority of LSTs are not currently being utilized in DeFi protocols. While LSTs served their purpose of creating a pseudo-withdrawal mechanism for ETH stakers, their utility has not been maximized due to low utilization in DeFi. This lack of utilization is potentially due to frequent de-pegs between the LST and ETH, which makes liquidation a real concern during volatile times. As LSTs continue to grow and take center stage in the Ethereum ecosystem, we can expect to see more DeFi protocols integrating LSTs into their platforms, thereby increasing opportunities for LST holders to utilize their tokens.\n\nWrapping up\n\nIn conclusion, the Shapella upgrade, which includes both the Shanghai and Capella upgrades, was a much-needed update to Ethereum. The Shanghai upgrade has provided validators with the ability to withdraw their staked ETH, enabling them to re-stake their rewards, compound their yield, reallocate their staking positions, and reduce liquidity risks.\n\nThe ability to withdraw staked ETH has significant positive implications for Ethereum's DeFi ecosystem and will usher in a new era for staked ETH. We anticipate increased staking participation among ETH holders and greater innovation in staking solutions. By monitoring key data points, we will gain a deeper understanding of the upgrade's impact and the future of ETH staking over time."

        "content": "The price of Ethereum (ETH) has been a hot topic in the crypto community as of late, to the point where numerous experts were consulted and requested to share their views.\n\nIn particular, finance platform Finder has asked 32 fintech and crypto experts to give their end-of-year price predictions for Ethereum, and the results reveal positive expectations for the asset.\n\nAccording to the results shared with Finbold, the experts suggest that Ethereum is set to rise as the year progresses, although it will not come close to its all-time high ($4,891). The coin reached this height on November 16, 2021, just before the crypto winter started pushing crypto prices down.\n\nPolled finance professionals believe that ETH could reach its peak in 2023 at around $2,758. However, after that the price is expected to start dropping again in the second half of 2023, sinking to $2,342 by the end of the year.\n\nEthereum price prediction. Source: Finder.com\n\nNotably, some of the surveyed experts included Paul Levy, a senior lecturer from the University of Brighton; Dimitrios Salampasis, the director of FinTech Capability at the Swinburne University of Technology, as well as Aaron Rafferty, the co-founder and CEO of StandardDAO.\n\nThe panelists\u2019 predictions were made into a chart that can be viewed here.\n\nPost-Shapella worries\n\nMoreover, commenting on their prediction, a number of panelists also expressed concerns regarding post-Shapella Ethereum.\n\nData shows that around 21% of them believe that ETH is facing a risk of centralization, while nearly one-third of panelists (29%) think that the upgrade will eventually cause a massive sell-off. Meanwhile, half of the panelists believe that the update will result in greater scrutiny by the regulators.\n\nPost-Shapella Ethereum poll. Source: Finder.com\n\nAt the time of writing, April 27th, the price of ETH sits at $1,874.89 after declining by 4.64% in the last 7 days.\n\nEthereum price chart; Last 7 days. Source: Finbold.com\n\nAI provides its own prediction of the Ethereum price\n\nWith AI being another hot topic in fintech lately, some experts leverage this technology to predict Ethereum\u2019s future price. AI has been used for automated trading for some time now, as it can quickly identify chart patterns and trends.\n\nIn this line, Finbold used projections made by CoinPriceForecast which revealed that Ethereum will potentially manage to climb above the $2k mark by mid-2023 and surge to $2,146 by the end of the year.\n\nIt is worth noting that the AI prediction is less optimistic than the one provided by the polled experts, which projects the ETH price to be higher than that by year-end, even after it drops from the expected $2,758.\n\nHowever, if AI is correct, ETH would still see a 31% price surge by the end of the year compared to its price today.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--CoinDesk Indices, the leading provider of digital asset indices by AUM since 2014, in partnership with CoinFund, a leading Web3 and crypto-focused investment firm and registered investment adviser, today announced CESR, the composite ether staking rate.\n\nCESR is a global floating rate benchmark derived from the daily transaction fees and staking rewards emitted from the Ethereum Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchain. As a global and unbiased benchmark, CESR can serve as a fundamental building block of the Web3 economy by enabling the proliferation of loans, bonds, futures, swaps, other derivative products and financial instruments that reference the index.\n\n\u201cWe are excited to launch what we see as a defining institutional reference rate for the crypto asset class,\u201d said Chris Perkins, President of CoinFund. \u201cThis benchmark is poised to precipitate the expansion of investment products across global finance to ultimately enhance stability and risk management capabilities for investors.\u201d\n\nThis benchmark serves as an important first step in the creation of a forward rate curve, serves as a new discount rate, and allows assets across the digital domain to be priced as a relative investment to CESR, as retail and institutional market participants are granted new opportunities to gain exposure and hedge risk. This development follows Ethereum\u2019s transition from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake (\u2018The Merge\u2019).\n\nCESR captures all relevant block rewards paid to network validators, comprising new emissions issued by the Ethereum PoS blockchain and transaction fees awarded from existing circulation, including maximal extractable value (MEV). The methodology accounts for protocol \u201cslashing\u201d and protocol withdrawals. CESR will be calculated and published by CoinDesk Indices daily, seven days per week.\n\n\u201cOur partnership with CoinFund creates such a foundational piece of infrastructure to crypto asset markets,\u201d said Alan Campbell, President of CoinDesk Indices. \u201cDrawing on our experience managing the longest-running and largest benchmarked crypto indices globally, we\u2019re excited to launch CESR, a building block for crypto-based finance.\u201d\n\nRoger Bayston, EVP and Head of Digital Assets at Franklin Templeton, expressed support for CESR \u201cAs a firm committed to innovation across digital assets and the Web3 ecosystem, Franklin Templeton is very excited about the launch of CESR, backed by CoinFund and CoinDesk Indices, and the pathways it may open for the industry to use this innovative new index.\u201d\n\nCESR will be released to the public in the coming weeks.

It is a blockchain where planning and decision-making regarding the cryptocurrency are distributed away from the central unit to the smaller factions (decentralized).\n\nThe native token of the platform is the ETHER coin. The coin gained its all-time highest value of about $4,800 in 2021, \u201cthe year of cryptocurrency,\u201d where most cryptocurrencies gained their maximum value. Although the coin got a massive drop in value the following year due to the poor performance of cryptocurrencies all-around to a value of about $1,300, experts still believe the coin can gain its highest value ever since its creation before the year 2023 concludes, to be valued at $5,000 or even more after it managed to rise to above $2,000 in just the first quarter of the year.\n\n>>>Buy LHINU Now<<<\n\n5 Major Reasons ETH Price Can Reach $5,000\n\nPotential to grow high : It is no news that Ethereum is the second most popular cryptocurrency after Bitcoin.

These investors are known as big investors, who tend to invest significantly in the market. Future potentials: Cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum have been speculated to be the next form of currency to be accepted worldwide. Unlike fiat currencies, this cryptocurrency would not be controlled by a government, leading to massive adoption.\n\nAlthough Ethereum seems to be heading for the $5,000 threshold soon, significant price drops in recent years can be unsettling for investors. During times of market volatility, some investors may look for a \u201csafe haven\u201d investment that can provide more stability and protection against market fluctuations. One such opportunity is Love Hate Inu, a relatively new cryptocurrency that has gained popularity.\n\n>>>Buy LHINU Now<<<\n\nLove Hate Inu ($LHINU) \u2013 Revolutionary V2E Project\n\nLove Hate Inu is a vote-2-earn meme coin that has gained popularity amongst investors since its creation in the crypto world. It is a meme coin based on people who want to give opinions on social platforms. It encourages and rewards people who share their opinions on different topics, either political, social, or entertainment based, provided by the platform. It is also a safe platform that protects its users and their opinions against criticism.\n\nSince the cryptocurrency is socially based, it attracts the interest of many people who are also likely to promote it on other social platforms, making it a more fun platform and an ideal project to invest in. Although the cryptocurrency is still in its presale stage, the project raised more than $4.5 million just a few days after its launch.\n\n>>>Buy LHINU Now<<<\n\nThis is an impressive feat for a relatively new token, which shows how the market has reacted positively towards the project. Market analysts have predicted that the token will raise $10 million in the coming weeks, so now is the best time for investors to load their bags with $LHINU tokens.\n\n>>>Buy LHINU Now<<<\n\nHow you can purchase the $LHINU token\n\nTo purchase $LHINU tokens, you can follow a simple process. First, visit the Love Hate Inu website and click the \u201cBUY NOW\u201d button. This will open a popup window prompting you to connect your Metamask or any other compatible cryptocurrency wallet to the website. To buy $LHINU tokens, ensure that your wallet is funded with USDT, which you will use to purchase the tokens, and Ethereum to pay for gas fees.\n\nAfter completing the purchase, you will need to wait until the presale period ends. At this point, you will receive your tokens automatically, or you may need to return to the website to claim them.\n\n>>>Buy LHINU Now<<<\n\nConclusion\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Love Hate Inu ($LHINU) can be profitable for investors. Ethereum, the second most popular cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, has shown high growth potential over the years and is expected to reach the $5,000 mark in 2023 due to limited supply, social awareness, interest from institutional investors, and future potential.\n\nOn the other hand, Love Hate Inu, a relatively new token, has gained popularity in the market due to its social-based approach, and the project has raised more than $3.5 million during its presale stage. Market analysts predict that the token will raise $10 million in the coming weeks, making it an attractive investment option for those who want to maximize their profits.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "While all eyes are on Bitcoin\u2019s creep toward $30,000 and Ether\u2019s double-digit year-to-date jump, another cryptocurrency has quietly surpassed the gains of both since the start of the year.\n\nSolana, or SOL, the native token of the Solana blockchain, has shot up 133% since trading at just $10 on Jan. 1, continuing to shrug off any reputational hit from being associated with Sam Bankman-Fried. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is up 78% and Ether is up just over 50% over the same period.\n\nWhile Solana\u2019s market capitalization sank to $5.3 billion the day after FTX declared bankruptcy, it has since recovered 72% to $9.1 billion. It was up 3% over 24 hours on Friday afternoon, trading at $22.86. Bitcoin and Ether were both down about 1%, at $29,300 and $1,800, respectively, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nThe number of successful transactions on the Solana blockchain rose to 713 million in March\u2014the most since October\u2014according to data tracker FlipSide. The total number of transactions is still down year over year largely due to a lagging bear market.\n\nThe Solana blockchain, which backs the Solana cryptocurrency, pitches itself as a faster and cheaper alternative to the Ethereum blockchain, still the most popular for decentralized apps such as NFT marketplaces and financial applications.\n\nBut Solana\u2019s pitch as an \u201cEthereum killer\u201d has hit some snags, including a number of recent outages and slowdowns. In February, a performance disruption resulted in issues with transactions and caused validators, who verify transactions on the blockchain, to restart the network to resolve the problem. Solana also faced a setback in the NFT space earlier this year when two of its most popular collections, y00ts and DeGods, left the blockchain.\n\nAustin Federa, head of strategy for the Solana Foundation, previously told Fortune he wasn\u2019t concerned about the projects leaving.\n\nJust a month after losing those collections, a new project, Mad Lads, is bringing some excitement back to Solana NFTs. The collection, created by the Web3 company Coral\u2014cofounded by Solana developer Armani Ferrante\u2014launched this week and has already become the most traded NFT with the highest sales volume over the past seven days, according to Crypto Slam.\n\nCompared with $11.4 million for Yuga Labs\u2019 Bored Ape Yacht Club collection, Mad Lads generated $17 million in sales over the last seven days, according to Crypto Slam. The Mad Lads trading frenzy also helped the Solana blockchain stay just above Polygon in number of transactions over the past week, according to Crypto Slam, even as Starbucks and other big companies flocked to the latter blockchain.\n\nMad Lads is one of the first of a new type of non-fungible token called executable NFTs, or xNFTs. While most NFTs are tied to centralized websites to provide the experiences they promise, xNFTs allow for built-in functionality. It could allow a game developer, for example, to mint an entire game as limited-edition xNFTs. For Mad Lads, the pictures act as a chat room for users that\u2019s rendered entirely within the NFT, thanks to Coral\u2019s new crypto wallet, Backpack, Federa wrote in a blog post.\n\nFedera said Mad Lads\u2019 launch is proof that Solana\u2019s more flexible NFT technology is a boon for entrepreneurs and creators.\n\n\u201cNFTs on Solana has always been a little bit different than other chains,\u201d Federa told Fortune. \u201cThere\u2019s this sort of relentless innovation and a drive to experiment.\u201d"

        "content": "On Wednesday, April 26, Polygon announced that the Polygon PoS Bridge is now available for Polygon zkEVM, whose beta version launched last month. The Polygon zkEVM network offers scalability solutions to decentralized applications (dApps) running on the Ethereum blockchain network.\n\nThe Polygon Bridge for Polygon zkEVM will have the same user experience as available in the Polygon PoS mainnet. However, it comes with a number of UX improvements that incorporate the feedback received from the community.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThese UX improvements include transaction history, a visible progress bar, and a recent transaction panel with completion status.\n\nThe concept of \u2018Bridges\u2019 in the crypto space is quite popular as they facilitate the transfer of assets across different blockchain platforms. However, bridges transferred using zk-technology are much better than the regular ones as they are entirely governed by smart contracts, one on the Polygon zkEVM and the other on Ethereum.\n\nPolygon Bridge \u2013 Withdrawing Funds from Ethereum\n\nThe launch of this Polygon Bridge for Polygon zkEVM will allow users to withdraw funds from the Ethereum mainnet within just 30-60 minutes of initiating the withdrawal. The Polygon Bridge shall be supporting some of the users\u2019 favorite assets such as ERC-20 tokens and the extended features of ERC-777 tokens.\n\nAlso, users of the Polygon Bridge won\u2019t have to undergo the bridging process. Soon as the user triggers a bridging transaction, the bridged token will be automatically mapped. Most of the other platform require users to map their tokens before bridging. This could also take hours or even days. Thus, the Polygon Bridge cuts through these hurdles offering users a seamless experience.\n\nThe Polygon zkEVM launched last month as mainnet beta is open source, permissionless, and public. Thus, any can build atop it and transact their assets. Some teams have already started building atop the Polygon zkEVM. This includes premier dApps such as Balancer and Lens, and other gaming projects."

This has caused a buying spree on Coinbase, as the crypto scales suggest that 98% of retail investors on the popular American platform are buying Shiba Inu.\n\nMoreover, the largest whales quickly reacted to the sudden price drop. According to blockchain data, one Ethereum whale on KuCoin took the opportunity to stock up on SHIB holdings. In four transactions from KuCoin, the aforementioned whale bought 4,000,000,000 $SHIB tokens, topping up the crypto wallet to 16 billion SHIB.\n\nAt press time, SHIB is changing hands at $0.00001025, according to CoinGecko.

With this in mind, developers put forth a proposal to the Render community that would see the project transition towards building its network with Rust atop the Solana network instead.\n\nWhen it put forth this proposal, stated to have been generated after an \u2018exhaustive review' of options, the developers explained that,\n\n\u201cThe Render Network has been built with a goal towards providing real-time, rendered, interactive holographic streams. This will require states to be updated dynamically, in real-time and on-chain. To do so, the network needs to be able to write high-performance code both on-chain and on GPUs. Rust can provide the Render Network greater speed and flexibility than Solidity, ultimately permitting the use of the same code for GPU render work and smart contracts. Further, the Solana virtual machine can process both C++ or Rust code and turn that into a smart contract.\u201d\n\nIt was recently announced that the voting period for this proposal, known as \u2018RNP-002', had come to an end. The result? An overwhelming ~4,800,000 voting yay, with a mere ~36,000 voting nay.\n\nIt should be noted that while nearly 5,000,000 eligible voters took part in the process, a whopping 167,000,000 did not.\n\nMarket Response\n\nBeing burdened by growth is a good problem to have. It shows both interest and demand for what Render has to offer, and with the passing of recent proposals (ie. RNP-002), it appears as though those responsible for the project are up to the task of scaling its services. The Render community appears to have recognized this, with RNDR trading accordingly.\n\nNot only is RNDR up 6% on the day, at time of writing, it is boasting gains north of 40% on the week. As it stands, the majority of trading volume for RNDR takes place on two exchanges \u2013 Binance, and Hotcoin Global.\n\nThe Front Runner\n\nWhile Render has been around for years now, having launched in 2017, it was not actually the first project to hit the market offering access to distributed computation. Another, which seasoned market participants may recognize, goes by the name of Golem.\n\nHowever, in the years since, a clear front runner between the two has emerged \u2013 Render. While Golem had its time in the spotlight years ago, it has slowly faded from prominence, retreating to the 141st largest project by marketcap, while Render has continue to rise to 59th at time of writing.\n\nTo learn more about this project, make sure to visit our Investing in Render guide."

        "content": "Investors are growing anxious in a brutal year for some of their favourite Crypto coins, with current shake-ups like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) dipping on the Crypto chart. High inflation backed by the FTX meltdown has made the market uncertain leading to further crippling. Investors are worried and wonder if they\u2019re ever going to recover.\n\nLarge unstaking is definitely going to happen as investors try to look for other coins\u2014with the potential for growth to diversify their portfolios. An innovative alternative investment, Sparklo has been making headlines for the right reasons, even at its presale level.\n\nThe platform allows investors to trade and invest in Silver, Gold and Platinum bars. Analysts suggest that its prices will have a 40x increase after its launch, so buying earlier is highly recommended.\n\n\u201cEthereum Killer\u201d Solana (SOL) Trading Below Long-Term $27 Resistance Area\n\nOftenly championed as the \u201cEthereum killer\u201d, Solana (SOL) has been crashing on the market and is currently trading below its descending resistance line. Solana downward spiral made its prices go down to $8 in December 2022. Even after Solana\u2019s $230% increase in January 2023, it has failed to recover and break out above the $27 resistance line.\n\nAnalysts suggest that this bullish trend will still provide resistance since Solana (SOL) hasn\u2019t broken out of the long-term $27 resistance area and the red zone. It\u2019s even estimated that this fall will continue to single digits.\n\nThis circumstance has made Solana (SOL) lose its appeal to investors now looking for other presale gems like Sparklo.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Plummers the Crypto Charts By 6%\n\nDue to the selling pressures of Bitcoin (BTC), the second largest Crypto by market capitalization, Ethereum (ETH) is crashing the market. Ethereum (ETH) was steadily approaching $1900, with a previous record increase which was due to Shanghai\u2019s Blockchain upgrade.\n\nMany Crypto Analysts thought that Shanghai\u2019s Blockchain upgrade would cause a price fall, but this was not the case. It turns out the upgrade caused Ethereum (ETH) to have steady increases. The upgrade allowed Ethereum (ETH) to shift from a proof of stake protocol to a proof of work protocol.\n\nThe shift allowed staked Ethereum (ETH) to be withdrawn from the blockchain. Will ETH continue falling?\n\nNo one knows, but it\u2019s imminent for investors to look for other presale gems like Sparklo that have the growth potential to diversify their portfolio.\n\nPresale Gem, Sparklo (SPRK), Predicted to have Bullish Runs\n\nBeing a cryptocurrency protocol, Sparklo will become the first platform to allow traders to invest in precious metals fractionally. Investors will be able to trade and invest in fractionalized NFTs backed by Silver, Gold and Platinum.\n\nThe revolution project is making headlines and attracting investors who wish to invest in less risky assets during inflation and market uncertainty. Here are a few reasons why you should consider buying Sparklo as early as now:\n\nIt offers users an opportunity to invest in NFTs representing real luxury assets\n\nPartnered with jewellery stores that help bring products to the market\n\nWith the potential to grow, it can become a future crypto blue chip\n\nUsers have a chance to buy this future crypto blue chip at extremely affordable prices\n\nSparklo has set up measures that ensure the platform is ready for trade. For starters, it has passed through the Audit InterFi Network and will lock in liquidity for 100 years. Moreover, the Know Your Customer audit is in the works and will be received soon enough.\n\nWith a price of $0.015 that\u2019s on a steady rise to $0.017 by the end of this week, it\u2019s time to invest in it.\n\nWebsite: https://sparklo.finance\n\nBuy Presale: https://invest.sparklo.finance\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sparklo_finance\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/sparklofinance\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Meta: Deciding on Ethereum Classic, Near Protocol and Uwerx? Read on to know crypto analysts predictions for the two. Learn why Uwerx presale is the perfect opportunity to invest for potential profits and how you can invest in it too.\n\n2023 is turning out to be productive for Ethereum Classic (ETC) and NEAR Protocol (NEAR). But with many investors looking for better opportunities, they are increasingly searching for future jackpots.\n\nAs such, Uwerx has captured the attention of crypto investors due to its price predictions. Its presale is already in progress and gaining traction.\n\nUwerx (WERX) Powering Presale\n\nOpen to all, the WERX is a hot token in the trading and freelancing community. Analysts expect it to grab a fair share of the gig economy. Many are confident that WERX will break the $1 barrier in Q3 this year.\n\nConsidering the ongoing presale of WERX is for just $0.0075,, traders are expecting a 9,900% profit, which is probably going to be the best-performing asset this year.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) in the $30s Range\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) has risen quickly this year from $19.47 to $22.43. The performance for Ethereum Classic (ETC) is expected to rise more, but swing in the $30s range. Ethereum Classic (ETC) price prediction says it will fluctuate between $33.24 and $37.27.\n\nNot much gain for Ethereum Classic (ETC) but still, a price prediction that gives a 48% to 66% rise is not bad.\n\nNEAR Protocol (NEAR)\u2019s Better Performance\n\nNEAR Protocol (NEAR) is an in-demand crypto, thanks to its faster transactions and higher throughput. Not as big as Ethereum Classic (ETC), but NEAR Protocol (NEAR) price predictions say it will be a better token. Already the NEAR Protocol (NEAR) has gone up 25% in one month.\n\nTraders are expecting it to reach around $4.39 in 2023, but NEAR Protocol (NEAR) can fall short and not surpass $3.79. Even then, the minimum price prediction is 44% growth, with the optimistic forecast shelling 67% profits for NEAR Protocol (NEAR) holders.\n\nUwerx (WERX) Liberating Freelancers\n\nThe gig economy seems unstoppable. Nearly half of all new freelancers say they view this move as a long-term career choice (As per Velocity Global report).\n\nWith the growth that defies the current global economic slowdown, freelancing is showing a constant increase in size. This is despite issues that freelancers are forced to endure.\n\nPlatforms like Upwork and Fiverr are known for their high commissions (up to 20%), slow payment release, and no concern for freelancer copyrights protection. Uwerx on the other hand liberates freelancers from these and other issues.\n\nThanks to its blockchain basis, it extends the same benefits of the technology to freelancers. Significantly efficient and no intermediaries help Uwerx reduce fees down to 5%. Decentralized, Uwerx doesn\u2019t hold payments and these are instantly transferred to user wallets. This also includes eventual plan to remove transaction taxes.\n\nUwerx also has ensured the security of the platform, with dual but independent audits by InterFi Network and SolidProof. An important step has also been decided, where the taxes on transactions will be removed permanently.\n\nThough payments are in its WERX token, the highly anticipated value increase in conjunction with a token lock for 25 years by the development team (immediately after presale), gives strong fundamentals for it to stand amongst the largest cryptos.\n\nUwerx (WERX) Presale is Ongoing!\n\nWith the presale offering the lowest price for WERX, this is the best time to diversify and grab a future mainstream crypto token. The expected massive gains offer an opportunity that is hard to ignore, easily beating Ethereum Classic (ETC) and NEAR Protocol (NEAR).\n\nIf you are looking to benefit from WERX\u2019s predicted rise from $0.0075, check out the links below to find out how you can benefit from a 25% purchase bonus :\n\nPresale: invest.uwerx.network\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/uwerx_network\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/uwerx_network\n\nWebsite: https://www.uwerx.network/"

        "title": "Why the Bitcoin Halving is Bullish for Every Single Cryptocurrency - CCN.com",
        "content": "By CCN.com: The old adage \u201ca rising tide lifts all boats\u201d appears to be more applicable to the crypto market than perhaps any other asset class. Need proof? Just look at the resounding impact the looming bitcoin halving is having on virtually every major cryptocurrency.\n\nThe Halving is Bullish for the Bitcoin Price\n\nFor those who are not familiar, the bitcoin halving is a much-anticipated event in which BTC block rewards are reduced by 50 percent. One halving happens every four years.\n\nFrom an economic standpoint, the bitcoin halving is a bullish event because it significantly reduces the inflation rate of the asset that has a fixed supply of 21 million. The third halving will drop BTC\u2019s annual issuance rate from 3.70 percent down to 1.79 percent, which is lower than the inflation rate of some wealthy nations. For instance, the inflation rate in the US is 1.90 percent.\n\nMarket participants have responded by frantically buying the asset after every halving event, as inflation rate decreases intensify demand pressure.\n\nIn the first halving, bitcoin\u2019s price rose from $12.31 at the time of the halving to $994.21 a year later for a 7,976 percent rise. In the second halving, the price soared from $650 to $19,535 over a year later for a 2,902 percent surge.\n\nAlmost Every Cryptocurrency Benefits From Bitcoin Halvings\n\nWe looked at the altcoin market cap to see if other crypto tokens also benefited from the bitcoin halving. Unsurprisingly, other cryptocurrencies enjoyed significantly higher gains than BTC.\n\nDuring the first bitcoin halving, the altcoin market cap rose from $45.89 million in June 2013 to $2.02 billion by December 2013 for an increase of 4,302 percent. In the second halving, the altcoin market cap appreciated from $1.74 billion in December 2016 to an all-time high of $555.91 billion in January 2018 for a meteoric rise of over 31,849 percent.\n\nThere were other reasons for the market cap increases, and correlation does not mean causation. However, there is strong evidence to suggest that BTC halvings catalyze massive price increases across the overall crypto market.\n\nThe link between the bitcoin halving and the overall cryptocurrency market is strong. In fact, a 2019 analysis revealed that the prices and volume of cryptocurrencies are highly correlated. In other words, if bitcoin skyrockets, other cryptocurrencies are likely to follow suit. This led to the conclusion that \u201cif you own one cryptocurrency, you own them all.\u201d\n\nOther Factors That Drive Crypto Growth\n\nFurther research shows that cryptocurrency growth is also driven by two factors: media coverage and investor attention. One study on bitcoin and media hype concluded that returns are likely to be elevated when media outlets mention the cryptocurrency more frequently and when Google searches increase.\n\nThis phenomenon happened in 2017. Media coverage soared as bitcoin surged. As more articles chronicled bitcoin, more people searched for it on Google. The chart below shows how the weekly number BTC-related articles spiked while the cryptocurrency\u2019s price climbed.\n\nIn addition, the number of searches for the term \u201cbitcoin\u201d on Google also spiked during the 2017 bull run, coinciding with the rising weekly number of articles.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nHistorically, bitcoin halvings ignite a strong upward cycle that lifts the overall cryptocurrency market. With the price of bitcoin climbing, media hype and investor attention balloon. The surge in investor attention likely leads to more people buying BTC and other cryptocurrencies. As prices increase, more articles are written, and the cycle continues.\n\nIn short, the bitcoin halving is a massive tide that lifts all boats.\n\nAnd the clock is ticking ."

        "content": "What do you get when you combine one of the fastest-growing industries with the power of financial freedom? This is exactly what Uwerx is planning with its upcoming launch. The decentralized freelancing platform combines blockchain with an ethical gig workers\u2019 platform, offering speed, transparency, and monetary security.\n\nThe result is a token (WERX) that can explode in value \u2013 much more than Ethereum (ETH) might.\n\nBut Aren\u2019t Ethereum (ETH) Signals Strong?\n\nEthereum (ETH) acts as a global computer and allows anyone to run decentralized apps (dApps) on it. This has led to thousands of protocols, applications, and tokens that today utilize Ethereum (ETH) as the backbone.\n\nAs such Ethereum (ETH) has a strong value in the market. Even after dropping 66% since its ATH, a single Ethereum (ETH) is worth $1,680.\n\nAccording to many crypto traders, Ethereum (ETH) still has rocky days ahead as the market adjusts to the post Terra and FTX world. There are wild swings expected in its price, with many saying it will peak at around $2474. A 47% jump, but the same experts are also pointing out that in case of a crypto market downturn, Ethereum (ETH) can dive to as low as $984.\n\nWhy is Uwerx (WERX) More Likely to Explode?\n\nOne major advantage that Uwerx will have over Ethereum (ETH) is how it is going to be structured. The platform offers some major benefits in the freelancing market \u2013 a global industry that is expanding 3 times more than the whole US workforce.\n\nAccording to Teamstage.io, freelancing is extremely strong in both developed and developing nations, with the US, UK, Brazil, and Pakistan at the top.\n\nThis places Uwerx in the perfect position to offer a marketplace that offers more than just a crypto token to invest in for potential profits. Over time, freelancers will experience the different advantages of using Uwerx over traditional platforms like Upwork and Fiverr. Things like the team\u2019s announcement to give control to token holders and removing taxes will bring in a rise in demand for its WERX token \u2013 and therefore, an increase in its token value. Traders are excited and expect the WERX to range between $1 to $1.5 by September 2023.\n\nAs Uwerx gears up to kick off its WERX presale, targeted at $0.0075, this means it can explode in value in just a few months, offering anywhere from a potential 10,000% to 15,000% ROI.\n\nThank You, Decentralized Freelancing\n\nTraders and experts have high hopes for Uwerx for several reasons. Blockchain grings in a level of trust and transparency the industry desperately needs. A decentralized platform means that freelancers are not at the mercy of corporate greed is going to be a major pull factor.\n\nMixing in the low fees that cryptocurrencies are famous for, Uwerx offers significant savings as it will charge only 5% per job, rather than 20% compared to other platforms. Other advantages include:\n\nIP protection.\n\nRewards and incentives for new and active freelancers.\n\nFaster payment withdrawals.\n\nIntegration with Trello, Asana and Slack\n\nUwerx is committed to providing a sustainable freelancing platform and protecting WERX token holders. It has already completed a third-party technical audit, thanks to InterFi Network as well as SolidProof, and will also be locking in liquidity for a massive 25 years after its presale.\n\nThese reasons have traders and the freelancing world excited about WERX, making it highly likely it will not only rise in value but stand among the top crypto assets.

        "content": "Phantom, a Solana-based crypto wallet, is set to expand its support to include Ethereum and Polygon blockchains, opening its doors to a broader range of crypto users.\n\nAccording to Phantom, the feature for multichain support will have a public launch on May 1st. The public launch will place on May 1. The Web3 wallet has published an initial guide on how to import and manage multiple wallets natively on its web and mobile apps.\n\nWith the integration, Phantom's multichain wallet will simplify the management of multiple Secret Recovery Phrases and private keys across Solana, Ethereum, and Polygon. Users may then import and use existing multichain addresses from popular wallets like MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, and Rainbow, eliminating the need for multiple wallets. Phantom allows for the creation and management of up to 100 accounts, enabling easy management of all Secret Recovery Phrases and private keys within a single platform.\n\nOriginally scheduled for launched in Q1 2023, the addition of Ethereum and Polygon support enables Phantom's 3 million users to transfer assets across different blockchains and interact with decentralized applications (dApps) such as Uniswap and Aave, as well as NFT marketplaces like Blur and OpenSea. Phantom wallet users can now also import existing assets from MetaMask, Solana, or Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) wallets.\n\nPhantom's multichain support follows a successful funding round in January 2022, during which the wallet company reached a valuation of $1.2 billion. The round included participation from Paradigm, Andreessen Horowitz, Jump Capital, Solana, and other investors. The firm started with a $9 million Series A.\n\nWhile there are other multichain crypto wallets like Pillar in the market, the majority of crypto wallets typically cater to single layer-1 blockchains, with Ethereum-focused wallets being the most prevalent. MetaMask, for instance, supports Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens, but its team has expressed interest in a multichain future.\n\nWeb3 wallets play a crucial role in scaling the crypto ecosystem, as they provide users with a seamless, secure, and accessible interface for managing their digital assets. One of the main factors contributing to the growth of the crypto ecosystem is the rise of decentralized applications (dApps) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which have expanded the use cases for cryptocurrencies beyond just being a store of value or a medium of exchange.\n\nWeb3 wallets are thus critical in the ecosystem in that they enable users to interact with these dApps and NFT marketplaces, thus facilitating their participation in decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, and other sectors that are gaining traction within the crypto space.\n\nPhantom Wallet CEO Brandon Millman has opined along the same trajectory, claiming that the nature of wallets in the crypto space is rapidly changing amid newly-discovered technical difficulties and regulatory concerns. Millman previously helped build Matcha.xyz, an Ethereum-based DEX aggregator, as well as APIs for 0x.\n\nPhantom is also implementing new security features to mitigate phishing risks, including hiding spam sent to crypto wallets. The wallet simulates transactions before approval, allowing users to verify the transaction details and detect potential concerns. To date, Phantom has a user base of over 3 million.\n\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Rajagopal Menon, vice president, WazirX on Bitcoin or Ethereum, which is a better choice of investment - The Financial Express",
        "content": "For cryptocurrency traders perhaps one of the biggest challenges resides in selecting between Bitcoin and Ether. Reports from Investopedia, a financial media platform, include that currently Bitcoin and Ether are among the popular digital currency. As per CoinMarketCap, a crypto price-tracking platform, the current market value of Bitcoin stands at $28,425.16 (April 26, 2023, 08:40 am IST) and Ether stands at $1,868.09(April 26, 2023, 08:40 am IST).\n\nInitially, both cryptocurrencies were made to store and preserve data in a secure manner. With time, people began to realise that more things could be done with the help of this programmable money. Vitalik Butalin, creator of Ethereum, realised that Bitcoin has limitations and so he created his own crypto Ether (ETH). Eventually, Ethereum opened a new way of working with digital currencies by using the working mechanism of Proof-of-Stake (PoS). In a conversation with FE Blockchain\u2019s Poulami Saha, Rajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, talks about currently which crypto is better to invest in. (Edited excerpts)\n\nWhat makes Bitcoin popular among other cryptos?\n\nDigital currency was introduced in the \u201990s. By then people already started experimenting with cryptocurrencies. However, in 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto introduced us to a digital currency that could provide safety and help solve many other problems. Bitcoin is considered as one of the oldest cryptocurrencies. What makes Bitcoin special is that Satoshi Nakamoto created it and left it for growing organically. Apart from that Bitcoin works in a decentralised manner which might not be easy to hack when it comes to safety. Also, its Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism adds to its security. Moreover, we can say that Bitcoin is popular for its authenticity.\n\nCan the working mechanism of Bitcoin affect its popularity, when it comes to the ability to adapt to changes?\n\nAdaptation to changes may need the involvement of many hands, which might affect the security of these networks. However, Bitcoin\u2019s decentralised working mechanism does not allow such involvement. Since its creation, nothing has changed and no one can control it. Probably, this makes it one of the safest networks in the blockchain. Therefore, Bitcoin has been able to provide some sort of assurance to its users which I guess contributes to its popularity.\n\nEthereum is supposed to be more versatile then why it\u2019s still in the second position?\n\nThe working mechanism of Ethereum which is Proof-of-Stake (PoS) makes it very adaptive to new technologies such as smart contracts and decentralised applications (dApps) among others. But Ethereum is also considered just as a security network by many. It is a security network that might fluctuate due to its unknown scalability. However, Bitcoin has become more of a commodity. The users are more comfortable using Bitcoins due to their unchangeable monetary value. It is already known that there are about 21 million Bitcoins and its monetary policy can\u2019t be changed.\n\nWith the adoption of automatic technologies and smart contracts do you think Ethereum will lead the crypto market?\n\nThe future of cryptocurrency is quite unpredictable as crypto is a constantly evolving space and the popularity of these cryptocurrencies depends on the purpose that it is used for. Bitcoin promises strong security and storing values and Ether can be considered as the \u2018Future of the financial system\u2019. Reportedly, the current Shanghai upgradation seems to have contributed to the popularity of Ether. Experts believe that Ethereum with constant upgradation could create an impact in the long run.\n\nFollow us on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn"

        "content": "The crypto market has been in a tailspin over the past few days, with Bitcoin and Ethereum leading the way down. Prices have fallen sharply, with the market meltdown catching many investors by surprise.\n\nWithin just 24 hours, between April 10 and April 11, the price of Bitcoin decreased 15%, dropping below $40,000 for the first time since March 15. Ethereum followed suit, declining 14% and going below $3,000 for the first time since March 23.\n\nThis is all part of a broader trend that saw the crypto market tumble 8.5% over 24 hours, hitting a $1.84 trillion market cap. So, what caused this market nosedive? There are a few theories floating around, but the most likely culprit is a combination of several factors.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin has historically been connected to the price of other cryptocurrencies, but as of recent, it has been correlated with the stock market as well. When these markets take a turn down, so does the price of Bitcoin.\n\nThe stock prices have recently been affected by various factors, including the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, growing inflation concerns, and a fresh round of COVID-19 lockdowns. The S&P 500 closed down 1.7%, while the Nasdaq dropped 2.2% in its value, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended Monday\u2019s session down 1.2%.\n\nWhen the stock market takes a dip, this often pushes investors to sell off their assets, which is likely what happened with Bitcoin and Ethereum as well.\n\nThe crypto market is in a rough state right now, and it\u2019s hard to say where things will go from here. Bitcoin and Ethereum have both been hit hard. However, price volatility is hardly a new phenomenon in the world of cryptocurrencies."

        "title": "How Can Developers Retrieve ETH from Ethereum's Sepolia Testnet? - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "Testnets are valuable tools for Web3 developers to test their projects in a secure environment before launching on a mainnet. The Ethereum community has two central public testnets, including Sepolia, which can save blockchain developers\u2019 time and resources. In this article, we will delve into Sepolia, which is one of Ethereum\u2019s most significant proof-of-stake (PoS) testnets.\n\nThe article will start by explaining the details of Sepolia and the importance of a testnet. It will then give a brief guide on how developers can obtain Sepolia testnet ETH to pay for transactions on the network. The article will also compare Sepolia to other testnets, like Goerli, which is also maintained by the Ethereum community. Finally, the article will discuss Sepolia Etherscan, a blockchain explorer for the Sepolia testnet.\n\nWhat are testnets and why do we need them?\n\nTestnets are experimental versions of blockchain networks that imitate the real networks they are associated with. They work on different ledgers, so any currency used there has no connection to the actual transactions and values on the real network. Such a setup allows developers to test their projects on a proper blockchain environment without facing the risk of costly mistakes on the real network.\n\nDevelopers prioritize security when working on decentralized platforms, and using a testnet allows them to investigate vulnerabilities and learn about the platform. Testnets for pre-network upgrades enable investigation of newly developed changes before merging them with the mainnet.\n\nDifferences between testnet and mainnet\n\nBoth blockchain and crypto are important in their own ways. However, it\u2019s necessary to differentiate between the two based on the following factors.\n\nObjectives\n\nDevelopers building blockchain networks prioritize building testnets. Testnets are primarily used by developers to experiment with their blockchain network, dApp or smart contract before making it live.\n\nOne benefit for developers is being able to test new concepts in an environment similar to the real-world deployment of their solutions. Meanwhile, the mainnet provides important advantages for users who are designing contracts, developing dApps, and making transactions. Because upgrades or modifications could potentially cause changes to user accounts, transactions on the mainnet are inherently secure.\n\n\n\nSecurity\n\nThe discrepancies between testnet and mainnet highlight the importance of security on mainnet, which varies depending on the blockchain network and consensus mechanism design. Furthermore, mainnet provides superior security because the tokens or cryptocurrency have tangible value for storage and transactions. The mainnet uses encryption, undergoes smart contract audits, and follows consensus mechanisms to ensure security. The testnet relies on the security features of the mainnet, and the safety of the system is determined by how the codebase is scripted.\n\nTraits\n\nThe comparison between testnet and mainnet will focus on their differing traits and features, including the interfaces used to access them. Mainnets typically see a higher frequency of transactions than testnets. Comparing the crypto mainnet with the testnet would show if the testnet limits operations to a few nodes. Remember that testnets are still being developed and have less user-friendly interfaces. One advantage of testnets is that the tokens used have no actual value, which helps reduce transaction fees.\n\nMining\n\nThe main difference between mainnet and testnet is that developers can earn real cryptocurrency through mining on the mainnet, while testnets do not provide any economic benefits for mining new crypto tokens.\n\n\n\nNetwork IDs\n\nWhen discussing the differences between mainnet and testnet, one important factor to consider is network IDs. These IDs help developers identify a specific network. For example, Ethereum\u2019s mainnet has a network ID of 1, while testnets like Ropsten and Rinkeby have network IDs of 3 and 4.\n\nCoins\n\nThe digital currency that exists on the blockchain network is known as cryptocurrency and it has actual value. It can be utilized to pay for transactions on the mainnet. On the other hand, the coins that exist on a testnet are not real. So, when it comes to performing transactions, the mainnet requires genuine tokens whereas the testnet doesn\u2019t require any fees.\n\nWhat is the Sepolia Testnet?\n\nSepolia is a PoS testnet for Ethereum that was introduced in October 2021. It is one of two primary testnets that have not been deprecated along with Goerli. Sepolia is currently being maintained by client developers, which makes it a safe and reliable testing environment.\n\nIn 2021, Sepolia used a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism at launch. However, they later merged with the PoS Sepolia Beacon Chain after The Merge. Now, they use a PoS consensus mechanism similar to the Ethereum mainnet. This makes Sepolia a suitable environment for testing smart contracts and dapps, just like the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nWhy is a testnet like Sepolia necessary? Well, when you perform transactions on the blockchain, you need to pay for gas. Developing dapps and other blockchain projects directly on Ethereum\u2019s mainnet can be expensive due to the gas costs. So, testnets like Sepolia are used to create a more cost-effective and smoother development experience for blockchain developers.\n\nDevelopers can use Sepolia as a testing ground for their Web3 projects. Sepolia is very similar to Ethereum, and this allows developers to design, create, test, and monitor their project\u2019s public performance before launching it on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nIn order to perform transactions on the Sepolia testnet, you will need to use Sepolia testnet ETH as gas. To obtain these tokens, you can use a faucet for free. But first, you must add the Sepolia testnet network to your wallet.\n\nIn order to add this network, you must include specific details such as the Sepolia chain ID and network name in your wallet. The Sepolia chain ID (11155111) is crucial because it distinguishes the Sepolia chain from other testnet networks. Although the Sepolia testnet is already included by default in MetaMask, we will provide an example of how to add the network to your wallet using the Sepolia network details.\n\n\n\nFor MetaMask, open your wallet and select the \u201cEthereum Mainnet\u201d button.\n\nimage 629\n\nNow click on the \u201cAdd network\u201d button. This will allow you to manually add any network of your choice.\n\nimage 630\n\nNow choose \u201cAdd a network manually\u201d.\n\nimage 631\n\nEnter the following details to add the Sepiola testnet:\n\n\n\nNetwork Name: Sepolia test network\n\nNew RPC URL: https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/\n\nChain ID: 11155111\n\nCurrency Symbol: SepoliaETH\n\nNext, we will learn how to obtain Sepolia testnet ETH by using a Sepolia faucet after incorporating some details from its network.\n\nDevelopers can obtain Sepolia testnet ETH by using a Sepolia testnet faucet. This will allow them to receive small amounts of Sepolia ETH in their wallets, which they can use to pay for transactions on the Sepolia testnet. These testnet tokens have the same functionality as real ETH on the Ethereum mainnet. The best part is that anyone can use this service.\n\n\n\nJust follow these simple steps:\n\nGo to https://faucet.sepolia.dev Enter the wallet address to receive Sepiola testnet ETH Verify the captcha and click the \u201dRequest funds\u201d button\n\nimage 632\n\nAfter clicking on the \u201cRequest funds\u201d button, a pop-up window will appear with a \u201cTransaction sent\u201d message and the amount of Sepolia testnet ETH sent to your wallet. This means you now have Sepolia ETH and can start using it to run smart contracts on the testnet.\n\nHow Does Sepolia Differ From Other Testnets?\n\nLet\u2019s compare Sepolia testnet to other testnets you may have encountered during your Web3 development journey. After learning more about Sepolia, including how to obtain testnet ETH, we can examine its unique characteristics. So, the question is, \u201cWhat makes Sepolia different from other testnets?\u201d Let\u2019s find out.\n\nPreviously, Ethereum had multiple testnets, like Ropsten, Rinkeby, Kovan, and more. But these testnets, along with others, are now obsolete. When a testnet becomes deprecated, the community no longer provides client updates, which causes the network to fall out of sync with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Consequently, outdated testnets are no longer reliable or secure testing grounds for dapps and other Web3 projects.\n\nSepolia is a testnet that is different from Ropsten, Rinkeby, Kovan, etc. because it is not deprecated and is still maintained by the Ethereum community.\n\nAnother testnet maintained by the Ethereum community is Goerli, which can be used for Web3 development along with Sepolia. In order to compare these two networks, we first need to understand what the Goerli testnet is.\n\nIn 2018, Goerli was introduced as one of Ethereum\u2019s major testnets, alongside Sepolia. It began as a project at ETHBerlin hackathon, but was officially launched at G\u00f6rliCon in Berlin in 2019. The Ethereum community maintains Goerli, just like Sepolia, unlike other important testnets that have been deprecated, as mentioned before.\n\nWhen it was launched, Goerli was the inaugural Ethereum testnet built by the community that utilized proof-of-authority (PoA) and allowed for cross-client functionality. However, similar to Sepolia, Goerli changed its consensus mechanism to PoS when it joined forces with Beacon Chain during The Merge.\n\nOne of the significant strengths of the Goerli testnet is its cross-client functionality. This means that developers can use different programming languages to interact with the network, thanks to the various clients maintained by the Ethereum Foundation, for languages like Java, Rust, Go, C#, and others. Unlike other testnets like Rinkeby and Kovan, which support only one client, the Goerli testnet supports multiple clients.\n\nThe benefits of Sepiola Testnet\n\nWith the evolution of the blockchain ecosystem, developers are constantly in search of new testnets to experiment with and refine their innovations. Let\u2019s look at some of the most prominent benefits of the Sepiola testnet.\n\nScalability and Performance\n\nOne of the major challenges that have long plagued blockchain networks is scalability. The Sepiola Testnet addresses this issue head-on, thanks to its innovative architecture that allows for a high throughput of transactions. This not only leads to a more efficient network but also makes it feasible to run complex applications and smart contracts on the platform.\n\nEnhanced Security Measures\n\nThe Sepiola Testnet boasts advanced cryptographic techniques that protect user privacy and secure sensitive data. This not only instills confidence in developers and users alike but also paves the way for the deployment of privacy-centric applications on the platform.\n\nUser-Friendly Environment\n\nhe Sepiola Testnet offers an environment where developers can safely test their applications and smart contracts before deploying them on the mainnet. This enables developers to identify and address any potential issues or vulnerabilities before their projects go live, ensuring a more secure and reliable end product.\n\nVibrant Community and Ecosystem\n\nAnother key advantage of the Sepiola Testnet is its thriving community, which plays an instrumental role in fostering innovation and collaboration. By actively participating in the community, developers can exchange ideas, seek advice, and share their experiences with like-minded peers.\n\nThe Sepiola ecosystem also includes a growing number of partners, ranging from established blockchain projects to cutting-edge startups. These partnerships not only validate the platform\u2019s potential but also create synergies and opportunities for collaboration, further enhancing the overall value proposition of the Sepiola Testnet.\n\nOngoing Development and Improvement\n\nIt is backed by a dedicated team of developers who are committed to continuously refining and enhancing the platform. This ensures that Sepiola remains at the forefront of the blockchain industry and is well-equipped to adapt to the ever-evolving needs and requirements of developers and users alike.\n\nThe Sepiola team actively encourages feedback from the community, taking user input into account when shaping the platform\u2019s future roadmap. This open and collaborative approach ensures that the Sepiola Testnet remains closely aligned with the needs of its user base, making it a truly user-centric platform.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Ethereum Sepolia Testnet provides developers and users the opportunity to experiment with and refine blockchain projects. As a complete guide to this innovative test network, we\u2019ve explored its numerous benefits, from scalability and performance to a thriving community and ongoing development. With such a promising foundation, the Sepolia Testnet is playing a big role in the blockchain industry."
