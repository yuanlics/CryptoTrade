        "title": "Solana Co-Founder Says Ethereum Could Be Layer-2 for SOL - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nDespite certain limitations and potential risks, the idea of using Ethereum (ETH) as a layer-2 for the Solana (SOL) blockchain is not as farfetched as it may seem, according to Anatoly Yakovenko, the co-founder of Solana Labs.\n\nIn a series of tweets on Sunday, Yakovenko took a closer look at how such an integration could take shape, suggesting that the technical collaboration, is \u201cprobably more likely than you might think at first glance.\u201d\n\nLayer-2 solutions aim to address scalability issues faced by blockchains like Ethereum, which have experienced congestion and high transaction fees during periods of increased activity. Solana, known for its high throughput and low transaction costs, promises a blockchain platform capable of efficiently accommodating various decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPointing out that these scaling solutions \u201care bridge protocols that provide one-way security,\u201d Yakovenko argues that Ethereum being a layer-2 for Solana would mean that holders of SOL assets on the Ethereum blockchain would have \u201cfinality guarantees\u201d of being able to safely exit back to Solana even in cases of transaction double spends or an invalid state transition.\n\nWould it be possible for ethereum to be a @solana L2? Probably more likely than you might think at first glance. L2s are bridge protocols that provide one way security. In this setup, holders of solana assets on ethereum would have finality guarantees that they can exit back\u2026 https://t.co/XE5ETsxGIW \u2014 toly \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@aeyakovenko) July 2, 2023\n\nMaking this setup work would first require submitting all the Ethereum transactions into Solana, according to Yakovenko, as well as submitting a Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) root for the resulting state\u2014something that would serve as evidence that consensus has been reached among Ethereum validators regarding the state of the network.\n\nFinally, to identify and address possible faults within a bridge protocol, a bridge timeout mechanism will be necessary. Some examples of faults, per Yakovenko, include conflicting SPVs for the root, invalid root computation, and censorship.\n\nLimitations and risks of Solana's ETH-based L2\n\nThe Solana Labs co-founder also highlighted the limitations and potential risks associated with this integration, saying that while it would be safe to hold SOL assets on the Ethereum blockchain, it will not be safe \u201cto lend them or maintain positions against them.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne key risk is the possibility of an Ethereum fault or a contentious social consensus fork within the Ethereum network. In such a scenario, the representations of Solana assets held on Ethereum could become separated from the consensus fork, resulting in a situation where these assets become effectively worthless.\n\nIt would be safe to hold solana assets on ethereum, but not safe to lend them or maintain positions against them. This is because once there is an ethereum fault, ethereum state on solana becomes separated from ethereum the social consensus fork. Solana users can get their\u2026 \u2014 toly \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@aeyakovenko) July 2, 2023\n\nLending Solana-based USDC, the dollar-pegged stablecoin from Circle, on Ethereum could lead to a situation where the borrower can withdraw the real USDC on the Solana network, while the lender on Ethereum receives a \"junk token.\"\n\nThis scenario, argues Yakovenko, is similar to the experience of holding USDC on Ethereum's Proof-of-Work (EthPow) chain, where certain tokens may lose value or functionality due to network issues or changes.\n\nAdditionally, the integration of Solana assets on Ethereum may have implications for various DeFi protocols. While central limit order books (CLOBs) would likely remain functional, automated market makers (AMMs), and non-flash loan borrowing and lending protocols could face limitations or challenges, potentially leading to inefficiencies or constraints in liquidity provision and trading.\n\nClobs are ok, AMMs and non flash loan borrow lending protocols are not. \u2014 toly \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@aeyakovenko) July 2, 2023\n\nYakovenko\u2019s proposal came hot on the heels of Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin lamenting about how U.S. regulators are targeting various crypto projects, including Solana, which the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in its recent lawsuit against Binance labeled as unregistered securities.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t deserve it, and if Ethereum ends up \u2018winning\u2019 through all other blockchains getting kicked off exchanges, that\u2019s not an honorable way to win, and in the long term probably isn\u2019t even a victory,\u201d Buterin tweeted last week.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "Liquid staking tokens (LSTs) have begun to pick up momentum this month as the second half of the year edges closer toward a highly anticipated Ethereum upgrade.\n\nDubbed Cancun-Deneb (or \u201cDencun\u201d for short), the upgrade \u2014 expected sometime in the fourth quarter of this year \u2014 will see the introduction of a mechanism known as \u201cblob-carrying transactions.\u201d\n\nLiquid staking providers, especially Lido, have gained significant traction, underlining users\u2019 preference for greater liquidity and flexibility in their staking activities, blockchain analytics firm Glassnode wrote in a research note on Monday.\n\nAs such, protocols and assets linked with staked ETH are delivering outsized gains when compared to other major digital assets in the market on the week.\n\nAs of 5 am ET, the governance token for liquid staking solution Lido DAO (LDO), has jumped about 11% and 24% on 1-week and 2-week timeframes respectively.\n\nFrax Share (FXS) \u2014 the governance token of the Frax ecosystem responsible for frxETH \u2014 and the staking pool known as Rocket Pool (RPL) have also risen by 11% and 2.4% over the past week.\n\nTo date, LST platforms and protocols have so far accrued $20 billion in total value locked, representing some 10.3 million ETH, data from DeFiLlama shows.\n\nLido has garnered a significant portion of the market, boasting roughly 7.5 million ETH staked on its platform, as per data from Nansen. That figure accounts for approximately 77% of the total market, data shows.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), on the other hand, were up approximately 1.9% and 3.9% over seven days \u2014 even as renewed investor interest comes via Blackrock\u2019s spot ETF application last month. The pair of major blue-chip digital assets retain roughly 51% and 20% of the total market share, respectively.\n\nCancun upgrade could fuel further growth\n\nThe next update to Ethereum focuses on EIP-4844 (also known as proto-dank sharding), which would effectively allow for larger \u201cblobs\u201d of data to be transmitted to Ethereum nodes for a limited duration, as opposed to hosting that data permanently on the layer-1 chain.\n\nThe data is stored long enough for nodes to demonstrate that provers from layer-2 rollups, which make sure the transactions from the L2 chain are correct, have done their job.\n\n\u201cWith the upcoming Cancun upgrade, L2 sequencers can anticipate considerably higher profit margins as L1 data costs are set to decrease substantially,\u201d Delphi analyst Joo Kian wrote in a blog post late last month.\n\nSequencers, whose role is to receive and order transactions in a way that reduces the load on the main Ethereum blockchain, would effectively be allowed to \u201coperate more efficiently and profitably,\u201d Kian added.\n\nIn the wake of the Shanghai hard fork, Ethereum\u2019s staking landscape has seen a significant transformation. The upgrade, which introduced the ability to withdraw staked ETH, has catalyzed a surge in staking deposits, while demand for withdrawals has been scant.\n\nNotably, the volume of ETH staked surpassing or equalling exchange inflows post-upgrade, Glassnode wrote.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nThe crypto space witnessed abnormal activity today, as major investors, often referred to as \"whales,\" made substantial investments in options contracts for Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC), as reported by Greeks Live portal. This surge in activity has sparked optimism within the market, pointing toward potential positive developments in the second half of the year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn particular, a considerable number of block calls, primarily involving Buy-DEC-2200C/2400C and Sell-DEC-3000C Ethereum contracts known as bull spreads, dominated the trading floor. These bullish strategies suggest that traders anticipate favorable price movements for ETH. Impressively, over 12,500 sets of these options contracts were traded, with a total notional value exceeding $50 million, indicating a significant response from the market.\n\nBTC and ETH to USD by CoinMarketCap\n\nAdditionally, there was notable buying activity in out-of-the-money (OTM) JUL calls for Ethereum. This suggests that buyers initiated transactions for options contracts with strike prices above the current market value of ETH. Such buyer interest implies a belief among investors that Ethereum's price may experience further appreciation in the coming months.\n\nWhile Bitcoin did not witness the same level of activity as Ethereum, signs of active buying were still evident, reaffirming the cryptocurrency's appeal to traders and investors.\n\nThese events are surprising, particularly given the usual decrease in market activity after quarterly expiration. The confidence displayed by major investors has challenged this convention, prompting speculation among analysts and enthusiasts regarding the market's prospects for the second half of the year."

        "title": "Is Ethereum (ETH) a security under US law? - CoinGeek",
        "content": "To read full Legal Opinion Click Here.\n\nA court would likely agree with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that Ethereum 2.0 amounts to an unregistered security, a comprehensive internal legal memo has warned.\n\nBuffone Law Group issued the memo to venture capital firm Ayre Ventures, and warned that both Ethereum\u2019s move to proof-of-stake and the Ethereum 2.0 staking programs offered by exchanges both amount to illegal securities offerings under the Howey test.\n\nEthereum is often held up as a kind of gold standard for digital assets that are not considered securities under the law. This is thanks to comments made by a former SEC director in 2018, which indicated his view that ETH was a commodity rather than a security. Though the speech was explicitly caveated as not being representative of the SEC\u2019s official position, ETH holders have clung to his words ever since.\n\nBut a lot has changed since 2018\u2014not least of all, regulators\u2019 understanding of the digital asset industry. Look no further than the sweeping charges levied by the SEC against the two biggest digital asset exchanges for illegally listing securities in June or Gensler\u2019s on-record comments that \u2018only a few\u2019 of the coins listed on exchanges were not securities.\n\nThis means Ethereum is also due for a revaluation\u2014especially with this year\u2019s move to proof-of-stake under Ethereum 2.0.\n\n\u201cAyre Ventures commissioned the report so that it can continue to steer clear of illegal securities business,\u201d said Calvin Ayre, founder of Ayre Group.\n\n\u201cI think the evidence is the only platform that is certain to not be a security is BSV.\u201d\n\nRecapping Howey\n\nThe memo, issued by Buffone Law Group, includes a summary of the Howey test for determining whether an asset offering is an investment contract and, therefore, a security. Under Howey, an investment contract exists if there is:\n\nAn investment of money; In a common enterprise; With a reasonable expectation of profits; That expectation is based upon the efforts of others\n\nThe key element of the Howey test, as it applies in a digital assets context, is whether there was an investment of profits derived from the efforts of others. This test will be met when the development of a given digital asset project is centralized (meaning there are identifiable individuals with the power to govern the network).\n\nIt also canvases several cases (on top of the Binance and Coinbase [NASDAQ: COIN] charges) where the courts have examined Howey\u2019s application in a digital assets context, showing that courts have been able to fit digital assets within Howey in a variety of contexts:\n\nSEC v Telegram: an enforcement case brought by the SEC over the issuance of Telegram\u2019s Gram tokens, the court found that the offering amounted to an investment contract under Howey. In particular, the court said that Telegram\u2019s execs \u201cwill be the guiding force behind the TON Blockchain [supporting the Gram token] for the immediate post-launch period while the [initial] purchasers unload their Grams into the secondary market\u201d and, therefore, \u201cthe initial 175 purchasers possess a reasonable expectation of profit based solely upon the efforts of Telegram because these purchasers expect to reap whopping gains from the resale of the Grams in the immediate post-launch period.\u201d\n\nSEC v Kik Interactive: this case concerned presales of Kik\u2019s Kin token to private investors. The court held that this amounted to a securities offering, saying that the \u2018common enterprise\u2019 element of Howey could be established by showing \u201cthe tying of each individual investor\u2019s fortunes to the fortunes of the other investors by the pooling of assets, usually combined with the pro rata distribution of profits.\u201d It also clarified that under the \u2018expectation of profits derived from the efforts of others\u2019 limb, the expectation of profits need not derive solely from the efforts of others. The fact that the token was eventually intended to be used consumptively also did not save Kik, as the court held that such consumptive uses would only arise from the efforts of its managerial staff in the first place.\n\nEthereum 2.0\n\nThe memo says that Ethereum 2.0 represents illegally unregistered securities offering on two fronts:\n\nFirst, with the upgrade to Ethereum 2.0 itself; and\n\nSecond, with regard to exchanges offering Ethereum 2.0 staking services\n\nTo begin, the memo sketches out the circumstances behind Ethereum\u2019s transition to Ethereum 2.0 (a term that has apparently been \u2018phased out\u2019 by the Ethereum Foundation). Additionally and most pertinently to the securities analysis, the memo also examines how this upgrade was designed and implemented.\n\nEthereum 2.0 went through four distinct development stages, all of which were managed by Vitalik Buterin\u2019s Ethereum Foundation. This included:\n\nThe rollout of Ethereum 2.0\u2019s proof-of-stake algorithm via the Paris upgrade\n\nThe creation of shard chains for network \u201cscalability\u201d\n\nThe activation of smart contract execution\n\nThe implementation of miscellaneous features for 2.0, such as the April 2023 Capella upgrade to allow staking withdrawals\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation said these changes were \u2018necessary to unlock Ethereum\u2019s full potential.\u2019\n\nIf Ethereum 2.0 is not a security, then these changes should have all been democratically designed, chosen, and implemented. Further, there would be no expectation of further changes to the network. This didn\u2019t happen in the case of Ethereum, which is at all times exclusively managed by the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nAs the memo says:\n\n\u201cUnder this arrangement, presumably the Ethereum Foundation developers will continue to administer improvements to the network and distribution of validator rewards post-launch, and will be responsible for the success or failure of Ethereum post-merge.\u201d\n\nIt points out that the GitHub page for Ethereum 2.0 contributors shows that there are only five individuals with a \u2018significant concentration\u2019 of additions or commits\u2014all of whom are employees of the Ethereum Foundation. These are:\n\nDanny Ryan (aka \u201cdjrtwo\u201d)\n\nHsiao-Wei Wang (aka \u201chwwhww\u201d)\n\nDiederik Loerakker (aka \u201cprotolambda\u201d)\n\nJustin Drake (aka \u201cJustinDrake\u201d)\n\nApplying Howey to the Ethereum 2.0 upgrades\n\nWas there an investment of money?\n\nThe memo advises that the courts have found that the investment of digital assets, as opposed to fiat currency, still amounts to an investment of money under Howey (BitConnect). It was a true investment, because the users staking their ETH were running the risk that the entire amount staked could be lost in the process, and users could not unstake or otherwise redeem their staked ETH until the Ethereum 2.0 network upgrade was completed in April of this year. Additionally, there was never any guarantee that the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade would be successfully completed.\n\nWas there a common enterprise?\n\nAccording to the memo, \u201cthe $325 million of ETH staked to launch Ethereum 2.0 would likely be considered a pooling of funds that would give rise to horizontal commonality.\u201d\n\nIt cites the court\u2019s decision in Kik, which held that the key feature of a common enterprise \u201cis not that investors must reap their profits\u201d in a specific form or at the same time, but that the \u201cinvestors\u2019 profits at any given time are tied to the success of the enterprise.\u201d Further, \u201cthe nature of a common enterprise [is] to pool invested proceeds to increase the range of goods and services from which income and profits could be earned or, to increase the range of goods and services that holders of [the digital asset] would find beneficial to buy and sell with [that digital asset].\u201d\n\nFor Ethereum 2.0, there are two factors that suggest a common enterprise exists:\n\nOver 16,000 validators collectively staked $325 million, which was the threshold required for the launch of Ethereum 2.0 to take place. The ETH created on the 2.0 network count not be sent back to the original Ethereum blockchain and could not be used on the 2.0 network until the Paris update and network merge. If the merge did not take place, the ETH held on the Ethereum 2.0 network had no consumptive use or value.\n\n\u201cThus,\u201d reads the memo, \u201cthese features lead naturally to the conclusion that the $325 million of staked ETH constitutes the pooling of funds to not just increase, but create, the goods and services that holders of the ETH on the Ethereum 2.0 network can use this asset for.\u201d\n\nWas there a reasonable expectation of profits?\n\nThis limb of the test is straightforward. The validators who staked their 32 ETH to the network begin earning rewards on their ETH in the form of annualized interest, which can reach more than 20% and is distributed around every 6 minutes (the time it takes to create a new block).\n\nEarlier investors also stand to earn higher interest on their investment than later investors because the percentage interest earned over time decreases in proportion to the total number of validators.\n\nWas that based on the efforts of others?\n\nThe memo identifies four facts relevant to the final and most frequently challenged limb of the test as it applies to digital assets.\n\nETH earned on the Ethereum 2.0 network was locked on this network until the merger with the Ethereum mainnet. Before that merge, the ETH could not be sent to the Ethereum mainnet. No consumptive transactions or smart contracts could occur on Ethereum 2.0 until the merge took place. The Ethereum 2.0 network did not have an existing marketplace where ETH tokens were accepted for consumptive use until the merge.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, the value of the Ethereum tokens earned as interest payments was entirely speculative, and the future value turned entirely on the Ethereum Foundation successfully executing on its four-phase plan leading to the merging of the Ethereum 2.0 network with the Ethereum mainnet.\u201d\n\nNow that the merger has taken place, those ETH tokens have increased in value thanks to the additional capabilities offered by the merged network, such as vastly increased scalability. If the merger hadn\u2019t gone ahead, those tokens would be worthless.\n\nThat the upgrades were to increase the value of the network can be seen from the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s promotional materials describing the merge. They said that the upgrades would \u201cmake Ethereum more scalable, more secure and more sustainable.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs Ethereum developers presumably continue to build out, improve, and administer updates to the network and distribution of ETH post-launch, a court is likely to find that Ethereum 2.0 validators are heavily reliant on the efforts of the Ethereum Foundation for their ETH token holdings on the Ethereum 2.0 network to have any value, let alone appreciate in value.\u201d\n\nThe memo warns that there are \u2018several\u2019 aspects of the Ethereum 2.0 rollout that would likely cause the SEC or a court to find that it falls within the Howey test and thus amounts to an unregistered securities offering.\n\nUsers that want to earn rewards for securing the network and processing transactions must deposit 32 ETH into a smart contract on the original Ethereum blockchain.\n\nAn equal amount of that ETH is created on the Ethereum 2.0 beacon chain, which can be put up as collateral by the user in order to become a validator.\n\nThe validators only received their 32 ETH existing on the 2.0 chain because the threshold of 16,000 validators was reached, which allowed for the Ethereum 2.0 network to launch.\n\nETH could not be sent back to the original Ethereum chain.\n\nThere was a risk that the 32 staked ETH could be lost to the user under the provision of the smart contract. Validators immediately began earning interest as high as 20% on their initial 32 ETH investment.\n\nExchange-facilitated Ethereum staking programs\n\nThe analysis also covers another significant implication of Ethereum 2.0\u2019s status under Howey: the legality of exchange-offered ETH staking programs. These are programs facilitated by exchanges, which allow users to stake their held ETH (usually in amounts smaller than the 32 ETH threshold) in exchange for the payment of interest. The exchanges then pool those assets together and are responsible for staking them in 32 ETH increments to the Ethereum 2.0 blockchain. Validator rewards are then distributed back to the original users in proportion to the amount initially staked.\n\nThis is a particularly relevant topic given the SEC charges against Coinbase and Binance, both of which highlighted the digital asset staking programs offered by the exchanges as examples of unregistered securities. The SEC has also pursued other exchanges for similar arrangements, including the Gemini Earn lending program.\n\nIn the case of staking ETH to the Ethereum 2.0 network via exchanges, the memo warns that this, too, meets the Howey test for an investment contract.\n\nAs discussed above, users are making an investment of money through the platforms.\n\nThere is a common enterprise, as when users stake less than 32 ETH via the exchange, the exchange is pooling the funds to stake 32 ETH lots of assets to the network. The court\u2019s ruling in the Kik case is instructive, as it said that \u201cthe nature of a common enterprise [is] top pool invested proceeds to increase the range of goods and services from which income and profits could be earned or\u2026 the increase the range of goods and services that holders of [the digital asset] would find beneficial to buy and sell with [that digital asset].\u201d\n\nSeveral factors support a reasonable expectation of profits: exchanges offer rates of between 5 and 20 percent per year, with validator rewards being paid out to users proportional to the amount staked.\n\nThe expectation of profits is derived from the efforts of others: the exchanges are providing the resources necessary to run a validator node, such as hardware and the finances to run it. The rewards ultimately received by the users depend heavily on the efforts of these exchanges to 1) provide the resources and hardware required to run the node, and 2) ensure that the validator does not stop validating or behave in a way that would lead to the forfeiture of the staked ETH.\n\nThe analysis of staking programs is interesting because it illustrates that a court finds that a given digital asset offering amounts to a security will have significant implications for all parties connected with the asset. This can be seen in the slew of charges now faced by Coinbase and Binance merely for listing digital asset securities (their liability arises from failing to register as securities dealers), and will be seen in the way other products based on securities (such as Ethereum staking services) will also be rendered illegal by the circumstances of the initial offering.\n\nDoes this analysis apply elsewhere?\n\nPerhaps most alarming (to some) about this analysis is that it can be applied to a huge proportion of the digital asset market.\n\nThere is always going to be an investment of money. Any hope of escaping liability under this heading vanished with the confirmation that digital assets are considered money under this test.\n\nThere is practically always going to be a common enterprise. As the court said in Telegram, the key feature is not that the investors actually reap their profits in a specific form or at the same time; all that is required is that the profits\u2014at any given time\u2014are tied to the success of the enterprise.\n\nThere is an expectation of profits derived from the efforts of others: this is both the most obfuscated element of the test and the easiest to apply. It comes down to centralization: is the investors\u2019 expectation of profits arising from the efforts of some management or entrepreneurial efforts of others? Crucial to this element is that the expectation does not need to derive solely from the efforts of others, so the fact that some of the profits can be accounted for by an increase in value arising solely from speculation is no argument against a finding under this heading.\n\nLike ETH, BTC has often been held up as an example of digital assets which do not amount to commodities. As seen from the analysis above, the upgrade to Ethereum 2.0 looks a lot like an illegally unregistered securities offering, as do exchange-facilitated ETH staking programs.\n\nBTC has also undergone significant changes designed and implemented by a core group of individuals with the power to affect the network. In 2017, the SegWit update drastically changed the way Bitcoin transactions are recorded: whereas the Bitcoin white paper made it clear both that signatures are an inextricable part of the system and that the network is scalable on-chain, SegWit removed digital signatures and broke them out into a separate data structure in order to (allegedly) help the network\u2019s scalability issues.\n\nSuch a change has significant consequences. Not only is it a demonstration of power by the BTC Core developers (just as it was with the Ethereum Foundation employees shepherding in Ethereum 2.0) in demonstration of reliance on the efforts of others, each departure from the original Bitcoin protocol is a \u2018fork\u2019 of the network. This creates new coin issuances based on the new protocol whereby the new coins are \u2018airdropped\u2019 to the holders of the original.\n\nZeMing Gao describes the consequences of this in a securities context in his article, \u201cEven BTC is a security according to the Howey test\u201d:\n\n\u201cEvery time when the actual underlying blockchain changes the base protocol that not only affects transactions but also affects the automated unilateral contract originally offered by Satoshi, the coin is no longer the original coin. From that point on, any coin that continues on the changed blockchain is materially a new coin offered under a new contract. Further, the continuous issuance of new tokens to miners is also under a new mining contract different from the original unilateral contract offered to miners by Satoshi. This makes the reissued tokens and new tokens both a security, collectively or separately, even though the original bitcoin was a nonsecurity. It does not matter what name or ticker it carries, nor what the market price it receives. This is because the market is not the factfinder for this matter; it simply votes according to whatever information it was fed, and in this case they were fed deceptive information.\u201d\n\nHowey can sound like a confusing and difficult-to-apply test, especially in a digital assets context. However, when you strip away the fluff, the core question is as simple as whether or not the underlying protocol is fixed and set in stone. If not, then centralized power exists somewhere in the system, usually resting with a few key individuals. Once that\u2019s established, the conclusion that there is an expectation of profits reliant on the efforts of others\u2014and is thus a security\u2014is staring you in the face.\n\nAs it is with Ethereum 2.0, so it is with BTC.\n\nTo read full Legal Opinion Click Here.\n\nFollow CoinGeek\u2019s Crypto Crime Cartel series, which delves into the stream of groups\u2014from BitMEX to Binance, Bitcoin.com, Blockstream, ShapeShift, Coinbase, Ripple,\n\nEthereum, FTX and Tether\u2014who have co-opted the digital asset revolution and turned the industry into a minefield for na\u00efve (and even experienced) players in the market.\n\nNew to blockchain?

        "title": "Shards and Layer-2s: Unpacking NEAR and Ethereum's contrasting approaches to blockchain scalability - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "The landscape of blockchain scalability has evolved significantly in recent years, with Layer-2s (L2s) and sharding emerging as the two dominant approaches.\n\nEthereum, a key player in the crypto industry, has adopted rollup-centric L2s to scale its network, while NEAR protocol has taken a different path, choosing to scale via sharding. Both strategies offer unique solutions to blockchain scalability, but they also present their distinctive challenges.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Layer 2s: A Rollup-Centric Approach\n\nNEARWEEK, a NEAR protocol publication, commended Ethereum for garnering considerable attention for its innovative rollup-centric scaling strategy. An L2 protocol is built atop an existing blockchain to enhance scalability, throughput, and privacy. This is achieved by executing state transitions off-chain from the Layer-1 (L1) they\u2019re built upon and committing state roots and transactional data to the underlying L1.\n\nNEAR sees the driving philosophy behind rollups as the belief that a rollup can outperform the underlying L1 in terms of throughput due to decreased consensus overhead. However, in practice, NEAR believes the overall scaling achieved by rollups collectively has been somewhat disappointing, barely surpassing what a single rollup can offer.\n\nHowever, data from L2 analysis platform L2Beat offers a contrasting view due to increased L2 activity over the past year, as shown in the chart below.\n\nFurther, reviewing the top 10 Ethereum L2s shows Arbitrum One and zkSync Era closing in on Ethereum\u2019s monthly transaction count. Additionally, Immutable X and Arbitrum Nova have surpassed Ethereum\u2019s growth in average transactions per second (TPS) over seven days. Notably, Ethereum had a higher active TPS than any L2 scaling solution on the network on July 3.\n\n# Name Past Day TPS 7D Change Max Daily TPS 30D Count Data Source 1 Ethereum 12.29 6.48% 22.37 (2022 Dec 09) 31.45 M Blockchain RPC 2 Arbitrum One 9.69 -4.17% 31.64 (2023 Mar 23) 24.81 M Blockchain RPC 3 zkSync Era 8.63 -14.74% 12.00 (2023 May 16) 22.27 M Blockchain RPC 4 OP Mainnet 6.00 -12.97% 9.26 (2023 Jan 12) 14.82 M Blockchain RPC 5 dYdX 3.09 -38.54% 11.45 (2022 Feb 15) 9.42 M Closed API 6 Immutable X 2.01 7.47% 39.35 (2022 Mar 11) 5.67 M Closed API 7 Starknet 1.79 -9.17% 3.05 (2023 May 16) 4.61 M Explorer API 8 Arbitrum Nova 1.34 18.15% 10.93 (2023 Apr 27) 2.99 M Blockchain RPC 9 ApeX 0.95 2.27% 1.38 (2023 Apr 13) 2.68 M Closed API 10 zkSync Lite 0.89 -27.20% 3.29 (2023 Mar 21) 2.52 M Explorer API 11 Polygon zkEVM 0.64 -5.13% 0.82 (2023 Jun 13) 1.34 M Blockchain RPC\n\nData from L2Beat.com\n\nHowever, the primary cause of NEAR\u2019s suggested lackluster performance is attributed to the fact that popular Ethereum decentralized applications (dApps) operate on nearly all rollups, resulting in similar transactions being \u2018duplicated\u2019 across different rollups.\n\nNEAR\u2019s Shard-Centric Approach\n\nNEAR Protocol has, conversely, opted to tackle scalability through sharding, which partitions the network into distinct segments built directly into the protocol. According to NEARWEEK, each shard in NEAR\u2019s architecture can be likened to an optimistic rollup in Ethereum\u2019s approach.\n\nThe key advantage of NEAR\u2019s sharding approach lies in its composability, which allows applications on one shard to interact with applications on another shard natively. This homogeneous sharding model allows applications to interact in the same way regardless if they\u2019re deployed on the same shard, relieving developers from deciding which shard to deploy their applications.\n\nAdditionally, NEAR\u2019s sharding model offers faster transaction finality, typically within two to three seconds, outperforming the extended finality times in the rollup universe.\n\nWhile NEAR Protocol does not list its real-time TPS on the block explorer, it can be calculated based on data from the most recent blocks. A CryptoSlate analysis of transactions from the NEAR block explorer showed an average TPS of roughly 5.7 transactions per second on July 4. This snapshot of NEAR\u2019s TPS aligns with the top five L2s on the Ethereum network. The NEAR community foresees the protocol\u2019s potential through sharding will reach 100,000 TPS in the future.\n\nContrasting Design Philosophies\n\nThe different scaling approaches adopted by Ethereum and NEAR highlight their contrasting design philosophies. While Ethereum prioritizes resilience, maintaining a simple L1 protocol design, NEARWEEK stated NEAR Protocol leans towards a simplified user experience, taking on additional protocol complexity to ensure a superior UX.\n\nFurthermore, it\u2019s important to note that NEAR is not aiming to be \u201cjust an L1\u201d as it seeks to function as a Blockchain Operating System (BOS), providing a universal layer for navigating and discovering open web experiences. Through the BOS, NEAR aims to\n\n\u201cempower developers and users from various blockchains, including Ethereum Layer 2s, to construct and utilise applications across a multitude of blockchain ecosystems.\u201d\n\nMore details on NEAR\u2019s BOS vision can be found on its Medium account.\n\nBlockchain scalability remains a complex and crucial issue in the crypto world. As Ethereum\u2019s rollup-centric L2s and NEAR\u2019s sharding evolve, it will be intriguing to see which approach proves most effective in the long run.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction As ETH Takes On $2,000 \u2013 Is This The Bullish Escape To $5,000? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum price is doubling down its bullish efforts after reclaiming support at $1,900 and extending the leg to $1,950. The second largest smart contracts token, powered by a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, is up 1.6% on the day and trading at $1,945 on Monday.\n\nBitcoin price is also slightly in the green with 0.5% in accrued gains over the last 24 hours and doddering at $30,660. As analyzed earlier, BTC is poised for a massive breakout to $35,000 and $38,000, but first, the resistance between $31,000 and $32,000 must come out of the way.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum boasts approximately $8 billion in its 24-hour trading volume and a market cap of $234 billion. Its immediate downside is protected by the recently reclaimed ascending trendline support, but if declines intensify, it would be prudent for investors to anticipate a minor and brief retracement to stronger support at $1,800 and $1,650, respectively.\n\nHow Will Investors React To Ethereum Price Lifting Above $2,000?\n\nThe sudden interest in the crypto market by institutional investors like Blackrock, Fidelity Investments, and Cathie Wood was a substantial boost for the crypto market in June.\n\nBlackrock\u2019s decision to apply for a spot Bitcoin ETF has, within a few weeks, encouraged other players like Cathie Wood and Fidelity to cast their nets with the hope of operating a similar product in the US.\n\nMarket participants believe Blackrock has a higher chance of getting the coveted approval, which the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has managed to avoid for several years, citing market volatility and manipulation, among other bottlenecks.\n\nAs more institutional investors stream into the market, major digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum are bound to react positively. Retail investors also see this as a signal that the market is on an upward trajectory.\n\nEthereum\u2019s sturdiness from support at $1,650 can mainly be attributed to the rise in interest from institutional and retail investors combined.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that with Ethereum holding above $1,900 and particularly on top of the dotted rising trendline, the path with the least resistance gradually turns to the upside. That said, the anticipated breakout above $2,000 is, at the time of writing, a matter of when and not if.\n\nEvaluating Ethereum Price Bullish Outlook\n\nTwo indicators affirm the bullish outlook for Ethereum price, starting with a buy signal from the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator. This call to buy Ether triggered on June 20, has managed to keep investor interest intact, but resistance at $2,000 is the biggest stumbling block, at least for now.\n\nA second bullish signal emanates from the SuperTrend indicator, which like the MACD, flipped in support of an Ethereum uptrend on June 20. Like a moving average, this indicator overlays the chart, but it also integrates readings from the true average range (ATR) to gauge the volatility in the market.\n\nAs long as the SuperTrend is trailing Ethereum price, recovery to $2,000 will remain steady. Traders may want to confirm ETH closes the day above the dotted trendline and the buyer congestion at $1,900 to validate the expected breakout beyond the psychological resistance.\n\nThe fear of missing out (FOMO) could suddenly be the driving force for Ethereum price targeting the ultimate move to $3,000 and subsequently climbing to the all-time high of $4,878.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "content": "Solana (SOL) co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko believed that Ethereum (ETH) can act as a layer-2 network for the SOL blockchain. Yakovenko took to Twitter to express his views on the possibility. According to Yakovenko, the collaboration is \u201cprobably more likely than you might think at first glance.\u201d\n\nWould it be possible for ethereum to be a @solana L2? Probably more likely than you might think at first glance. L2s are bridge protocols that provide one way security. In this setup, holders of solana assets on ethereum would have finality guarantees that they can exit back\u2026 https://t.co/XE5ETsxGIW July 2, 2023\n\nLayer-2 solutions try to solve the scalability problems that blockchains often face. Despite its popularity, Ethereum has seen congestion and high transaction costs when there has been a spike in activity. On the other hand, Solana is famous for its high throughput and cheaper transactions.\n\nAccording to Yakovenko, if Ethereum (ETH) becomes a layer-2 for Solana (SOL), SOL assets on the ETH blockchain would have \u201cfinality guarantees\u201d of being able to exit back to Solana safely. This would happen even in the face of transaction double spends or an invalid state transition.\n\nYakovenko mentioned that making the setup work will require submitting all the Ethereum transactions into Solana. In addition, it will need to submit a Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) root. This will demonstrate that the network\u2019s current state has been agreed upon by all Ethereum validators. Finally, a bridge timeout mechanism will be required to detect and correct potential protocol flaws.\n\nYakovenko also emphasized the restrictions and possible dangers connected to this integration. It would be secured to store SOL assets on the Ethereum blockchain, but it would not be secure \u201cto lend them or maintain positions against them.\u201d\n\nEthereum\u2019s Vitalik Buterin speaks on Solana\n\nYakovenko\u2019s tweet about ETH being a potential layer-2 for SOL follows Ethereum co-founder, Vitalik Buterin\u2019s comment about SOL\u2019s current predicament. Buterin expressed displeasure with the way U.S. officials are going after cryptocurrency initiatives like Solana.\n\nAlso Read: Vitalik Buterin Reveals His ETH Staking Strategy\n\nAccording to Buterin, the real competition is the \u201crapidly expanding centralized world that is imposing itself on us as we speak,\u201d and not other chains. Buterin took to Twitter and said that \u201cI feel bad that Solana and other projects are getting hit in this way.\u201d\n\nThe one comment I'll make is that I feel bad that @solana and other projects are getting hit in this way. They don't deserve it, and if ethereum ends up \"winning\" through all other blockchains getting kicked off exchanges, that's not an honorable way to win, and in the long term\u2026 \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) June 30, 2023\n\nSolana (SOL) has had a series of hard times, especially after the collapse of FTX. FTX founder, Sam Bankman-Fried had a lot riding on SOL, and the exchange\u2019s collapse left a heavy blow on the project. Many developers left the SOL network to join rival chains. However, the project has since made a healthy recovery, despite the ongoing crackdown on crypto projects in the U.S. At press time, SOL was trading at $19.33, up by 2% in the last 24 hours.\n\nAlso Read: Mark Cuban Gets into Heated Debate With SEC Official Over Crypto Regulation"

        "title": "Ethereum Whale Transactions Jump Over 50% As ETH Eyes $2,000 - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum whales have been ramping up their activities on the blockchain as it eyes an important level. This time around, their recent spike in activity has been in the form of transactions. These whale transactions which are carrying at least $100,000, making it so only large holders could be behind the transactions, have been on the rise.\n\nMostly, the Ethereum whales ramped up their activities following ETH\u2019s price increase over the last week. The first spike was noticed after the crypto broke above $1,900 and as it has continued to maintain this level, there has been more consistency among the whales.\n\nIntoTheBlock data shows that ETH whales have doubled their transaction counts over a few days. This increase saw their total transactions go from 2,120 to 3,230 in two days. This jump in number of transactions translates to an over 54% increase in just 48 hours \u2013 from July 2 to July 4. In a 7-day period, almost $20 billion has been moved by ETH whales.\n\nETH whale transactions cross 3,000 in two days | Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nHowever, while this jump is significant in its own right, it is not unusual for Ethereum to see such a high number of large transactions. For example, toward the end of June, the total whale transactions had also spiked above the $3,000 level.\n\nEthereum\u2019s holder base is made up of a high number of whales when compared to its largest competitor Bitcoin. While the latter\u2019s whale holders only make up 11% of the total holder base, Ethereum whale wallets account for 42% of its total wallets, according to data from IntoTheBlock. Hence, a high volume of large transactions happening in a short period is not out of place.\n\nHow The Ethereum Whales Can Affect Price\n\nA high number of whale transactions can have significant impacts on the price of coins like Ethereum depending on what the holders of these coins intend to do with them. If these transactions carrying at least $100,000 worth of coins are for selling, then the price of ETH would see a downtrend.\n\nHowever, since the price of ETH has remained relatively stable and maintained its hold on the $1,900 support, then it is likely that these whales are just moving their coins around without selling. Additionally, these on-chain transactions do not point toward a good volume of ETH flowing toward centralized exchanges, further giving credence to the fact that these whales are not moving their coins for selling purposes.\n\nEthereum, on its own, has not had the best of days though as its trading volume is down significantly from Monday. It is currently sitting at $6 billion, a 27% decline from Monday\u2019s figures. Nevertheless, its price is holding steady with meager gains of 0.1% as the coin trades at a price of $1,963.\n\nETH price trending at $1,962 | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

The largest digital asset by market cap was trading for $31,052 at the time of writing, according to CoinGecko.\n\nThat's a 1.8% 24-hour jump.

A high-profile Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) application from BlackRock and the launch of a new crypto exchange called EDX Markets were among the triggers, according to experts.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitcoin dropped below that mark in recent days and was holding firmly above $30,000 per coin aside from a brief dip on Friday. But the price is now comfortably above $31,000 again.\n\nInvestment firm CoinShares said on Monday that institutional investors are continuing to plug money into digital asset products, with $125 million worth of inflows over the past week. And most of that money is focused on Bitcoin, it added.\n\nThis week in Fund Flows, by CoinShares Head of Research @jbutterfill:\n\nBullishness on crypto among investors continues, with US$125m inflows in digital asset investment products. \ud83e\uddf5 (1/5) pic.twitter.com/rX6KZrSOgm \u2014 CoinShares (@CoinSharesCo) July 3, 2023\n\nInstitutional investors are interested in the digital asset market because major Wall Street firms like BlackRock\u2014the world's largest asset manager\u2014and Fidelity have applied to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nA spot Bitcoin ETF, which allows investors to buy shares that track the price of an asset, does not yet exist in the U.S. However, the flurry of applications potentially show that traditional investors are hungry for such a product.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe largest digital asset by market cap isn't the only cryptocurrency up today: Ethereum, the second largest, is fast closing in on $2,000 per coin, CoinGecko data shows. It is right now trading for $1,961, a 2.3% climb over the last 24 hours.\n\nIf it hits $2,000, it will be the first time since May that the coin topped that mark. Ethereum remains down nearly 60% from its peak price of $4,878 from November 2021, according to CoinGecko, while Bitcoin is down 55% from its own all-time high from the same month.\n\nAnd Pepe, a newer meme coin which launched in April, is one of the best-performing digital assets today: it is up 16.7% in the past day and 15.1% in the past week, trading hands for $0.00000182.\n\nThe asset has surged in value since its launch\u2014with one lucky investor managing to turn $250 into $1.02 million worth of the cryptocurrency in just four days amid its initial spike. However, Pepe has shed about 58% of its value since its April peak."

        "content": "With the increasing global interest in cryptocurrencies and the appealing opportunity to achieve millionaire status through smart investments, Ethereum (ETH) has gained popularity as a favored option, attracting significant attention for its potential to generate substantial profits. So, how many Ethereum do you need to buy to become a millionaire?\n\nEthereum Price: What has happened to ETH?\n\nAt the present time, the current price of ETH stands at $1,960. This means that each ETH coin would cost an investor $1,960. It is important to note that the price of ETH, similar to other cryptocurrencies, is subject to market fluctuations and can rapidly change. Therefore, it is crucial to stay updated with the latest information when making investment decisions.\n\nETH prices have recently shown a slight upward trend, recovering from support levels near its recent lows.\n\nEthereum ATH Price: Highest ETH Price\n\nETH has witnessed significant price volatility throughout its history. The all-time high (ATH) price signifies the highest price level that ETH has ever reached. According to the most recent available data, the ATH price of ETH is approximately $4,880, representing the highest value ETH has attained in the past.\n\nHow Many Ethereum Do You Need to BUY to Become a Millionaire?\n\nTo determine the amount of ETH coins required to attain millionaire status, it is necessary to consider the difference between the current price and the ATH price.\n\nThe price difference between the ATH and the current price of ETH is $4,880 \u2013 $1,960 = $2,920.\n\nTo calculate the quantity of ETH coins needed, we divide $1,000,000 by the price difference: $1,000,000 / $2,920 = 342.47 ETH (approximately).\n\nTherefore, at the present ETH price of $1,960, an investor would need to purchase approximately 342.47 ETH coins today to potentially achieve millionaire status if the price were to reach its ATH once again. This would require an investment of approximately $671,959.\n\nImportant Considerations\n\nIt is important to acknowledge that the above calculation assumes that the ETH price will reach its ATH once again. However, predicting the future price movements of any cryptocurrency is highly speculative and depends on various factors, including market conditions, adoption rates, and regulatory changes, such as legal actions taken by regulatory authorities like the SEC.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might also like\n\nMore from Altcoin"

The repercussions of these liquidity changes have prompted discussions about their interpretation, especially in light of Bitcoin\u2019s price going up due to increased institutional interest.\n\nLiquidity Plummets In Crypto Market\n\nAccording to statistics, Bitcoin\u2019s exchange reserve has dwindled by 20% over the past year, amounting to 2.092 million. This reduction in available Bitcoin holdings on exchanges suggests a decreased willingness among investors to sell or trade their Bitcoin.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn a similar vein, Ethereum\u2019s exchange reserves have experienced an even steeper decline, plummeting by 40% to reach 16 million.\n\nAnother key aspect affected by this liquidity shift is the stablecoin market. Stablecoins, which aim to maintain a stable value by being pegged to a fiat currency, have encountered a sharp decline in reserves. The collective reserves of stablecoins have shrunk by 52%, amounting to 16.93 billion.

He suggests that when the ratio of stablecoin market capitalization or exchange holdings is high, there is a relatively high probability of market bottoming out.\n\nJu further notes that the current market capitalization of stablecoins, in relation to Bitcoin and Ethereum, remains relatively low. Another Twitter user said- stablecoin transition period due to $BUSD, and it doesn\u2019t necessarily link to the buy-side liquidity declining.

Starting at $31,153, Bitcoin\u2019s rally follows a wave of optimism fueled by several prospective issuers re-filing their applications for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

According to the SEC lawsuit, these include Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), and others.\n\nThe classification of these cryptocurrencies as securities could have far-reaching implications. For instance, if the SEC\u2019s allegations are upheld, these digital assets could be subject to stringent regulatory requirements, including registration and disclosure obligations.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nOnce hailed as an \u201cEthereum killer,\u201d Solana has faced an existential crisis since the FTX crash of November 2022. Solana was one of the projects with major exposure to FTX, an investor in Solana.\n\nDespite the regulatory woes, Solana is seeing increased adoption in some segments. The week ending on Sunday, July 2, Solana surpassed Ethereum in daily NFT sales.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nButerin\u2019s endorsements signal that the crypto community is closing ranks against what they see as regulatory attacks against the industry.\n\nRead more about Solana\u2019s regulatory woes:\n\nSEC v.

        "content": "Controversy emerged in the cryptocurrency community as Ethereum co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, revealed his cautious stance towards staking his Ether (ETH) holdings.\n\nIn a recent episode of the Bankless podcast, Buterin explained his decision, citing the complications surrounding multi-signature wallets as the primary reason. This revelation left many, including Charles Hoskinson, the co-founder of Ethereum and founder of Cardano, at a loss for words.\n\nDuring the podcast, Buterin also discussed the EigenLayer protocol, an innovative concept that allows validators and stakers to re-stake their assets on emerging networks. However, Buterin raised concerns about potential centralization risks associated with the protocol, emphasizing the need for a constrained approach to its development.\n\nSreeram Kaanan, the founder of EigenLayer, echoed Buterin\u2019s sentiments, acknowledging the complex risks involved in restaking. Kaanan stressed the importance of maintaining constraints to safeguard the ecosystem and prevent any potential negative consequences of this novel concept.\n\nThis news comes in the wake of Buterin\u2019s earlier statement regarding the shortcomings of the Ethereum blockchain without adequate scaling infrastructure. Buterin underlined the necessity of affordable transactions and highlighted the challenges posed by smart contract wallets, which can create user experience complexities when managing multiple addresses simultaneously.\n\nButerin\u2019s measured approach to staking and his insights into potential risks associated with new protocols have sparked a lively debate within the cryptocurrency community.\n\nAlso Read: Vitalik Buterin Raises Concerns Over SEC and Solana\n\nWhile some praise his prudent outlook, others express concerns about the impact on Ethereum\u2019s progress. The ongoing dialogue underscores the importance of striking a balance between innovation and risk management in the fast-evolving world of cryptocurrencies."

Many stops on shorts are ready to be taken, through which holding above $0.30 can lead to a continuation towards $0.40.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, FTM is trading for $0.304.\n\nNext up is the decentralized machine-learning network Fetch.ai (FET). Van de Poppe says he\u2019s waiting for FET to take out its resistance at $0.25 before accumulating the altcoin. Otherwise, he\u2019s looking to enter FET at lower levels.\n\n\u201cFlipping and breaking $0.25 is crucial and then I\u2019m interested for longs towards the highs.\n\nOtherwise, the trend continues and then I\u2019m looking at $0.14 or reclaim $0.17.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, FET is trading for $0.23.\n\nAnother altcoin on the trader\u2019s list is the Ethereum-scaling solution Arbitrum (ARB). According to Van de Poppe, ARB will likely enter bullish territory should it break above $1.30.\n\n\u201cThis is super simple.\n\nIf we break $1.30, you need to be long ARB.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, ARB is worth $1.13.\n\nThe last coin on the analyst\u2019s radar is the video-sharing blockchain Verasity (VRA). Van de Poppe says VRA must breach resistance at $0.0058 to ignite a significant surge.\n\n\u201cThis one looks ready for upwards momentum.

Watch this price prediction in the 4-hour timeframe\n\nFor days now, we have been tracking the ETH Converging Triangle Pattern playing out in the 4-hour timeframe. And right now, the target for that bullish pattern has been smashed!\n\nThe question now is what can we expect to see play out in the coming days. Should we expect to see the Altcoin continue to push higher to the upside or will Ethereum begin to sell off again?\n\nIn this ETH analysis, we will be breaking down the weakness we are seeing creep into the ETH rally and what this might mean for the Ethereum bulls in the coming days.\n\nTo trade ETH with leverage, sign-up to Bybit right now!

And in this state, there is a very high possibility for us to see the Altcoin move in any direction in the coming days.\n\nIt is also important to note that bulls are right now losing bullish momentum and we see bearish divergence developing in the 4-hour timeframe. This bearish divergence is between the ETH price and the MACD indicator.\n\nWhat Does This Bearish Divergence Mean?\n\nThe image above is what a completed bearish divergence should look like!\n\nBearish Divergence shows weakness in price. The bearish divergence is caused when the price is moving higher while the MACD indicator keeps on moving lower. Once this happens, it signifies that the asset might be weak and ready to sell off.\n\nRight now, the Ethereum price is rallying higher, but the MACD indicator is showing a clear sign of a downtrend.\n\nThis tells us that \u201cwhile the price might be moving up, bullish volume is dying down\u201d and if this continues, sooner or later the ETH price will reverse.\n\nFinal Verdict!\n\nETH Bullish Target For This Pattern Smashed! What Now? Watch this price prediction in the 4-hour timeframe\n\nThe Ethereum price is right now still pushing up higher. However, this bullish push is gradually losing steam. And as it gets weaker, we expect to see the bearish divergence between the ETH price and the MACD indicator grow!\n\nIf bullish momentum does not begin to pour into the market soon, there is a very high probability that we might see more sellers step in and push the Altcoin lower in the coming days.\n\nFor now, we are still bullish on Ethereum until the trend says otherwise.

Source: CoinCodex\n\nMoreover, should it follow the same growth pattern as that of the internet, the platform indicates that the price of Ethereum by the end of 2024 could reach $2,783.73, a 42.43% gain from its price at press time. Imitating the growth of mobile tech could lead it to $2,736.92, an increase of 40.04%.\n\nAt the same time, if the digital asset follows the path of Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL), it could increase its price by 108.18% and end up at $4,068.82. Mimicking Facebook\u2019s (NASDAQ: META) expansion could see Ethereum reach a price of $8,218.92 by the year\u2019s end, gaining 320.52%.\n\nMeanwhile, by the same logic, ETH could imitate the internet and reach the price of $ 3,593.79 by the end of 2025, increasing by 83.88% from press time, or $3,503.53 (+79.26%) if it followed the behavior and the expansion process of mobile technologies.\n\nFurthermore, keeping the same movements as Google, Ethereum is looking at $6,350.62 or +224.93% by the end of 2025, whereas following the trend of Facebook could lead it to a whopping $18,232, or a price increase of 832.84% during the same period.\n\nEthereum price prediction for 2024 and 2025.

        "title": "Comparing the Best ZK Rollups Projects on Ethereum - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2018s blockchain, while revolutionary, has encountered significant scaling challenges due to its growing popularity. However, innovative solutions like ZK-Rollups are now making it possible for Ethereum to handle more transactions per second, reduce gas fees, and improve overall scalability.\n\nThis article delves into some of the most exciting projects utilizing ZK-Rollups on the Ethereum network. Each of these projects brings unique attributes to the table, demonstrating the versatility and potential of ZK-Rollups as a layer-2 scaling solution.\n\nWhat are ZK rollups?\n\nZK-Rollups are an Ethereum Layer-2 scaling solution that uses zero-knowledge proofs to bundle multiple transactions into a single proof that is then posted on the Ethereum mainnet. Each transaction in the ZK-Rollup is completely valid, and the Ethereum mainnet can trust this without having to validate each transaction individually, thereby reducing the amount of computational resources needed. This greatly increases Ethereum\u2019s throughput, reducing congestion and lowering transaction fees.\n\nIn essence, ZK-Rollups move computation off-chain and leave only necessary data on-chain, which results in a drastic decrease in gas fees. Importantly, the technology helps retain a high level of security by maintaining a data availability layer on-chain. This ensures that even if the ZK-Rollup layer goes offline, users can still withdraw their funds.\n\nOne of the main advantages of ZK-Rollups over other Layer-2 solutions is that they maintain complete Ethereum compatibility, meaning that developers can leverage their existing knowledge and tools. Additionally, they provide finality, meaning once a transaction is included in a ZK-Rollup, it\u2019s final and can\u2019t be reversed.\n\nOverall, ZK-Rollups are seen as one of the most promising solutions to the scalability issues of Ethereum, offering faster and cheaper transactions while maintaining a high degree of security and decentralization.\n\nThe Top ZK Rollup Projects in 2023\n\nSeveral protocols, such as borrowing and lending protocols and decentralized exchanges (DEXs), have become multi-chain. This means that they support multiple ZK-Rollup based Layer-2s, giving users various choices to lower transaction fees and achieve quicker transaction times and finality.\n\nWe have listed some of the leading projects in the market that use ZK-Rollup technology for scaling.\n\nPolygon\n\nInitially launched in 2017 under the moniker Matic Network, Polygon is the brainchild of Ethereum developers Sandeep Nailwal, Anurag Arjun, Jaynti Kanani, and Mihailo Bjelic.\n\nPolygon capitalizes on ZK-Rollups to enhance scalability, despite conventional ZK-Rollups posing certain limitations such as requiring substantial time. The ingenious application of recursive proofs by Polygon mitigates this challenge. Unlike the average ZK-Rollup-based blockchains that generate proofs for a single transaction at a time, Polygon has the capability to create proofs for each transaction in a batch before dispatching the batch to the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nThe unique structure of Polygon\u2019s ZK-Rollups renders the network swifter and more cost-effective than the majority of other ZK-Rollup scaling remedies, removing the need for validators to possess specialized equipment. Indeed, some proofs on the under-development network, Polygon Zero, are as compact as 45kb, placing significantly less pressure on blockchain performance compared to alternative scaling solutions.\n\nPolygon\u2019s ZK-Rollups diverge from most Layer-2 counterparts in that they\u2019re entirely Ethereum compatible, so developers aren\u2019t required to master new languages to script Polygon smart contracts, unlike with Layer-2 alternatives like StarkNet.\n\nPolygon operates by producing multiple \u201ccommit chains,\u201d somewhat analogous to sidechains, but with a distinct function, drawing a larger proportion of their security from the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nStarkNet/StarkEx\n\nStarkNet and StarkEx are both creations of Starkware, a company established in 2017 by Alessandro Chiesa and Eli Ben-Sasson.\n\nStarkNet stands as another decentralized ZK-Rollup based Layer-2 blockchain. However, unlike Polygon, developers venturing into StarkNet must master the Cairo programming language instead of Solidity, which can potentially complicate the induction of new developers. Nevertheless, to overcome this hurdle, transpilers from Solidity to Cairo and other popular programming languages are under development.\n\nStarkNet, similar to other ZK-Rollup-based chains, packages multiple Layer-2 transactions into a singular Ethereum transaction, enhancing transaction speed while curtailing gas fees.\n\nThe same team that developed StarkNet also created StarkEx, another distinct blockchain. StarkNet facilitates public dApp development, whereas StarkEx serves as a SaaS (software-as-a-service) scalability solution specifically tailored for decentralized crypto exchanges (DEXs), enabling the exchanges to cut costs while elevating speed and liquidity.\n\nStarkEx extends support to ETH, ERC-20 tokens, and tokens on other EVM-compatible chains, as well as the globally popular ERC-721 NFTs. It\u2019s also working on providing off-chain minting support for ERC-1155 semi-fungible dynamic NFTs. StarkEx, having launched on Ethereum since mid-2020, is one of the biggest Layer-2 solutions by TVL (total value locked). It currently powers a wide range of dApps and protocols.\n\nZKSync\n\nThe brains behind ZKSync are Alexandr Vlasov and Alex Gluchowski from Matter Labs, which launched the solution in 2020.\n\nCrafted to deliver high-speed transactions (2,000+ TPS) while maintaining low gas fees and high security, ZKSync is an Ethereum Layer-2 scaling solution. Unlike numerous Layer-2s, ZKSync offers almost instantaneous fund withdrawal to the Ethereum Layer-1 mainnet. It\u2019s worth noting that ZKSync is the only zk-rollup protocol with complete EVM compatibility to date, enabling developers to easily redeploy live smart contracts from Ethereum without the need for rewriting or customizing them for ZKSync. This considerably boosts interoperability and trims down development time.\n\nZKSync bears similarities to StarkNet and StarkEx in certain respects, with the key differentiation lying in the type of proofing protocols used. ZKSync employs SNARKs (Succinct Non-Interactive ARgument of Knowledge), while StarkEx leverages STARKs (Scalable Transparent ARguments of Knowledge).\n\nZK-SNARKs require a one-off setup in which a handful of developers need to be trusted to create code correctly and securely, leading to increased centralization and reduced trustlessness. In contrast, ZK-STARKs use publicly verifiable randomness to establish trustless verifiable systems. STARKs are also perceived to be quantum-resistant, whereas SNARKs are not. STARKs further promise enhanced scalability. Therefore, ZKSync does exhibit some drawbacks in comparison to StarkNet.\n\nSome notable projects deployed on the ZKSync blockchain include Argent, Gitcoin, Yearn Finance, Gnosis Safe, Snapshot, Tally, and the 1inch Network.\n\nImmutable X\n\nImmutable is a platform that offers layer-2 solutions built on Ethereum. It provides developers with APIs and developer tools to facilitate the development of applications on layer-2.\n\nDevelopers can utilize Immutable X to create fast, scalable, and secure applications for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and blockchain games. For instance, game developers can leverage Immutable X to implement sophisticated in-game economies that ensure true ownership of in-game assets. They can also take advantage of features like free minting of game assets, fast and affordable in-game transactions, self-custodial wallets to empower users with ownership of their in-game items, and a global order book for trading in-game items on the open market.\n\nAdditionally, Immutable X caters to token and asset trading platforms by enabling fast, secure, and cost-effective trades between users. It provides a global order book that ensures maximum liquidity. Also, blockchain transaction analysis tools can access Immutable X\u2019s APIs to obtain easily accessible data on past transactions, trades, and user behaviors.\n\nImmutable chose to build its solutions on Ethereum due to its reputation as the most decentralized, secure, and widely-used blockchain, resulting in significant network effects. Ethereum allows the creation and execution of smart contracts and decentralized applications without any downtime, fraud, control, or interference from third parties.\n\nImmutable X offers two execution layers, both utilizing the ZK rollup batching mechanism. ZK roll ups consist of two main components: an off-chain batching mechanism (virtual machine) that generates a compressed cryptographic proof from a batch of transactions, previous state root, and new state root, and an on-chain contract that stores the current state root and verifies the consistency of the batch.\n\nHere\u2019s how ZK rollups work within Immutable X: A collection of Layer 2 transactions is sent to the batching mechanism, which generates a cryptographic proof based on the transactions, previous state root, and new state root. This proof is then sent to the Layer 1 smart contract for verification. The smart contract checks if the previous state root in the proof matches its current state root. If they match, the smart contract updates its current state root to the new state root of the batch.\n\nImmutable currently offers two Layer 2 solutions: StarkEx, which provides a service for batching specific types of transactions created and maintained by Starkware, and Immutable zkEVM, a smart contract platform that allows any developer to write and deploy smart contracts to zkEVM. Developers can access these solutions by signing up or utilizing the API endpoints provided by Immutable X. Immutable zkEVM, specifically designed for games, delivers low-cost, high-throughput, Ethereum-compatible smart contracts within an EVM zk-rollup framework.\n\nLoopring\n\nLoopring is a Layer-2 scaling protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain, specifically designed for decentralized exchanges (DEXs). It enables the settlement of thousands of trades per second while offering various functionalities. In addition to serving as a protocol layer for DEXs, Loopring provides Loopring Exchange, a non-custodial trading platform that facilitates secure and high-speed trades without gas fees.\n\nThe key technology behind Loopring is Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), which are blockchain innovations that bundle transactions together for improved efficiency. By leveraging ZKPs, Loopring enables the development of high-throughput, non-custodial DEXs. The protocol also introduces its native LCR token, which is utilized to reward Zero-Knowledge Rollup (zk-Rollup) operators and liquidity providers.\n\nLoopring\u2019s approach involves implementing Zero-Knowledge Rollups (zk-Rollups), a Layer-2 solution that enhances scalability by working alongside the Ethereum network. zk-Rollups can consolidate numerous transactions into a single, lightweight Zero-Knowledge Proof, which is then confirmed as a batch on the Ethereum network. This substantially increases transactional throughput compared to Ethereum\u2019s standalone capabilities. The zk-Rollup computation process occurs off-chain, while the underlying data and transactions remain on the Ethereum blockchain. By integrating zk-Rollups with DEX protocols, Loopring enables complex computations, leading to reduced transaction fees and significantly improved liquidity.\n\nWhen compared to conventional order book-based centralized exchanges (CEXs), DEXs typically offer lower transaction fees and support for a broader range of digital assets. However, centralized exchanges still outperform DEXs in terms of liquidity and transaction speeds. Loopring aims to bridge this gap by incorporating zk-Rollups, bringing the advantages of centralized exchanges to the decentralized ecosystem.\n\nWithin the Ethereum network, zk-Rollups offer faster and more cost-effective validation of transaction blocks. They involve less data inclusion and only require a smart contract to verify the final cryptographic proof, resulting in improved efficiency. Transactions processed through zk-Rollups are stored on the Ethereum blockchain as call reference data, which requires less computation compared to retrieving data from the network. By combining these functionalities into a single open protocol, Loopring accelerates the adoption of blockchain technology by enhancing efficiency across the entire Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe scalability issues on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain are being met head-on with innovative technologies like ZK-Rollups. As we\u2019ve explored, several prominent projects are already leveraging this technology to improve transaction speed, reduce costs, and ensure security on the Ethereum network.\n\nAs these solutions continue to evolve and mature, they hold the promise of unlocking the full potential of Ethereum, making it more accessible and efficient for users and developers alike. The future of Ethereum, it seems, is bound to be intertwined with the evolution and application of ZK-Rollups."

        "title": "Charles Hoskinson: From Ethereum Co-Founder To Cardano Innovation - The Coin Republic",
        "content": "Charles Hoskinson is an American entrepreneur who studied analytic number theory before moving into cryptography. Hoskinson quit a consulting job in 2013 to begin a project called the Bitcoin Education Project, believing the limited supply of Bitcoin makes it a digital form of gold.\n\nHe joined Ethereum in 2013 as one of the five founders, but he served till 2014, when Buterin and team Ethereum removed him due to some project dispute. The dispute was whether to make the project commercial or a non-profit. Hoskinson\u2019s view supported the commercial idea, while Buterin wished to make the project non-profitable.\n\nBesides Cardano, Other Investments Includes IOHK\n\nIn late 2014, Charles and former Ethereum colleague Jeremy Wood formed IOHK (Input Output Hong Kong). IOHK is an engineering and research company to build cryptocurrencies, and its key project is Cardano.\n\nHoskinson does not look for venture capital because he thinks that it might lead to the outside control of a project. In 2020, Hoskinson spoke at the World Economic Forum in Davos, expressing his views on how blockchain may eventually cause social change.\n\nThe development of Cardano began in 2015 and it was launched in 2017. It was launched with the goal of improving the functionality that Ethereum lacks. It is a proof-of-stake based platform, providing unmatched security and sustainability to decentralized apps and systems. One can send and receive funds instantly with minimal transaction fees.\n\nCardano (ADA) is the most environmentally sustainable blockchain platform as it uses energy saving proof of stake mechanisms, opposed to proof of work mechanisms utilized by Bitcoin and Ethereum. It is a public blockchain platform, providing peer to peer transactions with internal cryptocurrency ADA. It is a smart contract platform that hosts the ADA cryptocurrency, and is looking to create a decentralized application (dApp) development platform.\n\nCardano (ADA) is a decentralized proof of stake blockchain platform and cryptocurrency.\n\nThe popular feature of Cardano is proof of stake consensus protocol which is designed to minimize the energy expenditure.\n\nThe token holders can send and receive ADA instantaneously with minimal transaction fees. The Cardano Computational Layer contains the proof of stake, Ouroboros consensus protocol. The protocol helps to run smart contracts and guarantee security.\n\nCharles Hoskinson\u2019s Future Plans and Vision Regarding Cardano\n\nHoskinson has a wide range of plans regarding Cardano, including the improvement in its functionality. He wishes to establish it as a safer and long lasting blockchain platform. He also focuses on regulatory clarity and building an environment to promote the ADA to be adopted more widely.\n\nHoskinson has emphasized the importance of academic collaboration and how this sets Cardano apart, prioritizing scientific research and peer review development practices. The system is open to review by its peers, giving Cardano reliability that most other coins don\u2019t have. Comparatively, the transactions are cost effective.\n\nCharles Hoskinson\u2019s projects focus on educating people about cryptocurrency, making cryptographic tools easier. This includes Cardano, a third generation cryptocurrency. Its layer two scaling solution known as Hydra will theoretically be able to process 1 Million transactions per second, which is higher than Bitcoin\u2019s 7 TPS and Ethereum\u2019s 12 TPS.\n\nHe said the improvements might help the blockchain\u2019s native token, ADA, outperform Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nRecent Statistics of Cardano\n\nThe market cap of Cardano is $10B. Its volume in 24h is $207M and its circulating supply is 34,955,928,582 ADA. Looking at the 7-day chart, the price of the coin is $0.2826 and volume is $202.43M on 27th June, 2023. This has changed to price $0.2996 and volume of $200.74M on July 4th, 2023.\n\nSource: coinmarketcap\n\nCardano, the open source project is determined to create secure, transparent, and fair transactions. Its proof of stake mechanisms, which is an energy saver, adds unique quality in the coin."
