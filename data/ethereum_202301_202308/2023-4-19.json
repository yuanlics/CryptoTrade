        "title": "Ethereum L2s Are a Bug Masquerading as a Feature - Blockworks",
        "content": "The Ethereum community has been raving about \u201clayer-2\u201d or \u201cL2\u201d solutions for quite some time now. These solutions are marketed as a way to make Ethereum faster, cheaper and more scalable.\n\nBut if you look at what is actually being built and why, you will see that the generally accepted L2 narrative isn\u2019t telling the whole story. What layer-2 technology is actually doing is putting a Band-Aid over some specific issues on Ethereum \u2014 but not actually creating solutions that will solve any of Ethereum\u2019s real problems.\n\nIf there\u2019s one belief at the core of crypto, it\u2019s that incentives matter; the motivations, often financial or reputational, that drive individuals or entities to promote or criticize a certain narrative.\n\nWhat are the incentives motivating the people behind L2s?\n\nThey stand to benefit from L2s being perceived as a feature rather than a bug.\n\nIf layer-2s were widely understood to be a Band-Aid, rather than a fix, this would negatively impact anyone even tangentially involved in the Ethereum space \u2014 and certainly anyone behind these solutions, or anyone who intends to leverage these solutions.\n\nA shift in perception that identifies L2s as an insufficient stopgap measure would likely encourage the community to prioritize finding and developing long-term solutions to Ethereum\u2019s challenges, potentially leading to the emergence of more innovative and sustainable technologies.\n\nWhat Ethereum is doing wrong\n\nThe main problem with Ethereum is that it can be simply too expensive for people to use. Vitalik Buterin has freely admitted this.\n\nWe can actually keep this discussion fairly non-technical. L2s are a solution to a PROBLEM. Something is wrong with Ethereum, and that needs to be fixed. That\u2019s just reality and it is FINE.\n\nThe reason why it is too expensive to use Ethereum is because the network charges gas (essentially, ETH) to use its resources. The more people use the network\u2019s resources, the scarcer those resources become and the higher the cost of those resources in ETH. Of course, the price of ETH can go up as this happens, which obviously creates certain financial incentives. Simply put, high usage and high ETH fees benefit people who already hold ETH.\n\nThe problem then with Ethereum is less about the fact that gas fees exist, but instead that gas fees are TOO high. They\u2019re so high that they are limiting the upside for the people who control the chain.\n\nIf gas fees are high because of limited network resources, then the solution is obvious; Increase network resources. L2s accomplish this by giving users a place to send their transactions instead of the main network (main net) where they can be processed. The results of those transactions can then be broadcast down into the main network, Ethereum.\n\nSimply put \u2014 L2s are a way of NOT using Ethereum. Why, then, is the L2 narrative one of the successful solving of Ethereum\u2019s problems, rather than a critical look at this solution\u2019s temporary nature?\n\nThe dominant approach in the crypto space has been to avoid speaking honestly about both the benefits and the limitations of the technologies we are developing.\n\nInstead, we act as though our existing solutions are perfect. Even though we can acknowledge when they need small improvements, it\u2019s normal to see anyone who says anything more intensely critical as an enemy, someone uninformed who doesn\u2019t know what they are talking about, someone just trying to pump their own bag.\n\nIncentives matter\n\nWhenever you see a very one-sided narrative being put forward, especially when there is a lot of money on the line, this is an indication that something isn\u2019t right. There\u2019s almost always two sides to every story, especially when that story is about a solution to a problem. It\u2019s crucial to approach such narratives with a discerning eye and critically evaluate the motivations behind each side of any argument to develop a well-rounded understanding of the issue at hand.\n\nIn the context of Ethereum and layer-2 solutions, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that different parties have their own incentives to either promote or criticize these technologies.\n\nOn the one hand, there are those who have a vested interest in promoting layer-2s as the ultimate solution to Ethereum\u2019s scalability issues; these individuals are likely to be Ethereum proponents or developers involved in creating and maintaining L2 projects. On the other hand, there are those who stand to gain from criticizing Ethereum and its scaling solutions, such as competitors in the blockchain space or individuals who have invested in rival platforms.\n\nIf L2 solutions were seen as temporary workarounds rather than real solutions, users, developers, and investors might become less inclined to participate in or support layer-2 projects.\n\nAnd while this would obviously hinder the growth and development of L2s, this lack of confidence in the real L2 narrative could actually prompt individuals to seek out alternative solutions, including new blockchain platforms, that offer genuine fixes to scalability and other issues faced by the Ethereum network. In other words, acknowledging the truth would be more beneficial long term to Ethereum than denying it.\n\nThe point here is not that L2s and going off of Ethereum to do your transactions are bad ideas. But if no one talks about what L2s do accurately (and that\u2019s obviously because there are no incentives to do so), then real solutions to Ethereum\u2019s issues will not be found \u2014 because no one will even be looking for them.\n\nAndrew Levine is the CEO of Koinos Group, a team of industry veterans accelerating decentralization through accessible blockchain technology.

        "content": "Ethereum price started a major decline below $2,000 against the US Dollar.

ETH started a fresh decline below the $2,050 and $2,000 support levels, similar to Bitcoin.\n\nEther gained bearish momentum below the $2,000 support. It tested the $1,930 support. A low is formed near $1,933 and the price is now consolidating losses. It is now trading below $2,000 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nImmediate resistance is near the $1,960 zone. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,955 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,125 swing high to the $1,933 low is also just above the trend line.\n\nAn upside break above the trend line resistance might send Ethereum toward $2,000. The next major resistance is near the $2,025 zone or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,125 swing high to the $1,933 low. A close above the $2,025 resistance zone could start a fresh increase.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nIn the stated case, the price could rise toward the $2,125 resistance. Any more gains could send Ether toward the $2,200 resistance in the near term.\n\nMore Losses in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,960 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,930 level. A downside break below the $1,930 support could spark bearish moves.\n\nThe next major support is near the $1,900 zone, below which ether price might decline toward $1,860.

        "title": "Crypto's Ethereum Network Completes Key Software Upgrade Without a Hitch - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Ether rallied past $2,000 for the first time since August after a widely anticipated software upgrade to the most commercially important blockchain went according to plan, and as worries of initial rapid outflows proved unfounded.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThe so-called Shanghai, or Shapella, update enables investors to queue up to withdraw Ether coins they had pledged to help operate the Ethereum network in return for rewards, a process called staking. And so far, 96% of withdrawal volume has been from users withdrawing their rewards instead of their entire stakes, according to researcher Flipside Crypto.\n\nEther jumped as much as 6% to $2,023 on Thursday, taking it to levels not seen since May 2022. Its 68% year-to-date gain still trails Bitcoin\u2019s 84% gain. But there could be some additional upside if the size of withdrawals in the queue \u2014 now two weeks long, according to Rated Network Explorer \u2014 remains muted.\n\n\u201cThis could still be volatile,\u201d said Noelle Acheson, author of the \u201cCrypto Is Macro Now\u201d newsletter. \u201cThere is a queue forming for ETH withdrawals, and the looming sell pressure from Kraken, Celsius and others \u2014 that have to un-stake\u201d but the \u201coverall liquidity situation is favorable for crypto assets.\u201d\n\nCrypto exchange Kraken, which is discontinuing staking products in the US as part of a settlement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, dominated the initial exit queue, based on figures compiled by Rated.\n\nBut overall, the amount of Ether entering the market from Shanghai withdrawals is much lower than what was previously expected, said Grayscale Research analyst Matt Maximo. \u201cThe amount of new ETH being staked is also outpacing the withdrawals, which is creating added buy pressure to offset the withdrawn ETH.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nAbout 1.2 million of Ether tokens \u2014 worth approximately $2.3 billion at current prices \u2014 was expected to be withdrawn over the next five days, according to researcher Coin Metrics. However, that represents just 6% of the roughly $36.7 billion of Ether locked up for staking, data from Staking Rewards shows.\n\nInvestors had been braced for crypto price swings around the upgrade, but so far digital-asset markets have been largely steady.\n\nSmaller coins from applications that try to make it easier to harness Ether staking rewards, such as Lido and Rocket Pool, advanced, according to CoinGecko data. LDO climbed 7.2% and RPL was up 11%, the data showed.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain in September last year transitioned to a proof-of-stake from a proof-of-work approach, a revamp called the Merge that slashed the network\u2019s electricity consumption.\n\nProof-of-stake uses piles of Ether \u2014 placed in special so-called staking wallets \u2014 to help order transactions on the Ethereum network. And with investors now able to withdraw staked funds \u2014 boosting the appeal of an Ether investment \u2014 a debate is stirring over whether Ethereum could someday replace Bitcoin as the world\u2019s largest digital currency.\n\n\u201cEthereum is updating and navigating with great skill \u2014 so far anyway \u2014 and cementing its position as the No. 2 crypto,\u201d said Aaron Brown, a crypto investor who writes for Bloomberg Opinion. The network is \u201cmoving to the future much faster than Bitcoin.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Sidhartha Shukla and Carly Wanna.\n\n(Updates price reactions and adds commentary in fourth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P."

        "title": "Here's how Ethereum's ZK-rollups can become interoperable - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The past few weeks have seen a wave of zero-knowledge proof project launches, including Polygon\u2019s zkEVM and Matter Lab\u2019s zkSync Era on mainnet, and the Linea zkEVM from ConsenSys on testnet.\n\nThey join StarkWare\u2019s long-running StarkEx solution and its decentralized cousin StarkNet along with a variety of other projects in development from Polygon (Miden, Zero, etc.) and Scroll.\n\nThey all promise faster and cheaper transactions to scale Ethereum using zero-knowledge proofs.\n\nBut is the brutal competition between ZK-rollups a zero-sum game where there can be only one winner? Or are we looking at a future in which lots of different rollups are able to work in harmony and interoperably?\n\nAnthony Rose, head of engineering for zkSync, thinks the latter future is much more likely and predicts that one day, no one will think about which ZK-rollup they are on because it\u2019ll all just be infrastructure.\n\n\u201cI think that if we don\u2019t get to that world, then we\u2019ve probably failed,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the same way as somebody using Snapchat or Facebook doesn\u2019t really have to know about TCP/IP or HTTP \u2014 it\u2019s just the plumbing of the way the internet works.\u201d\n\nBut how do we move from a bunch of competing sovereign rollups to an ecosystem of ZK solutions that are interoperable and composable?\n\nPeople are already starting to think about this question, and all of the ZK projects Magazine spoke to have plans to make their projects interoperable with at least some other rollups \u2014 although the extent to which that can happen likely depends on the development of standards and protocols.\n\nAlso read: Attack of the zkEVMs! Crypto\u2019s 10x moment\n\nZero knowledge about ZK-rollups?\n\nIf you\u2019re unfamiliar with the term \u201czero-knowledge proofs\u201d \u2014 which StarkWare insists should be called \u201cvalidity proofs\u201d \u2014 they\u2019re a way to scale Ethereum using cryptography. Rollups take the computation for tens of thousands of transactions off the main blockchain and write a tiny cryptographic proof back to Ethereum that proves the computation was carried out correctly.\n\n\u201cEvery proof we generate covers roughly 20,000 transactions and fits inside a single block of Ethereum,\u201d explains StarkWare co-founder Eli Ben-Sasson.\n\nDespite this increase in transactions per block, zkSync\u2019s Rose doesn\u2019t think Ethereum can come close to scaling up to become the base layer for everything via a single rollup.\n\n\u201cA ZK-rollup on its own will not scale to the world that we\u2019re talking about,\u201d Rose says. \u201cIf we think that applications with some interactions on the blockchain are providing value to hundreds of millions of people, the scalability problem is still there to be solved.\u201d\n\nScaling is a little like internet bandwidth, in that the more you get, the more you realize you need. Back in 2017, Ethereum planned to scale using \u201cEth2\u201d sharding. This roadmap was then ripped up after ZK-rollups emerged in 2018 and promised vastly greater scaling, but only if Ethereum upgraded the blockchain with a different form of sharding (proto danksharding and then danksharding) to enable the ZK-rollups to achieve higher throughput.\n\nEven then, Rose says it\u2019s likely rollups will need to work in collaboration. \u201cThis is a big active area of research for us,\u201d Rose says of interoperability. \u201cAs the systems mature as well\u2026 I think, naturally, this is kind of the pattern that these systems suggest.\u201d\n\nEthereum scaling is some way off\n\nIt\u2019s the early days yet for scaling, however. Although various solutions claim they can theoretically hit tens of thousands of transactions per second (or even talk about \u201cunlimited\u201d scaling), in practice, they\u2019re hamstrung by data availability on Ethereum.\n\nAt present, between them, the various Ethereum scaling solutions and Ethereum are running at about 25 transactions per second (TPS). Ethereum itself has performed an average of about 12 TPS over the past month, Arbitrum One was at 7.2 TPS, Optimism at 2.65 TPS and zkSync at 1.6 TPS, according to ETHTPS.info.\n\nThese numbers move around a bit and are low mostly due to demand rather than capacity. StarkEx is not covered, but StarkWare tells Magazine it averaged 5 TPS over the past month.\n\nDespite supply outweighing demand so far, interoperability between rollups would already be helpful to ensure that users don\u2019t get stuck in walled gardens. Optimistic Rollup users, for example, have to wait a week to withdraw funds, which rather limits interoperability.\n\nZK-rollups don\u2019t have that limitation and can allow instant withdrawals (but don\u2019t).\n\nAlso read: ZK-rollups are \u2018the endgame\u2019 for scaling blockchains: Polygon Miden founder\n\nInteroperable ZK-rollups are possible, but is it probable?\n\nBobbin Threadbare, founder of Polygon Miden, says interoperability between ZK-rollups is certainly technically possible, but \u201cwhether it will happen in practice is a different question.\u201d\n\nHe explains that withdrawals aren\u2019t instant yet because it\u2019s not financially viable to put proofs on Ethereum that frequently, so transactions are fired off roughly every 10 or 20 minutes. As demand and throughput go up, this delay will become quicker and quicker.\n\n\u201cAnd in that case, you get closer, closer and closer to this instant kind of movement between different places,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThe second thing is that different rollups will have to have some kind of incentives to say, \u2018Okay, let\u2019s figure out how we can seamlessly move things from this to that.\u2019\u201d\n\nThreadbare adds, \u201cVery fast interoperability between ZK-rollups is technically possible, but a) People need to agree on standards, and b) They need to actually implement these standards in their systems.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I think that\u2019s a much, much more complicated thing to do.\u201d\n\nInteroperability is not composability\n\nThere\u2019s a difference between \u201cinteroperability\u201d and \u201ccomposability\u201d \u2014 although people often use them interchangeably.\n\nInteroperability is easier and basically involves being able to move funds from one layer-2 (L2) solution to another. \u201cBy this definition, at least all of the rollups which share an L1 today already are interoperable!\u201d notes Optimism co-founder Ben Jones.\n\nArbitrum\u2019s Patrick McCorry also says that for basic interoperability, you can already send an asset from one rollup to another via Ethereum \u2014 it\u2019s just slow.\n\n\u201cOr you could have some off-chain solution, maybe like Hop protocol, where there\u2019s someone in the middle who you give them the assets from StarkWare and then you take the assets to Scroll, and they provide some way to synchronize. So, there\u2019s ways to do that,\u201d he says.\n\nHop Protocol currently allows users to send funds between Ethereum, Polygon, Gnosis, Optimism and Arbitrum, though ZK-rollups aren\u2019t currently supported. Connext offers a similar service, including BNB. A cross-chain DEX and bridge aggregator called Rango already connects StarkNet to other L2s.\n\n\n\nAlso read: Ethereum is eating the world \u2014 \u2018You only need one internet\u2019\n\nDeclan Fox, product lead for the ConsenSys Linea zkEVM, expects support will be added soon. \u201cMany third-party bridge providers will continue to offer interoperability solutions for ZK-rollups,\u201d he says, adding that bridges have drawbacks around trust and fees.\n\n\u201cAt Linea, we value open systems and interoperability highly. The Linea testnet has already integrated many of the leading bridging solutions for this reason. In the future, Linea will be able to trustlessly interoperate with any of the layer 3 off-chain systems deployed on top of the layer 2 through their validating bridges.\u201d\n\n6/16) The case of two users exchanging value within an L1 is simple\n\n\n\nSimply scan the other user's QR code & press send, as long as they are also using ETH\n\n\n\nIn the case of L2s, this is not so simple, as the user now needs to know what L2 their friend is on & how to bridge between \u2014 Justin Bons (@Justin_Bons) April 10, 2023\n\nMetaMask Snaps might help\n\nAnother possibility for interoperability is via the browser wallet MetaMask. ConsenSys is in the midst of developing new crowdsourced wallet extensions called Snaps that projects can develop that extend the capabilities of MetaMask.\n\nMetaMask senior product manager Alex Jupiter says Snaps are still in the testing phase, \u201cbut if we imagine a future where you know Snaps is stable, developers can extend it in all manner of ways. Of course, the next step is to get these different Snaps talking to each other. So, one ZK-rollup can talk to another ZK-rollup, right? And that\u2019s part of the vision of Snaps, and yeah, we want to make that world possible.\u201d\n\nOne Snap that has been demoed already enables MetaMask users to control Bitcoin via their Ethereum wallet, so getting ZK-rollups talking to each other certainly seems achievable.\n\n\u201cWho knows where bridging is gonna go in the future as well. I\u2019m not an expert on ZK-rollups, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a core technical limitation of that being a problem in the future.\u201d\n\nMessari slide highlighting \u201ccomposable rollup ecosystems with shared infrastructure.\u201d\n\nZK-rollups and composability\n\nComposability is the ability to initiate a transaction that involves operations on more than one different rollup. Jones calls it \u201ca stronger form\u201d of interoperability \u201cwhere chains can do more than just communicate asynchronously with each other but actually have transactions, which are aware of the state of each chain in some more \u2018real-time\u2019 manner (think cross-chain flash loans).\u201d\n\nThis is likely to require the development of new standards and protocols, and Rose says that the sooner this happens the better.\n\n\u201cIt is a strictly better user experience if teams can build through an interface, and we can attempt to have more standardization. I think there is appetite for some of this standardization as well, and I do think we will see more of it as these systems mature.\u201d\n\nFox says that \u201cto get to a point where we have synchronous composability, there will need to be a globally sequenced and ordered set of transactions across the different off-chain systems. This is theoretically possible with ZK-rollups thanks to SNARKs [a type of ZK proof] where, for example, a common sequencer could offer a UX of unified execution and pooled liquidity,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cImagine making a DeFi trade where parts of the trade are executed on different chains for optimal liquidity all within the same transaction.\u201d\n\nBase layer advertisement from Coinbase. (Coinbase)\n\nOptimistic about the Superchain\n\nOne potential coordination method might be Optimism\u2019s Superchain concept, which it announced at the same time Coinbase unveiled its base layer-2 fork of Optimism.\n\nOptimism is an Optimistic Rollup, which is another way to scale Ethereum, though more limited in potential throughput. According to the announcement:\n\n\u201cThe Superchain seeks to integrate otherwise siloed L2s into a single interoperable and composable system.\u201d\n\nJones tells Magazine, \u201cThere is no silver bullet,\u201d but there are a couple of requirements for interoperability and composability the Superchain aims to address:\n\nShared Sequencing: \u201cTo have a system where you can do a cross-chain flash loan, at the very least, at the time when that transaction is being processed, it needs to be included in both of the chains reliably. This requires some notion of sequencers being able to communicate, merge or otherwise network together.\u201d\n\nSeparation of Proving and Execution: \u201cDifferent applications have different security requirements, and those security requirements impose different kinds of restrictions on what interoperability properties can be achieved. By de-coupling the computation of chain state from the proving of cross-chain messages, we can maximize the interoperability of applications without fragmenting them to other chains.\u201d\n\nHe says the Superchain can connect optimistic and ZK-rollups as well as other chains, providing a shared, modular \u201cstandard for all these innovations to happen on.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is going to be far easier to make these chains interoperate when they are built on the same codebase, compared to interoperating chains, which were written separately from the ground up,\u201d he says.\n\nHowever, underscoring Threadbare\u2019s point about political issues being more complicated than technical issues, Arbitrum CEO Steven Goldfeder dismissed the concept out of hand.\n\n\u201cThe notion that we\u2019re going to sort of coalesce on one particular technology stack \u2014 a technology stack that\u2019s not even built out today, that doesn\u2019t have the core features that make it a layer 2 or make it a rollup \u2014 the notion that we do that is, I think, a bit presumptuous,\u201d he told The Defiant.\n\nWhy connect ZK-rollups with Optimism?\n\nAnd Arbitrum is built using Optimistic Rollups. It might be even harder to convince ZK-rollups with their higher potential throughput, to coordinate via Optimism. To some it might seem like connecting fiber optic cables together with copper wire.\n\nAll the L2s make this claim though (Coinbase)\n\nHowever, Optimism is laying the groundwork to incorporate ZK proofs (validity proofs) in its systems with the Bedrock upgrade, and the Superchain will take this idea even further. \u201cCompatibility there is the goal,\u201d says Jones.\n\nOther potential coordination methods are the Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol from Cosmos or \u201cmodular blockchain\u201d Celestia (though the latter seems to be trying to replace Ethereum as the data availability layer).\n\nBut ZK-rollups could also connect directly with each other.\n\nPolygon ZK-rollups will be interoperable\n\nPolygon has a variety of flavors of ZK-rollup possible in development. They include Polygon Miden (similar to StarkNet), the Polygon zkEVM (compatible with existing EVM projects), Zero (recursive scaling) and Nightfall (Optimistic Rollups meet zero-knowledge cryptography).\n\nThreadbare says that coordinating internally to hook up Polygon\u2019s ZK solutions is easier than coordinating with outside projects, and he believes the technical challenges are doable. The team is working on the LX-LY bridge to enable this interoperability already.\n\n\u201cBecause we are all part of the same company, then the technical integration becomes much easier to solve,\u201d he says. \u201cMoving between these rollups will be super, super simple.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe friction, it\u2019s not two separate chains or three separate chains. It doesn\u2019t appear like that. It\u2019s just one Polygon that settles on Ethereum. And moving assets or funds or tokens between these different environments is super, super straightforward and easy. That\u2019s the end game.\u201d\n\nEthereum is eating the world. Metaphorically that is.\n\nStarkEx and StarkNet\n\nStarkWare\u2019s Ben-Sasson says they are building similar interoperability between StarkEx and StarkNet.\n\n\u201cYeah, definitely. We\u2019re gonna be porting the StarkEx systems to be layer 3s over at StarkNet, and, at some point, for them to be solutions on top of StarkNet. That\u2019s definitely the plan,\u201d he says.\n\nBack in 2020, StarkWare released a blog laying out its plans for interoperability, but Ben-Sasson says that has been superseded. StarkWare\u2019s Cairo is a Turing-complete language and virtual machine, which makes it similar in capability to a general-purpose computer.\n\n\u201cA good analogy is to think of a layer 2 or a layer 1 as some computer that is just a bit slower than your laptop, but it has a lot of integrity and safety,\u201d he says. \u201cSo, you can start just connecting these computer programs in various ways. Just like today, computers talk to each other and inter-operate or compose.\u201d\n\nTo get computers to talk to each other over the internet, a set of standards like TCP/IP and HTTP were developed. Ben-Sasson agrees that\u2019s the likely path for connecting validity-proof rollups, too.\n\nCointelegraph explainer on STARKs v SNARKs\n\nPerhaps ZK-rollups can connect direct\n\nStarkNet isn\u2019t working on standards like that at present, but Ben-Sasson suggests there may be other paths to interoperability. He says smart contracts can be written to interpret the different types of incompatible proofs used by different rollups. StarkNet uses STARKs as the name suggests; zkSync uses SNARKs, for example, while Polygon Zero uses recursive SNARKs called PLONKs.\n\n\u201cSomeone already wrote on StarkNet a smart contract that allows you to verify a Groth 16 SNARK,\u201d he says.\n\nZKPs might disrupt the design of the blockchain execution layer. Why bother with specialized languages, when you can just submit a proof of any computation in any language? \u2014 Jake Brukhman (@jbrukh) April 15, 2023\n\nThis means the two rollups can communicate directly.\n\n\u201cAs long as you can, in chain one, verify the proofs of chain two, you can start having interoperability. StarkNet is already able to verify STARKs, and now also Groth 16 SNARKs, and I\u2019m pretty sure that very soon, we\u2019ll have things like, you know, PLONKs and Plonky and other kinds of systems.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, at least in StarkNet, it should be relatively straightforward to be able to prove things happened correctly in other chains, and you can start having interoperability.\u201d\n\nFox tells me separately that Linea\u2019s system \u201cis already using the EVM to verify proofs (Groth16, PlonK, etc.) in a smart contract,\u201d which he says can make it interoperable with L3s.\n\nBen-Sasson says it seems likely that StarkNet would be able to connect to different rollups directly.\n\n\u201cYou can do it directly. You can do it because it\u2019s a general-purpose computer and because of the validity rollup nature, right, that you can just have these systems talking to each other.\u201d\n\nSo, it sounds like the future is interoperable and composable.\n\n\u201cYes, it definitely is interoperable and composable. Yes. Definitely.\u201d"

        "content": "P2P.org, a blockchain infrastructure firm, announced on Thursday that it had raised $23 million in a round led by Jump Crypto, Bybit, and Sygnum.\n\nDmitry Argunov, who is based in Cyprus and is P2P.org\u2019s chief product officer, declined to provide the implied valuation of the company, whose parent firm is incorporated in the Cayman Islands. A company spokesperson also declined to make public other participants in the funding round.\n\nP2P.org\u2019s business piggybacks on proof of stake, an increasingly common method blockchains use to secure their network, or prevent bad actors from hijacking a public database to, for example, falsely deduct a user\u2019s funds.\n\nAs opposed to Bitcoin\u2019s proof of work, which requires a large amount of electricity to verify transactions, blockchains like Ethereum require those who\u2019d like to secure the network\u2014the validators\u2014to put in escrow a certain amount of Ether, Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency. For validators, it\u2019s a direct financial incentive to help protect the network.\n\nIn return, validators receive interest on the amount of cryptocurrency they stake, or put into escrow. They also receive rewards for directly validating transactions on the blockchain.\n\nFor a crypto-naive institution that wants to reap the rewards of staking\u2019s high yields, the process can be quite complicated. Anyone who would like to be a validator needs to follow a complicated protocol for depositing cryptocurrency and then offer up a computer to validate the transactions.\n\nThis is where companies like P2P.org come in, which simplify the process for staking on a wide set of protocols, including Ethereum.\n\nInvestors can send companies like P2P.org the amount of cryptocurrency they\u2019d like to stake, and the firm then pools customer funds to stake the cryptocurrency, offering up its own computers to validate transactions. In return, P2P.org takes a cut of the yield.\n\nOriginally proof of work, Ethereum switched to proof of stake in 2022 and recently implemented two upgrades to its staking system in April, separately named Shanghai and Capella.\n\n\u201cThe recent Shanghai upgrade is opening up the possibility for further institutional interest in the direct staking of ETH,\u201d Konstantin Lomashuk, founder of P2P.org, said in a statement.\n\nAs Ethereum, the second-largest blockchain next to Bitcoin, continues to upgrade its proof-of-stake system and the energy-intensive proof-of-work method continues to draw criticism for its environmental impact, companies that facilitate staking, like P2P.org, are positioned to continue attracting both venture and institutional capital.\n\n\u201cThe third iteration of the internet was born with the promise of decentralization and democratization of finance,\u201d Bill Xing, Bybit\u2019s head of financial product, said in a statement. \u201cIt is vital that we fortify the nodes that connect the users of Web3 and harness the power of network effect.\u201d"

        "title": "An Overview of Ethereum Scaling - Unchained - Unchained",
        "content": "Developers have long sought ways to make Ethereum fit for huge numbers of users. Here are the most hopeful scaling solutions.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain can host non-fungible tokens (NFTs), games, decentralized exchanges, and a range of applications. But it doesn\u2019t have the capacity required to simultaneously handle thousands of transactions from all those applications. It\u2019s more comfortable at around 15 transactions per second, far off the pace of, say, credit card networks. Developers have long looked for a way to increase the blockchain\u2019s throughput and reduce network congestion.\n\nThe Problem Realized\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain was designed to be more flexible than Bitcoin. Not only could you send the network\u2019s native currency, ETH, but you could also easily send other stuff, including NFTs.\n\nEthereum\u2019s utility quickly proved problematic, however. In 2017, an early NFT project called CryptoKitties took off. The network struggled to handle all the transactions\u2014it\u2019s not just purchases and trades that get posted on the network, but also smaller transactions such as bids. During high traffic, transaction fees are designed to go up. While some people paid the ballooning levies, many grumbled or were priced out.\n\nEthereum had a clear problem: scalability. If a few thousand people trading digital cats could all but paralyze the blockchain, how was it going to become \u201cthe world\u2019s computer\u201d?\n\nWhat Did Developers Do?\n\nThere were three main courses of action.\n\nFirst, competitors like Solana emerged to develop alternative blockchains that could handle thousands of transactions per second. These blockchains often have their own tradeoffs\u2014Solana, for instance, relied on a small group of \u201cvalidators\u201d to verify transactions, which worked well but at some cost to security\u2014but generally host all the same types of applications as Ethereum.\n\nSecond, Ethereum developers researched network upgrades and scalability solutions. The most promising was sharding, which involves splitting a chain into many smaller chains. Like Bitcoin, Ethereum was originally designed so that every node is responsible for verifying the blockchain\u2019s state. That level of redundancy is hard to scale. Sharding fixes that by removing the requirement that every node participate in validating every transaction. By splitting responsibilities between users, the network can process many more transactions per second.\n\nFinally, many have looked to develop products that could help scale Ethereum by connecting to it.\n\nThe Four Types of Scaling Solutions\n\nThere are four basic categories of scaling solution, each with subcategories:\n\nState channels\n\nOne potential solution is keeping transactions off the main chain via state channels. With state channels, one party puts ether into a sort of escrow account to open the channel, and any transactions are tallied offchain\u2014that is, on a separate network that then submits its results back to the main protocol\u2014before a final transaction closes the channel. Think of it like keeping a restaurant tab where your card is only swiped at the beginning and end. Due to some shortcomings, state channels have fallen out of favor. For one thing, they can require users to commit a lot of capital, decreasing their liquidity.\n\nPlasma\n\nPlasma involves bridging Ethereum via a smart contract to a plasma, or \u201cchild,\u201d chain, where transactions will be executed. While plasma chains can harness some of Ethereum\u2019s underlying security, their setup more or less requires users to trust chain operators not to act maliciously. Though once promising, the idea has also fallen out of favor.\n\nSidechains\n\nThe most popular sidechain is the Polygon proof-of-stake chain. Essentially, you can lock your ETH into place on Ethereum and then mint tokens to represent that value over on Polygon, akin to changing out your dollar bills at the casino in exchange for chips to spend at the blackjack table. While sidechains are like plasma chains, one key difference is that they create their own security. It\u2019s like leaving the safe confines of Ethereum to cross a bridge with a sign that reads: \u201cEnter at your own risk.\u201d\n\nRollups\n\nRollups aren\u2019t to the side of the main blockchain but are instead built right on top of it. Therefore, they are known as layer-2 blockchains. Their main function is to roll up multiple transactions into one, execute them on their chain, and then send back a compressed bit of data to the main chain to show that the transactions have taken place.\n\nThere are two general types of rollups: optimistic rollups and zero-knowledge (zk) rollups. Optimistic rollups save space by assuming transactions are valid. To prevent bad transactions from getting finalized on Ethereum, validators can submit \u201cfraud proofs\u201d that show that the network\u2019s state was incorrectly changed.\n\nZk-rollups, on the other hand, use zero-knowledge cryptography to cut out most of the data that needs to be sent back to the main chain; this reduces the transaction size, abetting scaling. (For more on zero-knowledge proofs, see our explainer on zkEVMs.)\n\nThe Future\n\nSince at least 2021, Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin and others have looked to a combination of network upgrades, sharding, and rollups as a solution to Ethereum\u2019s scaling issues.\n\nEthereum developers are currently reviewing proto-danksharding via EIP-4844. This would allow some \u201cblobs\u201d of information to hitch a ride with blocks, enabling more data to be processed.\n\nMost external interest in scaling is focused on rollups. In March 2023, Polygon, long known for its sidechain, unveiled its zkEVM\u2014a way to make Ethereum more compatible with zk-rollups. In the same month, Coinbase jumped into the layer-2 game by building its own rollup on Optimism\u2019s open-source stack."

In November 2021, CoreWeave secured a $50 million investment from Magnetar Capital.\n\nAccording to CoreWeave, the money will be used to expand its cloud infrastructure for computational workloads such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, visual effects, rendering, batch processing and pixel streaming. The firm\u2019s CEO and co-founder, Michael Intrato, said NVIDIA\u2019s support would help the company continue to scale.\n\nFounded in 2017, CoreWeave uses cloud technology to scale graphics processing unit (GPU) computational resources that the company claims are \u201c35 times faster and 80% less expensive\u201d than competitor solutions. The firm started as an Ethereum miner, utilizing GPUs to verify transactions on the former proof-of-work blockchain.\n\nIn September 2022, Ethereum completed its much-anticipated Merge upgrade, transitioning the network into proof-of-stake from the previous proof-of-work protocol. The move rendered the practice of Ethereum mining and, subsequently, Ethereum mining GPUs obsolete. That said, CoreWeave ceased its Ethereum mining operations long before the Merge was completed.\n\nMagazine: Here\u2019s how Ethereum\u2019s ZK-rollups can become interoperable"

Registrations of .eth domains previously had to be paid for using Ether (ETH) via cryptocurrency wallets, which was cited as a barrier to entry for prospective Web3 users.\n\nMoonPay\u2019s service has been integrated into the ENS website, while the platform also launched version 3 of its user interface to streamline sign-ups. This is aimed at eliminating the need for multiple transaction approvals previously required with cryptocurrency wallets.\n\nA statement from ENS founder Nick Johnson highlighted the service\u2019s focus on making Web3 \u201chuman-readable\u201d to simplify the process of obtaining decentralized digital identities. ENS allows users to map human-readable names like \u201ccointelegraph.eth\u201d to machine-readable information like cryptocurrency addresses and URLs:\n\n\u201cThis allows us to reach those who are either just entering the space or who are not yet comfortable with transacting and would prefer to use the currency and payment form they understand best.\u201d\n\nThe upgrade of ENS\u2019s platform is also touted to expand its usability beyond a primary use-case of creating human-readable names for wallets to replace numerical addresses typically generated by wallet service providers, platforms and blockchain protocols.\n\nENS users can use names to host censorship-resistant websites, which can be linked to conventional domain name service (DNS) addresses already in use.\n\nRelated: State of play: Decentralized domain services reflect on industry progress\n\nMoonPay\u2019s vice president of partnerships, Bree Blazak, highlighted the integration with ENS as a means to create a simple payment experience for new users looking to obtain digital identities or decentralized domains:\n\n\u201cOur partnership with ENS delivers that by making it possible to buy a .eth name with some of the most familiar payment methods available.\u201d\n\nEthereum Name Service hasseen over 2.3 million names created from more than 550,000 unique addresses. As Cointelegraph previously explored, decentralized domain name registrations have been on the rise over the past two years.\n\nBoth ENS and Unstoppable Domains have become leading platforms onboarding new users to the world of Web3 and decentralized identities.

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market has taken somewhat of a beating in the past few hours. Bitcoin\u2019s price dropped to around $29,000, while Ethereum is trading slightly below $2000.\n\nBulls are attempting to defend these pivotal levels, and it\u2019s important to see how things will pan out and whether there\u2019s another crash incoming.\n\nBitcoin Price Drops Toward $30K\n\nThe market was performing relatively well throughout the past 24 hours as prices were recovering from the most recent declines. Bitcoin had reclaimed $30K.\n\nUnfortunately, the past hour has turned out to be quite negative, as the price tumbled toward $29K in less than 15 minutes. Longs comprised the overwhelming majority of the liquidations, so that could be a classic example of a long squeeze.\n\nThat said, BTC tagged $29K to the cent and is currently trading around $29,300, as seen in the chart above.\n\nAlicia Bakery CMO - A really good agency Did you like this market update?\n\nThis is all you need not to miss any price action in the raging crypto markets.

The price is currently hovering near it, and the bulls are fighting to protect it.\n\nAs seen in the heatmap above, all the major cryptocurrencies were caught off guard by this most recent move, and the market is largely painted in red.\n\nSOL lost quite a bit \u2013 around 8.5% of its price. It\u2019s also fairly evident that Bitcoin is boding well compared to the rest of the market.\n\nFor another day, Radix (XRD) remains the best performer. Despite the turmoil, the cryptocurrency is up 10% in the past 24 hours. It lost 9.4% in the past hour, though. Apart from it, all the other altcoins are trading in the red. Arbitrum\u2019s ARB lost 12.6% and is the worst performer during this period.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting to see how the market will pan out in the next 24 hours and whether or not this is just a temporary correction or the beginning of a deeper one."

        "title": "Is Ethereum Better Than Bitcoin? - CoinCodex",
        "content": "Ethereum is better than Bitcoin if you want to use decentralized applications like DEXes and NFT marketplaces. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has a larger market capitalization and is usually seen as a better option if you are looking for a long-term digital store of value.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are by far the two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, so it\u2019s not too surprising that there\u2019s a bit of a rivalry between the most fervent supporters of each project.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll compare Bitcoin and Ethereum from multiple perspectives to help you understand the differences between the two cryptocurrencies and their use cases.\n\nBitcoin vs. Ethereum \u2014 Main differences\n\nSo, how is Ethereum different from Bitcoin? Let\u2019s highlight the main differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum to understand how these two leading cryptocurrencies stack up against each other.\n\nConsensus mechanisms\n\nBoth the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks consist of thousands of nodes that are scattered across the globe. Therefore, nodes need a way for thousands of participants scattered across the globe to reach consensus on which transactions are valid and what the state of everyone\u2019s balances is.\n\nBoth Bitcoin and Ethereum use a special type of ledger called a blockchain to record transactions and user balances. A blockchain consists of a series of \u201cblocks\u201d which contain records of transactions and are \u201cchained\u201d together through cryptography to ensure that the information contained in them cannot be changed retroactively after being added to the blockchain.\n\nBitcoin utilizes a Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism. Participants in Proof-of-Work consensus are called \u201cminers\u201d. In order to add the next block to the blockchain, a miner needs to find the correct \u201cnonce\u201d, which is a random string of characters included in each block.\n\nThe nonce is determined by combining the block\u2019s data and a hashing algorithm. Finding the nonce requires a lot of computing power, and the Bitcoin network consumes substantial amounts of energy as a result.\n\nAt launch, Ethereum also used a Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism which was conceptually very similar to Bitcoin. In 2022, Ethereum switched to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. This drastically reduced the amount of energy consumed by the Ethereum network.\n\nIn a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism, users who want to be validators need to stake a certain amount of cryptocurrency. When it\u2019s time to add a new block to the blockchain, the protocol selects an active validator to perform the task. Meanwhile, other validators attest to the proposed block. Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanisms include rules to penalize validators for malicious behavior.\n\nProgrammability\n\nAnother major difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum is programmability. Bitcoin is designed to function as a peer-to-peer digital currency that\u2019s resistant to censorship attempts and avoids the common pitfalls of other digital currency designs, for example double spending. Bitcoin\u2019s programmability consists of limited scripting capabilities.\n\nMeanwhile, the scope of Ethereum is more ambitious. While ETH can be used in a manner very similar to BTC, Ethereum also provides general-purpose smart contract capabilities. For example, Ethereum can be used to issue custom \u201ctokens\u201d that can also be transacted with on the same blockchain.\n\nEthereum\u2019s programmability has unlocked some unique functionality like decentralized exchanges, lending protocols and NFT marketplaces. For example, the Maker protocol allows users to provide their ETH as collateral to mint DAI, which is a \u201cstablecoin\u201d that tracks the value of the US dollar. Another example is the Uniswap protocol, which allows users to swap between different Ethereum-based tokens trustlessly.\n\nCommon features\n\nNow that we\u2019ve gone through the main differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum, let\u2019s quickly highlight some of the main things they have in common.\n\nBoth utilize a blockchain architecture to keep track of transactions and balances\n\nBoth the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains are fully transparent with all information accessible publicly\n\nBoth allow users to send transactions on a 24/7 basis with no geographical or other restrictions\n\nBoth are permissionless\u2014anyone can set up a node and join the network\n\nUsers interact with each other through addresses, not real-world identities\n\nBoth have irreversible transactions\n\nSupply dynamics\n\nThere\u2019s quite a few differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum when it comes to supply dynamics.\n\nThe Bitcoin protocol specifies that no more than 21 million BTC can ever exist. Currently, there\u2019s about 19.35 million BTC in circulation, and new BTC coins will continue entering circulation until the 21 million BTC limit is reached. This is expected to happen sometime in 2140.\n\nBTC coins are created whenever a miner adds the next block to the Bitcoin blockchain. The Bitcoin protocol issues BTC as a \u201cblock reward\u201d in order to reward the miner. The Bitcoin protocol implements a mechanism called the Bitcoin halving, which triggers approximately every four years. When a Bitcoin halving happens, the block reward is reduced in half.\n\nAt the time of writing, the block reward is 6.25 BTC, and it will be reduced to 3.125 BTC when the next halving happens.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ethereum protocol doesn\u2019t specify a limit for how many ETH coins can exist. Approximately 1,600 ETH is issued every day to reward validators in the network\u2019s Proof-of-Stake consensus system.\n\nHowever, ETH coins are also being burned (permanently removed from circulation) with each transaction. This is because of an upgrade called EIP-1559, which introduced a mechanism in which the base ETH fee paid for each transaction is burned.\n\nTherefore, the fluctuation in the supply of ETH is mostly determined by demand for transactions. Higher transaction demand leads to more ETH being burned, which provides deflationary pressure to the ETH supply.\n\nTo learn more about Ethereum\u2019s supply dynamics, check out our article explaining the Ethereum triple halving.\n\nInvesting options\n\nIn terms of investing, both Bitcoin and Ethereum are generally considered as the two most important cryptocurrencies. In other words, it\u2019s difficult to imagine BTC and ETH performing poorly as investments if cryptocurrency as an asset class continues to grow.\n\nBoth Bitcoin and Ethereum are readily accessible to all types of investors, ranging from retail to institutional investors. In addition, most cryptocurrency exchanges have very low minimums, so it\u2019s possible to get started with very small investments. For example, you can easily buy $100 worth of Bitcoin if you wish to do so.\n\nSo far, institutional investors have been more comfortable with investing in Bitcoin than in Ethereum. For example, we\u2019ve seen quite a few publicly-traded companies invest part of their treasuries into Bitcoin.\n\nThis includes the likes of Tesla, Block, MicroStrategy and Nexon. Meanwhile, we have seen much fewer examples of publicly-traded companies buying and holding Ethereum. One of the reasons for this is simply that Bitcoin has a longer track record than Ethereum, as it was launched in early 2009. Meanwhile the Ethereum mainnet went live in July of 2015.\n\nIn the United States, investors have access to Bitcoin futures ETFs, which makes investing in Bitcoin easily accessible to traditional investors that prefer well-established products like ETFs. There\u2019s currently no Ethereum ETFs in the United States.\n\nIn other markets, for example Europe, it is also possible to find exchange-traded products that provide exposure to Ethereum. For example, CoinShares offers the CoinShares Physical Ethereum ETP, and 21Shares offers the 21Shares Ethereum Staking ETP.\n\nDecentralization\n\nBoth Bitcoin and Ethereum are permissionless, which means that anyone is able to join the networks and help process transactions without requiring any special permissions.\n\nAccording to Bitcoin node data aggregator Bitnodes, there\u2019s about 17,100 active nodes on the Bitcoin network at the time of writing. The location of 61% of nodes is unknown. Among the nodes with known locations, the United States comes in first with a share of about 10%. Germany (7.9%) and France (2.9%) are in second and third place, respectively.\n\nAccording to the Ethereum blockchain tracker Etherscan, there\u2019s about 9,200 active nodes on the Ethereum network at the time of writing this article. 49.3% of active Ethereum nodes are located in the United States, with Germany coming second with a 17.7% share and Japan ranking third with a 2.7% share.\n\nGenerally, both Bitcoin and Ethereum are considered as strongly decentralized networks that are resilient to attempts of censorship and manipulation. However, there\u2019s also a few concerns that are worth highlighting.\n\nThe main criticism regarding Bitcoin\u2019s decentralization is related to the amount of hashrate controlled by the biggest Bitcoin mining pools.\n\nAt the time of writing, the Foundry USA mining pool controls 33.6% of the Bitcoin hashrate, while AntPool controls 22.1%. The third largest pool, F2Pool, has a 14.6% share of the hashrate. So, the three largest Bitcoin mining pools combine for around 70% of the Bitcoin network\u2019s hashrate.\n\nDistribution of Bitcoin hashrate. Image source: BTC.com\n\nAs for Ethereum, the main concern regarding its decentralization has been RPC (Remote Procedure Call) providers, which are typically centralized companies. RPC services allow decentralized applications to access data from the blockchain.\n\nIf many decentralized applications use the same RPC provider, issues with the provider can make it difficult for regular users to access them. For example, the Ethereum ecosystem has been the subject of criticism for its alleged over-reliance on the RPC service provider Infura.\n\nTransaction fees\n\nIn terms of transaction fees, both Bitcoin and Ethereum are not exactly cheap to use. However, Ethereum transaction fees have largely been higher than Bitcoin transaction fees in the past few years.\n\nThis is because Ethereum has been seeing more demand for transactions than Bitcoin. One of the main reasons for this is that there\u2019s simply more to do on Ethereum. While Bitcoin only enables simple peer-to-peer transactions, Ethereum also supports smart contracts and more complex uses like decentralized exchanges and NFTs. The Ethereum network is also used to transact with tokens other than ETH.\n\nSo far in 2023, the typical range for the number of daily transactions on the Ethereum network has been 850,000 on the low end and close to 1.2 million on the high end. In the same period, the Bitcoin network has been processing roughly 230,000 daily transactions on the low end and 420,000 daily transactions on the high end.\n\nBitcoin is currently better than Ethereum in terms of transaction fees, but neither of them are especially impressive in this area. If you want to regularly use Bitcoin or Ethereum but want to pay less in transaction fees, consider exploring the following solutions:\n\nBitcoin: The Lightning Network layer 2 solution provides much cheaper and faster BTC transactions\n\nEthereum: Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism enable much more efficient transactions\n\nLegal status\n\nIn the United States, Bitcoin has the advantage of almost universally being treated as a commodity. This simplifies the process of investing in Bitcoin and selling it in a compliant manner.\n\nEthereum has also generally been viewed as a commodity in the United States, although its designation is not quite as clear as Bitcoin\u2019s. This is because Ethereum was launched through an initial coin offering (ICO) where investors provided funds for Ethereum\u2019s development in exchange for a future allocation of ETH before the Ethereum network itself was released.\n\nSo, there is some controversy about whether Ethereum should be treated as a commodity or as a security. If Ethereum were to be legally designated as a security, it would likely become more complicated to invest in it and offer Ethereum trading services in a compliant manner.\n\nMeanwhile, Satoshi Nakamoto released the Bitcoin software in 2009, and anyone was free to download it and earn BTC coins through crypto mining. Since there was nothing in the process of the release of Bitcoin that could be considered an investment contract, almost nobody views Bitcoin as a security and it is instead considered a commodity.\n\nStill, Bitcoin could be subject to regulatory pressure from another perspective, as the Proof-of-Work system used by the Bitcoin network is often criticized for its high energy consumption.\n\nThe bottom line \u2014 Both Bitcoin and Ethereum are great choices for crypto investors\n\nHopefully, our comparison of Ethereum vs. Bitcoin has helped you understand the differences between the two largest cryptocurrencies. Ethereum is more flexible than Bitcoin when it comes to the use cases it can support, while Bitcoin is more valuable overall and generally seen as a \u201csafer\u201d long-term bet due to its relative simplicity, predictable supply dynamics and longer track record.\n\nIf you are looking to invest in cryptocurrency, both Bitcoin and Ethereum are very solid options. In fact, it\u2019s quite common for crypto investors to have both BTC and ETH in their portfolio."

        "content": "Staked Ether levels have dropped by $1.3 billion over the past week after the blockchain\u2019s upgrade dubbed Shapella enabled withdrawals.\n\nInvestors withdrew 1.36 million Ether valued at around $2.6 billion and deposited only 714,290 Ether worth $1.4 billion in the week after Shapella went live \u2014 a net outflow of 647,050 coins, according to data from TokenUnlocks.\n\nWhile some analysts had anticipated the upgrade would trigger a sell-off after the upgrade led to more tokens in the market, its price has remained relatively stable.\n\nSince the commencement of withdrawals last week, the second-largest cryptocurrency has seen a moderate price increase of approximately 1.5%, currently trading around $1,970.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\n\u201cETH often has more than $10 billion of trading volume on a single day,\u201d Patrick Scott, a crypto analyst, told DL News. \u201cThe outflows are likely less consequential than normal crypto market volatility.\u201d\n\nREAD NOW: Fallen crypto king Do Kwon slapped with fake passport charge in Montenegro\n\nThe withdrawals from Ethereum\u2019s staking contract are likely far from over.\n\nIn order to keep Ethereum secure, the network limits the number of withdrawals that can take place concurrently. This means those who wish to withdraw their Ether must enter a withdrawal queue.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nBased on the amount of Ether currently in line for full withdrawals, those entering the queue now will need to wait over two weeks before receiving their Ether.\n\nData from crypto analytics platform Nansen shows that 741,750 Ether, worth approximately $1.4 billion, is currently queued for full withdrawal. Of this amount, 68% of withdrawals are due to come from Coinbase, Binance and Kraken \u2014 the top three centralised exchanges that stake Ether on behalf of their customers.\n\nAlthough stakers are in the process of withdrawing billions of Ether, the outflows may not be leaving the market altogether.

Staking tokens often trade close to the price of Ether, but they aren\u2019t pegged \u2013 fixed to the price of Ether \u2013 by design.\n\nLido, the leading liquid staking derivative provider, has experienced a surge in the amount of Ether staked via its protocol, with a notable 2.2% increase over the past week. This uptick is equivalent to roughly 120,000 additional Ether worth about $236 million, demonstrating a significant shift in investor sentiment towards liquid staking services.\n\nElsewhere Rocket Pool, the third-biggest liquid staking token provider, registered an inflow of about 7%. Two smaller liquid staking protocols \u2014 ether.fi and Frax Ether \u2014 have also seen gains of about 21% and 14%, respectively, in the same period.\n\nHowever, cbETH, or Coinbase Wrapped Staked ETH, the only liquid staking token issued by a centralised exchange, saw its supply decrease 2.7% in the same period.\n\nIn recent months, liquid staking services have garnered significant popularity, largely due to their ability to allow stakers to employ their staking tokens \u2013 and consequently, the staked Ether by extension \u2013 across various other DeFi protocols.\n\nSeveral DeFi lending protocols including Aave accept these tokens as collateral to issue cryptocurrency loans."

Do you agree?\u201d McHenry asked Gensler.\n\n\u201cActually, all securities are commodities under the Commodity Exchange Act. It\u2019s that we are excluded commodities. But I would agree that a security cannot be also an excluded commodity and an included commodity,\u201d Gensler responded.\n\nMcHenry then asked Gensler to make an assessment, under the laws that exist today, to categorize Ether as either a commodity or a security.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve repeatedly said you\u2019re not going to speak to one, except you\u2019ve spoken to one: Bitcoin. So I\u2019m asking you to speak to the second-largest [cryptocurrency] by market cap here,\u201d McHenry said.\n\nGensler alluded to the \u201cten to twelve thousand\u201d tokens that exist today, seemingly intending to make a point about a group of entrepreneurs that launch a token with the intent of making a profit, but McHenry pressed him to specifically answer the question he posed.\n\nWhen Gensler attempted to avoid giving a direct answer again, saying he did not want to \u201cpre-judge\u201d on the subject, McHenry pointed out that he had in fact done so by bringing 50 enforcement actions against crypto firms.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re finding out as we go, as you file suit, as people get Wells notices, on what is a security in your view, in your agency\u2019s view,\u201d said McHenry.\n\nIn March, The Block reported that Gensler suggested that Proof-of-Stake tokens, a category that Ethereum now falls under, are securities. In his view, the concept of users locking up tokens in a protocol with the anticipation of profit would put those token operators under the purview of the agency."

        "content": "The TON Foundation \u2013 a non-profit association of developers and enthusiasts behind The Open Network (TON) \u2013 has announced the rolling out of a two-way bridge to facilitate the transfer of ERC-20 tokens from Ethereum to natively wrapped fungible tokens (Jettons) on TON.\n\nAccording to the press release shared with CryptoPotato, the bridge is designed to offer a seamless transactional interface between Ethereum and TON. This marks a \u201csignificant milestone\u201d in the evolution of the TON ecosystem.\n\nFirst Unlimited Bridge Goes Live\n\nThe new offering, touted as \u2013 the first unlimited bridge \u2013 will help users to bridge Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC), Tether tokens (USDt), USD Coin (USDC), and Dai (DAI). At launch, users will only be able to bridge over four assets. Going forward, the TON Foundation intends to make more tokens available for bridging soon.\n\nThe foundation has welcomed white hat hackers to test the security integrity of the unlimited bridge through a hackathon in 2022.\n\nThe announcement further revealed that audits from prominent blockchain security firm CertiK, \u0430 smart contract auditor, Quantstamp, a specialist auditor in the blockchain space, and Hexens, a smart contract auditor, were made on the bridge.\n\nWhile validators voted on the formation, CertiK and Quantstamp conducted end-to-end audits on the TON blockchain. Commenting on the development, Justin Hyun, Head of Incubation at TON Foundation, said:\n\n\u201cWe are delighted with the introduction of this two-way bridge, the first unlimited bridge to go live on TON. We anticipate that this bridge will bring a host of new users to the TON ecosystem. By entering into closer proximity with other layer one blockchains through such bridges, our users will experience the advantages that TON holds over its competitors.\u201d\n\nTether Integration\n\nThe latest development comes less than a month after Telegram added a new feature enabling users to send each other the world\u2019s largest stablecoin, Tether, on the Tron blockchain.\n\nThe new feature enabled users to buy, swap, and make P2P trades with TRC20 by expanding the app\u2019s facility for crypto payments. This also allowed users on the instant messaging service to directly send USDT to their peers with no transaction fees."

        "title": "Crypto Price Predictions 2023: Why Bitcoin Price pump to $60k, Ethereum Price will surge past $6k, and Love Hate Inu ... - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "We are currently experiencing market conditions we have not seen since we first started to come out of the pandemic. 2023 has truly been a blessing for the market after it experienced one of its worst periods ever at the back end of 2022.\n\nThe new year began with a bull run and it has been a case of start as you mean to go on for the market as a whole. Sure there have been some blips along the way but generally things have been pointing upward. The emergence of presales as successful as Love Hate Inu (LHINU) and the recovery of traditional giants Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) shows how the growth is really market-wide and indicates this is not a flash in the pan thing and should continue through Q2 and beyond.\n\nThere was a lot of caution preached after the first bull run of the year that it likely wasn\u2019t sustainable and even as Bitcoin and Ethereum continued to grow after the run on traditional banks some experts were still saying the growth would slow due to interest rate hikes. Well, that hasn\u2019t been the case and even though news coming from the feds suggests rates will still not be slashed by Q3 there is still positive buzz around the market.\n\n>>Buy Love Hate Inu Now!<<<\n\nWhy BTC and ETH will not stop pumping\n\nNow even the most skeptical of analysts are starting to change their tone. There has been too much growth market-wide to dismiss it as anything other than real. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are the market\u2019s two biggest currencies so their price movement tends to be mirrored by the market as a whole. It is their continued positive movement that has won over the doubters.\n\nIn the chart above we can see Bitcoin\u2019s growth over the last 3 months. This is the reason many believe it can return to the heights of 2021 and finally break $60,000 again. It has already seen growth of over 55% since the start of the year and that\u2019s even after the disappointment of interest not being slashed as they were predicted to be at the start of the year.\n\nSo imagine what will happen to the price once these rates finally slow and are cut? The price will likely go through the roof! This is on top of the news that has been consistently flowing in from around the world about countries softening their views of Bitcoin and many taking steps toward hiring regulators so as to introduce it to their markets in the future.\n\nWhen we take all the above into consideration and the fact that eventually, inflation rates will have to stop, we think $60,000 might even be a modest marker for Bitcoin in the next few years.\n\n>>>Buy Love Hate Inu Now!<<<\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, Ethereum has been experiencing growth due to events happening within the ecosystem. On April 12th the long-awaited Shanghai upgrade took place. This was the first time ETH holders could finally withdraw the native currency and any rewards they had incurred.\n\nSome experts feared this would plummet the price of ETH due to a mass withdrawal of funds but it looks like it has mostly been the rewards that have been withdrawn. This of course strengthens Ethereum\u2019s position as clearly, their holders believe in the project long-term.\n\nJust looking at the chart above we can see nearly 75% growth in just the last 3 months alone. Just like with Bitcoin, the $6k barrier actually feels like it will be broken by Ethereum a lot sooner than many would have thought a little while ago.\n\nWhile these traditional giants look set to continue to pump the presale of Love Hate Inu (LHINU) is gathering a similar amount of attention, let\u2019s see why!\n\n>>>Buy Love Hate Inu Now!<<<\n\nLove Hate Inu- Meme coin set to break $2 once launched\n\nIt is nearly unheard of that a presale coin would be in the news as much as coins like Ethereum and Bitcoin, but Love Hate Inu (LHINU) is no ordinary coin and it represents the most exciting project on the market right now.\n\n>>>Buy Love Hate Inu Now!<<<\n\nThe presale is still not even two months old and already it has raised over $4.5 million. Why is this the best investment opportunity right now? Well, firstly it\u2019s the very first meme coin/V2E platform meaning it will have the virality of a meme coin and the utility of a staking coin. We think that once launched it will easily pump to $2 and beyond.\n\nOne look at the site now and you will see why experts and influencers can\u2019t dedicate enough words to this crypto. For example, it is showing its future users the kind of polls they will be able to vote on, they have a \u2018do you love or hate celebrity x\u2019 poll currently to view. Each celebrity is represented by a hilarious angel and devil meme version of themselves.\n\n>>Buy Love Hate Inu Now!<<<\n\nThis of course will draw in the influencers but the experts have been drawn in by the very comprehensive white paper. Love Hate Inu is really thinking about the future and security of their project. 90 percent of the total coin allocation will be sold at presale to prevent a dodgy rug pull from happening once the coin goes to its CEX listings, this also ensures only the real LHINU lovers will have a say in any future company decisions.\n\n>>>Buy Love Hate Inu Now!<<<\n\nIf you weren\u2019t sold on Love Hate Inu being the best investment opportunity on the market they also put their user\u2019s experience to the forefront. A stake-2-vote system will be implemented that requires users to stake LHINU for 30 days before they can vote. This in turn ensures a voter\u2019s anonymity which will also be useful in the discussion platform that will be available under polls.\n\nThe more you stake the more control you will have over these polls. Also, in the future, users will be able to suggest and run their own polls. This is to harvest a community vibe and the users will need to put forward their own LHINU to run the poll. There can then be a lively discussion about what polls should go on the site, giving a lot of the power to the users.\n\nThe price of LHINU once launched will be $0.000145 so predicting a growth spurt to $2 is ambitious. However, the market has not seen a meem coin with its capabilities before so we think it will blow the competition out of the market and soar past $2 in the future.\n\n>>>Buy Love Hate Inu Now!<<<\n\nConclusion\n\nIt seems to be good news all around for the crypto market, we have incredibly successful presales like Love Hate Inu ongoing, and traditional giants Bitcoin and Ethereum look set to reach previous highs. Of all 3 Love Hate Inu is by far the best investment opportunity, its room to grow is far bigger than the other two and it can be bought at a rock bottom price meaning investors can stockpile it before it pumps.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Lower BTC vs ETH correlation - Coinbase",
        "content": "Market View\n\nThe correlation between bitcoin and ether returns has been falling since mid-to-late March, around the time BTC started outperforming peers in earnest (against the backdrop of the US banking turmoil and the increased regulatory scrutiny of non-bitcoin digital assets). But the decline of that relationship has become more pronounced in the days following the Shanghai (Shapella) fork, reminiscent of a similar trend observed in September 2022 during the Merge (when Ethereum changed its consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake).\n\nBased on a 40-day rolling window (significant to a 85-90% confidence level), the correlation coefficient between daily bitcoin and ether returns dropped from 0.95 thirty days ago to 0.82 as of April 20, below a 12-month average of 0.90 and the January low of 0.85. (In January, the relationship between these assets was affected by the change in market conditions and technical supply constraints .) Note that the performances between these two digital assets have otherwise maintained a fairly stable and high correlation through 2022 into 2023 outside of the idiosyncratic deviations witnessed in September and January (see chart 1).\n\nChart 1. Correlations between BTC and ETH daily returns across 40d, 60d and 180d rolling windows\n\nThe relevance of this falling correlation for institutional investors is that it can affect quantitative strategies that rely on cross hedging one asset for the other (or using ETH as a hedge for less liquid altcoins). On the other hand, from a fundamental perspective, it supports diversification arguments in favor of holding both BTC and ETH. Following the Merge, a decrease in the observed correlation coefficient between ETH and BTC returns (from 0.95 to 0.75) lasted for around 47-50 days. Comparatively, the current period of attenuation has lasted for around 30 days, and we think it could continue for another two weeks given that the initial phase of ETH withdrawals is still ongoing.\n\nAs of April 20, we project that an additional 73k ETH could be unlocked in partial withdrawals and 822k ETH could be unlocked in full withdrawals (based on what is currently in the exit queue according to Nansen ). This could take around 15 days to process. Given that full withdrawals will begin to dominate the withdrawals queue imminently, the remaining variable is how much of these fully unstaked ETH could make their way back to the deposit queue. For now, we do not have enough data to make a reliable estimate. So far, the ratio of withdrawn principal and rewards to deposits has been 2:1 since the upgrade was activated."

        "content": "Qadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nThe House Financial Services Committee is holding a hearing to perform oversight of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Republicans on the committee have stated that they are dedicated to holding Chair Gensler responsible for his strategy of regulating the digital asset ecosystem through enforcement, his reckless regulatory agenda, and his disregard for the Commission\u2019s capital formation mandate.\n\nWhen questioned about the status of Ethereum as to whether it is a security or commodity. Gensler falters before the house.\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler Gets Grilled On Crypto Regulation In The U.S. House Hearing\n\nIn his opening remarks, Representative Patrick McHenry brought up the commission\u2019s \u201cpunishing\u201d of companies who deal in digital assets through regulation and enforcement without a clear route to compliance. The congressman renewed proposals for legislation that would provide \u201cclear rules of the road\u201d for cryptocurrency.\n\nFurther, to Chairman McHenry\u2019s dismay, the SEC Chair evaded a direct response when Gensler inquired if Ethereum (ETH) was a security or a commodity. The Chair of the House Committee repeatedly questioned Gensler about ETH in particular given the 50 enforcement actions, to which Gensler attempted to respond in a generic manner by saying, \u201cIt depends on the facts of the law.\u201d\n\nGensler\u2019s vague comments were repeatedly highlighted by McHenry, who cited the SEC chair\u2019s desire to classify Bitcoin as a commodity and hinted at earlier, private discussions on ETH before the hearing.\n\n\u201cClearly an asset cannot be both a commodity and a security,\u201d said McHenry. \u201cI\u2019m asking you, sitting in your chair now, to make an assessment under the laws as exist, is Ether a commodity or a security?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have pre-judged on this: you\u2019ve taken 50 enforcement actions. We\u2019re finding out as we go, as you file suit, as people get Wells notices, on what is security in your view, in your agency\u2019s view.\u201d\n\nGensler had previously stated in his pre-hearing testimony that cryptocurrency intermediates were engaging in securities transactions and should register with the SEC. An all-Republican coalition of lawmakers challenged this position in a letter denouncing the SEC\u2019s viewpoints. Regulatory frameworks that are incompatible with the underlying technology and inapplicable to laws governing the issuing of securities, according to the letter, were imposed on crypto businesses by the SEC.\n\nCommunity Reactions\n\nThe crypto community, which has long criticized Gary Gensler\u2019s leadership of the SEC and its policies, has praised the inquiries made by Rep. Patrick McHenry.\n\nSome have said that Gensler ought to be removed from his role as SEC chairman immediately and should be replaced by somebody with more industry knowledge."

Uwerx (WERX) presale token is likewise drawing attention from various types of crypto investors.\n\nUwerx (WERX) ready to rally in 2023\n\nUwerx (WERX) is launching the first decentralized freelance marketplace that aims to improve on existing platforms like Upwork and Fiverr \u2013\u2013 but with the added bonus of paying minimal transaction fees, more robust data and intellectual property protections, and more transparent and immutable recordkeeping practices. Uwerx (WERX) is tapping into the lucrative $1 trillion gig economy.\n\nWhile investing in Ethereum Classic (ETC) or Ethereum (ETH) might be good long-term picks, Uwerx (WERX) presents an infinitely higher upside.\n\nCrypto analysts believe that Uwerx has ensured the Web3-enabled freelance marketplace platform's long-term success by first passing an audit from InterFi Network and Solidproof, and then by locking liquidity on the platform for 25 years after the presale concludes. Additionally, contract ownership will also be renounced before the project is listed on centralized exchanges.\n\nEthereum (ETH) looks promising in 2023\n\nEthereum (ETH) is a decentralized smart contract platform that supports a robust ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps). Investors have been loading up on Ethereum (ETH) at its low rates, in the hope that Ethereum (ETH) can manage to go on a big run in 2023.

Ethereum Classic (ETC) enjoyed all-time highs of $176 at its peak in 2021, but is, as of this writing, trading at the $20-$22 levels.\n\nAccording to analysts, current Ethereum Classic (ETC) price action indicates a decline in the token's usage, with Ethereum Classic (ETC) holders dropping significantly since the 2021 peak. In fact, in January 2023, cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase delisted Ethereum Classic (ETC) on its platform due to low usage.\n\nUwerx (WERX) might see upsurge in 2023\n\nRemote work is no longer just a trend \u2013 it is a reality, along with freelancing. This trend is not going to end as we move to a post-pandemic world. With tens of millions of freelancers expected to join its global ranks, Uwerx (WERX) has all the chances to grow in prominence and value over time.\n\n\n\nPresale: invest.uwerx.network\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/uwerx_network\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/uwerx_network"

In the meantime, the attacker sets one transaction with a high gas fee \u2014 to ensure it is accepted first \u2014 and another transaction with a lower gas fee to ensure it is accepted after the victim's transaction.\n\nThe attacker profits by buying the victim\u2019s token at a price cheaper than market value, then sells it within the same block \u2014 taking in the difference between the revenue from the transaction minus the gas fees.\n\nThe large profits pocketed by jaredfromsubway.eth came from nearly $1.2 million being spent on gas fees between April 18 and 19, according to data shared by Thomas Mattimore, head of platform at the Reserve Protocol.\n\nThe MEV bot operator has spent over $7 million in gas fees across 180,000 transactions, according to Sealaunch.\n\nWhile some are finding the humor in the MEV bot\u2019s domain name and actions, not all are happy.\n\nRelated: Tether blacklists validator address that drained MEV bots for $25M\n\nOne analyst for on-chain analytics firm Glassnode questioned the \u201cvalue\u201d of the work jaredfromsubway.eth is providing to the world.\n\nOther Twitter users went one step further, expressing their hatred and frustration toward the MEV bot operator.\n\nwhen i see jaredfromsubway.eth on the shitcoin i just aped my entire networth into pic.twitter.com/heK4bnbikf \u2014 DRT (@pepeDRT) April 19, 2023\n\nAccording to MEV Blocker, MEV bots have extracted more than $1.38 billion from Ethereum users attempting to trade, provide liquidity and mint NFTs.\n\nSeveral MEV Block projects have been launched in recent months to help protect Ethereum users from sandwich attacks.\n\nMagazine: Magazine: \u2018Account abstraction\u2019 supercharges Ethereum wallets: Dummies guide"

        "title": "A Comparison Of Cardano, Ethereum, And Big Eyes Coin In The Quest For Enhanced Value And Utility - Atalayar EN",
        "content": "In recent months, the cryptocurrency market has experienced a surge of interest, with investors keeping a close eye on market developments during the current bullish run. One cryptocurrency that has been garnering widespread attention is Cardano, a blockchain platform that promises to bring added value to the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. It's worth noting that discussions related to Cardano typically bring up Ethereum and Big Eyes Coin (BIG).\n\nTherefore, this piece aims to provide a comprehensive comparison of the three leading contenders in the crypto industry, namely Cardano, Ethereum, and Big Eyes Coin. Each offers unparalleled value and utility to its diverse user base. We will examine their respective price projections, and updates, and take a quick trip down memory lane to explore their backgrounds.\n\nThe Crypto Dominators\n\nETH: Dominating The NFT Market\n\nEthereum is a decentralized platform that permits the development and deployment of decentralized applications, and it is renowned for its smart contract feature. The platform has become a popular choice for DeFi applications. The most recent upgrade, known as \"Shapella,\" or the Shanghai Upgrade, introduced the ability for users to withdraw their assets and access their cryptocurrencies more efficiently. Improvements were also made to sharding, EVM, and EOF. The main feature of the update is the ability for validator staking withdrawals on the main network.\n\nCardano, The Blockchain Aimed At Empowering Change-Makers\n\nCardano, founded by Charles Hoskinson in 2015, is a blockchain platform that operates on a Proof of Stake consensus mechanism, with a focus on providing a secure and scalable platform for decentralized applications, while bringing DeFi to a wider audience. Although Cardano has faced criticism over delays and network updates, it remains committed to expanding its influence in West Africa.\n\nBig Eyes Coin: Progressing Beyond Meme Recognition\n\nBig Eyes Coin, or BIG, is a cryptocurrency that is growing in popularity due to its innovative features, secure system, and potential in the DeFi ecosystem. It has also gained attention for its meme-inspired platform. Audits by Solidity Finance and verification by CoinSniper have ensured that the platform is secure for investors.\n\nBIG is not just a meme token, but a community-based token that enables investors to participate in decision-making processes. It also has a profitable NFT trading collection available on OpenSea. The presale raised $33.5 million and the ICO period ended on June 3rd, with the promo code END300 offering a 300% reward on all BIG purchases.\n\nA Thorough Comparison Of ADA, ETH, And BIG In The Cryptocurrency Scene\n\nIt's important to note the distinct differences between Cardano, Ethereum, and Big Eyes Coin. While Cardano and Ethereum utilize Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms, Big Eyes Coin uses the innovative Proof-of-Attention (PoA) mechanism, which can make their architecture faster and more efficient. However, Big Eyes Coin's PoA consensus mechanism is unique in that it incentivizes user engagement on the network, promoting security.\n\nETH has a more extensive developer community than ADA or BIG, leading to more projects and applications being developed on the platform. ETH's smart contract functionality is also more advanced, and it has a higher market capitalization.\n\nInvestors are also interested in Cardano's price prediction. ADA has seen significant price growth recently, although it experienced a slight 2.6% dip on Wednesday, trading at $0.39. Meanwhile, ETH dropped 2.53% with a trading price of $1,873.46, after surpassing the barrier at $1,919.27 on Tuesday. The USDT to BIG price is currently at 1891.89, but it is predicted to fall to $BIG 1772.15 by the last day of BIG presale on June 3rd.\n\nA Peak In The Future\n\nAlthough ADA and ETH have been around in the crypto industry for a while, the BIG team and its growing community remain optimistic about their platform's prospects. They recognize the strength of these established players, but they firmly believe that BIG will eventually surpass its competitors and become a dominant force in the market. Their unshakable confidence in the platform's potential reflects their trust in its innovative features and the bright future that awaits it.\n\nAll Things Big Eyes Coin\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL"

The bot has amassed around $700,000 in profits over the past day, and is the second-largest spender in terms of gas fees with over $1.1 million.

        "content": "Over $41 million of ETH long positions have been liquidated as Ethereum prices flash crash from their April peaks, Coinglass data on April 19 reveals.\n\nEthereum Remains Volatile\n\nETH, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, is under immense pressure when writing. Although the uptrend remains, and the coin has generally posted impressive results over the last four months, the price drop today has led to the biggest liquidation of ETH long positions in over one month.\n\nAccording to Coinglass data, ETH long positions were also wrecked on March 22 when over $31 million were forcefully closed. On average, less than $10 million of ETH longs have been closed on other trading days in the last month.\n\nNewsBTC\n\nThe magnitude of long or short liquidation can be used to measure general volatility in the market. Volatility indicates how fast or slow an asset price moves within a given period.\n\nDepending on the general liquidity, asset prices can move at different paces. In crypto, the most liquid assets, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, are usually less volatile than altcoins, for example, those outside the top 50.\n\n$41 Million Of ETH Longs Liquidated\n\nFrom the $41 million ETH longs liquidated, a big chunk is in OKX and Binance. These are some of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchanges that support the derivatives trading of crypto assets.\n\nBy supporting margin, perpetual futures, and other derivatives, OKX and Binance traders can use leverage to trade bigger positions than they would ordinarily be able to. Although leverage can amplify gains, it risks the trader\u2019s account when prices move against their prediction.\n\nThe drop of ETH prices from $2,100 moved against leverage traders in, among other platforms, Binance and OKX, leading to tens of millions of dollars being liquidated. www.tradingview.com/x/gbQIKdue\n\nBy liquidating a position, the exchange forcefully closed the long position and secured the margin since it couldn\u2019t cover the ongoing loss. How quickly a position can be liquidated also depends on the leverage level. Traders with high leverage and trading bigger positions in a volatile market stand a higher risk of having their positions liquidated.\n\nThe sharp spike in ETH long liquidations is less than a week after $54 million of short positions were liquidated on April 14. The number of ETH shorts closed by the exchange was also the largest in over a month. As the trend observed, most of those short positions were from Binance and OKX. There were also more short positions closed on Bybit and Deribit."

        "content": "Today Societe Generale Forge (SocGen Forge) unveiled the EURCV stablecoin (EUR CoinVertible), which is initially being issued on the Ethereum public blockchain with plans for other blockchains as well. This is the first public blockchain stablecoin issued by a subsidiary of a global systemically important bank (G-SIB).\n\nSocGen Forge has been at the cutting edge of blockchain for some time, providing the infrastructure for the first blockchain bond issued by the European Investment Bank (EIB) on Ethereum. Like that bond, the stablecoin uses Forge\u2019s CAST framework for tokenization. It was also the first major commercial bank to launch a public blockchain bond back in 2019.\n\nThe motivation for the issuance includes using it as a robust settlement asset for on-chain transactions. The DLT Pilot Regime is now in force, although no major projects have yet been unveiled. Other client needs that SocGen Forge is targeting include corporate treasury, on-chain liquidity funding and an asset for margin calls.\n\nIn terms of jurisdiction, it is a French regulated digital asset and the company received its digital asset license last year. On the one hand, it has many of the features you\u2019d expect from a conservative regulated institution. Access to the stablecoin is restricted to investors that have been through SocGen KYC and AML procedures. And the backing assets are fully segregated. If SocGen doesn\u2019t want to buy the stablecoins from the holders, they can be redeemed or converted into collateral.\n\nHowever, the collateral is of a lesser quality than the reserves of the USDC or Paxos dollar stablecoins. Collateral supporting the EURCV is cash at a bank with at least the credit rating of SocGen and short term securities with an unsecured credit rating equivalent to SocGen or better. In contrast, USDC and Paxos only invest in bank deposits and Treasuries or Treasury repo.\n\nSocGen Forge plans to have the stablecoin listed on digital asset exchanges.\n\n\u201cDigital assets with stabilisation mechanisms \u2013 i.e. stablecoins \u2013 built under a robust banking-grade structure will be a key element to increase trust and confidence in the native crypto ecosystem,\u201d said Jean-Marc Stenger, CEO of SG-FORGE. \u201cThis issuance is a major step in Societe Generale\u2013FORGE\u2019s roadmap to deliver innovative solutions to its clients, either real-money institutions and corporates or entities of the crypto industry, and to facilitate the emergence of new market infrastructures based on blockchain technology.\u201d\n\nWhite & Case was the legal advisor, Equitis Gestion is the fiduciary, and PwC audited the smart contract.\n\nEarlier this month, Brazilian investment bank BTG Pactual launched a dollar stablecoin."

        "content": "Cryptocurrency investors are always looking for new opportunities to invest in digital currency. With the recent rise in the popularity of presale platforms, it\u2019s important to stay up to date on market trends. In this article, we\u2019ll closely analyze the April 2023 forecast for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the new presale coin Dogetti (DETI) and explore the key factors shaping the cryptocurrency market.\n\nBitcoin Climbing Back Bit By Bit\n\nBitcoin (BTC), as the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation, has been a strong performer so far in 2023, with prices up 68.4% year-to-date. There are several factors that contribute to this, including increased institutional adoption and a shift in Federal Reserve policy, which has helped to boost investor confidence in the digital currency.\n\nLooking at the positive price performance in March, we can see the potential for a bullish pattern to continue in April. Bitcoin reached $29,000 briefly in late March, but dipped back down to $28,477 at the end of the month, still clocking in a 19.2% monthly gain.\n\nEthereal Economics: The Rising Value of Ethereum\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation, has also seen gains in 2023, with prices up 49.2% year-to-date. One key factor driving this growth is the rise of Web3, the next generation of the internet, using decentralisation as a key part of the network. Web3 has the potential to revolutionise the way we use the internet, and Ethereum\u2019s position as a key player in this space makes it an attractive investment opportunity for those interested in the future of digital technology.\n\nEthereum also is looking to perform strongly in April, as Ethereum shot up by 9.7% over the month of March, and finished strongly at a price of $1829.\n\nDogetti: The Rise of a New Meme Coin Kingpin\n\nDogetti (DETI) is a new presale coin that is set to launch in just two months and is attracting a lot of attention from many cryptocurrency investors. The coin\u2019s purpose is to create a strong community where holders are regularly rewarded thanks to a 2% reflection protocol, which means that 2% of every transaction is distributed to all wallets.\n\nDogetti also has a unique feature in the form of DogettiSwap, a decentralised exchange built on the Ethereum blockchain where users can trade ERC20 tokens with a 6% tax fee, which is broken down into 2% redistributed to all wallets, 2% to a charity wallet, and 2% for liquidity.\n\nPredicting the future price of any asset is a daunting task, and cryptocurrencies are no exception. Bitcoin and Ethereum have all experienced significant price fluctuations in the past. These digital assets have proven their potential to disrupt traditional finance and create new opportunities for investors and entrepreneurs.\n\nOverall, the April 2023 cryptocurrency market forecast looks promising for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogetti, with each offering unique opportunities for investors.\n\nPresale: https://dogetti.io/how-to-buy\n\nWebsite: https://dogetti.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/Dogetti\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_Dogetti_\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "How to stake Ethereum and earn ETH rewards (2024 update) - finder.com.au",
        "content": "Following the Merge, Ethereum now uses proof of stake (POS), which allows you to stake your Ether coins (ETH) in return for more ETH.\n\nStaking is designed to make the Ethereum network faster, more scalable and more sustainable. Mining on Ethereum has stopped, leaving staking the only way to earn new ETH. There are both simple and complex ways to participate in staking, each with its own benefits and risks that you need to weigh up.\n\nThis is not an endorsement of cryptocurrency or any specific provider, service or offering. It is not a recommendation to trade or use any services.\n\nWhat is Ethereum staking?\n\nEthereum staking involves validating transactions on the Ethereum network to earn new ETH coins. By locking up a minimum of ETH in a wallet, you gain the ability to confirm whether a transaction conforms to signature requirements and other rules. In return for your work, you get additional ETH coins \u2013 these are called staking rewards.\n\nAnyone can become a validator by staking through dedicated software, through your Ethereum wallet or by joining a staking pool.\n\nThe minimum amount of ETH required to run a validator node alone is 32. Anyone with less than that will want to join a pool or another service that lets you stake small amounts of ETH for rewards. You can find these pools on trading platforms such as Kraken and Binance, or DeFi services like Lido and Rocket Pool. These services usually let you start with 1 ETH or even less.\n\nStaking's goal is to make the network more secure from attacks and more decentralised. Ethereum staking is the only way to create new ETH coins following the Merge, which made energy-intensive mining obsolete.\n\nWhat is the Merge? The Merge refers to the Ethereum network upgrade that went live in September 2022. It implemented the following: The final transition to PoS and elimination of proof-of-work (PoW) mining.\n\nEnabled future scaling upgrades that will increase transaction speed and throughput.\n\nReduced energy consumption by 99.95%.\n\nHow to stake Ethereum\n\nThere are various ways of staking Ethereum. This depends on how much Ether you're willing to deposit and how comfortable you are using the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nYou must stake 32 ETH to become a validator on your own. This means you get to keep the full staking rewards. With anything less than that, you can join a pool like the DeFi protocol Lido or use an exchange like Kraken. This makes staking a lot easier for most people, although the pool will take a cut of your rewards.\n\nEthereum staking through an exchange pool\n\nIf you don't have 32 ETH or want to deposit that much, consider joining a staking pool.\n\nThis is a simpler process than staking alone as the pool and services staking for you typically do the technical work on your behalf. Because these pools provide a service for you, most pools charge either a flat fee or a percentage of your rewards for doing so.\n\nExchange pools operate on exchanges like Binance, Coinbase and Kraken, but some of these may not be available to users in Australia. Joining is a matter of creating an account with an eligible exchange and following the instructions for staking your ETH.\n\nAmount to earn on 1 ETH = $6,173.93450 Choose a rate 7% - Kraken Cryptocurrency Exchange 4.5% - Bitstamp Cryptocurrency Exchange Show all table options Daily earnings $0.00 0 ETH Weekly earnings $0.00 0 ETH Monthly earnings $0.00 0 ETH Yearly earnings $0.00 0 ETH Cryptocurrency prices provided by CoinGecko.

The table and calculator display the annual percentage yield (APY). Rates vary depending on a number of factors like the provider, term length and whether or not the rates are variable or fixed. Keep in mind that cryptocurrency yields fluctuate each day. For a more accurate overview, we've provided an average rate based on data from the past month. Choose a variable or fixed rate. To protect against fluctuations, some providers offer a fixed rate. These rates stay consistent over time and do not fluctuate with the market.\n\nCompare lock-up periods. Some accounts require you to keep your funds locked up for a set period, while others will let you withdraw at any time. Calculate your returns. Use the calculator to project how much you could earn with each provider. Start earning. Once you've made your choice, click on the green \"Earn now\" button to go to the provider's website and create an account or log in.\n\nEthereum staking with a wallet\n\nYou can use any compatible Web3 wallet like MetaMask to stake through a pool like Lido or Rocket Pool. The process only takes a few minutes and has the added benefit of providing you with a Liquid Staking Derivative (LSD).\n\nLSD's are tokens that represent your staked share of ETH and increase in value over time, which reflects your accrued staking rewards. LSDs like stETH (Lido) and rETH (Rocket Pool) can are popular and can be easily sold or used with DeFi apps.\n\nAnother way of staking through a wallet is by using a Ledger hardware wallet. Ledger allows you to stake directly through the Ledger Live software or in conjunction with a Web3 wallet. Using a hardware wallet to stake adds an additional layer of security, and is considered the safest way to store cryptocurrency. Ledger partners with either Lido or Kiln to provide staking services through Ledger Live.\n\nIf you have the full 32 ETH required you can use MyEtherWallet which has partnered with a node-hosting service called Staked. It allows browser and mobile wallet users to stake ETH directly through their wallet as a validator.\n\nLedger Nano X Wallet Trezor Model T Wallet Ledger Nano S Plus Wallet Go to site Go to site Go to site Supported assets 5,500+ Supported assets 9,000+ Supported assets 5,500+ Price (USD) $149 Price (USD) $179 Price (USD) $79 See more of the best crypto wallets Compare wallets\n\nEthereum staking with a validator node\n\nStaking as a validator is complex, but here's a brief overview of a method to help you decide if it's right for you.\n\nEither install staking software on your computer or buy specialised staking hardware. Connect your hardware to the internet. Download and validate Ethereum's blockchain data. Run the execution and consensus client software. Deposit your ETH to the official ETH staking address after verifying it at ethereum.org.\n\nHardware requirements to stake alone\n\nYou need storage space and a stable connection to run the validator software:\n\nStaking requires around 2TB SSD storage drive.\n\nYou need a 24/7 uptime without bandwidth caps to sync and validate without interruptions.\n\n8GB RAM if using Raspberry Pi or 16\u201332GB RAM on a regular computer.\n\nIntel NUC, 7th-gen processor or higher.\n\nHow does Ethereum staking work?\n\nWith Ethereum staking, you secure and add new blocks to the Beacon Chain. You must deposit either 32 ETH to become a full validator or join a staking pool with a lower amount.\n\nYou earn rewards for correctly validating transactions. If you make too many mistakes \u2013 for example, validating conflicting blocks \u2013 you can lose a part of your staked coins through slashing, a process designed to punish poor validators. You might also be booted from the network.\n\nSlashing\n\nSlashing is a penalty designed to punish validators who submit fraudulent transactions to the Ethereum blockchain. If a validator breaks the rules, they will have a portion of their staked 32 ETH removed from their ownership and be booted from the network.\n\nHow much can I earn with Ethereum staking?\n\nAs of September 2022 you can earn around 4% of your invested ETH, paid annually in ETH coins. This rate is dynamic though and will change over time.\n\nYour rate of return depends on the number of ETH staked at any given time across the network. When fewer ETH are validating the network, the reward is higher to provide an incentive for more users to stake their ETH. The more ETH staked at the same time, the lower the reward.\n\nThe dollar value of your return depends on the current price of ETH. If the price of ETH rises, your reward increases even more. But if the price of ETH drops, your reward value drops as well.\n\nWhen do I get my staking rewards?\n\nThe network transfers ETH staking rewards to validators every epoch \u2013 every 384 seconds or roughly 6.5 minutes. The number of coins each validator receives is calculated based on the state of the Ethereum network after an epoch is complete.\n\nYou must be an active validator during the previous epoch to receive a reward, meaning you need to be online and validating the network. You will only be rewarded for the epochs you participate in. Calculations of potential rewards provide only an estimate and you won't know your exact reward amount until you receive it.\n\nBenefits of staking Ethereum\n\nAside from earning ETH rewards, staking is designed for those who want to be part of the community actively building the foundation of the new Ethereum.\n\nYou help the network grow and contribute toward a decentralised world. If this kind of work aligns with your ideology, it might be your main reason to stake.\n\nDrawbacks of staking Ethereum\n\nBefore getting started, weigh potential drawbacks that include the following:\n\nYou must lock up your ETH. You can't access your ETH until the developers make another upgrade after the Merge.\n\nYou can't access your ETH until the developers make another upgrade after the Merge. You can lose ETH. If you're offline for more than 50% of the epoch time or make mistakes, it can cost you. How much you lose depends on your impact on the network. Let's say you and more than two-thirds of validators are offline. You could progressively lose up to 50% of your stake over 21 days. After 21 days, you might be kicked out of the validator pool.\n\nIf you're offline for more than 50% of the epoch time or make mistakes, it can cost you. How much you lose depends on your impact on the network. Let's say you and more than two-thirds of validators are offline. You could progressively lose up to 50% of your stake over 21 days. After 21 days, you might be kicked out of the validator pool. You must keep your address safe. Without your withdrawal address and recovery phrase, you can lose all of your ETH.\n\nWithout your withdrawal address and recovery phrase, you can lose all of your ETH. Value is affected by the market. Because your ETH is locked, if the price of Ether drops, you could lose the value of your cryptocurrency without the ability to sell them off.\n\nBottom line\n\nEthereum staking is the process of locking up a portion of Ether to validate the Ethereum network and earn rewards. You can stake solo with 32 ETH or join a staking pool with a lower amount.\n\nUsing a pool like Lido or Rocket Pool will also provide you with a token which represents your share of staked ETH and rewards. These can be easily sold or used in DeFi applications.\n\nFor added security, consider using a hardware wallet to protect your private keys if you decide to stake through a wallet.\n\nKeep in mind there are various risks involved with staking, such as slashing or smart contract vulnerabilities.\n\nIf the risks feel worth the reward, you'll need to buy some ETH to get started on your staking journey."

        "content": "Zilliqa (ZIL) is one of the most talked about and ranked high among currencies that entered the crypto market in recent months. Xinshu Dong, the Chief Executive Officer of Zilliqa, and his team came up with this brilliant idea in 2017. It was his team of dedicated consultants and blockchain algorithm experts who brought Zilliqa to life.\n\nHere's an analysis of Zilliqa's current details and a future prediction of the Zilliqa price.\n\nLet us begin with a quick overview of Zilliqa.\n\nCryptocurrency Zilliqa Ticker symbol ZIL Price $0.02478 Price change 24h +9.52% Price change 7d -7.55% Market cap $393,441,947 Circulating supply 15,867,699,447 ZIL Trading volume $38,448,228 All-time high $0.2563 All-time low $0.002477 Zilliqa ROI +546.14%\n\nInteresting facts you would want to know about Zilliqa\n\nZilliqa is a blockchain network based on Ethereum founded by Prateek Saxena, Amrit Kumar, and Max Kantelia. It is a platform with many decentralized applications and was initially based on Ethereum before it adopted its protocol. Since ZIL was a new entrant into the investment market around 2018, trading it initially needed to be more stable.\n\nAs the blockchain network grows, Zilliqa coin allows you to trade rates, leading to an exponential increase in miners. Zilliqa is the first public blockchain based on sharding technology. Programming languages such as Scilla implement practical Byzantine fault tolerance, and Sharding can solve the scalability problem arising from its platform's active scaling method. Several transactions can be processed simultaneously with Zilliqa, which makes it a good choice for enterprises.\n\nZIL has added a hybrid consensus mechanism backed by a public blockchain platform with high bandwidth to address accessibility issues. There can be no node operation without Proof of Work (PoS) hashing. A unique feature of Zilliqa is its ability to detect fraudulent or spurious transactions by peers, which allows confirmation blocks to trace previous blocks.\n\nWe use cryptographic techniques based on zero-disclosure evidence and mathematical consistency to cross-check this blockchain-enabled transaction without disclosing any personal information about either party. Therefore, security obstacles should be addressed first. There is no doubt that Zilliqa's Zyro protocol is at the heart of the entire decentralized finance ecosystem, which is about to undergo another launch.\n\nZIL (Zilliqa): Its unique features\n\nThis protocol is known for its liquidity and lightning-fast transaction speeds, which makes it different from other Ethereum-based Decentralised Finance protocols and opens up many mining opportunities. According to their website, they're transforming digital infrastructure across various communities.\n\nTherefore, Zilliqa tokens can be used to implement smart contracts and transfer funds. The company has also developed its smart contract language called Scilla, which developers can use to write safe smart contracts. Many shards make it easy to process many transactions cost-effectively, and silicon-smoothly.\n\nZilliqa price prediction 2023\n\nIt is forecast that Zilliqa's price will trade in the range of $0.0195 in 2023. In the near term, ZIL is expected to reach a high of $0.02 and a low of $0.014. By the end of the year, Zilliqa's price is forecast to be approximately $0.016.\n\nZilliqa coin price prediction 2024\n\nAccording to projections, ZIL will have an average price of $0.025 in 2024. There are expectations that ZIL will reach a high of $0.029 and a low of $0.024. A long-term investment in Zilliqa makes sense for investors who plan to hold the company for the long haul. Investing in dips will enable you to make more than 100% over the next two to three years.\n\nZilliqa price prediction 2025\n\nIn the world of cryptocurrency, there may be miracles and short-term magic. Zilliqa's price is estimated to reach $0.05 by 2025, reflecting its rapid growth. Therefore, it is expected to reach a value of $0.057 by 2025. Cryptocurrencies are always viewed as long-term investments by experts.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile various experts have predicted that Zilliqa (ZIL) will outperform its competitors, Zilliqa has continued to outperform them. Although Zilliqa has set higher benchmarks for itself, the community continues to develop new ones. ZIL's market share in the cryptocurrency market will exceed this platform's expectations since investors have found it to be extremely interactive and intuitive. Zilliqa's token exchange will soon unveil another important launch, supported by a wide range of exchanges. There is no need to exaggerate Zilliqa's rise to $0.0361, even if the same cannot be described as quite buoyant and overstated.\n\nDisclaimer: The information, view and opinions provided in this article are being provided solely for promotional and informational purposes and should not be construed as investment, tax or legal advice."

        "content": "Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology have long been evolving with the inclusion of exclusive and groundbreaking innovations. This evolution started right due to the shortcomings and difficulties faced by the crypto users who utilized the primary crypto token . The initial altcoin (the term used for cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin) to deal with the issues of the chief crypto was . It was developed and launched by Ethereum a few years after.\n\nEthereum: An Introduction\n\nFundamentally, Ethereum is known as a worldwide decentralized software platform that uses blockchain technology. It is usually famous for its local crypto token Ether (ETH). The platform of Ethereum can be utilized to develop any safe digital technology. Its token is structured for payment dealing with the work carried out to support the blockchain. Nonetheless, the members can additionally utilize it for the payment of tangible services and goods if accepted. Ethereum is developed to be decentralized, secure, programmable, and scalable.\n\nOne important aspect of Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies is the concept of a trading pair. With Ethereum, the most common trading pair is ETH USDT or Ether traded against the Tether stablecoin (pegged to the US dollar).\n\nIt is known as a blockchain platform that is preferred by enterprises and developers who are engaged in developing technology to facilitate the industries as well as serve real-world use cases. Ethereum is locally compatible with smart contracts that are categorized as an essential instrument at the back of the decentralized applications (dApps). Several applications related to decentralized finance (DeFi) utilize smart contracts in addition to blockchain technology.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Statistics\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price: $2,009.15 Ethereum (ETH) Rank: 2 Ethereum (ETH) Market Cap: $242,018,190,647 Ethereum (ETH) Trading Volume: $12,792,581,321 Ethereum (ETH) 24h High: $2,022.15 Ethereum (ETH) 24h Low: $1,901.86\n\nA Brief History\n\nThe idea of developing\n\nis credited to Vitalik Buterin. A white paper was published by him about Ethereum back in the year 2014. The platform of Ethereum was introduced a year later by Joe Lubin (the person who founded the blockchain software firm ConsenSys) and Vitalik Buterin in 2015. The Ethereum founders are considered among the earliest to be in knowledge of blockchain technology\u2019s complete potential beyond just offering a secure method for virtual payments.\n\nSince Ethereum\u2019s launch, a great rise has been witnessed in Ether\u2019s market. As a result of this, the ETH token remained successful in getting the 2nd spot after the top crypto Bitcoin in terms of market value. In this way, it is now the top crypto token among the altcoins. Similar to the rest of the digital assets, Ethereum has blockchain technology underlying it. A blockchain contains blocks in a lengthy chain.\n\nThe information kept in each of the blocks is incorporated into each of the latest-developed blocks with exclusive data. Within the network, the blockchain\u2019s identical copy is distributed. A network containing automated programs is responsible for the validation of this blockchain. The respective programs get to a consensus over the legitimacy of the transfer of information. No modifications can be done to the blockchain if the network does not reach a consensus.\n\nThe respective characteristic makes it considerably shielded. An algorithm, usually known as a consensus mechanism, is utilized to reach a consensus. Ethereum network utilizes the proof-of-stake algorithm that enables a group of members known as validators to develop exclusive blocks as well as operate in mutual harmony. In this way, they validate the information contained by them.\n\nThe blocks keep information dealing with the blockchain\u2019s status, a series of attestations (taking into account a validator\u2019s signature), transfers, and so on. It is noteworthy here that Ethereum formally altered its algorithm from the proof of work (PoW) to proof of stake (PoS) back in September last year with its enormous \u201cThe Merge\u201d upgrade. PoW is the power-intensive and expensive consensus mechanism while PoS is the latest, cost-effective, less energy-consuming, and environment-friendly consensus mechanism. The upgraded Ethereum is called Ethereum 2.0.\n\nProof-of-Stake Mechanism\n\nProof-of-stake is different from proof-of-work because it does not need the energy-consuming computing known as mining for the validation of the blocks. On the contrary, it utilizes a finalization protocol named Casper-FFG as well as an algorithm named LMD. These are added into a consensus named Gasper. The respective mechanism is responsible for monitoring the consensus as well as defining how validators are given rewards for their work or get punished for their dishonesty.\n\nSingle validators are required to stake thirty-two ETH tokens to be eligible for validation. People can stake minor\n\namounts, nevertheless, there is a need for them to join a validation pool as well as share the rewards. A validator develops an exclusive block as well as confirms that the information is valid in a procedure known as attestation.\n\nIn this process, the block is broadcasted to the rest of the validators within a committee specified for the verification as well as vote for the validity. On the other hand, the dishonest validators \u2013 who attempt to assault the network \u2013 are penalized as the ETH tokens staked by them are burned. Burning is considered the delivery of crypto assets to a wallet with no keys.\n\nGrand Split in Ethereum\n\nThe split or hard fork of Ethereum is known as a prominent incident in the platform\u2019s history, dividing it into Ethereum Classic and Ethereum. Back in 2016, several network members obtained majority control of the platform\u2019s blockchain. As a consequence of that, they took away ETH assets of above $50M worth. The respective funds were specified for a project named \u201cThe DAO.\u201d Keeping this in view, the majority of the community demanded the return of the stolen assets.\n\nThey wanted this to be done by the invalidation of the present Ethereum blockchain as well as authorizing a blockchain platform with a reviewed history. Nevertheless, a portion of the community intended to keep up with the Ethereum blockchain\u2019s original version. That is how Ethereum\u2019s unmodified version became Ethereum Classic (ETC) following the split. Ethereum Classic\u2019s blockchain still uses the PoW consensus algorithm and several speculations are also being made about the Ethereum mining profitability.\n\nComparison between Ethereum and Bitcoin\n\nA comparison is often drawn between Ethereum and Bitcoin. Though both crypto tokens have several similarities, there are also a few distinctions among them. The developers and founders of Ethereum describe it as the top programmable blockchain of the world as it is an electronic as well as programmable network that supports several applications. On the other hand, the blockchain of Bitcoin has been developed just to support the\n\ntoken.\n\nThe cumulative number of Bitcoin tokens to be entered into circulation is up to 21M. As opposed to this, the number of ETH tokens to be created is unlimited, though the time consumed in processing an ETH block limits the number of tokens to be minted every year. The Ethereum tokens in circulation are above 122M. Another important distinction between them is related to how these networks deal with the transfer processing charges.\n\nThe respective fees are paid on Ethereum by members while carrying out transfers. The charges linked to Bitcoin transfers are engrossed by the wider Bitcoin network. Above all, the consensus mechanisms of both networks are different although formerly both were using the same. Ethereum is now using a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism while\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Prediction: Price History\n\nis still utilizing its original proof-of-work consensus where the miners need to compete with each other for rewards.\n\nWith the past price performance of the crypto assets, the long-term crypto market outlook is clarified. It makes it easy to know more about Bitcoin as well as the altcoin market trends. In the case of Ethereum, the initial transaction on the network was performed back in the year 2015. Since its launch, during the major portion of that year, Ethereum remained under the $1 mark.\n\nNonetheless, in the next year, Ether moved beyond $10 in terms of price when it reached $10.03 for a brief time on the 4th of March in 2016. In the year 2017, Ether gained considerable fame and touched $100 in May. After that, by the year\u2019s end, the crypto token\u2019s value reached $774.69. Then, within 2018\u2019s 1st week, it even reached above the $1000 spot. Following the unprecedented upsurge, the crypto crash (better called the Bitcoin crash) was also experienced by Ether in 2018.\n\nAs a result, a decrease of nearly $100 in price per token was seen by 2018\u2019s end. Following that, between 2019 and 2021, the token again rallied and touched its all-time high price on the 9th of November at approximately $4,815. During 2022\u2019s initial half, the value of the token went through a significant dip. However, several developments have been carried out by the network. The chief characteristics of Ethereum like providing worldwide compatibility for DApps, smart contracts, and other scaling solutions have increased crypto adoption.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Prediction: Price Analysis\n\nAt present, the price of Ethereum is $2,009.15. The fundamental analysis of Ethereum\u2019s price says that it has a 24-hour high of up to $2.022.15 while $1,901.86 is its 24-hour low price level. The current price of the token has increased by 4.94% in the recent 24 hours. The market capitalization of Ethereum stands at $242,018,109,647. The 24-hour trading volume of the crypto token is approximately $12,792,581,321. The circulating supply of Ethereum is almost 120,457,776 ETH tokens while its cumulative supply is nearly 120,457,776.\n\nThe technical analysis of Ether points out that it has an overall bullish sentiment. This has become possible after the Ethereum network\u2019s continuous efforts to exit the bearish momentum that it was experiencing during the previous months. The potential cause behind it was the general crypto downfall and other macroeconomic factors. Since the initial coin offering of Ethereum, the price of ETH has jumped by up to 6,788.06 times in comparison with the US dollar.\n\nOn the other hand, a 105.78 times spike has been seen by the token in comparison with the top crypto Bitcoin. The fear and greed index is placed at 70 showing \u201cGreed.\u201d Apart from that, in the recent thirty days, the token has seen positive price movement in up to 16 days. The token is currently trading at a top point within its trading cycle. Moreover, Ether has a very low inflation rate. The annual inflation rate of Ethereum is almost 0.07% at the moment.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Prediction\n\nThe crypto market trends and the market analysis point out that Ethereum will likely see a great upsurge in its value in the coming time irrespective of the cryptocurrency price volatility. Apart from the retail adoption, the institutional adoption of Ethereum is also expected to have substantial uptake in the future. According to the anticipation, the political factors and the global economic factors will also get gradually favourable for crypto. Furthermore, the regulatory landscape around crypto will also be improved to a great extent.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2023\n\nThe crypto market analysis brings to the front that blockchain technology trends are getting more and more traction around the world. In this respect, Ethereum network scalability will play a significant role in onboarding a lot of exclusive people into the crypto ecosystem. Exclusive innovations like smart contracts in Ethereum are expected to elevate its popularity. Hence, the maximum price of Ether will be up to $2,650 this year. $1,450 will be its minimum price. The crypto token will trade for around $2,050 on average.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2025\n\nEthereum price forecast indicates that the political and economic factors affecting crypto prices will expectedly become supportive for crypto. With the dependence of decentralized finance (DeFi) on Ethereum along with the positive crypto market predictions and trends,\n\nEthereum (ETH Price Prediction 2030\n\nis expected to reach the price level of $6,000 at maximum by 2025. The minimum price of the token will be nearly $4,300. On the other hand, ETH is anticipated to trade at around $5,150 by that year.\n\nThe positive long-term crypto market outlook suggests that the crypto regulatory landscape and its impact on prices will become positive by the year 2030. Furthermore, the crypto market sentiment analysis signifies that a huge proportion of the financial community will be pro-crypto by that time. Apart from that, the institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies will also have an enormous spike.\n\nIn this regard, the Ethereum 2.0 features and benefits will grasp the attention of entrepreneurs. Ethereum price history and trends are presently pointing toward a bullish price momentum to be seen in the next years. It is expected that cryptocurrency investment opportunities will also increase with time.\n\nParticularly, Ethereum adoption and use cases will additionally surge significantly. Therefore, it is projected that the token might reach $15,555 as its maximum price by 2030. The minimum price level of Ether is predicted to be $12,500. Nevertheless, $14,028 will be the average price level of ETH by that year.\n\nCan Ethereum (ETH) Reach $100,000\n\nAt present no sufficient data is available on whether Ethereum will touch $100,000. However, Ether\u2019s price can reach the price level of $40,000 by the year 2040.\n\nFundamentally, Ethereum is known as a worldwide decentralized software platform that uses blockchain technology. It is usually famous for its local crypto token Ether (ETH). The platform of Ethereum can be utilized to develop any safe digital technology. Its token is structured for payment dealing with the work carried out to support the blockchain. Nonetheless, the members can additionally utilize it for the payment of tangible services and goods if accepted. Nowadays there are many ways to earn free Ethereum.

        "title": "Ethereum-Shibarium Bridge: Unlocking New Possibilities for the Shiba Inu Community - CryptoGlobe",
        "content": "Meet the Ethereum-Shibarium Bridge, an upcoming solution that promises to enhance the Shiba Inu ecosystem by providing seamless, secure cross-chain transactions for SHIB users.\n\nThe Shiba Inu ($SHIB) project, a decentralized cryptocurrency initiative, was inspired by the widely-known Shiba Inu dog breed meme and developed as an Ethereum blockchain-based alternative to Dogecoin. The Shiba Inu (SHIB) ecosystem features three distinct tokens, each designed for a specific function.\n\nSHIB, the primary token, serves as a decentralized, community-driven currency that is accessible to millions of users around the world. Launched in late 2020 on the Ethereum blockchain, SHIB has gained international attention and can be used for payments at various locations, either directly or via third-party intermediaries.\n\nBONE, the governance token of the ecosystem, has a total supply of 250 million tokens and allows the Shib Army to engage in decision-making by voting on proposals through the Doggy DAO. BONE also underpins the ecosystem\u2019s proprietary Layer 2 network, Shibarium.\n\nLEASH, with a total supply of 107,646 tokens, rewards the ecosystem\u2019s dedicated supporters by offering exclusive perks and access. LEASH holders have previously enjoyed incentivized BONE rewards for providing liquidity on ShibaSwap, exclusive Shiboshi NFT minting access, and early land sale opportunities in the Shib: The Metaverse project.\n\nShibarium is a Layer 2 blockchain developed to address the limitations of the SHIB token\u2019s host chain, Ethereum, particularly its low speed and high transaction costs.\n\nSHIB influencer Lucie Sasnikova recently explained the workings of the Ethereum-Shibarium Bridge. According to her, the bridge between the two major blockchain networks requires a secure and robust cross-chain solution. Shibarium achieves this through the use of Plasma and PoS security, creating a trustless and bi-directional transaction environment between Shibarium and Ethereum.\n\nThis bridge allows users to transfer tokens between networks without third-party risks or liquidity impacts. It is designed to be fast, cost-effective, and versatile while also serving as a scaling solution. The bridge leverages a dual consensus architecture (Plasma + PoS platform) to prioritize speed and decentralization and enables arbitrary state transitions on sidechains with EVM support.\n\nAs tokens cross the bridge, their circulating supply remains unchanged. When a token leaves the Ethereum network, Shibarium mints an equal number of pegged tokens (1:1). To transfer tokens back to the Ethereum network, they are burned on Shibarium and unlocked on Ethereum during the process.\n\nThe beta test network for Shibarium is named PUPPYNET. As per the blockchain explorer BlockScout, currently (i.e., as of 5:40 p.m. UTC on April 20, the beta version of Shibarium has successfully executed 4,290,709 transactions. Data from this PUPPYNET explorer indicates that the number of wallet addresses utilizing Shibarium beta has reached 13,993,009. Presently, the gas fees are 1.51 Gwei, which is virtually cost-free."

        "title": "What is Optimism: Layer 2 Protocol on Ethereum - Asia Crypto Today",
        "content": "In the ever-evolving world of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, Optimism has emerged as a game-changer in the Ethereum ecosystem. By offering faster transaction speeds and reduced costs, Optimism has quickly gained traction among developers and users alike. In this comprehensive guide, we will explore the origins of Optimism, its core technology, and the impact it has had on the Ethereum network.\n\nWe\u2019ll discuss the revolutionary OP token and its role in governance, the creative potential of Optimist NFTs, and the reasons why developers are increasingly drawn to Optimism\u2019s capabilities. So, whether you\u2019re a developer, crypto enthusiast, or simply curious about the future of blockchain technology, this ultimate guide to Optimism is the perfect starting point for your journey.\n\nBackground\n\nOptimism emerged on the scene in June 2019, and within a few months, they had already set up their testnet. However, it took until January 2021 for an alpha mainnet to be introduced, and it wasn\u2019t until December 2021 that Optimism saw a worldwide release with comprehensive compatibility for Ethereum and its EVM. The company was established in 2019, led by a team of experts including Chief Scientist Benjamin Jones, CEO Jinlan Wang, and Protocol Product Manager Kevin Ho.\n\nWhat is Optimism?\n\nOptimism enhances Ethereum transactions by accelerating their speed and reducing their costs through the implementation of advanced data compression methods on a separate blockchain. The core of Optimism\u2019s scaling strategy lies in its use of optimistic rollups, a technique that consolidates multiple transactions into a single transaction. This is then settled on an alternate blockchain, with the transaction receipts sent back to the primary Ethereum blockchain.\n\nOptimistic rollups are a unique type of rollup that \u2018optimistically\u2019 assumes the validity of all transactions within the rollup. This approach saves time as individual transactions don\u2019t require direct proof of validity. Validators in the rollup have a week to examine the rollup if they suspect it contains fraudulent data.\n\nData from a Dune Analytics dashboard reveals that Optimism slashes Ethereum transaction fees, also known as gas fees, by an impressive 129 times. DeFi platforms like Synthetix and Uniswap have embraced this technology, further showcasing its effectiveness.\n\nHow Do Rollups Work?\n\nOptimistic rollups work by aggregating multiple off-chain transactions into large batches before submitting them to the Ethereum network. This approach allows for the distribution of fixed costs across numerous transactions, effectively lowering the fees for end-users. Additionally, optimistic rollups utilize compression techniques to minimize the data volume posted on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe term \u201crollups\u201d is used because these techniques bundle or roll up data from hundreds of transactions, such as non-fungible token (NFT) mints and token swaps, into a single transaction on the Ethereum mainnet (layer 1). By consolidating so many transactions into one, the blockchain transaction or \u201cgas\u201d fee required is reduced to just one transaction, evenly distributed among all participants.\n\n\u201cOptimistic\u201d rollups get their name from the assumption that transactions are valid until proven otherwise, or \u201cinnocent until proven guilty.\u201d A designated time window allows for the challenging of potentially invalid transactions by presenting a \u201cfraud proof\u201d and executing the transactions\u2019 computations based on available state data. Optimism compensates for the gas necessary to carry out the computation of the fraud proof, ensuring the process remains efficient and transparent.\n\nOP Token\n\nOptimism introduced the OP token on May 31, initially distributing 214 million OP tokens for free (known as an \u201cairdrop\u201d) to 231,000 eligible addresses. This initial distribution represented 5% of the total supply of 4.29 billion tokens, with 95% of the supply remaining to be introduced to the market. The Dune Analytics dashboard provides information on the number of users who claimed the first airdrop.\n\nThe initial airdrop led to some dissatisfaction among the Optimism community as a few users claimed their tokens early and proceeded to sell them off.\n\nHolding OP tokens grants individuals the right to participate in The Optimism Collective, a dual-tier governance system consisting of the Token House and the Citizens\u2019 House. The Token House, which is currently operational, oversees technical decisions related to Optimism, including software updates. The Citizens\u2019 House, on the other hand, is responsible for governing public-goods funding decisions.\n\nOptimist NFTs\n\nOptimist NFTs are fully customizable digital avatars designed to represent your personality and establish your web3 identity. With Optimist NFTs, you can create a distinctive avatar that embodies your unique character and interests.\n\nTo craft your personalized avatar and embark on your web3 journey, visit the avatar builder. Here, you can tailor your avatar to reflect your individual style and interests before minting it for the world to see.\n\nCurrently in its Beta phase, Optimist NFTs are only available for minting by voters in RetroPGF 2. Starting in early 2023, a few hundred active addresses will be invited to mint each month based on their involvement in the Optimism Collective and data logged in the AttestationStation.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in minting Optimist NFTs in the future, follow @OptimismFND on Twitter or explore their documentation to discover products that can help build your reputation on Optimism.\n\nAs the Optimism Collective expands to include the entire crypto community, Optimist NFTs will become widely accessible for minting and customization. In the future, new traits can be unlocked depending on your participation within the Optimism ecosystem and the reputation you\u2019ve gained. During the initial stages of the Optimist NFT rollout, make sure to use the same device on which you minted your NFT to guarantee that your traits are accurately returned.\n\nWhy Developers Like Optimism\n\nOptimism is highly attractive to developers due to its seamless compatibility with the layer 2 network and existing Ethereum applications. The ability to create apps on the layer 2 network and ensure smooth functionality with Ethereum has led to a growing number of users and dApps being developed, all while benefiting from Ethereum\u2019s security. Consequently, the number of Optimism transactions has surged over tenfold in the past year.\n\nHowever, Optimism isn\u2019t competing with Ethereum; rather, it complements Ethereum\u2019s scaling strategy, which is centered around a rollup-centric roadmap. Optimistic rollups, such as those implemented by Optimism and Arbitrum (currently the two largest Layer 2 protocols), are designed to boost Ethereum\u2019s throughput. By processing transactions externally, they reduce the computational burden on the Ethereum mainchain, resulting in a significant increase in speed.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs the blockchain and cryptocurrency landscape evolves, Optimism presents itself as a notable development in the Ethereum ecosystem. As we continue to witness new advancements and adoption, it is essential to stay informed and engaged with the technologies that shape our decentralized future. By understanding platforms like Optimism and their role within the broader context, we can make more informed decisions and better anticipate upcoming trends in the blockchain space."

The protocol is able to resolve over 70,000 transactions per second and is better scalable than other blockchain technologies. There is also the possibility to deploy smart contracts on Solana, which makes it a direct competitor of Ethereum in the DeFi space. The biggest reason for investors to invest in Solana is that it doesn\u2019t have the scalability issues Ethereum has.\n\nBuy Solana on eToro\n\nBinance Coin\n\nBinance Coin is the native token of Binance. The more Binance Coins traders have, the fewer transaction fees they have to pay. Binance \u2018burns\u2019 these tokens every quarter, so they become more valuable over time. Binance Coins are like shares in Binance. Apart from this, Binance has its own blockchain, called the BEP-20 Smart Chain. New cryptocurrencies can be launched on this blockchain. This increases the value of Binance\u2019s BNB tokens as they are the only bridging currency. Analysts expect that BNB coins will continue to rise in price for the time being. For this reason, we recommend investing in Binance Coins.\n\nBuy Binance Coin on eToro\n\nPolkadot\n\nMore and more companies, institutions, and projects are choosing Polkadot. This is one of the reasons it\u2019s going to be a huge success in the coming years. Another reason is the interoperability of the platform. Polkadot uses chains called \u201cparachains\u201d. These chains communicate with the main chain called the \u2018Relay Chain\u2019. A special feature of this technology is that these chains connect to chains of other cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. This is possible thanks to so-called \u2018bridges\u2019. Polkadot\u2019s technology is groundbreaking and holds great promise for the future. None of this would have been possible without the \u2018Substrate\u2019 framework. This makes it possible to develop your own blockchain using advanced technology. All blockchains designed using Substrate can be active on the Polkadot network.\n\nBuy Polkadot on eToro\n\nPolygon\n\nPolygon is another protocol that tries to solve Ethereum\u2019s scalability issue. It tries to do this by using Ethereum-compatible blockchains called para chains. If Polygon succeeds in doing so, it will raise a lot in price, like Ethereum. Polygon Studios is somewhat of a side project of Polygon that focuses on the entertainment and media industry. Polygon Studios has partnered up with eDAO to explore the likes of web3 and NFTs.\n\nBuy Polygon on eToro\n\nCosmos\n\nCosmos is an open-source blockchain project that aims to increase the scalability of other blockchains. It tries to do this whilst staying decentralized. Interoperability is the key to the success of this project and if it succeeds in doing so, investors will be rewarded. Users can deploy dApps on Archway, which is Cosmos\u2019 alternative to Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts.\n\nBuy Cosmos on eToro\n\nFantom\n\nThe Fantom Foundation is building a platform that includes fast, scalable, and distributed DAG-based registers that use aBFT principles to achieve consensus. They are also developing a compiler that can authenticate a virtual machine to run the smart contract. It does this with the Lachesis protocol. Fantom is still quite cheap, so early investors can pick up a lot of coins now at bargain prices.\n\nBuy Fantom on eToro\n\nCardano\n\nCardano is an excellent cryptocurrency investment right now for several reasons. First of all, the Cardano blockchain is very secure due to its decentralized nature. The layered architecture meanwhile ensures enough scalability. This gives Cardano enormous potential for the future. Moreover, the project was only launched after extensive peer-reviewed research. So it has a good scientific basis. Finally, the blockchain is stable and very sustainable, as Cardano is unminable. In short: we have high expectations of Cardano. In the coming years, we will see if this crypto lives up to its potential.\n\nBuy Cardano on eToro\n\nDecentraland\n\nVirtual worlds are on the rise.
