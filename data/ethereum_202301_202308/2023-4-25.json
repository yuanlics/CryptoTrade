        "title": "Cryptocurrency Ethereum has slashed its energy use by 99.99 per cent - New Scientist",
        "content": "An experimental update to Ethereum, the world\u2019s second-biggest cryptocurrency, has led to a dramatic reduction in the energy used to secure the currency and verify transactions\n\nEthereum is the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency SKapl/iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nThe world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum, has successfully slashed its emissions by 99.99 per cent after an unprecedented experiment to ditch power-hungry mining in favour of a new approach, according to researchers. But experts say there is little appetite for such a change among users of bitcoin, the largest digital currency, which has no central body to steer development.\n\nLike bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum used to rely on \u201cproof of work\u201d to secure its network, meaning that computers performed huge numbers of calculations to \u201cmine\u201d new currency and verify transactions. This process uses vast amounts of electricity. But in September 2022, Ethereum switched to a new technique called \u201cproof of stake\u201d during a period of change known as the Merge.\n\nThe Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance (CCAF) has published comprehensive data on bitcoin\u2019s energy use over the past four years and has now released similar data for Ethereum. Alexander Neum\u00fcller at the University of Cambridge, who worked on the project, says the experimental update has been a technological success, achieving a \u201cstaggering\u201d reduction in electricity consumption.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnder the new system, instead of using computer hardware to mine new currency to get a reward, validators lodge money with the network to gain the right to validate transactions and be rewarded. Before the Merge took place, the Ethereum Foundation, a non-profit organisation that oversees the development of Ethereum, estimated that this would cut energy use by 99 per cent, but the results of the switch were unpredictable, as nothing on the same scale had been attempted before.\n\nEthereum had, like bitcoin, been using more energy each year since its launch in 2015. According to CCAF\u2019s data, it used 16.4 terrawatt hours in 2021. By 14 September 2022 \u2013 the day before the Merge \u2013 it had already used 17.6TWh, and was on course to end the year at 21.4TWh.\n\nThe CCAF now estimates that Ethereum will consume just 6.6 gigawatt hours of electricity annually, equivalent to about 2000 typical homes in the UK. In contrast, Ethereum\u2019s previous consumption from its launch to the Merge totalled 58.3 TWh \u2013 comparable to Switzerland\u2019s annual electricity consumption.\n\nSign up to our The Daily newsletter The latest science news delivered to your inbox, every day. Sign up to newsletter\n\nNeum\u00fcller says success was far from guaranteed due to the scale of the challenge. \u201cAn often-used anecdote in that regard was changing a jet engine during flight,\u201d he says. \u201cIt has been executed very well. No one knew exactly what was going to happen.\u201d\n\nSome analysis has suggested that although Ethereum\u2019s power consumption has dropped, the hardware that used to account for it is now being used for other purposes. Kyle McDonald, who carried out his own research on the energy use of the Ethereum network before the Merge, says large numbers of disgruntled miners who were left with hugely expensive, specialised hardware and no source of income decided to continue harvesting other coins.\n\nBut Neum\u00fcller says not all miners switched and there is evidence that many sold off their hardware. His research looked at the other cryptocurrencies that miners could have profitably switched to and calculated that, between 8 September 2022 and 4 March 2023, nearly 80 per cent of the computational power used for mining had simply disappeared, as miners gave up and sold their hardware.\n\nDespite the success of Ethereum\u2019s switch, Neum\u00fcller says that the bitcoin network is too attached to its current proof-of-work approach to follow suit.\n\nEthan Vera, co-founder of cryptocurrency firm Luxor Mining, also believes that a similar change in bitcoin is unlikely. \u201cProof of work is fundamental to bitcoin. The use of energy is critical to its security mechanism,\u201d he says."

        "title": "Ethereum's post-Merge energy usage shows how blockchain tech can align with national sustainability goals - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "The Ethereum blockchain's energy usage initially plummeted more than 99 per cent last year after a change to its architecture, a new report confirms, showing how a new token minting and validation process better aligns with sustainability goals two years after China's crackdown on crypto mining.\n\nFollowing a change from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) for creating new ether last September, power demand on the network cratered to 235 kilowatts from 2.44 gigawatts, according to the latest Cambridge Blockchain Network Sustainability Index released on Wednesday. Amid rising usage of the network, energy consumption reached 420,000 kilowatt hours in March, the index shows.\n\nIn its report on the index, the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance (CCAF) also notes that ether mining appeared to be of much less interest in China than bitcoin prior to the change. During Beijing's crackdown on mining activity in May 2021, the bitcoin network's hash rate, the measure of the network's computational power, was \"far more severely\" affected than Ethereum's, with each falling 71.1 per cent and 25.5 per cent, respectively.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

This chart shows consumption on the Beacon Chain, a proof-of-stake blockchain that merged with the main Ethereum chain in September 2022. Chart: SCMP>\n\nChina was once the world's largest cryptocurrency mining hub owing to its relatively cheap electricity, despite the digital assets being banned in the mainland. The crackdown two years ago briefly pushed measurable bitcoin mining activity in the country to near zero, although later data suggested much of that activity had largely moved underground.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe success of Ethereum's change in reducing energy usage shows how PoS blockchains can better align with green energy goals, which China has championed with a promise to reach peak carbon emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060.\n\nConcerns about the energy usage of cryptocurrency mining were widely seen as a potential factor in Beijing's crackdown.\n\nPoW blockchains like bitcoin's are so energy intensive because the process requires hashing, or solving increasingly complex math problems, to add new tokens to the network and verify transactions. With PoS, users \"stake\" their own tokens, or put up a specified amount as collateral, to verify transactions.\n\nEther's switch to PoS was teased for years before the stakeholders pushing the change were able to make it stick. The network went through multiple technical changes before the so-called Merge last year, according to the report.\n\nBitcoin's monthly energy consumption has remained consistently high. Chart: SCMP alt=Bitcoin's monthly energy consumption has remained consistently high. Chart: SCMP>\n\nUntil the Merge, Ethereum's entire electricity consumption of 58.3 terawatt hours was more than Switzerland's average annual energy usage of 54.9 terawatt hours, according to the CCAF.\n\nEther is now estimated to consume 6.56 gigawatt hours of electricity annually, comparable to that of iconic structures such as the Eiffel Tower or the British Museum, the CCAF said.\n\nWhile the energy usage of Ethereum has climbed over the past several months, the CCAF said that is to be expected as more nodes and validators are added to the network. It is also still a far cry from what it used to consume and what the bitcoin network still consumes, which was 10.3 terawatt hours last month alone, more than 1,500 times Ethereum's annual consumption.\n\nThe bitcoin network's annual energy usage of 132.2 terawatt hours could power the entire country of Norway, according to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index.\n\nAmid a bitcoin price rally of about 75 per cent this year, the energy-intensive token remains the gold standard in cryptocurrency. However, governments are increasingly trying to balance innovation and sustainability goals regarding digital assets.\n\nBeijing has embraced blockchain technology and is promoting its development in the mainland. But with cryptocurrency illegal there, many projects focus on other uses of distributed ledger technologies.\n\nMeanwhile, Hong Kong's bid to become a regional virtual asset hub has received a nod of approval from mainland officials. A new licensing scheme in the city that goes into effect in June officially sanctions retail investor participation in the market for the first time.\n\nHong Kong's pro-digital asset stance has led some in the industry to speculate that it could be used as an experimental zone for crypto development in China. Some exchanges with ties to the mainland that fled during earlier crackdowns are looking to get licensed in Hong Kong.\n\nHowever, Hong Kong will also have to balance its Web3 initiatives with its own sustainability goals. The city has pledged to become carbon neutral by 2050, and it aims to become a green technology and finance centre with new initiatives set forth in this year's budget.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "title": "Is Ethereum More Decentralized After The Merge? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "It might come as a surprise, but Ethereum (ETH -0.21%) made its noteworthy switch from proof of work to proof of stake more than six months ago. Referred to as The Merge, this transition looks like a distant memory as attention has been focused on the fact that Ethereum is in the midst of an impressive rally to start off 2023 and is up more than 50% so far this year.\n\nAlthough Ethereum might be having a much better year than in 2022, it's probably time to check in on how this whole proof-of-stake thing is doing.\n\nEthereum before The Merge\n\nThe switch from proof of work caused some to believe Ethereum was becoming more centralized. This topic is highly controversial and is an extremely abstract concept, but its important to take into consideration since one of the primary use cases of investing in cryptocurrencies is their premise as an alternative to existing centralized systems.\n\nBefore The Merge, it was relatively easy to measure Ethereum's decentralization and security through the use of a metric called hash rate. Exclusive to proof-of-work blockchains such as Bitcoin, hash rate essentially quantifies computing power which serves as a proxy for decentralization and security. While using proof of work, Ethereum had the second-highest hash rate of all cryptocurrencies.\n\nBut now that it uses proof of stake and we can't use hash rate, gauging whether Ethereum is more or less decentralized and secure can be a little complicated. But let's give it a shot.\n\nThe post-Merge era\n\nThere are a plethora of new functionalities that accompanied The Merge, but likely the most significant was the replacement of miners with validators and the ability for holders to stake their funds.\n\nWithout the need for miners, Ethereum's network is secured by these validators, who earn the chance to verify blocks by \"staking,\" or essentially locking up their funds to the network. Therefore Ethereum's decentralization and security are derived from three factors -- the number of validators, the distribution of staked funds among these validators, and the percentage of Ethereum staked relative to its total supply.\n\nLet's start with the number of validators. Since The Merge, this number has been increasing at a steady rate. Today, it sits at just over 600,000. Not only has it been steadily increasing, but in the last month, the rate of new validators has skyrocketed, and this could be an encouraging sign that the network is growing in decentralization.\n\nThe validator dilemma\n\nTo become a validator, you must pledge 32 ether to the network. That's a lot of money (more than $58,000 at today's prices), but there is a way around it. Those with the technical know-how and resources to set up the equipment can pool together money from other holders and reach the 32 coin limit. Known as staking pools, this option allows anyone to participate in staking, but it has also created a lucrative business model for some centralized players.\n\nData show that four validators control roughly 53% of the total amount of staked Ethereum. Three of these validators are centralized companies that provide staking products to customers, such as Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance, and they collectively have 23% of all staked Ether. But the fourth is a decentralized staking protocol known as Lido, and it alone has 30% of the total amount of staked Ethereum.\n\nIn an ideal world, there would be a large number of staking pools with an equal distribution of ether staked. Unfortunately, this isn't quite the case. Thankfully, these centralized companies don't control nearly as much as Lido, which claims to be decentralized, but this concentration of staked ether among just a few participants is something to keep in mind.\n\nLackluster staking ratio\n\nThe last factor to consider in Ethereum's new journey as a proof-of-stake blockchain is the amount of ether staked relative to its total circulating supply. This ratio is crucial to evaluate because the greater the number of ether staked, the more secure and decentralized the network becomes.\n\nUnfortunately, Ethereum still lags in this area. Today almost 15% of the total ether supply is staked. Compared to other proof-of-stake blockchains like Cardano, Solana, and Avalanche, which all are above 60%, it becomes clear Ethereum has some work to do.\n\nMaking sense of these numbers\n\nBased on these three metrics, it could be surmised that Ethereum's network is still going through some growing pains. While the number of validators is rising steadily, the total number of ether staked among a few participants and the small ratio of ether staked relative to the total supply is a little concerning.\n\nDespite this, Ethereum is still one of the top blockchains in the world. It boasts a plethora of use cases in decentralized finance and has long-term potential. It looks like it just needs some more time to mature as a proof-of-stake blockchain to return to the levels of decentralization and security it had before The Merge."

        "title": "What Are Smart Accounts on Ethereum? - Coinspeaker",
        "content": "Let\u2019s get to know more about one of the developments iterated to enhance the usability of the Ethereum network and foster its wider adoption \u2013 Smart Accounts on Ethereum.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is a decentralized blockchain network that has undergone significant changes over time, such as the switch from proof of work to proof of stake consensus mechanism. The Ethereum 2.0 upgrade is a major milestone in this transition, but it is still a work in progress. Despite this, other important improvements have been made, with the potential to enhance the usability of the network and drive user adoption.\n\nOne such improvement is the deployment of smart accounts on the Ethereum blockchain. Smart accounts are a type of accounts that can be controlled by programmable smart contracts rather than private keys, allowing for more advanced functionality and automated management of assets and transactions. This can include multi-signature authorization, time-based unlocking, and threshold-based transaction limits, as well as the implementation of complex business logic and security measures.\n\nSmart Accounts Defined\n\nAs said above, smart accounts are a type of account on the Ethereum blockchain that can be controlled by programmable smart contracts rather than private keys. This means that the functionality of the account can be customized and automated using code, rather than relying solely on manual intervention from the account holder.\n\nSmart accounts offer a range of advanced features, such as multi-signature authorization, time-based unlocking, and threshold-based transaction limits. They also enable the implementation of more complex business logic and security measures, such as payment plans and revenue-sharing arrangements that can be enforced automatically without the need for third-party intermediaries.\n\nAccount Abstraction Explained\n\nAccount abstraction is an emerging standard in the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem that allows the transformation of a regular wallet into a smart contract account. It was previously known as ERC-4337, but the standard was not officially adopted. The feature has already been deployed on a smart contract, and it is expected to be supported by several Ethereum infrastructure providers in the future.\n\nAccount abstraction is a significant development that could greatly enhance the usability of wallets and improve the security of user accounts. By transforming a wallet into a smart contract account, the feature provides more advanced functionality, including multi-signature authorization and time-based unlocking, which can help prevent the loss of private keys and secure user accounts.\n\nAnother important aspect of account abstraction is its compatibility with other EVM-compatible blockchains, including Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Polygon (MATIC), and Avalanche (AVAX). This means that the feature can be used across multiple blockchain networks, enabling greater interoperability and flexibility for users.\n\nWhile it was initially expected to take until 2024 for account abstraction to be deployed, the feature has already undergone a full security audit and is now available for use. It may take some more time for the feature to become widely adopted, but its potential impact on improving the security and usability of wallets makes it an exciting development for the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nLaunch of Smart Accounts\n\nSmart accounts were not launched as a single event, but rather as a gradual evolution of the capabilities of the Ethereum blockchain. As the Ethereum ecosystem has grown and matured, developers and businesses have increasingly turned to smart contracts to create more sophisticated and secure financial applications on the blockchain.\n\nWhile smart accounts are not a distinct product or service that can be launched, several developments have contributed to their emergence as a powerful tool for creating more advanced financial applications on the Ethereum blockchain. These include the introduction of the ERC-20 standard for creating fungible tokens, the development of more advanced programming languages such as Solidity and Vyper for writing smart contracts, and the emergence of infrastructure providers and tooling to support the development of decentralized applications on the Ethereum network.\n\nMoreover, the emergence of account abstraction that allows wallets to be transformed into smart contract accounts, has further expanded the capabilities of smart accounts and enhanced their usability and security. This development enables the implementation of more advanced functionality, such as multi-signature authorization and time-based unlocking, and allows for more complex business logic and security measures to be enforced automatically without the need for third-party intermediaries.\n\nExternally Owned Accounts (EOAs)\n\nThe majority of accounts created on the Ethereum blockchain and other EVM networks are known as externally owned accounts or EOAs. EOAs use traditional key pairs, meaning they consist of a single private key that is used to sign messages and make transactions. However, this also means that if someone gains access to your private key, they have full control over your account and funds.\n\nPopular wallets like Metamask and imToken, as well as hardware wallets such as Ledger Nano and Trezor, are all examples of EOAs. Despite their popularity, EOAs are susceptible to security risks since the private key is a single point of failure. If your private key is lost or stolen, you could lose access to your funds.\n\nTo address this issue, account abstraction was developed as a new standard for Ethereum, with the goal of allowing wallets to become smart contract accounts. Smart accounts leverage the added security and functionality of smart contracts to enable features like multi-signature authorization and time-based unlocking. By doing so, smart accounts aim to provide users with a more secure and flexible option for managing their funds on the Ethereum network.\n\nContract Accounts (CA)\n\nA contract account (CA) is a unique type of account on the Ethereum blockchain that is owned and managed by a smart contract, rather than an individual or entity. This means that the smart contract code determines how the Ether within the account is managed and utilized.\n\nNotably, contract accounts provide a powerful tool for developers and businesses to create more sophisticated and automated financial applications on the Ethereum blockchain. By allowing for more complex functionality and automation, contract accounts can enhance the efficiency and security of financial transactions and other applications built on the Ethereum platform.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that contract accounts still require an externally owned account (EOA) to deploy and execute their functions. The EOA is responsible for initiating transactions and interacting with the smart contract code, which then determines how the Ether within the CA is utilized.\n\nEOAs vs Smart Accounts\n\nExternally owned accounts and smart accounts are both types of accounts in the Ethereum blockchain, but they have different characteristics and purposes.\n\nEOAs are the most basic type of Ethereum account. They are controlled by private keys, and transactions can be initiated only by the account owner. EOAs are used mainly for holding ether and sending transactions to other accounts, including smart contracts.\n\nSmart accounts, on the other hand, are more complex and have more functionality than EOAs. Smart accounts are smart contracts that have been deployed to the blockchain and have their own Ethereum address.\n\nSmart contracts are self-executing programs that can be programmed to perform specific actions when certain conditions are met. Smart accounts can interact with other smart contracts and can also execute code automatically based on predefined rules and conditions.\n\nThe key difference between EOAs and smart accounts is that smart accounts are programmable and can execute code, while EOAs are simply accounts that hold ether and can send transactions. Smart accounts can be used for a variety of purposes, including decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, voting systems, and supply chain management, among others.\n\nIn some cases, smart contracts may be owned by EOAs. For example, an individual may deploy a smart contract to the Ethereum network and own it through their EOA. In this case, the EOA would control the smart contract and be able to perform actions such as updating its code or interacting with other smart contracts.\n\nBenefits of Using Smart Accounts\n\nThe use of smart accounts on the Ethereum network provides users with the following benefits.\n\nSecurity. Smart accounts are built on the Ethereum blockchain, which uses cryptographic techniques to secure the network. This makes smart accounts highly secure and resistant to hacking and fraud.\n\nTransparency. Smart contracts are transparent, meaning that the code is open and visible to everyone on the network. This makes it easy to audit the code and verify that it is working as intended.\n\nAutomation. Smart accounts are self-executing programs that can automate a wide range of tasks, making them highly efficient and reducing the need for manual intervention.\n\nCost-effectiveness. Smart accounts can automate tasks and reduce the need for intermediaries, making them highly cost-effective. This is especially true for tasks that involve multiple parties, such as supply chain management and decentralized finance.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nSmart accounts on Ethereum have revolutionized the way agreements and transactions are conducted, enabling automated and trustless execution of contracts without the need for intermediaries. Smart contracts can be used for a wide range of applications, including financial instruments, insurance policies, supply chain management, and more.\n\nWhile smart accounts on Ethereum offer a wide range of benefits, they are still a relatively new technology and may present some challenges, including the need for careful and secure programming to prevent vulnerabilities and the possibility of unforeseen consequences due to complex interactions between multiple smart contracts."

        "content": "Phantom, a crypto wallet for Solana blockchain users, will start supporting the Ethereum and Polygon blockchains in a public launch across browsers, iOS and Android on Monday, May 1, at 9 a.m. EST, the company exclusively told TechCrunch.\n\nSupport for the two new blockchains was originally slated for the first quarter of 2023, but was pushed back. The multichain integration will be available to its 3 million users, Brandon Millman, CEO and co-founder of Phantom, said to TechCrunch.\n\nThe new capabilities come more than a year after Phantom hit a $1.2 billion valuation on a $109 million funding round in January 2022. That round was led by Paradigm, and saw participation from Andreessen Horowitz, Jump Capital, Solana and other investors.\n\nSupport for Ethereum and Polygon will let Phantom wallet users transfer assets across blockchains and dApps like Uniswap and Aave as well as NFT marketplaces like Blur and OpenSea. Users can now also import existing assets from MetaMask, Solana or Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) wallets. \u201cThe Phantom multichain is now available everywhere that MetaMask is,\u201d the company said.\n\nThe multichain support will open up Phantom to a broader pool of crypto users beyond the millions of users it currently has from the Solana ecosystem, given that wallet owners can trade, hold and interact across all three blockchains (opposed to just one).\n\n\u201cIf you have a MetaMask, you can plug in your seed phrase to have everything under one roof,\u201d Millman said. \u201cMetaMask can only handle one seed phrase at a time, but you can manage multiple here.\u201d\n\nThere are other multichain crypto wallets on the market like Pillar, which provides support for Ethereum, Polygon, Gnosis Chain, BNB Chain and others. But in general, most crypto wallets focus on providing services for single layer-1 blockchains, with Ethereum-focused wallets being the most common. For example, MetaMask allows users to hold and transfer Ethereum or any other ERC-20 token, which are derived from the Ethereum blockchain. However, the MetaMask team has said they see potential for a multichain world in the future.\n\nPhantom is arguably one of the biggest Solana-based wallets, so its opening up to other blockchains speaks to the growing potential for a multichain world and the possibility that other big players (like MetaMask) may follow suit.\n\nPhantom\u2019s new capability could also let dApps and other projects interact with consumers in an easier way cross-chain.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all multichain; you can see Solana NFTs next to ETH NFTs,\u201d Millman said. \u201cThey all show up in one place.\u201d\n\nThe wallet also shows advanced metadata for NFTs such as current floor prices, sale prices and other factors within the application, he added. \u201cWe also have the ability to sell NFTs directly into marketplaces like Magic Eden and OpenSea and others.\u201d\n\nPhantom is also adding new safety features that hide spam sent to crypto wallets in an attempt to help prevent phishing, Millman shared. \u201cThe analogy is similar to email: sometimes spam emails slip through, but users can just mark it as spam, and over time it gets better and better at catching it.\u201d\n\nAll in all, safety is one of the biggest areas Phantom is worried about, Millman noted. \u201cIf you go to a website, we give you a warning that you\u2019re leaving Phantom, and if we have an understanding that a website is malicious, we preemptively block it.\u201d Obviously, users can ignore the warnings, but Millman advises against doing so.\n\nThe wallet also simulates transactions before they\u2019re approved so users can see what they\u2019re sending and receiving \u2014 and if there\u2019s any cause for concern there, too, Millman said.\n\n\u201cThere are cases where you fall through all these protective layers and do get phished, but we have a customer support team that\u2019s basically 24/7 and can try to get you help with exchanges, directory of local authorities or things like that to explore routes,\u201d Millman said. \u201cI think that\u2019s a huge thing, because afterward, usually you don\u2019t know what you can do.\u201d\n\nUpdate: This article was amended after publication to reflect that Phantom\u2019s launch of the multichain support has been pushed to Monday, May 1. The previous version of this article stated the launch would happen on Wednesday, April 26."

        "title": "Circle launches cross-chain USDC transfer protocol for Ethereum, Avalanche - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Circle, the creator of US Dollar Coin (USDC), has launched a mainnet protocol that lets users transfer USDC between Ethereum and Avalanche, according to an April 26 announcement. Previously, Avalanche users who held USDC on Ethereum had to deposit their coins with a Circle partner or use a third-party bridge to transfer their USDC from one network to the other. The new Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) protocol appears to do away with this need for USDC bridges.\n\nThe team released a video on April 13 showing how the new protocol works. Unlike a traditional bridge, it doesn\u2019t lock tokens sent to its contract. Instead, it completely destroys them and issues new tokens on the receiving network. Users can redeem these new tokens for bank deposits directly, by depositing the tokens with Circle or its partners.\n\nIn the announcement, the team said that it expects CCTP to solve the problem of \u201cfragmentation\u201d in the Web3 ecosystem. Currently, there are multiple unofficial versions of USDC floating around on various networks, most of which are the result of tokens on one network being bridged to another. Now that there is an official way to transfer coins from one network to another, the team expects these unofficial copies to slowly decline in use, making the token less confusing to use.\n\nThe team said that many of the largest cross-chain protocols have already pledged to use CCTP going forward, including Celer, Hyperlane, LayerZero, LI.FI, MetaMask, Wormhole and others.\n\nRelated: VISA will facilitate USDC payments, thanks to fresh partnership\n\nJoao Reginatto, Circle\u2019s vice president of product, said he believes the new protocol will help improve liquidity and capital efficiency in decentralized finance:\n\n\u201cWith CCTP, developers can simplify the user experience and their users can trust that they are always transacting with a highly liquid, safe and fungible asset in native USDC.\"\n\nUSDC is a fiat-backed stablecoin issued by Circle. The company claims that each USDC token is backed dollar-for-dollar in its reserves. Users can mint USDC by opening an account and depositing cash with either Circle itself or one of its partners, such as Coinbase. Once they\u2019ve done this, they can receive the coin on several networks, including Ethereum, Avalanche, Stellar and Polkadot.\n\nUsers have lost billions of dollars worth of USDC and other cryptocurrencies due to bridge hacks over the past few years, as attackers have repeatedly figured out how to remove locked coins from bridge contracts and leave their copies on the receiving network with no backing. This has left developers wondering how to secure bridges for future use as digital assets become more mainstream."

        "content": "Widely followed crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen is warning that Ethereum (ETH) could collapse in price despite rallying after a network upgrade.\n\nIn a new strategy session, Cowen tells his 785,000 YouTube subscribers that ETH could plummet by more than 57% from its value of $1,869 at time of writing.\n\nCowen believes that ETH will return \u201chome,\u201d a term he uses to describe the fair-value logarithmic regression trendline using \u201cnon-bubble data.\u201d\n\nAccording to Cowen, even though ETH had rallied and traded at the $2,000 level after the recent Shapella network upgrade, the smart contract platform will likely retest lows within the upper and lower bounds of the logarithmic regression chart.\n\n\u201cI would say that people are likely celebrating prematurely and there still is a very high risk that Ethereum could in fact return home.\u201d\n\nCowen says the fair-value logarithmic regression trendline is currently at around $800. However, he says there is also a possibility for Ethereum to repeat a pattern in 2019 and 2020 when ETH dipped below the fair-value logarithmic regression trendline.\n\n\u201cWhere is home? If you look back to where home was back in the summer of 2022 it was around $600. Now, it\u2019s around $800. Okay, but also do note that when we were over here [in 2019 and 2020] we actually went below that fair value, which is that middle line. And the lower bound on the lower regression trendline is now at $574.\n\nI\u2019ve said many times I think the deep value zone on Ethereum if we can get it, is somewhere between $400 to $600. There\u2019s of course no guarantee we go to those levels. If we go back to $700 or $800 we\u2019ll already be back home, but it is something that you should think about is that this could be an eventual outcome to at least consider.\u201d\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Circle, the issuer of USDC, announced on Wednesday that it is making its permissionless cross-chain transfer protocol (CCTP) available to developers building on Ethereum and Avalanche. As a result, USDC can now be transferred more securely and efficiently between the two chains using Circle\u2019s burn-and-mint mechanism, as opposed to the traditional lock-and-mint approach.\n\nApps that embed the CCTP in their code will now enable users to burn their USDC on the source blockchain, then mint it on the chain to which they\u2019re transferring the funds. Because it\u2019s permissionless, the company says that developers can build on top of the CCTP and deliver new use cases, such as digital asset swaps, deposits on decentralized exchanges and buying NFTs across Ethereum and Avalanche, according to a statement from Circle.\n\nA number of developers have already integrated the CCTP, which was discussed on Blockworks\u2019 0xResearch podcast in March. It is currently used by wallets and infrastructure providers, including Celer, Hyperlane, LayerZero, LI.FI, MetaMask, Multichain, Rarimo, Router, Socket, Wanchain and Wormhole, according to a blog post written by Circle\u2019s vice president of product, Joao Reginatto.\n\nReginatto added that lock-and-mint bridging was the standard before this idea of burn and mint. This caused \u201ca proliferation of synthetic USDC assets,\u201d he wrote, noting that these synthetic tokens \u201cresulted in fragmented liquidity, security risks due to large amounts of the native asset locked on-chain, and confusing developer and end-user experiences.\u201d\n\nBlockworks Research Senior Analyst Sam Martin said that billions of dollars have been lost as a result of bridge hacks, which he said usually involves lock-and-mint bridging solutions. \u201cThe larger the dollar value locked on the source chain, the larger the incentives are for hackers to figure out how to exploit the bridge\u2019s contracts.\u201d\n\nMartin added that the CCTP \u201cis a much safer mechanism for moving value across chains, and should result in less fragmented liquidity across various DeFi ecosystems.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Cardano vs. Ethereum: Cryptocurrency Comparison - Latest Cryptocurrency Prices & Articles",
        "content": "In the cryptocurrency space, it\u2019s no secret that the industry heavyweights like Cardano (ADA) and Ethereum (ETH) compete for dominance. With both ranking among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, these digital assets share similarities in design and application.\n\nIn this article, we delve into the subtle differences between Cardano and Ethereum, highlighting their unique features and functionalities. Read on to learn how these two crypto giants compare.\n\nWhat Is Ethereum (ETH)?\n\nEthereum\u2018s Ether is not just another cryptocurrency but also the most popular altcoin in circulation today. Ethereum is a revolutionary platform that enables the creation of decentralized applications (dApps) with the power of blockchain technology. On Ethereum, developers can also build smart contracts, which, once executed, can set some rules that can and do streamline each transaction process.\n\nEthereum\u2019s founder, Vitalik Buterin, envisioned a decentralized internet where the code serves as the law. At the heart of Ethereum is the Ethereum Virtual Machine, which calculates elements that determine how smart contracts function.\n\nDevelopers can build dApps using Solidity and Vyper, giving them virtually any capacity without intermediaries. More experienced developers can also use YUL, an intermediate language for the Ethereum Virtual Machine, or Yul+, an extension to Yul.\n\nEthereum\u2019s proof-of-work setup has presented scaling issues and raised concerns about energy consumption. That is why, as of September 15, 2022, through the event called \u201cThe Merge,\u201d Ethereum switched from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake, allowing for faster, more cost-efficient, and environmentally friendly transactions.\n\nThis evolution aims to simplify the platform\u2019s operation, with decreased transaction times and fees, to encourage developers to create more dApps that perform well even in high-traffic situations.\n\nWhat Is Cardano (ADA)?\n\nCardano is a blockchain project that was designed to support smart contracts functionality.\n\nThe project was developed in 2015 by Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK), led by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson. Cardano prides itself on a modernized version of the Ethereum blockchain and has established itself as a \u201cthird-generation\u201d platform compared to Ethereum\u2019s \u201csecond-generation\u201d status.\n\nCardano\u2019s digital currency, ADA, is the powerhouse behind the third-generation blockchain platform, named after Augusta Ada King, the first computer programmer from the 1800s. ADA plays a crucial role in Cardano\u2019s proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, rewarding users for validating transactions.\n\nCharles Hoskinson, the co-founder of Ethereum, initiated the creation of the Cardano blockchain in 2015, and it went live in 2017. As a blockchain platform, Cardano functions as an alternative to Ethereum, serving similar purposes such as facilitating smart contracts and constructing an interconnected and decentralized system. Furthermore, Cardano aims to offer banking services to the unbanked globally.\n\nWhile ADA prices have significantly fluctuated since its 2017 launch, Cardano\u2019s unfinished product presents room for improvement and the potential for promising investment opportunities. However, as with other cryptocurrencies, careful investment planning is necessary due to ADA\u2019s volatility. You should always rely on academic research and other trustworthy sources before investing in a specific token.\n\nCardano vs. Ethereum: Tokenomics\n\nCardano Tokenomics\n\nThe total supply of ADA is limited to 45 billion with an inflationary emission rate, with around 35,4 billion currently in circulation. The remaining ADA will be gradually released over time through staking.\n\nThe initial token distribution of ADA was as follows:\n\n57.60% was allocated to ICO;\n\n11.50% was allocated to the Team;\n\n30.90% was allocated to Staking Rewards.\n\nThe initial token launch date for Cardano (ADA) was September 29, 2017.\n\nCardano\u2019s tokenomics also include a treasury system, which allows users to propose and vote on projects that can be funded with a portion of the network\u2019s transaction fees. This ensures that the Cardano network remains self-sustaining and can continue evolving and growing.\n\nEthereum Tokenomics\n\nThe total supply of ETH is not fixed, and same as ADA, new ETH have been created through the staking process since September 2022. However, the rate of new ETH creation is decreasing over time, and there is a cap on the total supply of ETH, which is currently around 120 million.\n\nThe initial distribution of Ethereum (ETH) was as follows:\n\n83.33% was allocated to Ethereum Crowdsale;\n\n16.68% was allocated to Ethereum Foundation, Early Contributors & Others.\n\nInitially, Ethereum had an inflationary supply, with Ether increasing yearly at 4.5%. However, following the Ethereum Merge that transitioned from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, it has become a deflationary asset because of its burn rate. The amount of Ether burned to maintain network activity exceeds the amount of Ether entering circulation.\n\nEthereum\u2019s tokenomics also include a gas fee system, prioritizing transactions, and ensuring that the network can handle high demand. Users must pay a fee in ETH to execute smart contracts and interact with dApps on the network. The gas fee system helps prevent spam and ensures the network is not overloaded with unnecessary transactions.\n\nComparison\n\nCardano Ethereum Inflationary Deflationary Fixed supply Unlimited supply Both blockchain platforms use PoS (Proof-of-Stake) Both blockchain networks use their native tokens to validate transactions and incentivize users\n\nCardano vs. Ethereum: Technology\n\nConsensus Mechanism\n\nCardano uses the Ouroboros Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, which is designed to be energy-efficient, secure, and scalable. Until recently, Ethereum used Proof-of-Work to verify transactions, but it now uses Proof-of-Stake. Today, with the current Proof-of-Stake consensus, Ethereum has lowered the network\u2019s energy consumption by 99,99%.\n\nProgramming Languages\n\nIn the blockchain space, many Ethereum virtual machine-compatible platforms use Solidity as their programming language. In contrast, Cardano employs Haskell due to its potential for improved security and speed. However, Haskell has a steeper learning curve, making it less popular among developers.\n\nArchitecture\n\nEthereum\u2019s architecture is classified as Layer 1 technology. Despite network upgrades such as the Beacon Chain and The Merge, they are merely parts of a series of advancements intended to fortify the Ethereum network and prepare it for rollups on Layer 2.\n\nThis upgrade is because Ethereum\u2019s original design used an auction-based model where users bid for transaction space, leading to bidding wars, price spikes, and slower speeds during network congestion.\n\nSimilarly, Cardano also operates on a two-layered architecture. The Cardano Settlement Layer handles transactions, while the Cardano Computation Layer, built on top of it, facilitates smart contracts, enabling dApps to operate on the Cardano network.\n\nTransaction Speed\n\nEthereum\u2019s Layer 1 technology can handle around 30 (although often only 15) transactions per second (TPS), whereas Cardano can process roughly 1000 TPS, although it has been criticized for its developmental speed.\n\nHowever, both platforms can potentially improve their TPS capabilities in the future with upcoming upgrades. For instance, Cardano\u2019s Layer 2 Hydra upgrade can potentially increase its TPS to an impressive 2.5 million. Similarly, Ethereum\u2019s forthcoming upgrades, which we\u2019ll discuss later, could possibly increase its TPS by up to 100,000, a significant improvement from its current capacity.\n\nGovernance\n\nCardano\u2019s governance model is designed to be decentralized, with a voting mechanism that allows stakeholders to have a say in the decision-making process. Ethereum\u2019s governance model is transitioning to a more decentralized approach through the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) process.\n\nCardano\u2019s governance structure involves 3 separate organizations:\n\nIOHK, which coded Cardano and developed its PoS algorithm;\n\nThe Cardano Foundation, responsible for blockchain development;\n\nEmurgo, which is focused on bringing large-scale businesses onto the Cardano network.\n\nBesides, Cardano has a treasury that operates independently of these organizations. With every block added to the chain, a portion of the ADA rewards is redirected to the treasury wallet. Whenever a network change is proposed, ADA holders can vote on it, and if the proposed changes are approved, a grant is released by the treasury.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum is overseen by a single organization, the Ethereum Foundation. While the foundation claims not to run Ethereum, it has made significant decisions in the past, such as during the DAO hack of 2016.\n\nIn response to the hack, the foundation allowed all ETH holders to vote on whether Ethereum should fork. The vote passed, creating a new version of Ethereum, but some miners rejected the fork and established Ethereum Classic.\n\nScalability\n\nTo be a strong \u201cLayer 1\u201d cryptocurrency, it\u2019s essential to have a blockchain infrastructure that supports scalability. Compared to Ethereum, Cardano\u2019s system is more scalable and can handle a greater number of transactions.\n\nEthereum encounters difficulties with transaction volume. The network operates efficiently during quiet periods, but during a bull market when millions of new investors enter the crypto space, Ethereum\u2019s capacity is exceeded.\n\nCardano Vs. Ethereum: Crypto Price & Market Cap\n\nCryptocurrency investors often consider factors such as price and market metrics when seeking longevity and stability in their investments. Ethereum, being one of the oldest and most established cryptocurrencies, has a long history and larger market capitalization than Cardano.\n\nMetric Cardano Ethereum Price $0.6859 $3,432.55 Market Cap $24,334,127,652 $412,393,655,001 Circulating Supply 35,479,795,292 120,142,084 Trading Volume $1,053,115,908 $22,112,015,717\n\nWhile both Cardano and Ethereum have their strengths and weaknesses, Ethereum\u2019s more extended history and larger market capitalization give it an advantage in terms of stability and mainstream recognition. However, Cardano\u2019s innovative technology and potential for growth make it an attractive investment option for many investors.\n\nCardano vs. Ethereum: Main Advantages and Disadvantages\n\nCardano Ethereum Advantages Disadvantages Advantages Disadvantages Strong backing from academics and a strong team guiding the project Competing with many third-generation cryptocurrencies The first blockchain network that can handle smart contracts Limited capacity to deal with high transaction volume Lower costs and energy usage Unfinished product with limited uses Supports: DApps; DEXs; Lending protocols; Yield farming; NFT marketplaces. High transaction fees and long transaction times Better potential for scaling Less demand and lower liquidity High liquidity due to high demand No supply limit\n\nCardano vs. Ethereum: Future Developments\n\nEthereum was the first-ever blockchain project to provide smart contract technology, still holding the second position according to the market cap. It is the most used platform for issuing initial coin offerings (ICOs) for new start-ups and new tokens.\n\nEthereum also has many DApps built in its ecosystem, which use the Ether coin. The project still has scalability issues, but many hope the problem will be resolved with future upgrades.\n\nLike the rest of the cryptocurrency industry, Cardano has experienced a noticeable decrease in value. However, with the latest growth of the crypto market, it recovered most of its value.\n\nThe main issue with Cardano is the slow development process, with the team claiming to take their time to build the product without any flaws.\n\nThe platform still has a long way to achieve its final goal of unlimited, instant, and free transactions. Even though the team gathers experienced engineers, scientists, and developers, there is no guarantee that the project will ever be finalized, and investors may lose interest.\n\nFAQ\n\nIs Cardano better than ETH?\n\nDetermining which one is a better investment option is subjective and depends on your personal preferences. Ethereum has a well-established ecosystem and developer community, providing a sense of security. On the other hand, Cardano\u2019s long-term growth potential, particularly in emerging markets, makes it an attractive option.\n\nDoes Cardano or Ethereum have a higher market cap?\n\nAs of March 1, 2024, Ethereum has a higher market capitalization than Cardano. Ethereum\u2019s total market value is $412 billion, whereas Cardano\u2019s is $24 billion.\n\nHow is Cardano\u2019s platform different from Ethereum 2.0\u2019s?\n\nCardano\u2019s platform differs from Ethereum 2.0 in several ways. The most significant might be that while Ethereum remains a single-layer solution for managing smart contracts and decentralized apps, Cardano adopts a dual-layer design that combines smart contract functionality with a native currency for financial transactions.\n\nCan Cardano replace ETH 2.0?\n\nIt\u2019s improbable for Cardano to replace ETH 2.0, mainly because Cardano does not have a clear numerical advantage over Ethereum. It is important to note that Ethereum currently holds the title of being the most popular choice for smart contracts and DApps.\n\nWhat makes Cardano and Ethereum 2.0 similar?\n\nCardano and Ethereum 2.0 share multiple similarities, as both use PoS, allowing users to stake their assets for transaction validation. Besides, both platforms incorporate smart contracts, enabling secure and customizable transactions on the blockchain.\n\nCardano vs. Ethereum: Which is a Better Buy?\n\nDetermining whether Ethereum or Cardano is the superior investment option is a topic of discussion and may hinge on personal investment preferences. While Ethereum is deemed the more secure choice by some due to its extensive developer community and ecosystem, Cardano\u2019s potential for long-term growth is worth considering.\n\nWith its potential to attract users from emerging and frontier markets, the Cardano network could be a strategic acquisition that offers significant returns, albeit with some waiting time. Therefore, carefully evaluating both cryptocurrencies\u2019 potential risks and rewards is crucial to making a wise investment decision.\n\nShare this Post Twitter\n\nLinkedin\n\nFacebook\n\nReddit\n\n* The information in this article and the links provided are for general information purposes only and should not constitute any financial or investment advice.

        "title": "Three Tips for Avoiding Ethereum's High Gas Fees - Money Morning",
        "content": "During this morning's Crypto Q&A, someone asked me \"why are gas prices so high right now?\"\n\nI wouldn't know. My car is electric.\n\nOh...you meant Ethereum (ETH) gas prices.\n\nYeah-they're stupid expensive right now. I know they broke their 10-month high last week, leaving many investors (including myself) frustrated with gas prices sometimes higher than the value of the transaction itself.\n\nThis is a direct result of demand for decentralized applications (dApps), NFT trading, cryptocurrency, and Web3 services reaching an all-time high, which is a net positive for investors.\n\nUnfortunately, Ethereum can't handle all this new demand. And because gas prices depend on network traffic, supply of validators, and the amount of transactions needing validation-the more people that use Ethereum, the higher that gas prices climb.\n\nThat's because what you're actually paying for is the amount of computational power required to validate new transactions on the blockchain, the value of which increases with demand.\n\nEthereum gas is measured in \"gwei,\" the equivalent of 0.000000001 ETH.\n\nThe chart below illustrates how gas fees have steadily increased over the past six months.\n\nBut here's the kicker: higher demand also means a higher price for ETH, which has climbed by 50% in the same time frame.\n\nThe more people that use Ethereum...\n\n...the more transactions that need validating...\n\n...and the more money we're all going to pay to make it happen.\n\nWe're stuck with this problem until Ethereum can increase its transaction capacity, or another blockchain replaces it as the leading Web3 platform.\n\nSo, while we can't avoid these fees entirely... I can show you three ways to pay less.\n\nHere are three tips for avoiding high gas fees:\n\n#1 - Avoid Rush Hour\n\nCryptocurrency has peak traffic times, too. Gas fees are typically lower during off-peak hours when the network is less congested. You can time your transactions for these periods to save money on gas fees.\n\nGas prices are currently at their lowest between midnight and 4 a.m. (EST) on weekdays, and between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. (EST) on weekends.\n\nUse this chart to find out when gas fees will be their lowest and try to time your transactions for off-peak times.\n\n#2 - Use Exchanges that Bundle Transactions\n\nDecentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Uniswap can help save you money on Ethereum gas fees by bundling multiple transactions into one.\n\nUniswap does this using a market maker (AMM) model instead of a traditional order book that relies on liquidity pools to facilitate transactions, reducing the need for complex gas fee calculations and lowering the overall cost.\n\nYou can use Uniswap to convert Ethereum into other ETH-based cryptocurrencies for typically lower gas fees than what you'd find on MetaMask\n\nNot familiar with Uniswap? Start here.\n\n#3 - Utilize Layer-2 Solutions\n\nOne of the best ways to avoid high gas fees on Ethereum is by utilizing Layer-2 protocols like Polygon (MATIC).\n\nLayer-2 protocols have become vital scaling solutions for Ethereum by offloading transactions and validating them on a \"sidechain\" adjacent to the mainnet. We can access these sidechains and use them to conduct transactions for lower fees and faster processing times.\n\nThe most popular Layer-2 network for ETH is currently Polygon. To use Polygon instead of Ethereum, you'll need to own MATIC and connect to the network via MetaMask.\n\nLearn how to use Polygon here.\n\nBut there's another Layer-2 network I haven't mentioned here that I think is going to outperform Polygon long-term. I'm building my position in it right now, and I'm predicting a 10X return over the next three to five years.\n\nI'm keeping this asset hidden for now...unless you're subscribed to Digital Fortunes Network, in which case you can check out your April pick here.\n\nStay liquid,\n\nNick Black\n\nChief Crypto Strategist, American Institute for Crypto Investors\n\nThe post Three Tips for Avoiding Ethereum's High Gas Fees appeared first on American Institute for Crypto Investors."

        "content": "Join the most important conversation in crypto and web3! Secure your seat today\n\nVertex, a decentralized exchange for the spot and derivatives trading of digital assets, has gone live on Arbitrum (ARB), a popular network built atop the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nVertex, which had been operating on a test network, combines an off-chain order book layered on top of an on-chain automated market maker on a decentralized, self-custodial exchange. The firm, which has bases in Singapore and the Cayman Islands, counts Jane Street, Dexterity Capital, Hudson River Trading, GSR, Collab+Currency, JST Capital, Big Brain and Lunatic Capital among its early backers.\n\nThe messy collapse of FTX and other centralized trading platform blowups last year has fueled a shift toward decentralized exchanges and self-custody. Ethereum layer 2 system Arbitrum is now the fastest-growing blockchain in total value locked and has surpassed Ethereum in daily transaction volume.\n\nThe Vertex team has been working on the protocol for about a year. Co-founder Darius Tabatabai said the platform has drawn interest from institutional traders and from retail traders who use Arbitrum.\n\n\u201cWe built all the smart contracting ourselves, so we\u2019re not forking anything,\u201d Tabatabai said in an interview with CoinDesk. \u201cThe [automated market maker] is quite conventional, but we have a bunch of tech under the surface that enables you to do leveraged AMMs, to do looping, and we have an inbuilt money market. So you can think of it as a combination of Aave, dYdX and Uniswap, with an order book.\u201d\n\nBuilding Vertex on Arbitrum and using an off-chain sequencer for the order book has enabled the venue to process between 10,000 and 15,000 transactions per second with the ability to match buy and sell orders in 10 to 30 milliseconds, a speed that rivals leading centralized venues and surpasses that on other decentralized exchanges, Tabatabai added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

This new offering allows users to earn staking rewards on their Ether holdings without locking up their assets, providing increased flexibility and liquidity. The product is designed to capitalize on the growing demand for Ethereum staking as the network transitions to Ethereum 2.0 and the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.\n\nThis move by Binance is expected to further solidify its position as a leading provider of staking services, while also catering to the needs of the Ethereum community. The introduction of Ether-based liquid staking reflects the rising popularity of staking services and the growing acceptance of Ethereum's Proof of Stake system.\n\nBinance says its new Ether-based liquid staking product lets users stake their Ether and get rewards without the hassle of running or delegating a validator node. Users will be able to stake any amount of Ether and receive BETH tokens in return, which represent their staked Ether and the accrued rewards. BETH tokens can be freely traded, transferred, or used as collateral on Binance\u2019s platform, giving users more options and flexibility with their staked assets."

Visa prefers hearing from candidates who have a good understanding of Layer-1 and Layer-2 solutions, as well as working knowledge of writing smart contracts using Solidity, Ethereum\u2019s programming language.\n\nThey should also have an understanding of public and permissioned distributed ledger technology, security protocols and the new Ethereum account standard, ERC-4337.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nPublic blockchains refer to networks which don\u2019t require prior authorization to join as validators, with Bitcoin and Ethereum the two most prominent examples. Permissioned blockchains differ in that vetted operators control most of the functions on the network.\n\nIn February, Visa rejected reports stating it would halt crypto activities after the collapse of high-profile companies across the ecosystem.

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nIn 2009, Bitcoin introduced the digital assets era, and since then, many have adopted cryptocurrency. Ethereum also came along with altcoins to fill gaps and improve on what Bitcoin left out, including dApps and smart contracts. The two established players in the market have been dominant, but with the advent of AI, a new class of cryptocurrencies has emerged, offering exciting possibilities for the future of finance and technology. Crypto watchers have even begun referring to these new coins as \u201cplatinum\u201d in comparison to gold (Bitcoin) and silver (Ethereum).\n\nLet\u2019s explore the potential of AI crypto and its role in shaping the future of digital finance.\n\nAvorak AI: Pioneering AI Crypto Surge\n\nAI crypto refers to cryptocurrencies or blockchain projects that utilize artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning technologies to enhance various aspects of the blockchain ecosystem. These projects aim to improve security, scalability, and efficiency through new solutions and opportunities in data analysis, prediction, and automation. Avorak AI\u2019s innovative solutions include a flagship trading bot, Avorak Trade, which is receiving attention for its accuracy, as beta testers report its quick response to price changes through 24/7 market analysis.\n\nAvorak AI (AVRK) is breaking records with its ongoing ICO, with phase five seeing a rise of 250%, reaching $0.210. The project has passed its second audit by SolidProof, which has elicited high expectations. YouTube analysts are showing enthusiasm for Avorak through their videos. Early investors enjoy 6% bonus yields and priority staking rights when Avorak lists on the Azbit exchange with an expected launch price of $1.\n\nThe impressive Avorak AI performance is evident through its sentiment and impressive milestone of surpassing $1.5 million. This achievement is a promising sign for the project\u2019s future growth potential. The project\u2019s innovative approach, growing community, and increasing demand for AI-based solutions may increase the AVRK price. This positive sentiment can provide further momentum for the project\u2019s growth and success. Avorak AI\u2019s strong performance encourages holders looking for high-growth potential projects.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow to Buy Bitcoin on etoro?\n\neToro\u2019s rich features and market monitoring tools propel it among the best crypto buying platforms. You can buy Bitcoin on eToro by signing up for an account and verifying through the \u201cDeposit Funds\u201d button before funding it.

Cross-check the details and click the \u201cOpen Trade\u201d button to confirm the order. eToro charges fees for buying and selling cryptocurrencies, so familiarize yourself with the fee structure before purchasing.\n\nHow to Stake Ethereum?\n\nStaking Ethereum involves holding and locking up your ETH coins in a wallet. This will help maintain the security and operation of the Ethereum blockchain while you earn rewards in return. Before staking, ensure you have the minimum ETH required to become a validator on the Ethereum network. You will then choose a staking service, including exchanges, wallets, and dedicated staking platforms. Some popular options include Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken. Once you choose a staking service, deposit the required amount of ETH into the staking platform. This usually involves sending your ETH to a designated wallet address provided by the staking service and then following the instructions to initiate the staking process. Ethereum Staking can be technical and risky, so research and understand the staking process thoroughly before starting.\n\nConclusion\n\nAI crypto leverages AI tools to automate processes, improve efficiency and accuracy, and offer unique solutions to common challenges. With continued growth and evolution of AI technology, more innovative AI solutions by Avorak AI will continue to unfold, stamping its platinum label.\n\nLearn more about Avorak and its ICO here:\n\nWebsite: https://avorak.ai\n\nBuy AVRK: https://invest.avorak.ai/register\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article, and views in it do not represent those of, nor should they be attributed to, ZyCrypto.

        "title": "Third round of ETH withdrawals sees roughly equal amounts of deposits: Data - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ethereum staking withdrawals have entered their third \u201cround,\u201d but Ether (ETH) staking deposits have almost equaled them, according to the data from the analytics platform Nansen.\n\nEthereum staking withdrawals started ramping up for the third time on April 24 and into April 25. According to Nansen, the crypto exchange Kraken was responsible for a large portion of these withdrawals.\n\nA \u201cround\u201d refers to the number of days taken to process partial withdrawals and rewards. Nansen says it currently takes just under four and a half days.\n\nThe last large batch of withdrawals on April 24 was a total of 61,608 ETH in principal and reward withdrawals. However, at the same time, there were 63,009 ETH deposits, reported Nansen.\n\nThis has resulted in zero change in the balance of staked ETH over the past 24 hours.\n\nEther deposits (shown in blue) since April 18. Source: Nansen\n\nIn February, Kraken was forced to halt its Ethereum staking services following enforcement action and a fine by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, which accused it of selling unregistered securities.\n\nAs a result, much of the ETH withdrawn early on has been from Kraken wallets as assets get returned to stakers. According to Nansen, 2.3% of the total withdrawable ETH remains from Kraken.\n\nNansen currently reports there is a total of 632,651 ETH waiting in the pending withdrawal queue. At current prices, this is valued at around $1.16 billion.\n\nThird round of principal withdrawals underway\n\n\n\nAgain largely Kraken, bringing their total principal withdrawn to almost 400k\n\n\n\nSource: @nansen_ai pic.twitter.com/jVnnxnl5Jf \u2014 Martin Lee | Nansen (@themlpx) April 24, 2023\n\nBefore the last wave of withdrawals commenced, Nansen reported an all-time high in the total amount of staked ETH. The figure hit 18,796,663 ETH valued at around $34.5 billion on April 24.\n\nRelated: ETH staking passes withdrawals for the first time since Shapella upgrade\n\nThe current figure, which is slightly lower than this peak, represents 14.5% of the total Ether supply. Due to the EIP-1559 burning mechanism, the total supply has declined by 114,077 ETH (around $209 million) since the Merge in September.\n\nConcerns over a massive exodus of staked Ethereum following the Shapella upgrade have been quashed. Token Unlocks is reporting that a total of 1.66 million ETH has been withdrawn since April 12, but 1.07 million ETH has been deposited, signaling there is still quite an appetite for staking Ether.\n\nMagazine: District 9 director\u2019s shooter, Decentraland red-light district battle: Web3 Gamer"

Paradigm led and A16Z participated. https://t.co/MimvkmqvMc \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) April 26, 2023\n\nThis has become possible after the wallet obtained a valuation of $1.2 billion after the $109 million fundraising round at the start of 2022; that is, a year has passed since then. The leading players who participated in that investment round were Paradigm and Andreessen Horowitz, along with Solana.\n\nIntegration with the above-mentioned chains will provide Phantom users with exposure to decentralized platforms, like Aave and Uniswap, and also to NFT platforms, such as OpenSea. Users will also be able to move their crypto from MetaMask wallet, Solana or EVM to Phantom.\n\nBesides, users of this wallet have options to trade and hold crypto. They will now be able to do it on three leading blockchains, rather than just one. Besides, as mentioned above, Phantom's users will now be able to interact with dApps and other multichain products."

        "content": "Since the CryptoKitties debacle in 2017, we\u2019ve been hearing promises that Ethereum would scale soon and that Vitalik Buterin and friends would pull a rabbit out of a hat to bring gas fees down for good.\n\nYet, over five years later, Ethereum is no further along. As an inherently flawed state machine, it can still only process 20 transactions per second (max) on the base layer, and fees fluctuate wildly depending on use.\n\nWe saw yet more evidence of this recently when a handful of meme coins created major congestion on Ethereum and almost tripled the average gas fee. While some Ethereum advocates celebrated the growth in revenue for stakers, others lamented the gas fee increase as $TROLL, $APED, and $BOBO entered the top 10 gas burners on the network.\n\n\u26fd\ufe0f A highly unusual shift in top 10 gas burning #altcoins has emerged today. Instead of $ETH, $WETH, and $USDT being at the top of the fee distribution list, we're seeing new assets like $TROLL, $APED, and $BOBO among them. Read our latest deep dive. \ud83d\udc47 https://t.co/7SlmJ59k2m pic.twitter.com/Y2kaLKZTrL \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) April 19, 2023\n\nIt\u2019s yet another demonstration that the Ethereum blockchain is wholly unsuitable as anything other than a novelty network for pet projects that don\u2019t require serious scaling.\n\nUtility is taking center stage, and Ethereum will not fare well\n\nIn July 2025, it will be Ethereum\u2019s 10th anniversary, and with the way the digital currency and blockchain markets are changing, it\u2019s not looking good for Vitalik Buterins\u2019 brainchild. Already, many Ethereum developers have jumped ship, realizing the promises coming out of the Ethereum camp were nothing more than hollow words; time and again, update after update, those who staked their futures on Ethereum have been left disappointed.\n\nWith the speculative mania of recent years dying down and regulations coming down hard on exchanges, promising to drive out unregulated stablecoins and limit leverage, we\u2019re seeing a shift of focus to utility, the real-world use cases of blockchain technology, and the problems it solves. In such an environment, hype machines like Ethereum will begin to fall behind as utility blockchains that can deliver the goods take center stage.\n\nFor example, take Bitcoin SV (BSV), the original protocol designed by Satoshi Nakamoto. It\u2019s currently processing millions of transactions daily with fees of just $0.000007 (04.20.23), and real companies like STUK.co and Haste Arcade are harnessing the power of the BSV blockchain to manage data and deliver services that would otherwise be impossible. See Haste\u2019s Instant Leaderboard Payout technology, which is used in its arcade, for one example.\n\nDeliver or die \u2013 there\u2019s no other way forward\n\nLet\u2019s cut to the chase and spell it out: the era of easy money, VCs throwing bags of cash at everything with the word blockchain in it, and rogue stablecoins like Tether pumping speculative tokens like BTC and ETH to insane heights is over. The big crash has already occurred, and just as with the Dot Com crash back in 2001, only the companies that use the blockchain to deliver real services in a way that\u2019s better than what\u2019s already out there will survive.\n\nSo, you tell me, how are companies going to deliver anything of value on a blockchain that is incapable of scaling on-chain, which has fees that almost triple when put under a little pressure by some silly memes coins? What serious business will be able to deliver blockchain services at an affordable cost when it can\u2019t even predict what its costs will be weekly or month to month?\n\nIn the new era, where blockchain startups have to do something useful to earn their money, they\u2019ll need utility blockchains that scale with fees that either remain low to build on. In this era, nobody will care whether you can run a node at home or whether Lord Vitalik says it\u2019s cool or not. Businesses don\u2019t deal in ideology; they deal in dollars and cents, and the most affordable solutions that work today will win.\n\nSeriously, get your study cap on and hit the books. Try to find a blockchain that can lay a glove on Satoshi\u2019s original Bitcoin; you won\u2019t be able to. Then, let logic take its natural course and ask yourself; how will companies building on blockchains like Ethereum compete with those building on BSV? They won\u2019t be able to, and that\u2019s all anybody really needs to figure out.\n\n\u201cBut Ethereum is going to scale!\u201d I can hear some shrill voices yelling internally as they read this. Yeah, right. If it could have, it would have, and if a feasible layer-two solution emerges in a couple of years, it\u2019s going to be too late. Businesses are signing deals now, and utility blockchains will have it all tied up before Vitalik Inc. delivers anything feasible.\n\nWe\u2019re well into the blockchain marathon now, and in the era of utility, those who have been focused on scaling and building superior technology are going to rapidly catch up with and overtake those who have been focused on pie-in-the-sky layer-two networks and coin prices. In BSV\u2019s case, it has already surpassed Ethereum many times over, and the gap is only going to widen.\n\nWhile Ethereum has been in the limelight during the early days of the industry, unless it delivers solutions that can best its competitors in the next year or two, it\u2019s not going to be relevant for much longer. After all, if a couple of meme coins can break the network, how is it ever going to underpin the global economy, as Ethereum maximalists claim?\n\nFollow CoinGeek\u2019s Crypto Crime Cartel series, which delves into the stream of groups\u2014from BitMEX to Binance, Bitcoin.com, Blockstream, ShapeShift, Coinbase, Ripple,\n\nEthereum, FTX and Tether\u2014who have co-opted the digital asset revolution and turned the industry into a minefield for na\u00efve (and even experienced) players in the market.\n\nNew to blockchain?

        "title": "#CryptoExplained: A Brief History of Ethereum - Rolling Stone India",
        "content": "The crypto space moves fast, and Ethereum has singlehandedly changed the crypto landscape over the last 10 years with significant innovations that have come to define the space.\n\n2013\n\nEthereum was conceptualized by Vitalik Buterin who has become one of the key figures in the crypto ecosystem. He published his concept in the form of a white paper, similar to the way Bitcoin was introduced to the world. This white paper included his ideas for a world computer called the Ethereum Virtual Machine, and smart contracts.\n\n2014\n\nThe Ethereum Initial Coin offering launched in 2014 and successfully raised $18 Million USD. The sale had 2 parts: a pre-sale which allocated Ethereum to early contributors and supporters and a public sale with an initial exchange rate of 2000 Eth for 1 BTC. The funds raised were used for the development of the platform, and a portion of the Eth was set aside for use by the Ethereum foundation to grow the ecosystem. In addition to Vitalik, the founders of the Ethereum Network included Gavin Wood who went on to found Polkadot, and Joseph Lubin who founded Consensys. The Ethereum ICO became the template for ICO\u2019s in the ICO boom of 2017.\n\n2015\n\nThe first Live release of Ethereum launched and was called \u201cFrontier\u201d. It launched on July 30th. The creation of the Genesis block marked the exact start of the network.\n\nFrom the official blog at the time of the launch:\n\n\u201cThe Dev team joins me in thanking each and every one of you for your support during the past year and half. It\u2019s incredible to see the progress that has taken place since that humble first commit on Christmas Eve 2013. The vision of a censorship-proof \u2018world computer\u2019 that anyone can program, paying exclusively for what they use and nothing more, is now a reality.\u201d\n\n2016\n\nThe DAO hack took place. The DAO was a decentralized autonomous organization that was designed to be a new way to allocate funds to projects. Due to a vulnerability in the code 3.6 million eth worth a total of over 70 Million USD was stolen. This led to a controversial move by the Ethereum community who decided to fork the code to version before the hack occurred and recovered the funds. This was controversial because it questioned the immutability of the Eth ledger. Eth purists continued the version with the hack, and this gave birth to the Ethereum Classic, a network that\u2019s been running with the original Ethereum code since 2016.\n\n2017\n\nThe ICO boom was one of the most exciting periods in Ethereum History. ICO stands for Initial Coin Offering, and ICOs paved the way for entirely new ways to fund new businesses. The boom also saw the advent of scam ICOs which relied on nefarious tactics like Pump and Dump to steal investor funds. Over $1B in funding was raised during the ICO boom.\n\nThis year also saw the launching of Crypto Punks, which paved the way for the NFT craze. Crypto punks are rare collectible NFTs and their value has increased significantly over the years. Many crypto punks are owned anonymously.\n\n2018\n\nUniswap launched as one of the first decentralized exchanges. It was a significant innovation in the crypto economy as it allowed anyone to exchange tokens built on the Ethereum ERC 20 standard and it popularized the use of Automated Market Makers or AMMs. Since its launch, Uniswap and other decentralized exchanges have grown to the point where they are likely to overtake centralized exchanges in volume. The FTX crisis in 2022 has made DEXs even more valuable as they are unlikely to be manipulated in the same way.\n\n2020\n\nThe most significant event in 2020 was the decision by the Ethereum community to move to Proof of Stake which would reduce the energy consumption of the network by 99%. In December 2020 Ethereum launched the genesis chain to begin the process. As part of the process, \u2018Validators\u2019 locked in 32 ETH (approx. 20000 USD at the time) for an unspecified amount of time to help secure the network and help it make the transition. Many skeptics believed at the time that this would mean the end of Ethereum, as a transition from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake had never been attempted.\n\nThis year also saw the DeFi boom. DeFi stands for decentralized finance and most people agree that this has changed the way finance works around the world and will continue to usher in financial innovations that are accessible to more and more people. DeFi is expected to do to the financial industry what the internet did to the Print and Media industries. It will enable anyone to provide financial services just like the internet enabled anyone to become a content creator and publish to large audiences.\n\n2021\n\nThis year had many major events in crypto all of which culminated in all-time highs for both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Transaction volumes were some of the highest ever seen and led to extremely high fees for applications running on Ethereum. All the while the Ethereum developers worked diligently to prepare for the merge which still did not have a date and would mark the complete transition to Proof of Stake.\n\nEthereum also implemented the London hard fork which turned Ethereum into a deflationary asset. By burning Ethereum with every transaction the amount of Ethereum being burned began to exceed the amount being minted, resulting in a reduction of supply. This means that over time the value of Ethereum is likely to increase as more apps utilize it and increase demand, while supply decreases.\n\n2022\n\nThe year of crashes and the merge! Terra Luna and FTX tanked the crypto market, but Ethereum and the DeFi ecosystem kept working as designed and withstood an incredible stress test created by malicious centralized actors. In doing so Ethereum helped prove that DeFi was here to stay and was a far superior alternative to the centralized systems we are used to.\n\nAnd then on September 15th, 2022, it happened. The Ethereum network performed an unprecedented feat and successfully transitioned to Proof of Stake. The network experienced no downtime, no errors, and no malicious activity. It defied the skeptics and ushered in a new era of innovation.\n\n2023\n\nAnd that brings us to the Shanghai upgrade completed just a week ago. The primary purpose of this upgrade was to allow stakers to withdraw the Ethereum they locked into the network in 2019 to help secure the transition. Skeptics expected significant withdrawals that would briefly reduce the price of Ethereum. But this has not happened yet, and instead the price of Ethereum has risen. Most people expect this price increase to continue as more institutions begin to add Ethereum to their balance sheets since now it can be withdrawn within a reasonable amount of time."

If you wish to withdraw, you\u2019ll need at least an equivalent of $50 in your account.\n\nGame Variety: 4.75/5\n\nBitStarz\u2019s games library is composed of over 3,800 games. It has an impressive selection when it comes to jackpot slots and there is a very generous prize pool that sometimes go up to 7 figures.\n\nSlots make up a major part of the casino\u2019s portfolio, but there are plenty of classic casino games available here as well. Blackjack, Roulette, Baccarat, and other specialty games can be played using your ETH funds.\n\nUnfortunately, live dealer games are not available for US players.\n\nBonuses: 4.7/5\n\nWhen it comes to bonuses, BitStarz will surely not disappoint.\n\nFirst off, there\u2019s a 20 free spins no-deposit bonus, which will be made available to you when you sign up for an account.\n\nIts 100% up to 1 BTC first deposit bonus is just the tip of the iceberg. Once you make your second, third, and fourth deposit, you can get as much as 5 BTC and 180 free spins. The wagering requirement is pretty standard at 40x.\n\nThere\u2019s also an exclusive VIP bonus for those who wish to make a larger first deposit and enjoy better perks.\n\nUser Interface: 4.8/5\n\nThe BitStarz platform was created in 2014. But its user interface is well laid out, impressively designed, and easy to navigate.\n\nThe graphics and color scheme were in total balance. Even in the games itself, the graphics are ultra-sharp and translated well into smaller screens for most mobile devices.\n\nIts overall quality is undeniably impressive, and it contributes to a better experience for the users.\n\nCustomer Support: 4.6/5\n\nBitStarz casino offers several channels for customer support for all its players.\n\nAside from the regular features such as the live chat, they also provide customer support through their social media accounts such as Twitter and Facebook.\n\nIf you want to go traditional for your inquiries, they also have email support available on their website.\n\nOne great thing about BitStarz is the availability of a comprehensive FAQ section. This allows their players to look for quick answers should they want one.\n\nEnjoy Bitstarz\u2019s almost endless games and score your welcome bonus by clicking here.\n\n2. Ignition Casino \u2013 Best Ethereum Online Casino for Poker Players\n\nPros:\n\n$3,000 combined welcome bonus\n\nPlay online poker tournaments using Ethereum\n\nFast withdrawals \u2013 less than 24 hours\n\nGenerous promos for regular players\n\nIgnition Miles loyalty program\n\nCons:\n\nLimited number of mobile games\n\nOnly 56 different slots\n\nIf you are an Ethereum holder and want to find the best Ethereum casino for poker, look no further than Ignition Casino!\n\nIt stands out for a nice $3,000 combined welcome bonus (25x wagering requirements) and arguably the best poker experience on the web. They also have fast withdrawals that take place within 24 hours.\n\nEthereum Compatibility: 4.5/5\n\nIn addition to depositing with Ethereum, players can deposit using Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin. This is not that many options, especially if you hold ERC-20 altcoins and have to pay the expensive gas fees to convert your tokens over to ETH.\n\nGame Variety: 4/5\n\nAs we have mentioned, this casino stands out for having an excellent online poker lobby where you can connect and play with other players. Outside of this, there are only about 120 different ETH casino games that you can play.\n\nThere is also a virtual sport betting page to bet and watch simulated sports games. However, the table game, slots, and live dealer game selection are minimal. Typically, you should want to play games like blackjack, roulette, and baccarat to make the most of this site.\n\nBonuses: 4.7/5\n\nIgnition casino has a nice welcome bonus that will give you up to $3,000 in bonuses if you deposit using Ethereum. Half of these can be used on casino games if you get the full amount.\n\nThe other $1,500 can be used on the poker section. Note that there are 25x wagering requirements, which is more reasonable than other online Ethereum casinos.\n\nYou also must ensure that you never bet more than 20% of the deposit amount while using bonus funds.\n\nUser Interface: 4.5/5\n\nIgnition Casino offers a straightforward interface that is easy to use. Perhaps the low number of total games is part of why it is this way.\n\nIf you want to play casino games like slots, blackjack, and roulette, you can simply select \u201ccasino.\u201d There is also a \u201clive dealer\u201d button to see all the live games.\n\nFinally, the poker interface is what stands out the most. It is effortless to connect with other players, sign up for tournaments, and the games themselves are very engaging and fun.\n\nCustomer Support: 4.5/5\n\nCustomer support is very simple and straightforward for typical requests commonly sought out. Once you navigate to the help page, you are given lots of different help articles.\n\nHowever, you will need to click on a help article before you are prompted to seek out human assistance. To get the email address or live chat link, you need to click \u201cno\u201d when the article asks if it answered your question.\n\nClick here to get a combined welcome bonus of up to $3,000 for casino and poker!\n\n3. Wild Casino \u2013 Most Generous Welcome Bonus of All Ethereum Gambling Sites\n\nPros:\n\n$9,000 crypto welcome bonus\n\nVariety of live dealer games\n\nOver 15 banking options supported\n\nAmazing mobile compatibility\n\nCons:\n\n$50 minimum ETH deposits\n\nWild Casino was launched at the tail end of the year 2018, making it one of the newest Etherereum online casinos in the gaming market today. Given this, this casino was created with modern live dealer games, which adds to its excellent advantage.\n\nOn top of that, it offers one of the most generous welcome bonus packages you\u2019ll find in today\u2019s online gambling market, especially in the crypto department.\n\nEthereum Compatibility: 3.7/5\n\nWild Casino accepts 17 different cryptos. But unlike other Ethereum casinos, this site has a set maximum for both deposits and withdrawals, even with cryptocurrencies.\n\nEthereum has a minimum deposit of $50, which makes it higher than the other available currencies. When it comes to its withdrawals, you can be capped at the standard fee of $100,000.\n\nGame Variety: 3.5/5\n\nWild casino\u2019s games library is a bit limited. There are only 358 total games offered. However, its game variety is actually quite good. You have the freedom to choose over 200 slots, table games, and other classic casino games.\n\nBut what really makes it worthy of being part of our list of the best Ethereum casinos is its incredible live casino section with 18 live dealer games. The betting limit is between $5 to $10,000.\n\nBonuses: 4.8/5\n\nWild Casino offers a great deposit bonus of up to $9,000 for crypto players. The first deposit is a 300% match deposit of up to $3,000. The next four deposits are a 150% bonus up to $1,500.\n\nFor non-crypto players, up to a $5,000 welcome bonus is up for grabs. The first deposit has a wagering requirement of 45x, while the subsequent four deposits are attached to a 30x wagering requirement. However, you can\u2019t use your bonus cash for live games.\n\nThere are also a lot of other bonuses offered for existing and new players. You can check the different offers by heading to the promotions section on its website.\n\nUser Interface: 4/5\n\nThe jungle theme of the online casino, together with its clean layout design attracts many players. But what makes this more impressive is the easy and smooth navigation you\u2019ll experience at the site.\n\nLike any other popular Ethereum online casino, Wild casino laid out its games all over its homepage, making it more easily accessible for everyone.\n\nHowever, if you are a new player, you might be having a hard time navigating the site.

CloudBet \u2013 Best Ethereum Gambling Site for Sports Betting\n\nPros:\n\nAmazing variety of sports betting markets\n\nGenerous welcome package for new players\n\nLive dealer games available\n\nAmazing mobile compatibility\n\nCons:\n\nDesign could use an update\n\nIf you are looking forward to betting on the upcoming sports events or wager on different events, you should take a look at what CloudBet has in store.\n\nEthereum Compatibility: 4/5\n\nCloudBet supports 12 cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum. The minimum deposit necessary to be eligible for the welcome bonus is 0.01 ETH.\n\nThis online casino is designed exclusively for crypto players, especially for those who use Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nGame Variety: 4.5/5\n\nAs an established sportsbook, it can be expected that Cloudbet should have a great selection of sports betting markets for players to enjoy. There are over 30 sports to bet on, including major leagues like MMA, FIFA, and less mainstream ones like table tennis, snooker, and more.\n\nUnlike BitStarz, CloudBet doesn\u2019t have as many casino games offered to its players, but its 1,500 game selection and variety is already enough to keep its players satisfied.\n\nAt CloudBet, you can play a lot of slots, live casino games, and more. It is also worth noting that this brand is responsible for some of the excellent jackpot slots and an online casino behind the creation of high RTP games like Marching Legions, Royal Rumble XtraGatcha, and more.\n\nBonuses: 4.3/5\n\nWhen it comes to bonuses and promotions, CloudBet offers various bonuses and promotions for its players.\n\nThe first deposit starts with a 100% deposit match as a welcome offer, which will slowly go up to 5 for BTC, ETH, and BCH deposits.\n\nAs mentioned, you cannot get the bonuses all at once; instead, the game operator will add 0.01 BTC for every 800 loyalty points. After that, you can get the opportunity to win free spins on Volatile Vikings. Furthermore, the bookmaker gives zero-margin betting options for chosen leagues, events, and sports, ensuring the best prices.\n\nUser Interface: 4/5\n\nCloudbet was created last 2013, but its user interference was just recently updated to make it even more user-friendly.\n\nThis type of online casino is different from the typical ones, especially when it comes to its design. Its layout looks more like a sportsbook compared to other brands. However, it\u2019s not bad as it still looks professional and clean.\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing to complain about, it would be the location of its banking area. For most people, the place where it is located looks unsuitable to see at first sight.\n\nCustomer Support: 4/5\n\nCloudbet casino has several available channels for customer support. The casino staff is also very friendly and reliable in answering all customer queries.\n\nIt has a live chat available 24/7 on its website for all customer concerns that require immediate feedback.\n\nAside from that, its email is also available on its website for concerns that do not need instant correspondence. The casino staff usually answers after an hour. They also offer an FAQ section for quick customer concerns. Despite the availability of these channels, Cloudbet casino lacks customer support via call.\n\nBet on your favorite sports and spend CloudBet\u2019s generous welcome bonus.\n\n5. mBit Casino \u2013 Most Exciting Tournaments of All Ethereum Casinos Online\n\nPros:\n\nMinimalistic casino lobby\n\nAmazing variety of casino games from leading providers\n\nHosts regular tourneys for slots and table games\n\nPayouts are processed almost instantly\n\nCons:\n\nSlow email response\n\nmBit Casino has improved its quality features throughout the years. Today, this online casino is constantly performing well with its fastest and most user-friendly website.\n\nWith over 2000 games, mBit casino allows players plenty of freedom to choose the game they love to spend their time with. But the casino is mostly known for its crypto slots and table wars \u2013 the exciting tournaments that players keep coming back for.\n\nEthereum Compatibility: 4.6/5\n\nAt mBit casino, you have the option to deposit among seven available cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum.\n\nOther accepted currencies include Dogecoin, Bitcoin, Tether, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin. However, there are certain limits on how much you can deposit and withdraw with these listed methods.\n\nBut what makes this preferable for others is that almost all casino games available can be played using ETH.\n\nGame Variety: 4.6/5\n\nmBit casino has a large selection of over 2,700 fun and exciting casino games to offer its players, such as Blackjack, Roulette, Baccarat, and many more. Over 1,161 of them are slot games, making sure slot enthusiasts won\u2019t ever get bored.\n\nDespite having thousands of casino games available, mBit casino only has limited crypto games, which is quite odd for a crypto online site.\n\nOverall, this casino still has many games to offer in the market, making it one of the top-rated online casinos so far.\n\nBonuses: 4.3/5\n\nmBit casino offers generous welcome bonuses and rewards to keep their new and existing players happy. New players who sign up on mBit casino, will receive a welcome deposit bonus of 110% up to 1 BTC and 300 free spins on their first deposit. The wagering requirement is 35x.\n\nMoreover, they can also receive additional perks for the second deposit of 100% up to 2.5 BTC and a 75% bonus up to 1.5 BTC for their third deposit.\n\nThis is such a great deal compared to other casinos who mostly just offer welcome bonuses on their first deposit.

They have a live chat available that is accessible 24/7 for those who want instant responses.\n\nTheir email address is also readily available on their website. But as much as they\u2019re great options for customer support, they lack two other important factors for accessible customer support \u2014 a phone hotline and a user-friendly FAQ section.\n\n\n\nSign up for a new account at mBit and score your welcome package!\n\n\n\nRunners-up:\n\nRanking Methodology for the Best Ethereum Gambling Sites\n\nEthereum Casino Compatibility\n\nFirst of all, we made sure that all of the gambling sites listed above accept Ethereum.

        "title": "#CryptoExplained: Ethereum is Still a Work in Progress - Rolling Stone India",
        "content": "Ethereum is not yet the base layer of trust on the internet. To get there it has to go through several more upgrades. As it does so, the way it operates will continue to change and evolve. But because Ethereum is the primary ecosystem for most crypto, each stage of evolution will create new opportunities for technologies, innovations, and businesses.\n\nThe biggest change coming to Ethereum in the near future is the move to something called Proto-Danksharding. This is a way for Ethereum to scale the number of transactions it can process. Currently, Ethereum is a single blockchain which can process around 15 transactions per second. After this upgrade, it should be able to process over 100,000 transactions per second. For reference, Visa can process 1,700 transactions per second.\n\nTransaction fees currently are also very high, and often become prohibitively expensive when a lot of people are using the Ethereum network at the same time. But this will also change with future upgrades and expectations are that fees will drop to less than $0.001. With high transaction volumes and low fees, Ethereum will improve the economics of the businesses that run on it.\n\nUpgrades that Increase transaction volumes and lower fees will likely take place within the next two years and are much needed. However, the Ethereum roadmap is also looking at what Ethereum will look like beyond the next two years.\n\nIn several talks, Vitalik has discussed various possibilities for the future of Ethereum. Most of these include the \u201coutsourcing\u201d of certain tasks away from the network itself. For example, the Ethereum blockchain currently contains all the transactions since the first one. This means that maintaining the network requires a lot of memory from participants. One of the proposals for the future state of Ethereum is to incentivize service providers to store historic data and only maintain two to three years worth of information at a time. This could create new business models around archiving old data.\n\nFuture upgrades will primarily focus on making Ethereum even more efficient and getting it to a state where it will no longer require significant changes for 10 to 20 years. This is because every time Ethereum is upgraded, trillions of dollars are affected and businesses built on Ethereum have to expend several hours of technical expertise on ensuring their tech is ready for the change. For Ethereum to truly become the base layer of trust, it will need to stay constant in a rapidly changing world.\n\nAs the base layer of trust strengthens collaboration around the globe, humanity could solve some pressing challenges like climate change, poverty, and becoming a multi-planetary species."

This setup points to an ETH recovery bringing a move to areas above the $2,000 psychological into the picture.\n\nEthereum Price Remains Bullish From A Technical Outlook\n\nAfter being turned away from the $2,142 local high, Ethereum embarked on a downtrend that was halted around the $1,800 support zone. Ether has then been displaying range bound movement producing a series of lower highs and lower lows, while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) produced lower highs. This resulted in a non-conformity scenario referred to as a \u201cbullish divergence\u201d.\n\nA bullish divergence is a technical setup that suggests that the bulls have not given up on pushing the price higher. This formation from the RSI forecasts an upward recovery in the Ethereum price. The levels that buyers likely have their eyes on is the $1,973, which is the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent downturn as well as the 78.6% Fibonacci level at $2,069\n\nShattering this resistance will allow Ether\u2019s price to tag the $2,100 hurdle and later the $2,142 swing high. Such a move would bring the total gains to 18% for the ETH traders.\n\nETH/USD Daily Chart\n\nApart from the bullish divergence from the RSI, the price sat on a four-hour demand zone, as shown on the chart above. This was the area stretching from $1,640 to $1,760 that could provide the oomph required by the buyers to scale ETH higher.\n\nNote that the last time the price consolidated within this region between March 12 and March 28, it went on to surge 22% to 10-month highs close to $2,150. Therefore, even if Ethereum drops back into this level, demand pressure from this zone could lift the price back up, avoiding the price from tanking below the said level.\n\nOn the downside, if bulls fail to lift Ethereum up and sellers tighten their grip instead, it could spell doom for the largest altcoin by market value. If this happens, ETH could slide below the 23.6$ Fibonacci retracement level at $1,805 and back into the bullish breaker, described above.\n\nIn highly bearish cases, a four-hour candlestick close below $1,640 would invalidate the bullish thesis for Ethereum price and potentially trigger a correction to $1,531 and $1,470 defense levels.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Which is the best Ethereum Mining Software in 2023? (press release) - Romania-Insider.com",
        "content": "Press Release\n\nEthereum is the blockchain-based decentralized protocol that has made waves in the cryptocurrency market with its native token, Ether (ETH). With a circulating supply of more than 120 million ether coins, it's far larger than Bitcoin's supply \u2013 and yet prices have been steadily increasing since 2015. Just like Bitcoin, people mine for ETH to ensure new tokens enter circulation. If you are keen on getting into digital currencies, then Ethereum could be one way better to go about it. If you are planning to trade Bitcoin, you may use a reputable trading platform like bitcoin-loophole.live .\n\nEthereum mining is still a viable way to earn money, but the success of a miner relies heavily on the type of Ethereum mining software used. To help miners make an informed decision as to which platform best suits their needs, we have made a list featuring some of our top picks for the best Ethereum mining software applications. Before getting into Ethereum mining, take time to read through this article and equip yourself with knowledge about some of these essential tools that will guide your journey.\n\nBest Ethereum Mining Software\n\nWinETH\n\nThe most widely used GPU mining program is WinETH, and it is recommended by novices. Depending on Ethminer, the system has a user-friendly interface as well as an intelligent algorithm which enables users to enhance the effectiveness of the hardware while mining. The open-source application features a user-friendly interface, calls for no configurations, and it is extremely simple to make use of because of its one-click mining on Windows. Along with Ethereum Classic, you can mine Ethereum Classic and it's also able to mine within restricted networks by proxy.\n\nKryptex\n\nKryptex differs from some other Ethereum mining programs for Windows as you can decide to be paid out in dollars or maybe different currencies, rather than Bitcoins. Therefore you won't need to concern yourself with conversion or fees. The software is utilized on a desktop to mine Ethereum and Bitcoin, as well as the owners blending the power out of several computer systems to operate a decentralized mining system.\n\nSo long as the application is operating, you can continue to make use of your computer as per usual. Additionally, they provide Pro Miner for GPU mining, Kryptex OS, and a mining pool, as well as a leasing service for USD 99.99 per month. Many users have stated issues with the application such as the capability to withdraw cash through the likes of Walmart e Gift cards as it requires way too much time to withdraw cash out. To take cash out, even to an outside Bitcoin wallet, is costly. That is not to mention the point that the app doesn't have much better control over power usage and that customer care is poor.\n\nMinedollars\n\nMine Dollars may be utilized to mine ether along with nine other cryptos without the necessity for costly hardware. It performs like a cloud mining environment, where you simply purchase a mining agreement for a particular amount, from ten to twenty thousand US dollars. The Ethereum contract is priced at 100 USD for a three-day contract plus makes an income of 6 USD.\n\nThe organization doesn't need you to purchase some mining hardware since it invests in its very own ASICs and GPUs which are utilized to mine the crypto. The customer may either enhance their contract or purchase extra. They decide upon a crypto mining agreement based on deposit quantity (various agreements have varying investment quantities on them), crypto to mine as well as contract duration.\n\nPhoenixMiner\n\nPhonexMiner, a CPU as well as GPU mining program for Ethereum, had been turned off from the NiceHash mining pool in 2022 year as a result of problems with the new download file, whose checksum didn't match the one published by the creator."

        "content": "Hong Kong\u2019s push to become a crypto hub has opened up new opportunities for Chinese state-affiliated banks and crypto companies despite a blanket ban on crypto-related activities in mainland China. Meanwhile, the Big Both of crypto, Bitcoin and Ethereum are facing their own changes after the Shanghai Upgrade. Next in the market, is the brand new Signup token, inching closer to its launch, but not just yet. Read till the end to know more!\n\nChinese Crypto Banks Turn To Hong Kong\n\nChinese banks have shown interest in building partnerships and onboarding regulated crypto companies in Hong Kong. Since crypto trading has been banned in the mainland since 2021, state-affiliated banks in China have shown interest in building partnerships and onboarding regulated crypto companies in Hong Kong. These banks are looking to leverage the province\u2019s development to tap into the ever-expanding world of cryptocurrency.\n\nAfter the restriction of a security crackdown and COVID regulations, Hong Kong is emerging as a financial hub for cryptocurrency in China. The Hong Kong government seems to be serious about this development, as confirmed by Xiao Feng, chairman of the exchange HashKey. This exchange itself was visited by 13,000 people on its first day at the recent Hong Kong Web3 Festival.\n\nBitcoin Reels, Ethereum Flourishes As Shanghai \u201cUpgrades\u201d\n\nMuch to the dismay of optimistic watchers, Bitcoin (BTC) witnessed a dip below the $30k level: decrease of 1.12% on the $29,996 mark. The coin surged through the week by 5%, peaking at $31,005 on Friday, before fluctuating over the weekend. Meanwhile, after a continued 12% week-long surge post the Shanghai upgrade, Ethereum (ETH) is at the $2101 mark, a 134% increase since the lowest value in June last year.\n\nSignUpToken.com: Ready To Take Over The Market!\n\nSignUpToken.com is a new altcoin that is similar to other cryptocurrencies but has some unique features.

        "content": "Cambridge dons launch tool to track Ethereum electricity consumption as concerns over environmental impact grow\n\nToday is the day of the long-awaited Ethereum Dencun upgrade. Dencun will reduce Layer 2 transaction fees and involve \u201cblobs\u201d and \u201cProto-dank sharding\u201d. On Monday, Ethereum punched above $4,000 for the first time since December 2021. This new cycle high has happened even in the face of the perceived diminishing likelihood of an Ethereum spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) being approved by the SEC.\n\nCryptocurrencies will face more scrutiny on their environmental impact after the University of Cambridge released a new open access tool to track electricity usage from cryptocurrencies, starting with Ethereum.\n\nThe new Cambridge Blockchain Network Sustainability Index (CBNSI) hopes to provide \u201ccutting edge insights into the current and historical environmental impact of various blockchain networks.\u201d\n\nSo far, the tool has tracked electricity consumption from Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation.\n\nRead more Major Ethereum upgrade goes live, and Twitter starts letting users trade stocks with eToro partnership\n\nThe CBNSI\u2019s data tracks Ethereum\u2019s consumption both before and after The Merge.\n\nThe Merge took place in September 2022 and moved Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-work model into a proof-of-stake model.\n\nUnder a proof-of-work model, currency holders have to \u2018mine\u2019 the currency in an energy intensive process. A proof-of-stake model, in contrast, requires participants to put financial resources at stake which is more less resource intensive.\n\nAccording to the research, there was a 99.99 per cent decrease in Ethereum\u2019s electricity usage after The Merge concluded.\n\nThe research also showed that 39 per cent of Ethereum nodes were based in the US while 17 per cent were in Germany.\n\nWhile the CNBSI does not yet have data on Ethereum\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, work is underway to translate the consumption data into greenhouse gas emissions. This will allow for a better assessment of Ethereum\u2019s ongoing environmental footprint and historical emissions debt.\n\nJoe Baguley, chief technology officer, EMEA at VMware said: \u201cThe Ethereum Merge is a responsible step in the right direction, removing a fundamental environmental barrier to more mainstream adoption.\n\n\u201cBut \u2018The Merge\u2019 won\u2019t put a plaster on this carbon intensive network, particularly if Bitcoin won\u2019t also overhaul its underlying infrastructure,\u201d he continued.\n\nThe project builds off the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI), launched in 2019, which tracks the environmental impact of Bitcoin.\n\nAccording to its data, Bitcoin consumes more electricity than Ukraine and contributes more to greenhouse gas emissions than New Zealand.\n\nIf the electricity consumed by Bitcoin were directed to more productive uses \u2013 such as tea kettles in the UK \u2013 it would be able to power all kettles used in the UK for the next 30m years.\n\nExecutive director of the CCAF Bryan Zhang said \u201cthe debate around Bitcoin\u2019s environmental impact demonstrated that we needed to expand the scope of our research to assess other blockchain networks.\u201d\n\nThe launch of the CBNSI will provide policymakers with the \u201cnecessary foundational data for evidence-based debate to take place\u201d Zhang said."

        "content": "The upcoming Ethereum Shanghai fork, scheduled for April 12, is poised to unlock over 18 million staked ether (~$34.2 billion) and ignite what I predict will be a fierce competition among liquid staking protocols, aptly named the \u201cLiquid Staking Wars.\u201d This battle for supremacy in the liquid staking space is expected to have a profound impact on the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem as a whole.\n\nLiquid Staking Wars Will Begin By Early May\n\nFor those of us who remember the DeFi Summer, the Curve Wars come to mind \u2013 the cutthroat competition among emerging stablecoin protocols vying for the deepest liquidity and widest range of liquidity pairings on the Curve DEX. However, the Liquid Staking Wars have a unique element \u2013 the imminent Shanghai upgrade that will enable liquidity providers (LPs) to easily and inexpensively unstake ETH from one LST protocol and transfer it to another.\n\nThe first skirmishes of the Liquid Staking Wars will take place by early May, with LST protocols battling to capture the most total value locked (TVL) and volume for their tokens. The protocol that can attract the most liquidity and market share will likely emerge victorious in this battle, reshaping the landscape of all crypto pairs across various decentralized exchanges (DEXs).\n\nLido Seems Like a Frontrunner in LST War\n\nWhile LidoDao (LDO), currently holding a dominant market share of approximately 75% in LST TVL, may seem like the frontrunner in the Liquid Staking Wars, other contenders such as Frax, Coinbase, Rocket Pool, and upcoming protocols that are yet to launch, are actively vying for the top spot as the preeminent ETH replacement.\n\nDespite market conditions slowing down, there has been a notable trend of higher receiving addresses compared to sending addresses, indicating a lack of significant sell pressure, as observed on Glassnode. Investors who have staked their ETH through Lido, for instance, can anticipate withdrawals to be available no earlier than early May.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that the preparation of Lido\u2019s V2 testnet and completion of multiple security audits for its V2 upgrade won\u2019t coincide with the Shapella software upgrade on April 12, which is set to enable ETH withdrawals. The winners and losers in the Liquid Staking Wars will ultimately be determined by the strategic deployment of tactics on the battlefield, just like in any war.\n\nBig Eyes Coin ends Presale with The Biggest Bonus\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG), the latest addition to the frenzy of meme coins, has gained significant popularity during its presale phase. The token\u2019s unique concept and promising potential have attracted a large number of buyers, with investors showing great enthusiasm for Big Eyes Coin\u2019s presale and displaying confidence in its future success. As the presale comes to a close on June 3, the strong demand for BIG indicates that the token is well-positioned for a successful launch and a promising future. The presale of Big Eyes Coin has been a remarkable success, raising over $33.5 million from eager investors. Despite the impressive gains already seen, with the current price at $0.00053 in Stage 13, investors are anticipating even greater returns with the launch price set at $0.0006.\n\nBig eyes Coin has launched its biggest ever bonus code to mark the culmination of their successful presale. The code END300 when used at the checkout, will give the user 300% bonus. So if you buy $1000 BIG you get $4000 BIG. The users can also use Bitcoin, ETH, BNB, USDT-TRC20, USDT-ERC20, BUSD, DOGE and very soon TRX to snap up $BIG in the presale.\n\nThis time-limited offer reflects the cryptocurrency\u2019s belief in its future prospects and commitment to rewarding early investors, making it a strategic choice for those seeking to maximise their investment in Big Eyes Coin and capitalise on the upcoming bull run market. The strong performance of Big Eyes Coin during its presale could potentially position it to challenge the dominance of more established meme coins, setting the stage for an exciting battle in the next bull run market.\n\nThe intense competition among liquid staking protocols brought about by the Ethereum Shanghai fork is expected to drive innovation, improve LP strategies, and reshape the landscape of crypto pairs on DEXs. As LPs and protocols vie for market share and liquidity, the DeFi industry as a whole stands to benefit from increased competition and the potential for higher yields. The outcome of the Liquid Staking Wars remains to be seen, but it is clear that this battle for dominance in the liquid staking space will have a lasting impact on the broader DeFi ecosystem.\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG)\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nOpensea: https://opensea.io/collection/big-eyes-lootbox-cards\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Arbitrum, a layer-two scaling solution for Ethereum, recently distributed $120 million in ARB tokens to 125 decentralized autonomous entities (DAOs) in its ecosystem. The tokens will be used to incentivize ecosystem growth by allowing DAOs to reward users or encourage liquidity and application. The distribution has been closely monitored by leading Ethereum analytics firms, with approximately 100 million ARB transfers reported to eligible protocols. This article is all about Arbitrum price and its potential price rise.\n\nHow has the Arbitrum (ARB) price been moving over the past few days?\n\nIn the last few days, the Arbitrum (ARB) price has risen massively. In the last 30 days, the price saw a gain of over 10%. This makes Arbitrum Coin one of the biggest winners in the altcoin rally that followed Bitcoin\u2019s price surge above $30,000.\n\nArbitrum is a Layer 2 scaling solution for the Ethereum blockchain. The so-called Arbitrum Rollups are used for this. These do not have their own consensus mechanism, but use the state of the Ethereum blockchain for verification. This improves the verification of smart contracts.\n\nEthereum Layer 2 solutions have repeatedly experienced massive price increases in the past. The best known is Polygon, which was one of the strongest gainers in the first quarter of 2023. After the successful Shanghai update on Ethereum, investors on Arbitrum were particularly bullish as the connection between high scalability and security through verification on the main chain is very promising.\n\nArbitrum Price and Token Distribution Details\n\nhttps://twitter.com/arbitrum/status/1650541491012370435?s=20\n\nThe DAOs received their first financing of 113 million ARB tokens, valued at around $148 million at current prices. Treasure DAO and GMX were among the largest recipients with 8 million ARB tokens each, while SushiSwap, Balance, Uniswap, Curve, and Dopex received 3 to 5 million ARB tokens. Additionally, 118 other ecological protocols received varying percentages of the ARB airdrop. Around 90 million ARB tokens have been distributed so far, valued at approximately $120 million at current pricing.\n\nLocalizing Community Governance\n\nhttps://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1650762245767569409?s=20\n\nThe token distribution is part of a broader effort by Arbitrum to localize community governance, allowing DAOs to choose how to distribute their share of the ARB tokens. PlutusDAO, for example, has promised to use the additional funds to \u201cmake Plutus stronger than ever before.\u201d This approach gives DAOs greater autonomy to direct resources to areas they deem most critical to their operations.\n\nImpact on Liquidity and DeFi Projects\n\nThe token distribution is expected to increase liquidity across all Arbitrum DeFi projects. According to Mechanism Capital co-founder Andrew Kang, such incentives provide the \u201cflywheel that gave the L1 token 100%+ APY\u201d within ecosystems on Layer-1 platforms. Other Ethereum scaling solutions, such as Optimism, have launched similar programs to increase liquidity and usage.\n\nBenefits for Small Market Capitalization Protocols\n\nThe ARB incentives may benefit protocols with smaller market capitalizations the most, such as Vesta Finance, PlutusDAO, and Yin Finance. Onchain data analyst The Data Nerd calculated the ratio of ARB incentives to each protocol about its market valuation and determined that these ecosystems are receiving incentives that are multiples of their present market capitalization, which might assist in ecosystem expansion.\n\nArbitrum Price and Potential for Token Value Increase\n\ngm\n\n\n\nThe DAO Distribution of the Arbitrum airdrop occurred last night.\n\n\n\nAround $120M of $ARB was sent to Arbitrum protocols \u2013 although not all projects have received their allocation yet.\n\n\n\nAs of right now the top recipients include @Treasure_DAO, @SushiSwap and @dopex_io. pic.twitter.com/Pe2qfSUfah \u2014 Arkham (@ArkhamIntel) April 25, 2023\n\nThe distribution of ARB tokens to DAOs within the Arbitrum ecosystem is expected to fuel ecosystem growth and encourage the creation of decentralized apps (dApps) on the platform. As more protocols receive ARB tokens, the value of the token may climb, potentially leading to a 500% increase in price.\n\nHere are some significant points on why there may be big profit potential ahead for Arbitrum:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/nansen_ai/status/1650744810012278785?s=20\n\nArbitrum is a popular layer-two scaling solution for Ethereum, which means it can process transactions more quickly and cheaply than the Ethereum network itself.\n\nWith Ethereum\u2019s high gas fees and slow transaction times, more users are looking for alternatives, and Arbitrum is one of the leading solutions.\n\nRecently, Arbitrum distributed $120 million in ARB tokens to 125 decentralized autonomous entities (DAOs) in the ecosystem it operates in, which could drive demand for the token.\n\nThe ARB tokens are being used to incentivize ecosystem growth by allowing DAOs to reward users or encourage liquidity and applications.\n\nAs more protocols and users adopt Arbitrum and utilize the ARB token, the demand for it could increase, potentially driving up its price.\n\nAccording to The Data Nerd, protocols with smaller market capitalizations, such as Vesta Finance, PlutusDAO, and Yin Finance, will benefit the most from the ARB incentives.\n\nThe analyst calculated that these ecosystems are receiving incentives that are multiples of their present market capitalization, which could help drive ecosystem expansion and potentially increase demand for ARB tokens.\n\nOther Ethereum scaling solutions, such as Optimism, have launched similar programs to increase liquidity and usage, which may further drive demand for Arbitrum and its associated token.\n\nAccording to some analysts, the current price of ARB may not yet reflect its potential value, which could mean there is room for growth and profit potential.\n\nHowever, as with any investment, it\u2019s important to do your own research and assess the risks before investing in ARB or any cryptocurrency.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe distribution of $120 million in ARB tokens to DAOs within the Arbitrum ecosystem is a significant step towards incentivizing ecosystem growth and encouraging the creation of dApps on the platform. The token distribution is expected to increase liquidity, benefit small market capitalization protocols, and potentially increase the value of the token. With greater community governance, DAOs have the power to direct resources to the areas they deem most critical, further fueling ecosystem growth.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might also like\n\nMore from Altcoin"

While some experts predict a potential crash, others maintain a positive outlook. With regulatory twists and fresh crypto developments, the market\u2019s future is both hazy and exhilarating. Therefore, for intermediate or advanced-level investors seeking adventure, this will help them navigate the current crypto climate.\n\nA prolonged period of bearish market conditions in the cryptocurrency world is known as a \u201cCrypto winter.\u201d It is characterized by significant price drops and reduced market capitalization. Predicting the crypto market\u2019s trajectory is a challenging task due to the significant fluctuations and recoveries that have marked its history. However, in 2023, the market has shown signs of recovery, with major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) rallying, despite negative headlines. The new meme coin Dogetti (DETI) is proving itself as a promising investment for quick returns.\n\nBitcoin For The Long Run\n\nIn April 2023, Bitcoin enjoyed a moment in the sun when it approached 30K, eventually settling at $28,070, representing a 19.2% monthly gain. On Thursday, Bitcoin traded at approximately $28,600, dropping as low as $28,289 earlier in the day. This marks the fifth time the digital currency has fallen in the past six days. Bitcoin had a remarkable surge in the past few months, reaching above $30,000 for the first time in ten months last Tuesday, and hitting $31,019 late last Thursday, making it the highest level since June 7 last year. Bitcoin saw a 20% increase in March, which is its best performance since January, when it rose by 38.7%.\n\nOverall, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency has rallied by about 73% since the beginning of the year. Although Bitcoin has experienced its ups and downs, with a current market cap of, it remains the world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency and still has room to grow. While Bitcoin has had a stronger correlation with the stock market in recent years, it is unclear if rising interest rates will impact this trend.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Bullish Predictions\n\nEthereum (ETH) also climbed 9.7% in March 2023, ending the month at a respectable $1,829. Wolf, a Twitter user and renowned analyst, has attributed the bullish prediction for Ethereum\u2019s growth to the increasing demand for decentralised applications (dApps) and the platform\u2019s dominance in the DeFi and NFT markets. Meanwhile, Brian Schuster, the founder of Ark Capital LLC, is even more optimistic, suggesting that Ethereum could potentially replace many traditional financial services. Schuster believes that Ether, Ethereum\u2019s native token, could compete as global money and capture a share of the $123 trillion in global Money and quasi-money (M2).\n\nEthereum 2.0, also referred to as Eth2, is a series of upgrades designed to enhance the efficiency and security of the Ethereum network. TThese upgrades\u2019 primary focus is moving away from the current Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a Proof of Stake (PoS) model, which was successfully completed last year. This transition is expected to result in lower energy consumption and faster transaction processing times, making the network more eco-friendly and cost-efficient.\n\nDogetti For Quick Profits\n\nThe upcoming presale token, Dogetti (DETI) has captured the attention of the crypto world, and is set to be one of the most highly anticipated coins of the year. Originally scheduled to launch in the fifth stage of the presale, the Dogetti team has pushed the release date to June 20th.\n\nThe project has successfully raised $941,223 and has already sold 8.74 billion tokens, accounting for almost one-fifth of the total supply of 50 billion tokens. Dogetti\u2019s affordability has made it a popular choice for budget-conscious investors seeking low-cost investment opportunities. Additionally, the large token supply may help balance supply and demand, ultimately promoting price stability.\n\nInvestors are drawn to Dogetti\u2019s many offerings, including its NFT marketplace, a reflective protocol that redistributes 2% of the 6% transaction tax back to the community, and a deflationary tokenomics model that ensures the coin\u2019s longevity.\n\nThe Dogetti team is now preparing to launch a series of NFTs that will grant community members access to unique digital companions. These NFTs are expected to have significant value and will be available for trade, sale, and purchase on the NFT marketplace, as well as provide exclusive access to Dogetti events and content.\n\nDogetti DAO is another notable feature that allows the community to participate in voting and proposing ideas, thereby giving users a unique sense of ownership over the coin that is rarely seen in other crypto ventures.\n\nWhat distinguishes Dogetti from other cryptocurrencies is its community-driven approach. Holding DETI tokens provides users access to a closely-knit community, and the team plans to leverage this dynamic community to promote the coin\u2019s success.\n\nTo mitigate risks, it is advisable to diversify your investment portfolio. Rather than investing all your money in established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, consider investing in other new altcoins/meme coins like Dogetti to spread out potential gains or losses.\n\nFor more information about Dogetti (DETI):\n\nPresale: https://dogetti.io/how-to-buy\n\nWebsite: https://dogetti.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/Dogetti\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_Dogetti_\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Snowmantastic moves from Ethereum to Cardano - Crypto News Flash",
        "content": "Snowmantastic has announced its movement from Ethereum to Cardano.\n\nThe reason has been linked to the high gas fees on the Ethereum network.\n\nSnowmantastic NFT project has become the latest to announce its transition from the Ethereum network to the Cardano network. According to the team, there was serious deliberation and planning before bringing it to the public domain.\n\nAs stated in their announcement, the transition of the Snowmantastic NFT project was largely influenced by the high fee cost present on the Ethereum network. Also, several other factors not disclosed were stated to be part of this move. On the Ethereum network, Snowmantastic has collaborated with over 200 projects.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/snowmantastic/status/1650591769505964033?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\n\nThis is just one of the many projects moving from Ethereum to Cardano. In March, a popular NFT collector identified on Twitter as @Alex_ADA_ announced his decision to move to Cardano from the Ethereum network.\n\nAccording to him, the current limitations of Ethereum have led to slow transactions and high gas fees. Cardano addresses this problem as its Ouroboros Proof of Stake (POS) consensus algorithm makes the network more scalable and efficient. Another reason for his transition is sustainability. According to him, the Proof of Stake model of Cardano is energy efficient and environmentally friendly compared to Ethereum. Another reason is financial inclusion.\n\nCardano\u2019s mission to bank the unbanked resonates with me. Their focus on empowering developing countries and providing access to the global economy can have a life-changing impact on millions of people.\n\nAlonzo upgrade of Cardano provides a better outcome\n\nCardano also has a better smart contract capability with the recent launch of the Alonzo upgrade. It has become a viable option for developers seeking to build decentralized applications. This, in addition to its interoperability, influenced his decision and possibly all NFT projects moving to Cardano.\n\nInteroperability: Cardano is built with interoperability in mind, aiming to connect with other blockchains and legacy systems. This is crucial for the future of cryptocurrencies and seamless integration with the broader financial ecosystem. In conclusion, while I appreciate the innovations #Ethereum has brought to the table, I believe #Cardano is better positioned for the future of decentralized finance and applications.\n\nWhile Ethereum remains the most popular platform for minting NFTs, layer 1 blockchains and layer 2 networks are recording increasing sales recently. Cardano (ADA), Polygon, and Solana are the hottest in the market with Cardano recording 86 percent sales in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe surge has been linked to two main projects, Goofy Gophers and Spacebudz that have over $70,000 in trading volume in the last 24 hours. Solana also recorded a jump in unique buyers and sellers on April 22. Mad Lads had so much demand that it had to delay its mint. This contributed to the $8 million of the $9.9 million in sales on April 22. Solana\u2019s sales volume has increased by 129 percent in the last seven days.\n\nAlso, NFT collection Y00ts, which recently migrated from Solana to Polygon has led to increased sales in the past days on the network.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

        "content": "On April 25th, the reState Foundation hosted a virtual talk between Vitalik Buterin, co-founder and inventor of Ethereum, and Sadhguru, the founder of the Isha Foundation. The topic of discussion was the intersection of technology and human consciousness. Blockchain technology is transforming the way humans interact with the digital world. This has prompted conversations among thought leaders from within and outside the industry about the implications of emerging technologies on the human experience.\n\nButerin started the conversation by highlighting that the core of blockchain technology is centered around human coordination and interaction. He explained that blockchain technology can help different groups of people collaborate across large distances on various kinds of projects. Technology makes it easier for people to recognize complicated identities and connect with one another on common ground.\n\nSadhguru pointed out that there is a growing gap between the rate of technological evolution and the progression of human ethical and consciousness development, with the latter lagging behind. He attributed this to the need for humans to identify with a group. According to the Indian mystic, this need for self-identification surrenders intelligence to \u201cprotecting and defending the identity\u201d of that group.\n\nSadhguru and Ethereum Co-founder take\n\nThe Ethereum Co-founder agreed with Sadhguru\u2019s assessment and added that emerging technologies would not solve all problems of users. But agreements and disagreements in the space have the potential to result in \u201crealized cooperation\u201d and learning opportunities. He believes that these are the kinds of ideas that people in Ethereum and related communities really care about.\n\nBoth speakers emphasized the importance of proper usage of technologies like blockchain. They pointed to the fact that humans are the \u201chighest level of technology\u201d and that by being mindful of this, we can improve the way we interact with technology. They believe that blockchain technology when implemented as a tool for greater understanding and raising human consciousness, can have a positive impact on the world.\n\nAs these new technologies continue to take precedence in the lives of users and in systems around the world, it is important to remember that humans are at the forefront of their development and implementation. The proper usage of blockchain technology will require a conscious effort to ensure that it is being used for the betterment of society. The Ethereum inventor encouraged listeners to be mindful of the role they play in this process and to use emerging technologies as a tool to improve the way humans interact with one another."
