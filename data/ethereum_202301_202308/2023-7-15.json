        "title": "Enterprise blockchain: 'Ethereum for Business' explains key use cases - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market has encountered its share of ups and downs over the past year, but blockchain technology continues to see impressive growth as businesses seek digital transformation.\n\nRecent findings from the market research platform, MarketsandMarkets, estimated the global blockchain market size to be $7.4 billion in 2022. While notable, the report indicates that the blockchain sector is expected to generate $94 billion in revenue by the end of 2027. If these findings are accurate, this will result in a compound annual growth rate of 66% from 2022 to 2027.\n\nBreaking down \u2018Ethereum for Business\u2019\n\nSpecifically speaking, many enterprises today are using the Ethereum blockchain to improve outdated business processes. Paul Brody, global blockchain leader for Ernst & Young (EY), told Cointelegraph that he believes the Ethereum network will drive the most growth for the enterprise blockchain market going forward.\n\nTo bring this to light, Brody recently published Ethereum for Business. According to Brody, this book intends to help non-technical, C-level executives and company leaders understand how and why Ethereum applies to specific use cases.\n\nBook cover. Source: University of Arkansas Press\n\nTo ease readers into the subject matter, Brody begins part one of the book by explaining how Ethereum works using relatable language. \u201cThere are three foundational concepts that are useful to understand \u2014 the distributed ledger, the programmable ledger, and consensus algorithm,\u201d he writes. Brody then explains that every \u201cfinancial system has a ledger,\u201d but notes that the difference between centralized, traditional systems and Ethereum is that \u201cEthereum\u2019s ledger is public and distributed to all participants.\u201d\n\nThe first chapter also explains the terminology associated with blockchain networks. Brody writes that \u201cbatches of transactions are known as \u2018blocks.\u2019\u201d He ends the chapter by mentioning that the Ethereum network is often attractive to business users because it offers the \u201cconvenience of an integrated digital business\u201d without a centralized market operator.\n\nBefore going in-depth on specific use cases, Brody spends the next few chapters of the book detailing terminology like wallets, tokens and smart contracts. For instance, in chapter four, he writes:\n\n\u201cIn Ethereum, both the money and the stuff can be represented as tokens, while the terms of the exchange between two parties can be captured in a smart contract.\u201d\n\nBrody adds that everything of value is stored in a wallet when using the Ethereum blockchain: \u201cWallets are just a name for a digital account where you can store your keys and the access rights to contacts and assets you control through those keys.\u201d\n\nRecent: AI in healthcare: New tech in diagnosis and patient care\n\nChapter five focuses on oracles; as Brody mentions, \u201centerprise transactions will require extensive use of oracles\u201d since external data sources will be essential for completing smart contracts for business purposes.\n\nThe information presented at the beginning of Brody\u2019s book is extremely useful for readers that may be new to the blockchain sector. The following chapters focus on concepts like privacy, which is a crucial consideration for enterprises leveraging blockchain.\n\nIn chapter six, Brody writes, \u201cThough enterprises require privacy, blockchains do not, by default, offer privacy.\u201d Given this, Brody focuses this section on privacy applications that can be applied to support enterprise transactions. Although Brody mentions at the beginning of the book that the read is not meant to promote EY\u2019s blockchain work, he does detail how Nightfall and Starlight \u2014 two privacy mechanisms created by EY \u2014 are used by businesses to ensure private blockchain transactions.\n\nReal-world enterprise Ethereum use cases\n\nPart two of Brody\u2019s book focuses on use cases and case studies. This section is probably the most interesting because it explains why the technology could be helpful for business processes.\n\nTokenization is heavily discussed in section two, with Brody writing that it is \u201cthe single most important thing enterprises can do in the blockchain space.\u201d He adds that tokenization is often the first decision that firms using blockchain make since this can be used to digitize assets that can be easily tracked and managed.\n\nAlthough Brody explains the difference between ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens, he emphasizes that the ERC-1155 standard is gaining traction among enterprises due to its blend of fungible and nonfungible properties. Brody shares that an EY client in the pharmaceutical industry is currently using ERC-1155 tokens to track serialized medicine packages. \u201cUsing the 1155 standard, this firm can mint large volumes of tokens and transfer them in big batches to distributors and others,\u201d he writes.\n\nBrody continues sharing real-world examples of how EY clients apply the Ethereum blockchain. For instance, he explains how Italian beer producer Peroni uses blockchain for traceability, allowing consumers to scan a QR code to understand how the beer was produced.\n\n\u201cThose looking at a beer non-fungible token (NFT) from Peroni on the Polygon PoS chain (an Ethereum side chain), will be able to see Peroni\u2019s final batch token as well as input tokens from the malt house and farms,\u201d writes Brody.\n\nIn addition to these use cases, Brody details how blockchain helps with supply chain management, contract management, carbon emission tracking, payments and more. He emphasizes in this section that \u201cBlockchains will do for business ecosystems what ERP [enterprise resource planning] did inside the single enterprise.\u201d\n\n\u2018Ethereum for Business\u2019 is educational, but blockchain is broad\n\nWhile Ethereum for Business provides an in-depth and clear view of enterprise Ethereum, readers should remember that the blockchain ecosystem is broad. There are a number of different blockchain networks that businesses can use aside from Ethereum.\n\nRecent: Bug bounties can help secure blockchain networks, but have mixed results\n\nYet it\u2019s notable that Brody\u2019s new book gives an in-depth overview of the Ethereum ecosystem, breaking down key concepts while providing real-world use cases. This is extremely important, as education around blockchain technology is still needed to drive mainstream adoption.\n\nThe views, thoughts, and opinions expressed here are the author\u2019s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."

        "title": "Will an Upcoming Tech Upgrade Send Ethereum Soaring? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Currently trading at a price of around $1,900, Ethereum (ETH 0.33%) is looking for its next big catalyst. While Ethereum is up by more than 60% year to date, it's still down significantly from the all-time high of $4,891.70 that it hit nearly two years ago. So it has plenty of potential upside.\n\nThat next big catalyst could be a blockchain upgrade that's tentatively scheduled to take place before the end of the year. In mid-2022, The Merge galvanized investors, and the crypto at one point rose 85% from the end of June to mid-August just before the upgrade took place in September. (The gain, of course, didn't last amid the brutal crypto winter.)\n\nCould this pending upgrade have a similarly positive impact?\n\nNot all tech upgrades are created equal\n\nAt the outset, it's important to differentiate between transformational upgrades and incremental upgrades. The Merge, which turned Ethereum from a proof-of-work blockchain into a proof-of-stake blockchain, was monumental. That helps to explain why there was so much investor excitement about The Merge.\n\nThe coming upgrade, known as Dencun (a mashup of \"Cancun\" and \"Deneb\"), will be more incremental. It has two goals: to reduce transaction fees on the Ethereum blockchain and to increase the network's throughput. In short, it will help Ethereum to run faster and cheaper, and that's certainly worthwhile. But is it really a big deal?\n\nThe answer will depend on how much of an impact Dencun has on blockchain performance. Right now, Ethereum's transaction fees (known as \"gas fees\") can become exorbitant during peak periods of demand. Thus, any change that brings down these fees significantly is certainly important. Moreover, Dencun is the next big step on Ethereum's path to becoming able to handle 100,000 transactions per second. That's a huge number. To put it into context, the Visa (V 1.20%) credit card network can handle about 65,000 transactions per second.\n\nThe big picture\n\nThe really exciting part, if you're a long-term crypto investor, is how the new upgrade fits into the bigger picture. Ethereum has planned a series of improvements as part of its long-term plan to ensure it remains a best-in-class blockchain. In November, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin released an updated roadmap for development, and Dencun is part of stage one of a five-stage process.\n\nTo put it another way, Ethereum is not resting on its laurels after The Merge. After this stage, which is known as The Surge, there will be The Scourge, The Verge, The Purge, and The Splurge. Even if each of these developmental stages lasts for only six months or so, that's still a solid two to three years more of regular improvements being made to the blockchain.\n\nShould you buy Ethereum?\n\nOn its own, Dencun might not be enough to make Ethereum soar. It's just an incremental change to help the blockchain run faster and smoother. Yes, it will improve scalability and efficiency, and it will introduce a new transaction type, but it's not a transformational change like The Merge.\n\nHowever, if you consider this tech upgrade as one step in a long-term process designed to make Ethereum a best-in-class blockchain, then it's an exciting story. Some crypto traders have even suggested that Ethereum could more than double in value to the $5,000 price level as a result of this upgrade.\n\nPersonally, I think that's expecting too much from this upgrade since the all-time high for Ethereum is just under $5,000, and that was during the peak of a huge bull market for risky assets like cryptocurrencies. But as more details about Dencun get released, and as more people understand how it could put Ethereum on the path to 100,000 transactions per second, then it's not out of the realm of possibility that the token will experience an extended rally heading into 2024. For that reason, I'm bullish on Ethereum's prospects."

        "content": "Dollar-pegged Stablecoin Can Be Borrowed Against Collateral Deposited In Aave\u2019s V3 Ethereum Market\n\nBy: Samuel Haig \u2022 Loading...\n\nDeFi News\n\nAave, the leading DeFi lending protocol, has launched its long-awaited GHO stablecoin on Ethereum.\n\nAave v3 users on Ethereum can now mint the stablecoin against assets deposited into the protocol. GHO offers a fixed interest rate of 1.5%, with AAVE stakers receiving a 30% discount.\n\nAave DAO\u2019s treasury will receive all fees generated from GHO. Aave v3 users can mint GHO against all collateral assets supplied to the protocol, allowing users to continue earning yield on their assets while accessing dollar-pegged liquidity. The stablecoin\u2019s initial debt ceiling is $100M.\n\n\u201c[GHO] makes borrowing on the Aave Protocol more competitive, provides more optionality for stablecoin users, and generates additional revenue for the Aave DAO by sending 100% of interest payments on GHO borrows to the DAO,\u201d Aave told The Defiant. \u201cThe goal is to create a decentralized and resilient stablecoin with no single points of failure or overexposure to\u2026 centralized or single-set assets.\u201d\n\nThe deployment follows the passing of a governance proposal on July 14 with near-unanimous support. GHO\u2019s code was audited four times before its mainnet launch. The price of AAVE is up nearly 60% in the past month.\n\nAAVE Performance vs ETH\n\nAave is seeking to capitalize on the demand for a good decentralized option in the stablecoin sector with GHO.\n\nConfidence in incumbent stablecoins was recently rattled, with each of the top four centralized stablecoins briefly depegging this year. The market capitalization of USDC, the second-largest stablecoin and a popular asset among DeFi protocols, also slumped 50% in the past 12 months, according to CoinGecko.\n\nAave said it developed GHO to enable a permissionless web3 financial ecosystem, touting its efficacy for DeFi, cross-border remittances, and micropayments applications.\n\nGovernance and Facilitators\n\nChaos Labs and Gauntlet, Aave DAO Risk Contributors, will take on the role of GHO Risk Steward for the first 60 days after its launch.\n\nDeFi Alpha Premium Content DeFi Daily | Weekdays\n\nDeFi Alpha Letter | Weekly\n\nDefiant Podcast Transcript | Weekly\n\nInbox Dump | Saturday\n\nWeekly Recap | Sunday Looking for Alpha? Become a premium member of The Defiant and join our DeFi Alpha community. Start for free\n\nPending approval via an accelerated 24-hour governance process, the steward can raise GHO\u2019s debt ceiling by up to 100% or move interest rates up or down by 50 basis points once every five days.\n\nMoving forward, the Aave DAO will oversee GHO governance. The DAO can change GHO\u2019s interest rate or debt ceiling, and appoint facilitators \u2014 entities that can trustlessly mint and burn GHO and integrate the stablecoin into other protocols. Prospective facilitators must apply by submitting a governance proposal in Aave DAO\u2019s forum.\n\nAave has already approved three GHO facilitators, starting with Aave v3 on Ethereum. Governance also greenlit the \u201cFlashmint Facilitator,\u201d \u2014 which allows users to take out flash loans, provided borrowing and repayment occur within the same Ethereum block.\n\nAave also said it will soon publish a proposal to launch the GHO Stability Module, which will support GHO\u2019s peg by facilitating one-to-one swaps between it and other stablecoins. Aave said it will also propose a strategy for multi-chain deployment soon.\n\nAave added that it plans to expand the collateral assets supported by GHO to include both \u201cblockchain and non-blockchain assets\u201d in the future.\n\nLens Integration\n\nAave told The Defiant that GHO may also play an important role within the ecosystem of its decentralized social protocol, Lens.\n\n\u201cGHO can be used as a form of payment for various actions that people can take on Lens \u2014 GHO can be unlocked as an asset that can be used for minting, tipping, donating and any other transaction involving payments,\u201d Aave said."

        "content": "Share:\n\nEthereum\u2019s EIP-4844 upgrade could kickstart a rally in Layer 2 tokens.\n\nThe reduction in gas fees due to the introduction of a new transaction format via this update could significantly help users.\n\nSome altcoins that could potentially rally in anticipation of this upgrade include Optimism, Arbitrum and Polygon.\n\nThe announcement of the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit caused crypto investors to flip bullish after being confused for the last month due to Bitcoin\u2019s rangebound movement. But with Ethereum Improvement Proposal 4844 or EIP-4844, things might get interesting for a certain set of altcoins.\n\nRead more: Ethereum Improvement Proposal EIP -4844 turns experts bullish, will ETH price rally?\n\nEthereum gas fees to improve vastly in EIP-4844\n\nEthereum (ETH) has already undergone major hard forks in the last few years, ranging from London Hardfork to the recent Merge upgrade. All of these code changes are aimed at making the Ethereum blockchain more secure and scalable while keeping it decentralized.\n\nThe latest in the line of upgrades is the EIP-4844, aka Shard Blob Transactions update, which is aimed at reducing gas fees by introducing a special transaction type. The official EIP website for Ethereum summarizes the goal of this upgrade as follows.\n\nIntroduce a new transaction format for \u2018blob-carrying transactions\u2019 which contain a large amount of data that cannot be accessed by EVM execution, but whose commitment can be accessed. The format is intended to be fully compatible with the format that will be used in full sharding.\"\n\nThis new transaction formation will be forward-compatible and will be used in future upgrades of sharding.\n\nWhy Layer 2 solutions are in the spotlight?\n\nIn addition to preparing the Ethereum blockchain for full dank sharding, the EIP-4844 will have a huge impact on gas fees. Despite the Merge or London hard fork, the gas fees for Layer 1 (L1) solutions are still high for many users. While Layer 2 (L2) solutions have reduced gas fees by three to eight times than L1 chains, it is still high for many retail investors.\n\nAlthough EIP-4844 is aimed at reducing gas fees for Ethereum\u2019s beacon chain, the benefits of it will inevitably be compounded for Layer 2 scaling solutions. Hence, this update will attract many investors to interact with L2 chains like Optimism (OP), Arbitrum (ARB), Polygon (MATIC/POL) and so on.\n\nWhile this speculative move will improve the fundamentals of L2 chains, it will also attract traders and prospective buyers looking to capitalize, which could trigger a massive rally for these altcoins."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nRecent data reveals that Ethereum (ETH) whales are significantly selling off their holdings. One such instance involved a transaction where a whale sold 4,549 ETH for approximately $8.78 million, at a price of $1,930 around 14 hours ago. Notably, this particular whale initially spent $6 million to buy 4,549 ETH at a price of $1,319 on Jan. 9, which means they made a profit of approximately $2.78 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis sell-off pattern among ETH whales might have been triggered by a strategic move to reap the benefits of the cryptocurrency's recent surge in value. This market situation largely stems from the positive court decision in favor of Ripple's XRP, which had a ripple effect on several other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum.\n\nA whale sold 4,549 $ETH for 8.78M $USDT at a price of $1,930 14 hrs ago.\n\n\n\nThis whale spent $6M to buy 4,549 $ETH at a price of $1,319 on Jan 9, and has earned $2.78M so far.https://t.co/pzSfTqYuPn pic.twitter.com/PEtWS9LXmE \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 16, 2023\n\nThe court's decision seems to have provided a significant boost to the overall cryptocurrency market sentiment, leading to a considerable price appreciation for several tokens, Ethereum included.\n\nSubsequent to the XRP court decision, Ethereum surged to around $2,000. This impressive rally undoubtedly offered an attractive profit-taking opportunity for ETH whales who had acquired their holdings at lower price levels. As such, the current ETH sell-off by whales could be a reflection of these large investors cashing in on their profits, an understandable move considering the crypto market's notorious volatility.\n\nHowever, as whales started selling, the price of Ethereum began to retreat from its $2,000 level, a natural market reaction to a substantial sell-off. This recent activity in the Ethereum market serves as a reminder of the significant influence whales can wield on crypto prices, often leading to sharp price fluctuations."

On Thursday, Ethereum hit $2,000 for the first time since May.\n\nWhile the latest CPI report, released on Wednesday, indicates that U.S. inflation is going down in line with expectations, it wasn\u2019t quite enough to send investors toward the two most popular cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe first substantial bit of altcoin news broke on Tuesday when Polygon (MATIC) began to surge following an uptick in network growth.\n\nOn Thursday, Polygon published a technical proposal for Polygon 2.0 and proposed the launch of a new native token for the network: POL token\u2014a kind of upgrade to MATIC.\n\nClearly, it was already a good week for Polygon holders, but things got even better on Thursday when a judge presiding over the Ripple vs SEC case ruled in favor of Ripple.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJudge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP \"is not necessarily a security on its face\u201d and programmatic sales of XRP to the public did not break securities laws, but some $728 million worth of institutional sales of XRP did qualify as securities offerings because they were sold to buyers who expected to profit in a common enterprise.\n\nThe news didn\u2019t just boost XRP, it also caused Polygon, Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA) to blow up by double digit percentages on Thursday. Crypto\u2019s total market cap surged 6% in the hours following to hit $1.3 trillion on Friday.\n\nAt the start of the weekend, all four altcoins were up by double digit percentages over the last seven days. XRP leads with an eye-popping 66% spike in price and currently trades at $0.72194.\n\nSolana blew up 33% and now trades at $27.44, Polygon rose 24% before settling to $0.8061 and Cardano added 22%, now $0.3299.\n\nOther particularly noteworthy rallies this week include Stellar\u2019s XLM, up 47% and now trades at $0.1316, Chainlink (LINK) added 14% to settle at $6.96, and Lido DAO (LDO) rallied 26% to trade at $2.37 as of this writing.\n\nThere were no major losses among the top thirty cryptocurrencies.\n\nCoinbase, Kraken and Crypto.com all announced they would all be relisting XRP after the momentous court ruling.\n\nFinally, regulators across the world are continuing to grapple with the growing crypto industry.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Monday, two high-level European Union institutions, the European Banking Authority and the European Securities and Markets Authority, both released new guidelines in the runup to the implementation of Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA), a comprehensive framework for governing the industry across all the bloc\u2019s 27 member states.\n\nMiCA comes into force on 30 June 2024.\n\nAnd on Tuesday, South Korea's Financial Services Commission (FSC) announced the implementation of rules, effective from January 2024, requiring crypto firms to submit detailed crypto disclosures in their financial statements."

        "title": "Arbitrum 101: The Future of Ethereum Scaling is Here! - Coinpedia Fintech News",
        "content": "Qadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nArbitrum is one of the most promising layer-2 scaling solutions for Ethereum. It offers a number of advantages over the Ethereum mainnet, including faster transaction speeds, lower fees, and full compatibility with existing Ethereum applications.\n\nAs the Ethereum ecosystem continues to grow, Arbitrum is poised to play a major role in enabling its scalability and adoption.\n\nWhat will you learn in this article?\n\nWhat is Arbitrum and how does it work?\n\nThe benefits of using Arbitrum\n\nThe risks associated with Arbitrum\n\nThe Arbitrum ecosystem\n\nThe future of Arbitrum\n\nWe know you can\u2019t wait to get started. Dive in!\n\nKey Takeaways Layer 2 scaling solutions like Arbitrum offer faster and cheaper transactions to solve Ethereum\u2019s scaling problems.It uses optimistic rollup to batch transactions and execute them off-chain.It is one of the fastest growing Layer-2 solutions, with over 50% YoY growth in developers.\n\n1. What is Arbitrum?\n\nA layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, Arbitrum is devised to work on the scalability and reduce the high gas fees linked to the Ethereum network. It is operating as a sidechain which runs with Ethereum mainnet and offers faster and cheaper transactions.\n\nIt is compatible with Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts which makes the developers port their existing Ethereum applications to Arbitrum with very minimum modifications.\n\nIt uses an \u201coptimistic rollup\u201d approach which makes sure that most transactions are processed off-chain and validated on-chain, thus reducing the load on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nAs the transactions are processed off-chain, there is much lower gas fees in comparison to Ethereum.\n\nIt relies on Ethereum\u2019s security for dispute resolution.\n\nIt is compatible with Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem.\n\n1.1. Overview\n\nIn 2018, a team of researchers and engineers established Offchain Labs, laying the foundation for what would become Arbitrum. The primary objective was to tackle the scalability and high gas fee issues plaguing Ethereum. In 2019, Offchain Labs introduced the alpha version of Arbitrum, a proof-of-concept showcasing its advanced rollup technology. The most significant milestone came in 2021 with the launch of Arbitrum One, the mainnet version of Arbitrum. This marked a major step towards providing a layer-2 solution for the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n1.2. How Does it Work?\n\nLet us consider Arbitrum as a super-fast and cost-effective express line for the Ethereum network.\n\nWhen someone wants to work with Ethereum, like trading, he can send the transaction to Arbitrum instead of the main Ethereum line.\n\nArbitrum processes the work off-chain, just like a secret shortcut, making things super quick without dealing with heavy traffic.\n\nOnce a transaction is processed on Arbitrum\u2019s express line , one gets a ticket faster. It is verified on Ethereum\u2019s main line which is slower but secure.\n\nArbitrum takes less fees for faster rides as its work is mostly off-chain.\n\nIn case of disputes, Ethereum\u2019s security guards (its decentralised network) step in to rectify everything.\n\nIt makes using Ethereum faster and cheaper by using a very wise shortcut.\n\n1.3. Deciphering Layer 2 Scaling\n\nLayer 2 scaling is akin to adding an extra express highway alongside the main road to reduce traffic congestion. In the cryptocurrency world, it involves creating a secondary layer parallel to the primary blockchain, enabling faster and more cost-effective transaction processing. This secondary layer can manage numerous transactions without overburdening the primary blockchain, enhancing overall system efficiency.\n\n1.4. The Arbitrum Airdrop\n\nAn Airdrop refers to the distribution of tokens to eligible users who actively engage with the Arbitrum Layer 2 scaling solution. Here\u2019s how the Arbitrum Airdrop operates:\n\nTo qualify, users must interact with the Arbitrum network, whether by using DApps or conducting transactions on Arbitrum Layer 2.\n\nThe Airdrop team takes a \u201csnapshot\u201d of the Ethereum blockchain at a specific block height, recording the addresses and balances of users active on Arbitrum up to that point.\n\nAfter the snapshot, tokens are distributed to eligible addresses on a one-to-one basis.\n\nIn some cases, users may need to claim their tokens through a website or transaction.\n\nOnce received, these tokens can be used in various ways.\n\nArbitrum airdrops reward early adopters and promote blockchain technology usage, fostering the growth of the ecosystem. One of the highly anticipated airdrops in 2023 is $ARB, with specific criteria for \u201cactive\u201d user qualification.\n\n1.5. The ARB Token in Focus\n\nARB is the native ERC-20 compatible governance token for the Arbitrum network, serving various functions, including value transfer, investment, and governance voting. The initial supply of $ARB at launch was 10 billion, with a 2% annual inflation rate. In March 2023, approximately 12.75% of the total supply was distributed among eligible users and DAOs, resulting in a circulating supply of around 1.275 billion $ARB.\n\nARB tokens grant users a voice in Arbitrum DAO governance. The DAO plays a pivotal role in decision-making regarding fund allocation, protocol operations, and system investments. These decisions are made transparently on platforms like Snapshot.org, where users can cast their votes. ARB token holders also participate in the election of members for the security council, a 12-member team responsible for managing the treasury wallet.\n\n2. What is the Arbitrum Bridge?\n\nIt is a mechanism which allows a user to move his assets between Ethereum blockchain (Layer 1) and Arbitrum Layer 2 network. It is like a bridge connecting two stations, Ethereum mainnet and Arbitrum Layer 2.\n\nTo use it, first deposit the assets, Ether (ETH) or other tokens, into a smart contract on Ethereum mainnet.\n\nAfter depositing the assets, initiate a transfer through Arbitrum bridge by sending a request or transaction from Ethereum to Arbitrum.\n\nOnce a request is received, it processes it on the Arbitrum layer 2 network. The assets become available on Arbitrum, where they can be used for faster and cheaper transactions.\n\nThe assets can be moved back to Ethereum mainnet by initiating a withdrawal from Arbitrum bridge. The bridge would release the assets on Ethereum, and they become available on Ethereum again.\n\n3. Key Benefits of Arbitrum\n\nArbitrum offers several advantages, making it a compelling choice for Ethereum users and developers:\n\nTransaction Acceleration: Arbitrum significantly accelerates transaction processing, supporting a high number of transactions per second. This enhanced speed results in quicker and more efficient interactions with DApps.

        "content": "CLabs, the organization responsible for developing the Celo blockchain, is seeking to return to the Ethereum ecosystem by transitioning from an independent EVM-compatible layer-1 blockchain to an Ethereum layer-2 solution.\n\nAccording to a proposal discussion on Celo\u2019s governance forum, the transition would include leveraging OP Stack as the architecture to become an Ethereum L2 blockchain, eliminating the need to monitor tooling and libraries composability through upgrades, thus \u201cmaking it easy for Celo developers to utilize the full gambit of Ethereum tooling/libraries.\u201d\n\nOther key differentiating factors would include an off-chain data availability layer operated by Ethereum node operators and protected by restaked Ether (ETH), along with transforming current validators into decentralized sequencers for L2.\n\nLayer-1 and Layer-2 blockchains differ primarily in purpose, but also in their design and architecture. While L1 networks are designed to be self-sufficient, L2 solutions are aimed at enhancing the performance of L1 blockchains rather than operating independently.\n\ncLabs proposed upgrade. Source: Celo's governance forum\n\nBenefits from the transition were said to include increased security while maintaining low gas fees. \u201cWe expect no material change of gas fees. As the proposal is for an L2 solution with off-chain data availability, gas costs can be a lot lower than on other L2s,\u201d reads the proposal, scheduled to be discussed on a governance call on July 21 before being released for a \u201ctemperature check\u201d on the following day.\n\nBy adopting the proposal, end-users would not be affected by the migration, and CELO tokenholders would retain control over core contracts by voting on governance proposals. Additionally, CELO tokens will also be used to pay for gas.\n\nAlthough the transition seems purely technical, it may affect the Celo ecosystem in different ways. As per the forum discussion, it could potentially enable more liquidity to flow between Celo and other chains but also generate extra costs for sequencers, such as fees on the data availability layer and gas on Ethereum. In addition, it is also unclear whether sequencers' rewards would match with current validators\u2019 rewards.\n\nWith blockchains becoming increasingly competitive, Celo has been working on improving its mobile experience by incorporating increased functionality and particular features. The Celo ecosystem is also targeting developing economies, where more technological solutions for payments are in demand.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: Here\u2019s how Ethereum\u2019s ZK-rollups can become interoperable"

        "title": "Azuki NFTs: Ethereum Blue-Chip or Hollow Cash Grab? - DailyCoin",
        "content": "Love them or hate them, Azuki NFTs are everywhere. These anime-style Avatars are some of the most recognizable PFPs in the NFT market, second only to Yuga Labs\u2019 Bored Ape Yacht Club.\n\nThe Azuki story is as polarizing as it is compelling. While Azuki NFT collections have boasted astronomic price appreciation and explosive trading volume, the ecosystem has been tarnished by a dark history of failed projects and disappointing new collections.\n\nDespite its flawed reputation, the Azuki NFT ecosystem has been a trendsetter within the cryptocurrency space. The Azuki community has been through multiple baptisms of fire and come out the other side uncharred and unfazed.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll take the Red Bean and go down the Rabbit Hole to explore all the non-fungible tokens and FUD that shape this mysterious and iconic Web3 startup.\n\nWhat Are Azuki NFTs?\n\nInitially, Azuki NFTs were a collection of 10,000 unique digital avatars, each boasting a distinctive Japanese anime-themed design. Launched in January 2022 by a group of artists based in Los Angeles, Azuki\u2019s skyrocketed in popularity, becoming a sensation in the Ethereum (ETH) NFT community.\n\nSince then, the Azuki Ecosystem has expanded, with multiple NFT collections and a tight-knit Web3 community. Ownership of an Azuki avatar grants access to a range of exclusive benefits, including Whitelist opportunities for new NFT drops, collaborations with streetwear brands, and invitations to live events.\n\nThis is all part of the Azuki vision to create a vibrant and interactive community known as The Garden, where artists, builders, and Web3 enthusiasts put their creative heads together to shape the future of the decentralized internet.\n\nThe Azuki Metaverse\n\nIf The Garden represents the beating heart of the Azuki community, Hilumia is the thriving on-chain Metaverse that will host Azuki\u2019s digital experience.\n\nHilumia development is still in its early stages, so it\u2019s still not completely clear what this blockchain-based digital universe will look like. The Azuki Metaverse is divided into ten separate areas, including a Skatepark, Dojo, and Arcade.\n\nWhat\u2019s Growing in The Garden: Azuki Collections\n\nA range of NFT collections have taken root and sprouted with the Azuki Garden. Each collection represents a different aspect of the Azuki universe, offering a diverse range of digital assets for collectors and enthusiasts.\n\nAzuki Main Collection\n\nThe Azuki main collection is the cornerstone of the Azuki universe. Launched in January 2022 through a Dutch Auction, Azukis are 10,000 unique digital avatars, each hand-drawn and boasting an anime-inspired aesthetic. These avatars have quickly gained popularity for their distinctive style and the unique traits they possess.\n\nDuring the initial mint, the Azuki NFT collection sold out in minutes, registering about $30 million USD in sales, trending on NFT marketplaces like OpenSea, and catapulting Azuki into the spotlight of the NFT world.\n\nEach Azuki avatar is a unique piece of digital art, with individual characteristics that set it apart from the rest. From different hairstyles and clothing to unique accessories like swords, skateboards, and boomboxes, the diversity of Azuki avatars mirrors the community\u2019s diversity.\n\nLike Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs, an Azuki pfp is one of the most popular digital flexes. Repping an Azuki NFT on social media is a sure way to get noticed within NFT circles.\n\nBeanz\n\nIn a bid to make entrance to The Garden more accessible and reward existing holders, Azuki Beanz sprouted from the dirt. Chiru Labs, the team behind the Azuki ecosystem, describes Beanz as sidekicks that help expand the wider Azuki community.\n\nDuring the Beanz airdrop, Azuki holders were gifted two new NFTs. At their all-time high, Beanz fetched 5 ETH on NFT Marketplaces. The Beanz airdrop was considered a shining success that not only rewarded loyal members of the Azuki community but also added a new layer of intrigue and anticipation around the Beanz collection.\n\nAzuki Elementals\n\nIf you can\u2019t tell the difference between OG Azuki\u2019s and Azuki Elementals, you\u2019re not alone. The release of Chiru Labs new collection was met with both anticipation and controversy. Despite raking in $38 million USD within 15 minutes of its release, the Elementals collection faced overwhelming criticism from community members.\n\nCan you blame them? Azuki Elementals are so similar in appearance to the original collection that many loyal supporters abandoned The Garden, calling Chiru Labs nothing more than grifters and cash-grab artists guilty of extracting millions from the NFT space.\n\nWhile there are slight differences and the occasional Animal avatar, the similarities in design and aesthetic led to a significant backlash, with critics arguing that the Azuki Elementals felt like a cheaper and diluted version of the main collection. In the wake of the controversy, Azuki ecosystem floor prices dumped by over 40%.\n\nIn a desperate bid to stop the flow of criticism from the crypto community, Chiru Labs acknowledged that they\u2019d made a blunder and pledged to improve communication and execution in the future.\n\nGolden Skateboards\n\nAzuki Golden Skateboards are perhaps the most daring and innovative product released by Chiru Labs. In a bold fusion of the physical and digital realms, Azuki made waves by auctioning eight Golden Skateboard NFTs. This creative auction raised a staggering $2.5 million and introduced a new concept to the NFT space: PBTs (Physically-Backed Tokens)\n\nThe Golden Skateboards are not just digital assets; they\u2019re tied to tangible, gold-plated skateboards that can be redeemed by burning the NFT. Weighing in at 45 pounds each, these skateboards are not recommended for riding but would make a statement as a physical piece of luxury art.\n\nThanks to a cryptographic \u2018BEAN chip\u2019 implanted in each board, the physical skateboards can be transferred digitally, separate from the original NFT. This unique blend of the material and digital worlds is a new take on the burgeoning \u201cphygital\u201d collectibles market.\n\nWhether holders of the Golden Skateboards choose to redeem their tokens for the physical skateboard or hold for resale value remains to be seen. But one thing is clear: Azuki\u2019s Golden Skateboards have added a new dimension to the NFT landscape, pushing the boundaries of what\u2019s possible in the intersection of physical and digital collectibles.\n\nA Murky Past: Azuki History\n\nThe journey of Azuki has been a fascinating one, marked by rapid success, ambitious innovation, and a fair share of controversy.\n\nZagabond, the Azuki founder, has a shady past. He\u2019s faced criticism due to his association with previous projects that did not meet expectations. Prior to launching Azuki, Zagabond was involved with projects such as Cryptophunks, Cryptozunks, and Tendies. All of these collections failed to gain traction and ultimately did not succeed, with some being considered downright rugpulls that Zagabond abandoned.\n\nAzuki detractors suggest that these past failures as a cause for concern, questioning whether Azuki could suffer a similar fate. Some members of the NFT community have expressed skepticism about Zagabond\u2019s ability to deliver on the ambitious promises made by the Azuki project, given the track record of his previous ventures.\n\nOf course, supporters of Azuki argue that it\u2019s not all doom and gloom in the Garden. Past failures do not necessarily predict future outcomes. Azuki fans quickly point out Azuki\u2019s rapid success and innovation as evidence of Zagabond\u2019s ability to learn from past mistakes and adapt.\n\nDespite the controversy, Azuki has managed to carve out a significant place for itself in the NFT landscape, demonstrating that it is possible to overcome past setbacks and achieve success in the dynamic and often unpredictable world of NFTs.\n\nWhether they overcome the fallout of the Azuki Elementals debacle remains to be seen.\n\nAzuki Pros and Cons\n\nNFTs are a speculative asset class at best.

The fallout from the Elementals release has many collectors losing faith in Azuki\u2019s future.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nAzuki NFTs are an art-driven project. For collectors passionate about digital art and online communities, Azuki NFTs might be just what they\u2019re looking for, as opposed to an investment vehicle.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nThe Azuki NFT Ecosystem is arguablely the largest outside Yuga Labs. Azuki inspired dozens of similar NFT collections to adopt anime-inspired art or side-facing pfps. Despite Azuki\u2019s criticism, they have proven to set trends for others to follow.\n\nFAQs"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nA new protocol that lets people create and share digital objects on Ethereum has hit a major setback, according to its creator, who said the Ethscriptions main marketplace had been hacked.\n\nLaunched last month by Tom Lehman, co-founder and former CEO of Genius.com, Ethscriptions is a novel way to create Ethereum assets that leverage transaction \u201ccalldata\u201d to write non-financial data to the network\u2019s blockchain.\n\nThe Ethscriptions\u2019 protocol itself and other applications that tap the technology haven\u2019t been impacted, Lehman said. Yet, a sizable number of Ethscriptions listed on Ethscriptions.com have been stolen, Lehman said on Twitter on Friday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAbout 123 individual addresses lost a total of about 202 ethscriptions in this exploit,\u201d he said. \u201cAny young protocol will have bumpy landings, but this is definitely not what I meant.\u201d\n\nhttps://t.co/ZcR9HKlexS Marketplace Security Incident Update In this Tweet I\u2019m going to walk you through how the exploit happened and what we are doing about it. First, to be clear, this was not a vulnerability in the Ethscriptions Protocol. This was a vulnerability in one\u2026 pic.twitter.com/i5Q0W2PRMQ \u2014 Middlemarch (@dumbnamenumbers) July 12, 2023\n\nIn terms of value, it\u2019s unclear exactly how much was lost in connection with the exploit. But according to data from NFT marketplace OpenSea, some inscriptions have sold for as much as 5 Ethereum or around $9,600 in the past month.\n\nLehman told Decrypt that, regarding the Ethscriptions lost, \u201cit\u2019s all terrible,\u201d but he specifically lamented the theft of Ethscription #56, describing it as \u201cbrutal\u201d and pointing to the rarity often ascribed to earlier artifacts.\n\nThe exploit also has a particular sting, Lehman said, because it was meant to serve as an example that other marketplaces building out support for Ethscriptions could lean on.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe purpose of the marketplace was basically to help show other people how to create marketplaces and help build an ecosystem,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, we fell on our face in that area.\u201d\n\nLehman claimed responsibility for the failure, explaining the exploit could be traced to a smart contract that he and Indelible Labs co-founder Michael Hirsch created. A snippet of code allowed people to withdraw Ethscriptions that they didn't own from the marketplace.\n\n\u201cPart of the challenge with this new protocol is that you save a bunch of money from limiting the use of smart contract storage, but then you have to be more strategic surrounding how you use contracts in cases like marketplaces,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to figure out a way to either give smart contracts information or make it so smart contracts don\u2019t need that information.\u201d\n\nThe Ethscriptions.com marketplace will be relaunched once necessary changes are made to the protocol itself, according to Lehman, who said he\u2019s been in contact with many of those impacted by the exploit. He praised them on Twitter as \u201cthe earliest adopters\u201d of the Ethscriptions protocol.\n\nEthscriptions are distinct compared to traditional NFTs, stored in transaction-level data as opposed to being tokens issued on Ethereum by smart contracts, like in the case of the ERC-721 token standard. According to a Dune Analytics dashboard, around 474,000 Ethscriptions have been created so far.\n\nThe protocol\u2019s emergence follows Ordinals\u2019 rise in popularity, used for creating NFT-like assets on Bitcoin, which has led to a new wave of experimentation with crypto\u2019s oldest coin.\n\nLehman drew attention to the exploit on July 14. Days later, a disclaimer about the impacted state of the marketplace remains. A warning on Ethscriptions.com reads, \u201cThere is an issue with the marketplace contract! Withdraw your Ethscriptions and do not create new listings!\u201d"

        "content": "Even though the past month was filled with fear, uncertainty, and doubt (commonly referred to as FUD) due to regulatory scrutiny from the United States SEC, it appears that the sentiment around the cryptocurrency market is becoming more positive.\n\nIn this line, an anonymous whale shows solid support for Ethereum (ETH) as it seems to be accumulating over $125 million of the digital asset since June 8, according to on-chain data reported by Lookonchain.\n\nSince June 8, 2023, the Ethereum whale\u2019s address \u201c0x882\u202649732\u201d has withdrawn a total of 64,400 ETH ($125M) from exchanges and then staked 36,640 ETH ($71M), accounting for a 57% of the total transaction. Notably, the most recent withdrawal was made this Friday (14), for a 7,300 ETH ($14M).\n\nThe withdrawals took place in the last 44 days, as follows \u2014 according to data from the Ethereum blockchain on etherscan:\n\n20,000 ETH on June 8;\n\n6,500 ETH on June 23;\n\n8,100 ETH on June 27;\n\n15,500 ETH on June 30;\n\n7,000 ETH on July 13;\n\n7,300 ETH on July 14.\n\nWhy it\u2019s important?\n\nThese big transactions are important because a whale is usually known for owning a wallet address with high balances of a specific cryptocurrency, whose actions could directly impact the coin\u2019s price or form general sentiment around the digital asset.\n\nBy staking the majority of such a valuable sequence of withdrawals, this anonymous whale is sending a clear message that, potentially, there are no plans to sell ETH soon, which is a solid sign of support for the Ethereum network as a whole.\n\nNotably, to become a validator and generate yield, the user needs to invest (or stake) a minimum of 32 ETH, which then are locked into a smart contract. Later, validators are monetarily rewarded for their stake and participation.\n\nAs of the time of writing, ETH is being traded for $1,941, according to CoinMarketCap\u2019s price index.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price chart from June 8 to July 15. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nMarket pivots after a tough month\n\nThe first days of the last month (June) were filled with negative sentiments due to the SEC\u2019s lawsuits against two of the biggest crypto exchanges in the United States: Binance and Coinbase.\n\nHowever, the cryptocurrency market pivoted on Thursday (13th) after an apparently calm week start from Monday to Wednesday. A court decision on the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit triggered a sentiment change for all crypto assets.\n\nAs a result, most altcoins surged as Bitcoin Dominance fell below 50% of the entire market\u2019s capitalization after weeks of BTC receiving all the protagonism on price performance versus its competitors."
