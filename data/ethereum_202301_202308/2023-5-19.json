        "content": "Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency network by market capitalization after Bitcoin. The Ethereum blockchain is more versatile than Bitcoin, serving as a \u201cworld computer\u201d of sorts. It supports decentralized programs called smart contracts that let anyone spin up new tokens and run applications.\n\nEthereum is the brainchild of Vitalik Buterin, who launched the network in 2015 when he was just 21 years old. In the spirit of decentralization, Buterin stepped back from building the network, but he remains its de facto philosopher-king and an inspiration for developers who work under the banner of a nonprofit called the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nEthereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), is popular among speculators but also serves a practical purpose. It is used to pay \u201cgas fees\u201d\u2014industry lingo for transaction fees on the Ethereum blockchain. Most actions on Ethereum, such as sending tokens or buying an NFT, cost \u201cgas\u201d that\u2019s paid for in ETH, with the amount varying according to network congestion.\n\nThe supply of ETH isn\u2019t capped, but the network has a mechanism called EIP-1559, which removes some ETH, paid in gas, out of circulation. When network traffic is busy enough, Ethereum\u2019s coin issuance becomes deflationary when more ETH is burned than minted.\n\nEthereum\u2019s network becomes congested and expensive to use when the crypto market heats up. This has spurred the adoption of so-called \u201cLayer-2\u201d solutions\u2014secondary blockchains that offer a cheaper way to process transactions but that are ultimately recorded on the main Ethereum blockchain.\n\nEthereum\u2019s programmability attracted a marketplace of decentralized finance applications (DeFi) that at its peak in November 2021 commanded $111 billion worth of digital assets. Ethereum is also home to a sprawling industry of NFTs, or non-fungible tokens\u2014unique tokens that represent ownership of digital assets such as images or music.\n\nLike the rest of crypto, Ethereum\u2019s DeFi and NFT markets are volatile and filled with scams. Anyone can launch smart contracts, some of which contain malicious pieces of code that drain funds from user wallets. In the first eight months of 2022, scammers siphoned $1.6 billion from Ethereum wallets.\n\nEthereum initially relied on the same energy-intensive process as Bitcoin to build and maintain its blockchain ledger. But in September of 2022, it switched to a \u201cproof-of-stake\u201d system that relies on so-called validators to process transactions. The switch, which saw Ethereum reduce its energy consumption by more than 99%, was regarded as an impressive technological feat.\n\nEthereum is currently in the process of implementing a series of additional upgrades that will make it faster and cheaper to use.\n\n\n\nGo deeper:\n\nEthereum white paper\u2014Vitalik Buterin\n\n\n\nSee also:\n\nLayer 1 vs. Layer 2\n\nWhat is DeFi?\n\nWhat are NFTs?\n\n\n\nTry it:\n\nEtherscan\u2014Ethereum\u2019s blockchain explorer"

        "title": "We Asked ChatGPT If Ethereum\u2019s Price Can Flip Bitcoin in the Next 5 Years, Here\u2019s the Answer - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "A topic as old as time, if time was a few years old \u2013 will Ethereum flip Bitcoin in terms of total market cap? Will ETH overtake BTC?\n\nThis has been the \u201cto be or not to be\u201d in the cryptocurrency industry, and it pins communities against each other like no other. It\u2019s true that BTC has been the predominant market leader ever since it has been created, but a few years ago, who would have thought that another cryptocurrency would have a market cap worth over 40% of Bitcoin\u2019s? Well, that\u2019s the case for Ethereum today.\n\nSo, we decided to do what any sane person in 2023 would do \u2013 ask an AI language model what it (?) thinks. ChatGPT is all the rage in 2023, so who better to ask?\n\nCan Ethereum Flip Bitcoin?\n\nFirst things first, we prompted ChatGPT with this exact question: \u201cDo you think Ethereum\u2019s price can flip Bitcoin\u2019s price in the next 5 years?\u201d\n\nThe AI came back to us, explaining that this is an outcome that\u2019s \u201cuncertain and depends on various factors.\u201d\n\nThese include:\n\nAdoption Rates\n\nAccording to ChatGPT, Ethereum\u2019s robust ecosystem and use cases, such as DeFi, NFTs, and whatnot, could help it flip Bitcoin.\n\nEthereum\u2019s broader use cases, such as DeFi (Decentralized Finance), NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), and smart contracts, could potentially drive wider adoption and thus increase its value relative to Bitcoin.\n\nHere\u2019s where it got kind of interesting. You see, ChatGPT\u2019s most recent knowledge cut-off on this topic was in September 2021. This means that it was before Ethereum transitioned to Proof-of-Stake.\n\nThat said, the second factor, according to the AI, is:\n\nNetwork Upgrades\n\nChatGPT argues that \u201cthe successful completion of Ethereum\u2019s planned upgrades, such as Ethereum 2.0, could significantly affect its price. This upgrade plans to improve the scalability, security, and sustainability of Ethereum, which could increase its attractiveness to investors and users.\u201d\n\nWell, Ethereum\u2019s transition to proof-of-stake, otherwise known as \u201cThe Merge,\u201d is already a fact in our timeline, and so far, it hasn\u2019t really helped it get there.\n\nWhat Else Could Help ETH Flip BTC?\n\nThe flippening can also take place under a few more conditions, according to ChatGPT. Regulation, for once, is among the factors.\n\nChanges in cryptocurrency regulation could impact prices. More restrictive regulations could lower prices, while more accommodating ones could raise them.\n\nWhile it does sound like an answer from Captain Obvious, it is true. Favorable regulation could push ETH\u2019s price, but so far, the US government has taken a predatory approach, calling many of the projects built on Ethereum securities.\n\nGoing forward, the AI believes that market sentiment is also important. If enough investors believe Ethereum to be the better form of investment, it would inevitably lead to the flippening.\n\nLast but not least, the broader economic factors, including inflation, economic growth, and overall changes in the financial sector, could also have an impact.\n\nIn conclusion, ChatGPT took a more cautious position and didn\u2019t provide a straightforward yes or no answer. This was somewhat expected, but it what arguments would an AI use to structure a response to a question of this kind.\n\nOf course, none of the above should be construed as financial advice.

        "title": "Ethereum Devs Issue Final Report on Finality SNAFU - Blockworks",
        "content": "One week ago, the Ethereum network encountered a finality glitch that caused significant angst within the project\u2019s developer community.\n\nThe problem stemmed from two consensus clients, including one of the leading clients, Prysm, spending too much computing resources on processing \u201cmostly worthless\u201d block attestations \u2014 a part of the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.\n\nIn a report issued by the team behind Prysm, the failure to finalize \u2014 while largely unnoticed by users \u2014 was worse the second time around on Friday. In one epoch, client participation fell to 30.7%, which the Prysm team says was \u201cthe lowest participation of any epoch in [Ethereum] Mainnet ever.\u201d\n\nThe Prysm client is run on 37.6% of Ethereum validating nodes, according to clientdiversity.org. It is developed by Prysmatic Labs, which was acquired by Offchain Labs \u2014 the developers of Arbitrum \u2014 in October 2022.\n\nAn Ethereum epoch is roughly 6.4 minutes and comprises 32 \u201cslots\u201d \u2014 read blocks in the blockchain \u2014 of 12 seconds each. The network failed to finalize on Friday for nine epochs (nearly an hour). This was long enough to trigger the first-ever \u201cinactivity leak\u201d mode, which penalizes validators that have stopped contributing to consensus.\n\nBut the damage was inconsequential: about $0.27 per validator.\n\n\u201cIn total, we estimate that 28 ETH of penalties were applied and validators missed 55 ETH or more of potential revenue,\u201d the Prysm team said. \u201cThis is less than 0.00015 ETH per validator.\u201d\n\nWhat went wrong\n\nPrysm\u2019s client began to struggle to handle incoming attestations with target checkpoints two epochs behind the then-current one. These valid attestations required clients to recalculate previous states of Ethereum\u2019s Beacon chain and caused Prysm clients to exhaust their resources, resulting in a failure to meet validator clients\u2019 requests promptly.\n\nIronically, contributing to the client\u2019s woes was the huge success of Ethereum staking post-Shapella, when withdrawals of staked ether became possible for the first time.\n\nA sharp increase in new validators requesting to join the Beacon chain since the start of May has pushed ETH staked net of withdrawals up by about 1.3 million, to a total 20.5 million \u2014 a value in dollar terms of more than $37 billion, on-chain data shows.\n\nThat has lengthened the queue to join the network by nearly 60,000 validators, meaning a new validator requesting to join today will not be active until some time in late June.\n\nBeacon chain clients were stressed by all these incoming ether staking deposits, the Offchain Labs report explained.\n\n\u201cWhen the beacon state was smaller, Prysm would be able to handle these attestations and recover appropriately. However, with the large spike in deposits and the growing validator registry size, Prysm was unable to recover this time,\u201d the team said.\n\nBug squashed\n\nThe Prysm client now ignores attestations for old blocks, which the report says are generally of no value to the network. Minority client Teku implemented a similar fix last weekend.\n\nThe current majority consensus client, Lighthouse, already was programmed to drop the problematic attestations and suffered no loss of liveness. The mere existence of client diversity has been largely credited with allowing the network to recover on its own without any manual intervention.\n\nAside from the technical stress on the software and hardware, the incident also took a toll on some members of the Ethereum community.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nEthereum\u2019s \u201ccommunity health consultant,\u201d known as Superphiz, for one, declared he was taking some time off from Twitter, to \u201cregain some physical fitness routines and mental clarity.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "VanEck\u2019s bullish scenario for Ether predicts a 27-fold price surge by 2030.\n\nThe asset manager says it expects Ethereum to remain the dominant blockchain settlement network.\n\nEther, the transactional cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, could be worth $300 by the year 2030. Or it could soar as high as $51,000.\n\nThis is according to a prediction by investment management firm VanEck \u2014 the company sees $11,800 as a \u201cbase case\u201d Ether price in a report released this month.\n\nBased on VanEck\u2019s predictions, Ether could be up 27-fold or be down 83% from its current $1,800 price in the next seven years.\n\nVanEck's prediction sees Ether trading between $300 and $51,000 by 2030 (Source: VanEck Research)\n\nFor the more bullish prediction: \u201cWe base these estimates on the thesis that Ethereum becomes the dominant open-source global settlement network, that hosts substantial portions of the commercial activity of business sectors with the highest potential to gain from moving their business functions to public blockchains.\u201d\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nVanEck doesn\u2019t outline its bear case, where the price could plunge to as low as $343. But in a volatile asset class, where blowups have littered the crypto industry over the past year, it\u2019s wise to hedge one\u2019s bets.\n\nVanEck\u2019s bull case for Ethereum\n\nVanEck sees Ethereum prevailing over other alternative layer 1 blockchain networks, even as more competitors with venture capital backing continue to enter the fray. VanEck noted that the firm has positions in Ether.\n\nEthereum\u2019s dominance of the smart contract blockchain space could have significant financial benefits for the project, according to VanEck\u2019s report. The investment manager predicts that Ethereum\u2019s annual revenue will hit $51 billion by 2030, a 20-fold increase from its current level.\n\n\u2018People are relying more and more on the Ethereum chain\u2019\n\nVanEck pinned this prediction to its expectation that Ether will become more than a transactional currency.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\n\u201cETH, while not a complete store of value like Bitcoin due to Ethereum\u2019s demonstrated mutability of code and an evolving social consensus focused on utility, will nevertheless become a store-of-value asset for state actors looking to maximise human capital (versus Bitcoin, which maximises for stranded energy),\u201d the report said.\n\nNOW READ: Why Ethereum is so dominant \u2014 and why it\u2019s not going anywhere\n\nEthereum\u2019s adoption is also expected to continue to grow, especially with the level of developer activity on the network, said Danny Chong, co-founder of yield management protocol Tranchess.\n\n\u201cPeople are relying more and more on the Ethereum chain, and confidence in it has continuously increased,\u201d Chong told DL News. \u201cI expect more institutions to become involved in staking. At the same time, the ecosystem has already grown exponentially, with many new types of protocols coming in to bolster the demand.\u201d\n\nThe dominant layer 1\n\nSeveral \u201cEthereum killers\u201d have been launched by different project teams. These networks often claimed to be superior to Ethereum by offering faster transaction speeds at cheaper costs.\n\nBut these cheaper-to-use alternative layer 1 chains have been unable to knock Ethereum off its perch. Ethereum continues to dominate all other layer 1 networks in terms of economic activity.\n\nIt currently controls a larger share of the decentralised finance market, accounting for more than half of the total value locked into DeFi protocols, DefiLlama data shows.\n\nSome of Ethereum\u2019s competitors have been affected by scandals. The Terra ecosystem collapsed in May 2022 and FTX, a major backer of the Solana blockchain, collapsed in November. The likes of Fantom, Harmony, and Waves have also not fared any better."

        "title": "Parity Technologies Suggests Hard Fork to Release Locked Ether - CCN.com",
        "content": "Parity Technologies, having suffered a multi-signature wallet bug that froze hundreds of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of Ether, noted ongoing issues with Ethereum in a recent blog suggesting a course of action to rescue the funds.\n\nFrom its very beginning, users of Ethereum have had to deal with a command line interface with little tolerance for errors, sending thousands of Ether to 0x0, the blog noted. Any transaction with an improperly formed \u201cto\u201d address was read as a delivery to 0x0.\n\nA few months later, a bug was found in a JavaScript utilities library that the Ethereum Foundation wrote and was used by numerous parties to generate wallets. This mishap affected one in 128 accounts produced by some teams and rendered useless. Thousands of additional Ethers got stuck.\n\nThe DAO hack and the subsequent fork delivered problems with transactions that replayed across both Ethereum and the Ethereum Classic network. These issues were not widely recognized to anticipate that Ethereum Classic would more than survive \u2013 it would thrive, but leading to several issues. Such as Ether deposits to contracts that were never deployed to the Ethereum network to begin with.\n\nEther Frozen\n\nAn incident recently occurred with the Parity multi-signature wallet in which the contract holding the code governing the wallets\u2019 behavior was deleted. Anyone with Ether tokens in Parity multi-signature wallets was unable to withdraw them.\n\nAll of the funds are not recoverable without a change to blockchain\u2019s state, consensus rules modification or opcode upgrades, the blog noted. One can assume this was not the intention of the developers and users who deployed the contracts or sent the transactions.\n\nThere have been other issues. It has been too easy to have a typo in an address and end up sending Ether to the wrong address. Unfortunately, such errors can never be proven to be non-recoverable like the addresses where the Ethers sit and are valid and usable.\n\nNumerous Factors Involved\n\nNo one should think that unlocking the stuck funds will amount to anything but a rescue operation, which only would be possible with a hard fork. The protocol in some cases was at fault. Client usability issues and issues with codebase maintained by both private parties and the Foundation code, the unanticipated appearance of a competitor network and simple user error have added to the present state of affairs.\n\nEthereum remains solid and continues to evolve, the blog stated.\n\nYet many millions of dollars have been lost to numerous groups on account of these and other issues. Much of it cannot be recovered on account of not being able to prove its status as lost or because of a lack of clarity in the sender\u2019s intention.\n\nSolutions Are Possible\n\nMuch of it can be recovered.\n\nA hard fork is contentious. It marks a change to how we had expected the network to act. The question is whether these changes to the network\u2019s expected behavior could bring negative effects when some users based their off- and on-chain behavior assuming behavior would not change. There are parallels to the earlier debate over changing the rate of issuance and its impact on miner behavior and incentives.\n\nThe problem of having such diverse roots should be expected and many solutions have been put forth ranging from partial coverage with strict rules on certain cases to solutions focusing on edge cases without strict definitions.\n\nVitalik put forth a discussion in EIP 156 which enables private key holders impacted by certain issues to withdraw their Ether. Cases covered by this proposal include contracts created without code, losses generated by the JavaScript library bug and losses on account of replay attacks.\n\nThis marks a partial coverage with a strict rules solution. Such cases have a clear owner who can be identified with fairly inexpensive computation on the chain. This proposal, therefore, gives no explicit favor to any particular account, application or user. Such an approach fails to cover the funds locked in the Parity multi-signature wallets since the contract itself has code, and it would not permit recovery of tokens besides Ether.\n\nAnother solution is to address specific Ether and tokens recovery, a solution addressing capturing as many edge cases as possible, but it is not tightly defined. The solution would need those that \u201chold the pen\u201d to define its scope. It is the most direct solution and would not alter the semantic behavior of the EVM but could address all cases raised previously.\n\nAlso read: Parity ponders hard fork fix for 160 million in frozen Ether\n\nChange The Protocol\n\nA third solution that Parity suggested is to change the protocol that would permit the resurgence of suicided contracts and deployment of contracts for all users going forward. This would revive the Parity multi-sig and other problems in which contract addresses hold funds but have not had code deployed to them. Such a solution would also safeguard future similar incidents.\n\nAnother partial coverage with a strict approach, this represents enough change in behavior of the EVM that it could amount to a functional change to the platform since it will no longer make transaction ordering the key factor in a contract address. Parity prefers this solution since it adds functionality for users through the details being debated.\n\nAccomplishing proper governance around protocol upgrades and hard forks on Ethereum has been ongoing. Consensus has been achieved on technical upgrades while non-enhancement hard forks have failed. The next discussion will be a critical test for how contention can transform into consensus.\n\nParity hopes the community will support rescuing the funds to help as many users as possible.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock."

        "content": "The number of ethereum (ETH) wallet addresses holding at least one wei has just reached a new all-time high of 99,355,406, data shows. ETH price has remained above $1,800, despite choppy markets.\n\nThe battle for supremacy between the bulls and bears continues. With the global crypto market capitalization still way below the $3 trillion mark reached in November 2021, on-chain metrics show strong investor confidence in ethereum.\n\nPer Glassnode, ether (ETH) wallet addresses with non-zero balances have increased to a new all-time high (ATH) of 99,355,406, a strong indication that investors are hodling onto their coins for higher gains.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/glassnodealerts/status/1659427537942970369\n\nSince hitting an all-time high of $4,876 in November 2021, the price of ether has continued to slide, hitting a low of $881.56 last June. This latest on-chain metric suggests that even retail investors are holding onto their coins despite the dip.\n\nYou might also like: Bitcoin and ethereum on a losing streak, DigiToads presale shows steady growth\n\nWhile the number of ethereum wallet addresses with at least the smallest unit of ETH (one wei) has increased, the case is different for ether whales, as the number of diamond hands holding 100+ ETH has hit a six-month low of 46,858.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/glassnodealerts/status/1658989770217848833\n\nThough one can\u2019t name the exact cause of this decline, it could result from increased staking activity and portfolio diversification by these whales, amongst other possible factors.\n\nAt the time of writing, ethereum is exchanging hands for $1,807.35, representing a 1% decline in the last 24 hours.

        "content": "Visa is experimenting with ERC-4337, or Account Abstraction, which offers an alternative solution to dealing with transaction fees.\n\nPayments giant Visa has been exploring new ways to process payments on the blockchain with respect to Account Abstraction.\n\nBlockchain data shows that Visa deployed two sets of Paymaster smart contracts on Ethereum\u2019s Goerli testnet. The firm detailed these experiments in a report published earlier this week, outlining the potential use cases of the contracts.\n\nThese experiments were based on the starter code released by the Ethereum Foundation and the core team of developers working on ERC-4337. The Account Abstraction proposal incorporates a new transaction flow, which makes the ERC-4337 wallets programmable to initiate transactions without the need for them to be authenticated with private keys.\n\nPart of the proposal is a new type of contract called paymaster, which can sponsor gas fees on behalf of a user.\n\nIn Visa\u2019s first experiment, the Paymaster contract tested the potential to facilitate ERC-20 tokens to pay for gas fees.\n\n\u201cWe are exploring whether a user can pay transaction fees with alternative tokens, such as a dollar stablecoin or, in the future, even a Central Bank Digital Currency,\u201d the team explained.\n\nThe second experiment involved a smart contract that covers the gas fee for user transactions. The sample implementation uses an allowlist, which means potential users need to be whitelisted to interact with the contract.\n\n\u201cA user who only has USDC and wants to pay a merchant for a product no longer needs to carry the native chain token. Instead, a paymaster can cover the gas fees (charge a small fee). The user would never need to buy/hold ETH,\u201d explained blockchain developer \u201c0xcygaar\u201d on Twitter.\n\n\u201cAccount abstraction will open up a whole new world of interactions with Ethereum (and other EVM chains), this is just the beginning,\u201d he added."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction 2025-2030: Fresh wave of panic as ETH falls below $1800 - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Disclaimer: The datasets shared in the following article have been compiled from a set of online resources and do not reflect AMBCrypto\u2019s own research on the subject.\n\nEthereum\u2019s [ETH] price remained in a bearish zone below the $1,840 mark throughout the last week. Ethereum started a fresh decline below the $1,800 level and showed a few bearish signs. The price went below the $1,780-price level as well.\n\nAt press time, ETH was trading barely above the $1,800-price level at $1804.\n\nIf there is a move above the $1,840 resistance level, the price might start a decent increase toward the $1,920 level. Any more gains above the $1,920 resistance zone could start a decent increase toward the $2,000 resistance.\n\nAccording to Beaconcha.in, around 1.97 million ETH, or roughly $3.6 billion, have been withdrawn by investors since the Shapella update. ETH balances on cryptocurrency exchanges haven\u2019t changed significantly, though, as of yet.\n\nLess Ether whales have historically increased the negative risk for the ETH price. Typically, whale activity serves as a leading market indicator. Consequently, an increase in prices and rich investor accumulation typically go hand in hand.\n\nThis is interesting, especially since after bottoming out in June 2022 at about $880, the price of ETH has more than doubled. This, despite several unfavourable developments such as the demise of FTX, a rise in interest rates, and stricter U.S. regulations.\n\nHere, it is important to note that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) calculates inflation or the rate of growth in product and service prices. As a result, traders and investors predict that the US Federal Reserve will opt to postpone or slow down its intentions to hike interest rates at its next meeting if the CPI report indicates a high level of inflation.\n\nRead Price Prediction for Ethereum (ETH) 2023-24\n\nSpeculations around Shanghai weren\u2019t without reason, however. Especially since ETH was once valued at over $3,700, just over a year ago.\n\nEven so, the short-term sell-off event that was expected to follow the update, one which will allow stakers to withdraw their vested tokens from Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake (PoS) smart contract, has not come to pass. At least, not yet.\n\nThe Ethereum community seems to be supportive of Coinbase\u2019s recently revealed layer-2 network, Base, which has been called a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d and a \u201chuge confidence vote\u201d for the blockchain network.\n\nBase, a layer-2 network driven by Optimism and secured on Ethereum, seeks to eventually develop into a network for creating decentralized applications (dApps) on the blockchain. According to Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, the layer-2 network is now in its testnet phase.\n\nThe move is \u201ca massive vote of confidence for Ethereum,\u201d according to Ryan Sean Adams, host of the Bankless Show. This could set a precedent for cryptocurrency businesses and financial institutions to use Ethereum as their preferred settlement layer.\n\nRecently, Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, donated $150,000 in ETH to Syrian and Turkish victims. Additionally, the native coin of the Ethereum blockchain, ETH, experienced a significant price drop after whales sold 350,000 ETH tokens.\n\nAccording to Diogo M\u00f3nica, co-founder and president of Anchorage Digital, a cryptocurrency bank with a market cap of over $3 billion, the Merge\u2019s success transformed Ethereum from \u201ca smart contract platform lagging behind\u201d into \u201csomething that was doing things properly.\u201d This is accurate: After the Merge, institutional interest in ETH staking rose, according to Matt Hougan, CIO at Bitwise Asset Management.\n\nAs ETH dominance has increased compared to other cryptocurrencies over the past few years, Ether\u2019s bullish setup vs Bitcoin is apparent. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum have consolidated over the week as the broader crypto market continues to enjoy a bullish spell.\n\nThe price of Ethereum has lately undergone a significant correction, yet the whales have been purchasing at every decline. The fifth-largest accumulation day in a year was recorded last week as ETH whale activity reached a new level. As the FTX problem developed over this month of November, Ethereum whales have been building up. According to a Santiment report,\n\n\u201cEthereum\u2019s large key addresses have been growing in number since the #FTX debacle in early November. Pictured are the key moments where shark & whale addresses have accumulated & dumped. The number of 100 to 100k $ETH addresses is at a 20-month high.\u201d\n\nIt almost reached the lows during the FTX collapse-driven meltdown of the cryptocurrency market, but it rapidly bounced back and was able to maintain above those levels as well. This strengthens the argument since Ethereum has typically outperformed Bitcoin.\n\nGiven everything, buying Ethereum must be a sound investment in the long term, right? Most experts have positive predictions for ETH. Furthermore, the bulk of long-term Ethereum price projections are upbeat.\n\nWhy are projections important?\n\nSince Ethereum has seen phenomenal growth in recent years, it is not surprising that investors are placing significant bets on this cryptocurrency. Ethereum gained traction after the price of Bitcoin dropped in 2020, following a protracted period of stagnation in 2018 and 2019.\n\nInterestingly, much of the altcoin market remained idle even after the halving. One of the few that picked up the momentum quickly is Ethereum. Ethereum had increased by 200% from its 2017 highs by the end of 2021.\n\nEthereum may experience such a spike thanks to several crucial factors. One of these is an upgrade to the Ethereum network, specifically a move to Ethereum 2.0. Another reason is the Ethereum tokenomics debate. With the switch to Ethereum 2.0, ether tokenomics will become even more deflationary. As a result, there won\u2019t be as many tokens on the market to meet increasing demand. The outcome might increase Ethereum\u2019s rising momentum in the future.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll take a quick look at the cryptocurrency market\u2019s recent performance, paying particular attention to market cap and volume. The most well-known analysts\u2019 and platforms\u2019 predictions will be summarized at the end, along with a look at the Fear & Greed Index to gauge market sentiment.\n\nEthereum\u2019s price, volume, and everything in between\n\nAt press time, ETH was trading at $1,804.84 with a market capitalization of over $217 billion. In the last 24 hours, ETH\u2019s value dipped by 1.3% on the charts.\n\nEven though it\u2019s difficult to forecast the price of a volatile cryptocurrency, most experts concur that ETH may once again cross the $4,000 barrier in 2023. And, according to a recent forecast by Bloomberg intelligence analyst Mike McGlone, the price of Ethereum will conclude the year between $4,000 and $4,500.\n\nAdditionally, according to a report by Kaiko last year, ETH\u2019s market share of trading volume will reach 50% parity with Bitcoin\u2019s for the first time in 2023.\n\nAccording to Kaiko, ETH outpaced Bitcoin in July last year as a result of significant inflows into the spot and derivative markets. Most exchanges have seen this surge, which can be an indication of returning investors. Additionally, a rise in average trade size is the exact reverse of what has been seen so far in 2022\u2019s downturn.\n\nIn fact, a majority of cryptocurrency influencers are bullish on Ethereum and anticipate it to reach incredible highs.\n\nWhile the broader Ethereum community was looking forward to the environment-friendly PoS update, a faction emerged in favor of a fork that will retain the energy-intensive PoW model.\n\nThe faction was mostly made up of miners who risk losing their investment in expensive mining equipment since the update would render their business model useless. Prominent Chinese miner Chandler Guo stated on Twitter that an ETHPoW is \u201ccoming soon\u201d.\n\nAt the time, Binance clarified that in the event of a fork which creates a new token, the ETH ticker will be reserved for the Ethereum PoS chain, adding that \u201cwithdrawals for the forked token will be supported\u201d. Stablecoin projects Tether and Circle both reiterated their exclusive support for the Ethereum PoS chain after the Merge.\n\nIn fact, PwC\u2019s Crypto-head Henri Arslanian claimed in an edition of First Mover that \u201cEthereum is the only show in town.\u201d However, investors will need to witness increased demand and functioning for Ether\u2019s price to keep climbing.\n\nAccording to investor and creator of the cryptocurrency research and media organization Token Metrics Ian Balina, \u201cI think Ethereum can go to $8,000.\u201d\n\nETH Whale Activity\n\nOn 27 March, blockchain analytics firm Santiment revealed that almost 90% of Ethereum\u2019s supply was stored in self-custody addresses. The last time the figure was so high was nearly eight years ago in 2015, shortly after the protocol\u2019s native token saw the light of day. This was happening as users are withdrawing their assets from Binance that is facing CFTC\u2019s investigation.\n\nThis essential all-time low ratio of ETH on exchanges (10.31%) indicated confidence from hodlers.\n\n?? #Ethereum is now being held in self custody and away from exchanges at the highest level since the week the token was introduced nearly 8 years ago. This essential all-time low ratio of $ETH on exchanges (10.31%) indicates confidence from #hodlers. https://t.co/VPwlCjzbAN pic.twitter.com/VB2r57xhQl \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) March 27, 2023\n\nData from blockchain analytics firm Santiment shows ETH supply held by the top addresses on crypto exchanges has been on the rise since early June. On the other hand, ETH supply held by the top non-exchange addresses i.e. ETH held in hardware wallets, digital wallets etc. has been declining since early June. But why June? Because it was around that time that a tentative timeline for the Merge was disclosed to the community.\n\nAlso, Santiment had tweeted that over the past 3 months, whales had beefed up their exchange holdings by 78%.\n\nSo what does this mean? It means that Ethereum whales are moving their ETH onto exchanges. Top ETH hodlers are taking their supply out of cold storage and moving it to exchanges, most likely to facilitate a quick transaction if needed.\n\nIn the run up to the merge, a number of exchanges like Coinbase and Binance announced that they will be suspending all ETH and ERC-20 token deposits and withdrawals, in order to ensure a seamless transition.\n\nIt is possible that the whales moved their holdings onto exchanges to either preemptively dump their holdings in anticipation of a price slump after the Merge. The other possibility is them waiting till well after the Merge to act on ETH\u2019s price action.\n\nLet\u2019s now look at what well-known platforms and analysts have to say about where they believe Ethereum will be in 2025 and 2030.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction 2025\n\nAccording to Changelly, the least expected price of ETH in 2025 is $5,174.38, while the maximum possible price is $6,102.62. The average expected trading cost is $5,358.79.\n\nDigitalCoinPrice is even more bullish in its assessment of ETH\u2019s future performance. It predicts that ETH will trade as low as $5,302.54 and as high as $6,506.43, with its average price being $5,833.66.\n\nHowever, you have to remember that the year is 2025, and a lot of these projections are based on Ethereum 2.0 launching and performing successfully. And by that, it means Ethereum has to solve its high-cost gas fees issues as well. Also, global regulatory and legislative frameworks have not yet consistently backed cryptocurrencies.\n\nHowever, even though newer and more environmentally friendly technologies have been developed, analysts frequently claim that Ethereum\u2019s \u201cfirst mover advantage\u201d has positioned it for long-term success, despite new competition. The price predictions seem conceivable because, in addition to its projected update, Ethereum is anticipated to be used more frequently than ever before in the development of DApps.\n\nHow many ETHs can you buy for $1?\n\nEthereum Price Prediction 2030\n\nChangelly also argued that the price of ETH in 2030 has been estimated by cryptocurrency specialists after years of price monitoring. It will be traded for a minimum of $29,991.01 and a maximum of $37,106.45. So, on average, you can anticipate that in 2030, the price of ETH will be roughly $30,874.69.\n\nDigitalCoinPrice is however not as bullish in its 2030 prediction for ETH. It predicts that the minimum and maximum prices of ETH in 2030 will be $17,549.25 and $18,841.55. On average, it will be traded at $18,459.53.\n\nLong-term Ethereum price estimates can be a useful tool for analyzing the market and learning how key platforms anticipate that future developments like the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade will affect pricing.\n\nCrypto-Rating, for instance, predicts that by 2030, Ethereum\u2019s value will likely exceed $100,000.\n\nBoth Pantera Capital CEO Dan Morehead and deVEre Group founder Nigel Green also predict that during the next ten years, the price of ETH will hit $100,000.\n\nSounds like too much? Well, the functional capabilities of the network, such as interoperability, security, and transaction speed, will radically change as a result of Ethereum 2.0. Should these and other related reforms be successfully implemented, opinion on ETH will change from being slightly favorable to strongly bullish. This will provide Ethereum the chance to entirely rewrite the rules of the cryptocurrency game.\n\nConclusion\n\nUsers will have quicker access to their money now that ETH staking withdrawal processing times on Binance have been slashed from 15 days to 5 days.\n\nThis will provide traders and investors with greater flexibility because they will be able to use their ETH for other things like paying bills or buying other cryptocurrencies.\n\nMore market liquidity could be attained as a result of this action. Due to the quick access to their cash, traders who often enter and exit positions may find this to be very advantageous.\n\nWhile some of these investors have invested in rival tokens in order to profit, others are doing it out of precaution in order to hedge their portfolios. This has been corroborated by the volatility witnessed in metrics like daily active users and price action of so-called Ethereum killers like Avalanche, Solana, Cardano etc. in the run up to the merge event which is less than a month away.\n\nThe majority of investors anticipated that Ethereum would bottom out at $3500 early this year, but the currency moved lower to show them incorrect. In fact, ETH briefly fell below the terrifying $1000 threshold.\n\nHowever, the coin has always rebounded when it appeared that it was poised to strike the target once more, restoring confidence in its future. This includes the incident in November 2022 when an FTX hacker allegedly dumped over 30,000 ETH. Hope is offered by the token\u2019s persistence in the wake of the FTX bankruptcy and the protracted crypto cold.\n\nThere is broad hope that the first smart contract blockchain will survive this period of trials, despite Ethereum\u2019s rivalries and other factors contributing to its continuous instability.\n\nAs far as the Merge is concerned, it is being hailed as a major success story by the Ethereum community. Buterin cited a research study by an Ethereum researcher, Justin Drake, that suggests that the \u201cmerge will reduce worldwide electricity consumption by 0.2%.\u201d\n\n\"The merge will reduce worldwide electricity consumption by 0.2%\" \u2013 @drakefjustin \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) September 15, 2022\n\nIt also reduces the time to mine one block of ETH from 13 seconds to 12 seconds. The Merge marks 55% completion of Ethereum\u2019s journey toward greater scalability and sustainability.\n\nThe likelihood that Ether will experience a price surge of 50% in the future is increased by its superior interim fundamentals to those of Bitcoin. To begin with, Ether\u2019s annual supply rate plummeted in October 2022, in part because of a fee-burning mechanism known as EIP-1559 that takes a certain amount of ETH out of perpetual circulation anytime an on-chain transaction takes place.\n\nConcerns about censorship on the Ethereum ecosystem have also emerged post the Merge. Around half of the Ethereum blocks are Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)-compliant as MEV-Boost got implemented. As Ethereum has upgraded to a PoS consensus, MEV-Boost has been enabled to a more representative distribution of block proposers, rather than a small group of miners under PoW. This development raises a concern about censorship under the force of OFAC.\n\nIt is interesting to note that while many eagerly waited for Ethereum\u2019s Merge and beefed up their holdings in anticipation of a price surge, there was a group of investors who weren\u2019t confident in the Merge\u2019s successful rollout. These investors were betting on a glitch in the rollout process, hoping that the update runs into trouble. While some of these investors have started investing in rival tokens in order to profit, others are doing it out of precaution in order to hedge their portfolios. This was corroborated by the volatility witnessed in metrics like daily active users and price action of so-called Ethereum killers like Avalanche, Solana, Cardano etc. in the run up to the Merge.\n\nThe majority of Ethereum price forecasts indicate that ETH can anticipate tremendous growth over the ensuing years.\n\nAs per Santiment, Ethereum\u2019s active addresses have sunk to 4-month lows with weak hands continuing to drop post-Merge and disinterest at a high as prices have stagnated.\n\nWhat about the flippening then? Is it possible that the altcoin might pass Bitcoin on the charts in the future? Well, that is possible. In fact, according to BlockchainCenter, ETH has already surpassed BTC on a few key metrics.\n\nConsider Transaction Counts and Total Transaction Fees, for instance. On both counts, ETH is ahead of BTC.\n\nOn the contrary, the traditional definition of a \u2018flippening\u2019 relates to the market cap of cryptos flipping.\n\nHowever, remember that a lot can change over these years, especially in a highly volatile market like cryptocurrency. Leading analysts\u2019 projections may vary, but even the most conservative ones might cause respectable profits for anyone choosing to invest in Ethereum. As far as the F&G Index is concerned, ETH showed a \u2018neutral\u2019 market sentiment for the moment."

        "content": "Blockchains are composed of layers. These are not literal layers, like the sauce and pasta that form lasagna, but metaphorical ones that help explain how blockchains can take a load off each other. The most common blockchain layers are layer 1s (L1) and layer 2s (L2).\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are L1s, or base layers, blockchains because they operate independently from other blockchains. Computers produce blocks on them and secure the network\u2014by mining in the case Bitcoin and staking for Ethereum. Avalanche, Solana, and Cardano are other examples of L1 blockchains.\n\nL1s work well until the network clogs up, which pushes fees higher. This is known as the \u201cscalability\u201d problem. Such problems befell Ethereum during the bull market of 2021, when network fees skyrocketed. Paying $50 in fees to buy a single NFT was common as Ethereum\u2019s popularity soared.\n\nEthereum developers responded by creating a series of fast and cheap L2 blockchains to sit atop the main chain. These included technologies like \u201crollups,\u201d which replicate the Ethereum experience on other chains but in a faster and cheaper fashion. L2s achieve this by bundling lots of L2 transactions into a single L1 transaction\u2014kind of like Uber Pool for crypto.\n\nMost L2s are built on Ethereum to compensate for the slow speeds and high cost that made that the chain unviable for many back in 2021. Ethereum\u2019s L2s tend to be a lot cheaper than L1s; transaction fees on an L2 decentralized lending protocol can be 20 times less expensive than on an L1. Yet in doing so, L2s still rely on the security of the L1.\n\nArbitrum is the largest Ethereum L2, with around $870 million locked into its smart contracts and 116 protocols, as of October 2022. Optimism, another layer 2, lags narrowly behind with $850 million locked into 72 protocols. Another popular L2 service is Polygon, which is technically a \u201csidechain\u201d and not a roll up since it has its own consensus mechanism.\n\nThe widely adopted layer-2 chain for Bitcoin is called the Lightning Network. It lets people pay for things in Bitcoin without requiring the base-layer blockchain to confirm transactions. That makes payments instantaneous\u2014although anyone who uses it must first lock up however much Bitcoin they plan to use.\n\n\n\nGo deeper:\n\nUnderstanding rollup economics from first principles\u2014Barnab\u00e9 Monnot, Ethereum Foundation\n\nScalable off-chain instant payments\u2014White paper\n\n\n\nSee also:\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nWhat are crypto bridges?\n\n\n\nTry it:\n\nHop Exchange\u2014send crypto between different Ethereum layers\n\nStrike\u2014send Bitcoin to this beginner-friendly (custodial) Lightning Network wallet"

        "title": "This Ethereum Proposal Wants to Bring Revenue Back to Developers - Blockworks",
        "content": "An Ethereum Improvement Proposal, dubbed EIP-6969, is looking to implement Contract-Secured Revenue (CSR) on Ethereum L2s.\n\nCSR refers to a series of smart contracts that enable developers to earn revenue whenever others interact with the code they have deployed on-chain.\n\nKevin Owocki, one of the co-authors of EIP-6969, told Blockworks that his firsthand experience as a builder in the Web3 space made him aware of the difficulties involved in monetizing the products he had actively helped create.\n\n\u201cThere are really not that many opportunities to monetize in a way that\u2019s sustainable and not very speculative,\u201d Owocki said.\n\nAfter learning about CSRs from the Canto Layer 1 network, a permissionless general-purpose blockchain, Owocki saw an opportunity to reward developers for their efforts sustainably and wanted to bring this idea into the EVM ecosystem.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nBringing activity to L2s and revenue to developers\n\nOn Ethereum Layer 2 solutions today, every transaction that calls a contract on the network sends a portion of the gas consumed to the sequencer as a fee.\n\nEIP-6969 modifies this slightly by sending a portion of those gas fees to the developer of that smart contract as well.\n\n\u201cWhen you deploy a contract onto the Ethereum network, the address you deployed that contract with would be attached to the contract,\u201d Owocki said. \u201cHowever much execution time EVM spends inside of your smart contract, that\u2019ll be mapped proportionally and a percentage of the fee revenue will return to that address.\u201d\n\nOwocki notes that this new approach offers an opportunity to bridge the gap between Layer 2 solutions in need of more developers, and developers who are seeking avenues for generating revenue.\n\nThe modular architecture of smart contracts on Ethereum\n\nAs Ethereum smart contracts are designed with composability in mind, Owocki believes that EIP-6969 could set up a strong foundation for the evolving open-source infrastructure that can expand the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n\u201cWe have all these open-source lego bricks that exist in the Ethereum ecosystem, I as a hacker could walk into a hackathon and build something in a weekend that would have taken a bank 15 years ago $100 million to build because I can get so much software off the shelf,\u201d he said. \u201cSo with EIP-6969, we really wanted to respect that modular architecture of the EVM.\u201d\n\nThis means that revenue will not just be given to a smart contract at the top execution level, but as you go down the stack, each contractor that has contributed to modifying the code will be given a portion of the revenue.\n\n\u201cWhat this does is it incentivizes the creation of infrastructure, because people who might not have a business model right now are all of a sudden going to get more and more revenue as more people use their deployed version of [the smart contract],\u201d he said.\n\nEvery time an infrastructure is used, the gas fee trickles down to everyone who had participated in building the infrastructure, creating a reward loop that incentivizes more people to maintain open-source infrastructure.\n\nTimelines and execution\n\nCSR currently exists in the Canto ecosystem, Owocki notes. In the EVM ecosystem, the next step will be to wait for the EIP to be accepted by the community so that the development team can create a canonical spec for how it would operate in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nOnce that is complete, Owocki said that the next step would be to work with L2s to implement it into their ecosystems. This is expected to happen within the next six months.\n\n\u201cThe reason why we can move faster on this is because we\u2019re deploying it to layer twos,\u201d he notes. \u201cThis is not a specification that is meant for the Ethereum mainnet. Ethereum mainnet needs to be credibly neutral, and it needs to be capture resistant. I think it\u2019s very important to prototype this on layer twos where the stakes are lower.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Global payments giant Visa has deployed experimental smart contracts on Ethereum\u2019s Goerli testnet to pilot gasless transactions through account abstraction.\n\nThe two sets of smart contracts, dubbed Paymaster, will simplify user interaction with the Ethereum network by performing complex tasks and managing transaction costs on behalf of other accounts.\n\nVisa Tests Paymaster for Frictionless Transactions\n\nAccount abstraction is a proposal to increase flexibility in the management and behavior of Ethereum accounts by separating the control of an account from its associated private key, allowing it to be controlled by a smart contract. The mechanism is enabled by ERC-4337, a new Ethereum standard launched in March.\n\nVisa seeks to leverage the ERC-4337 standard to implement an intermediary currency conversion service. The first version of the Paymaster contract explores whether users can pay transaction fees with alternative tokens like dollar-pegged stablecoins or central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).\n\nThe contract can collect any ERC-20 token from users and convert them into ether (ETH) based on the current exchange rate to pay for gas fees on the users\u2019 behalf, thus removing the need to acquire ETH only for transaction fees.\n\n\u201cThis sample contract contains the governing logic for both the Paymaster and its custom ERC-20 token. To this contract, we introduced an allowlist and a function to update the token-to-ETH conversion rate. This allowed us to better simulate real-life conditions where the exchange rate between ETH and a token is dynamic,\u201d Visa said in a report.\n\nEnabling Gasless Transactions\n\nThe payments giant believes the Paymaster concept can incentivize adoption by allowing users to only fund the gas cost at the time of the transaction without any pre-funding requirements to optimize their cash-flow management.\n\nThe second Paymaster contract seeks to eliminate the need for users to cover gas fees by themselves, just like in web2 peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions, by using a solution proffered by account abstraction, which allows third parties, such as fintech wallet providers, to handle the costs.\n\nIn this case, the third parties can act as Paymasters, completely sponsoring transaction fees for users. The experiments are based on the starter code provided by the Ethereum Foundation and ERC-4337 core team.\n\nWe tested two core user operations: 1) paying with ERC-20 tokens using ERC-4337 Paymaster; 2) Sponsoring transaction fees for users (aka gasless txs) with ERC-4337 Paymaster \u2014 Catherine Gu (@catgu_) May 17, 2023"

This helps explain the popularity of later blockchains like Ethereum, which offers more complex smart contracts.\n\nSmart contracts bring blockchains to life by letting users create and run on-chain programs, like decentralized finance and NFTs.\n\nA smart contract is composed of functions (\u201cif X, do Y\u201d) and data (like NFTs). Nick Szabo, a cryptographer and one of the first people to receive Bitcoin, coined the term in 1997. He likened the logic of a smart contract to that of a vending machine.\n\nSmart contracts are pieces of code that define the rules of on-chain interactions and enforce the rules encoded within them. Once a developer deploys a smart contract on the blockchain, it cannot be deleted, and any interaction is irreversible.\n\nThese contracts facilitate complex blockchain functions, like lending. For instance, when a user locks up a certain amount of ETH as collateral, MakerDAO\u2019s smart contract will let them mint a certain amount of Dai. All this takes place without intermediaries, pre-programmed according to the rules baked into the smart contract.\n\nSmart contracts are written in specialist coding languages, like Solidity and Vyper. Anyone can deploy one on a permissionless blockchain, like Ethereum, and anyone can interact with the contract.\n\nSmart contracts often rely on \u201coracles,\u201d which are programs that retrieve external data from the wider internet. Smart contracts execute pre-defined functions once they receive certain information from oracles, such as cryptocurrency prices.\n\nEthereum is the largest blockchain to support smart contracts. It is followed from some distance by Tron and Binance Smart Chain (BSC).\n\nWhile the Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain doesn\u2019t currently support smart contracts, a project called Stacks wants to change that by building a supporting blockchain, known as a sidechain, that works with Bitcoin. Bitcoin hardliners argue that the blockchain should only be used in its most basic form: for storing and transferring value.\n\n\n\nGo deeper:\n\nClean Contracts\u2014a guide on smart contract patterns & practices\u2014Wesley Van Heije, Ethereum Foundation\n\nBest Practices for Smart Contract Development\u2014Yos Riady, a Solidity developer\n\n\n\nSee also:\n\nWhat are blockchains?\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\n\n\nTry it:\n\nOpenZeppelin\u2014an open-source library for smart contracts"

        "content": "DeFi trading is fraught with monetary dangers, borne from its freewheeling and volatile environment. And as if the wild west of crypto trading wasn\u2019t already risky enough, highly effective bots have emerged to gobble up value from unwary traders in recent weeks.\n\nThese predatory robots are constantly on the lookout for new victims in Ethereum\u2019s public mempool, hunting for opportunities to seize upon vulnerable orders.\n\nTechnically, one could argue they\u2019re not \u201cstealing\u201d anything, per se. The bots are really just extracting the maximum value, or MEV, in the most effective way possible under the given conditions.\n\nOstensibly, they\u2019re just playing by the rules \u2014 and finding loopholes \u2014 better than everybody else. Their actions just happen to also be at the expense of everybody else. In the traditional finance world, this activity would likely be a clear-cut case of illegal behavior, but legalities are not as well-defined in decentralized finance. Not yet, anyway.\n\nOn a recent Bell Curve podcast, host Mike Ippolito spoke to Blockworks about the tweeted observations of a recent MEV exploit from steward and product lead at Flashbots, Robert Miller. This particular bot, going by the dubious moniker, jaredfromsubway.eth, has been highly successful with a technique referred to as a \u201csandwich attack.\u201d\n\nA sandwich attack consists of two rapid swaps surrounding a victim\u2019s trade. It begins with an innocent trader sending their order to the public mempool, at which point the bot \u2014 always searching \u2014 spots its opportunity.\n\nThe attack begins with a frontrun, followed up by an attack on the backend of the selected trade, hence the term \u201csandwich.\u201d In an example posted by Miller, the bot exploits pepe (PEPE) trades with ether (ETH).\n\nThe frontrun, Miller explains, sells the attacker\u2019s pepe for ether. This causes the price of ether to climb immediately before the targeted trade is initiated. The victim then swaps their pepe for ether, receiving less than they should expect due to the price hike caused by the bot.\n\nFollowing this, the bot promptly sells ether back for the memecoin, which is now cheaper because of the victim\u2019s sell order.\n\nIn this particular example of a brief moment of exploitation, the bot gains 0.04 ETH and 300 memecoins, unbeknownst to the hapless victim. It might not sound like much, but it\u2019s happening constantly, netting the bot millions of dollars over the past few weeks.\n\nExtremely good at sniping\n\nIppolito says this particular bot is highly effective because it \u201ctakes a very different approach.\u201d It starts with a large supply of a token \u2014 in this case, pepe \u2014 so \u201cthere\u2019s just much less competition.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe reason why more bots don\u2019t do that is just because warehousing becomes very difficult,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t really want to hold a whole bunch of your assets in something that\u2019s as volatile as something like pepe, because any profits that you get from the sandwiching could be offset by declines from the memecoin basically failing.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I guess jaredfromsubway is extremely good at sniping.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the bot is especially effective at \u201csniping,\u201d suspiciously snapping up a large supply of pepe within ten minutes of it being deployed. This lucrative acquisition allowed it to have the required inventory for its MEV strategy.\n\nOne way to avoid becoming a victim of attacks of this nature is to change a wallet\u2019s RPC (remote procedure call) to Flashbots\u2019 Protect RPC solution. The tool diverts transaction orders from the public to a protected mempool. From there, it privately transmits transactions, rendering them invisible to bots, thus eliminating the possibility of such attacks.\n\nOn a positive note, co-founder of Framework Ventures, Vance Spencer, suggests the recent ramp-up in MEV activity is a good sign for the market, noting that \u201cMEV is turning back on.\u201d\n\nMichael Anderson of Framework Ventures agrees, noting that the level of engagement on pepe indicates \u201cgreen shoots\u201d out of the bear market and the possibility of finally \u201cmoving past it.\u201d\n\nFor good or bad, \u201cMEV is gonna be a benefactor for all of that.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

Instead, crypto users rely on a workaround called crypto bridges.\n\nWhen you want to transfer crypto assets from one chain, like Ethereum, to another chain, such as Solana, crypto bridges will hold your coins from the first chain in digital vaults and create synthetic tokens for use on the second chain. This amounts to an escrow system of sorts. Of course, users can\u2019t use the tokens in the vault and the synthetic tokens at the same time.\n\nBridges support different assets and chains. While Hop Exchange supports a handful of chains compatible with the Ethereum network, like Polygon and Gnosis, Connext supports technically diverse chains, like Cronos and Moonriver.

He explained some of the better-suited technology underlying modern blockchains, including the newly popular smart contract platform Radix.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Clunky Programming Language\n\nAccording to Ridyard, DeFi in crypto is currently lacking in three major areas: user experience, developer experience, and scalability.\n\nThe first two issues largely stem from the less-than-ideal programming languages for developers to express their ideas for particular financial applications. One such language, he said, is Ethereum\u2019s Solidity.\n\n\u201cSolidity is like banging your head against a brick wall,\u201d he stated. \u201cIf you want to build assets that are highly secure and you want to build financial applications that are highly secure, it\u2019s basically impossible to make it secure in a way that is easy for developers to use.\u201d\n\nRidyard\u2019s company RDX Works is a core developer for Radix \u2013 a DeFi-focused blockchain whose native token, XRD, roared upwards by over 200% from early to mid-April.\n\nUnlike Ethereum and other chains, Radix uses a unique programming language called Scrypto, which is specifically focused on making financial applications easier to build and use.\n\n\n\nUnderneath Scrypto is the Radix engine which includes primitives that are part of the ledger itself, providing the essential building blocks for developers to build apps without having to start complex development from scratch.\n\n\u201cYou are not creating your own smart contract that then defines what it means to be a token, what it means to be a token transfer and tracking balances,\u201d said Ridyard. \u201cAll of that is done by the ledger itself.\u201d\n\nThe Radix engine also protects applications on the platform from \u201creentrancy attacks,\u201d a common DeFi loophole that lets a hacker continually withdraw from a smart contract until the victim goes bankrupt. Specifically, the engine prevents infinite callbacks that lead to recursive loops which let hackers drain a contract to zero.\n\nIn February, the DeFi protocol dforce lost $3.6 million to such a bug. \u201cA whole host of maybe half a billion dollars worth of hacks that have just been from reentrancy disappear just because of how we\u2019ve implemented the architecture,\u201d said Ridyard.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Consensus Mechanism\n\nEthereum\u2019s \u201cMerge\u201d upgrade in September \u2013 which changed its consensus mechanism from proof of work to proof of stake \u2013 was widely praised as the greatest technical feat in the history of crypto. However, in 2023, even proof of stake may be proving less advanced of a mechanism than what newer chains can offer \u2013 especially on the scalability front.\n\nFor example, Ethereum doesn\u2019t allow for the parallel execution of transactions that would enable massive throughput. All transactions must be ordered, even if they are unrelated to each other.\n\nBy contrast, Radix uses the \u201cCerberus\u201d consensus mechanism, which obviates the need for ordering. \u201cThey can start and end whenever they need to start and end, and you don\u2019t need to agree between them which one came first and which one came second,\u201d said Ridyard.\n\nRadix still comes baked in with a delegated proof of stake system that protects Cerberus. However, Ridyard doesn\u2019t consider either proof of work or proof of stake to be \u201cconsensus mechanisms,\u201d but rather \u201ccivil protection mechanisms.\u201d\n\n\u201cA consensus mechanism, is how do the nodes come to an agreement. The civil mechanism is about, how do you defend those nodes from being maliciously attacked in the process of coming to an agreement,\u201d he elaborated.\n\nRidyard said he admired proof of stake for its energy efficiency, but noted that proof of work chains \u2013 like Bitcoin \u2013 solve certain \u201cbootstrapping\u201d and \u201crandomization\u201d problems.\n\nDeFi and the SEC\n\nBesides technological limitations, DeFi and the blockchains underpinning it are currently under immense regulatory pressure from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The agency currently seeks to regulate DeFi exchanges under existing securities exchange laws.\n\nWhile Ridyard sees a possibility that regulators \u201ckill\u201d DeFi in America for a period, he doesn\u2019t envision the industry dying globally due to the overwhelming benefit it can provide certain economies. Ultimately, he believes \u201creading the tea leaves\u201d of how regulators will interpret certain enforcement rules is a bit of a distraction, and that DeFi will ultimately adapt to best conform to each country\u2019s political and economic will.\n\n\u201cWhat the regulators are trying to do is find the handles in which they can exercise enforcement against what the government and by and large, what the voting public could consider to be the things they want and they don\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is going to be some give and take.\u201d"

        "content": "Moves from Grayscale Investments and Bitwise Asset Management to pause planned ether futures ETFs came after the SEC asked them to do so, according to two sources directly familiar with the matter.\n\nIndustry participants told Blockworks that concerns around current ether futures liquidity levels, as well as a lack of clarity on whether ether is considered a security or a commodity, are possible rationales.\n\nGrayscale, one of the crypto industry\u2019s largest and most prominent asset managers, moved last week to register a planned ether (ETH) futures product with the SEC. The firm \u2014 known for its $17.2 billion Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) \u2014 reversed course this week.\n\nRead more: Grayscale, Bitwise Pumping Brakes on ETH Futures Plans\n\nGrayscale\u2019s pullback appears to have started a trend amongst its competitors, per a Blockworks\u2019 review of SEC filings and the two sources familiar with the matter.\n\nThat trend: SEC representatives have told involved parties that the US regulator is still not yet ready to approve such products. The SEC oversees ETFs domiciled in the ETF, while the CFTC regulates crypto future trading products.\n\nDirexion follows Grayscale, Bitwise\u2019s lead\n\nFund manager Direxion became the latest to request rescinding its proposal to launch an Ether Strategy ETF, according to an SEC filing on Thursday. Direxion has nearly 80 ETFs trading in the US with combined assets under management of roughly $26.4 billion, according to ETF.com.\n\nThe two sources told Blockworks this week that the SEC has recently asked a number of top would-be issuers to pull their public filings for ether futures ETFs \u2014 requesting for firms to discuss the proposals confidentially with the regulator.\n\nBoth sources were granted anonymity to discuss sensitive business dealings. The SEC did not return a request for comment.\n\nThe Direxion filing came a day after Bitwise submitted a request to withdraw the application for its Ethereum Strategy ETF to the SEC. This would have invested primarily in cash-settled, front-month ETH futures contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).\n\nAn amended filing by Grayscale, dated Wednesday, indicated the crypto-focused asset manager was moving forward with ETF launch plans that did not include its previously filed-for Ethereum Futures ETF.\n\nSpokespeople for Grayscale and Bitwise declined to comment. Direxion did not return a request for comment.\n\nValkyrie Investments and Roundhill Investments also filed for ether futures ETFs last week. A Valkyrie representative declined to comment on its plans, while Roundhill Investments could not immediately be reached.\n\nSEC not ready?\n\nThe SEC approved bitcoin futures ETFs in 2021. But Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at fund group VanEck, told Blockworks the CME ether futures market is not yet liquid enough to support an ETF.\n\nVanEck has previously filed for a bitcoin ETF. It also filed for an ether futures ETF in 2021 before withdrawing the application just days later. ProShares did the same, though the fund group launched the first bitcoin futures ETF a couple months later.\n\n\u201cBecause of the SEC\u2019s previous haphazard approach to a bitcoin ETF, we\u2019ve already spent considerable time and resources filing and re-filing applications in hopes the timing would align to allow us first to market with a physical bitcoin ETF,\u201d Sigel said. \u201cHowever since the case against ETH futures ETF is quite clear from a liquidity perspective, we figured in this case, why bother?\u201d\n\nThe average daily volume for CME ether futures last month clocked in at 5,580 contracts, according to CME Group data.\n\nThat substantially trailed the average daily volume of 9,713 contracts for bitcoin futures over that same period. Open interest for ether futures and bitcoin futures during the month: 3,578 and contracts and 13,412 contracts, respectively.\n\nSigel added that ETH futures liquidity levels would likely have to more than double before the regulator would approve an ether futures fund.\n\nBeyond ether liquidity\n\nLiquidity might not be the only issue the SEC has with the ether futures ETF proposals.\n\nBryan Armour, director of passive strategies research at Morningstar, said he believes any read of the SEC\u2019s disinterest in approving an ether futures ETF is \u201cconjecture\u201d at this point.\n\n\u201cBitcoin has advantages over ether in terms of its integration into the financial system as a payment method \u2026 and its deeper liquidity,\u201d he told Blockworks in an email on Thursday. \u201cBut the main point of contention for the SEC may be its uncertain classification of ether as a commodity or security.\u201d\n\nWhile the CFTC considers ether to be a commodity, SEC Chair Gensler has said he believes most crypto assets, excluding bitcoin, are securities.\n\nEther\u2019s qualification as a commodity came into question after Ethereum moved from a proof-of-work model to proof of stake last year, Armour said.\n\n\u201cStaking could change the outcome of the Howey Test, which the SEC uses to determine what qualifies as an investment contract,\u201d he said. \u201cMy expectation is that the SEC needs more time to get comfortable with its classification before approving Ethereum-related ETFs.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "The Quantum Threat To Cryptocurrency: How QRL's Quantum-Safe Blockchain Technology Could Be Poised To ... - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "CHEYENNE, WY / ACCESSWIRE / May 19, 2023 / Cryptographic protocols that secure networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum are - for the time being - impervious to even the most advanced computers. However, imagine a near-future scenario where computers have advanced to such a level that current cryptographic standards become insufficient.\n\nThe Quantum Resistance Corporation, Friday, May 19, 2023, Press release picture\n\nThis potential danger arises from quantum computers, a cutting-edge technology that has the potential to compromise many of the encryption protocols used in cryptocurrencies today. Although quantum computers are in their infancy and not yet powerful enough to do so, experts predict that, if current trends continue, they could threaten blockchain networks by 2030.\n\nQuantum Resistant Ledger ( QRL ) aims to address this doomsday threat as the world's first post-quantum store of value and decentralized communication network to proactively tackle the threat of advanced quantum computing. The following article will deep dive into the nature of the quantum threat, and explain how QRL could be positioned to transform the industry by providing a post-quantum solution.\n\nThe Quantum Threat to Cryptocurrency\n\nBefore delving into how QRL offers a solution to the quantum threat to cryptocurrency , it is important to understand how quantum computers work and the current risks associated with popular blockchains such as Ethereum and Bitcoin.\n\nWhat Is Quantum Computing?\n\nQuantum computers are a type of supercomputer with far superior processing power than classical computers. They are able to carry out many computations while simultaneously considering several different configurations - this makes them exponentially faster than traditional computers.\n\nOver the past few years, quantum computing has shown significant progress in various fields, including AI, weather forecasting and medical research. However, in the wrong hands, quantum computing has the potential to pose a substantial risk to cybersecurity, and consequently, to cryptocurrencies as well.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor example, Google's 54-qubit Sycamore processor completed a computation in 200 seconds that would have taken the most powerful classical computer in the world 10,000 years . According to a report by IBM , in theory, cryptographic protocols can be solved within a few hours with quantum computers.\n\nTypes of Quantum Attacks\n\nBroadly speaking, traditional cryptocurrencies face two primary types of threats, which are:\n\nStorage Attacks: An attack that targets individual wallet addresses, trying to break their security and steal the cryptocurrency stored in them.\n\nTransit Attacks: An attack that focuses on taking control of all transactions happening in real-time on the network.\n\nVulnerabilities of Existing Cryptocurrencies\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum, the world's two largest cryptocurrencies, account for almost 60% of the industry's total market capitalization. Bitcoin as an asset functions like digital gold, providing a decentralized, immutable and secure store of value. Conversely, Ethereum is like a publicly shared computer network that enables developers to create applications on decentralized servers.\n\nWhen it comes to storage attacks, Ethereum is at a higher risk than Bitcoin. A recent Deloitte study revealed that about 65% of all Ether is vulnerable to quantum attacks, significantly more than the 25% of vulnerable Bitcoin.\n\nTransit attacks, though more severe, are also more challenging to execute. According to Mark Webber at the University of Sussex in the U.K., breaking this level of encryption would reportedly require a quantum computer with 1.9 billion qubits of power.\n\nThis number is staggering, especially when compared to IBM's most advanced quantum computer, which has only 127 qubits in comparison. Ethereum's creator, Vitalik Buterin, tweeted in 2019 that current speculations about quantum computing are as distant from real quantum computing as hydrogen bombs are from nuclear fusion. But rapid advancements in AI-assisted technology could be changing the outlook and accelerating the quantum timeline.\n\nQRL's Quantum-Safe Blockchain Technology\n\nTraditional cryptographic methods such as RSA and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) rely on computational complexity for security. However, this model is an ineffective long-term solution since quantum computers can solve these methods. QRL says it solves this vulnerability by creating cryptography based on problems that are believed to be resistant to quantum attacks, providing enhanced security in the quantum era.\n\nOne of the key components of QRL's cryptography is the eXtended Merkle Signature Scheme (XMSS). This is a unique mathematical function that is designed to allow for secure and efficient transaction authentication when taking into account the trends of quantum computers.\n\nIn addition to securing transactions, QRL leverages advanced techniques such as on-chain lattice key storage and layer-to-internode communication to secure communications on the blockchain.\n\nThe Road Ahead For QRL And The Cryptocurrency Industry?\n\nOverall, although the advent of quantum technology raises concerns, the ongoing development of cryptographic encryption has the potential to surpass the progress of quantum computing.\n\nAs quantum computing remains in its nascent stages, investors and centralized organizations have the opportunity to transition to quantum-resistant cryptography. The situation is much different for decentralized blockchain technology, which post-quantum security analysts insist has a fatal and fundamentally unfixable flaw . QRL doesn't have this problem, they maintain. In any case, QRL seems to be at the vanguard of the post-quantum security frontier and well-positioned to offer a safe way for transactions and communications in a post-quantum world.\n\nFeatured Photo by Sunil Ray on Unsplash\n\nContact:\n\nMike Zeiger\n\n4d5a@theqrc.com\n\nSOURCE: The Quantum Resistance Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\nView source version on accesswire.com:\n\nhttps://www.accesswire.com/756041/The-Quantum-Threat-To-Cryptocurrency-How-QRLs-Quantum-Safe-Blockchain-Technology-Could-Be-Poised-To-Revolutionize-The-Industry\n\n\n\n"

Discover SCENE\n\nThe prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum remained flat for the third week running as the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) showed no signs of conceding ground over its claim to being the industry\u2019s lead regulator.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) added a modest 0.3% to its value over the last seven days and currently trades at $27,110.29. Likewise, Ethereum (ETH) only grew 0.6% and currently changes hands at $1,825.\n\nThere were no substantial losses among any of the top thirty cryptocurrencies this week. Three projects posted notable rallies.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nXRP blew up 9.4% and entered the weekend at $0.46. The coin\u2019s progenitor, Ripple, scored a small courtroom victory against the SEC in the latter\u2019s ongoing lawsuit against the company for selling XRP as an unregistered security.\n\nOn Tuesday, Judge Analisa Torres blocked the SEC\u2019s motion to seal documents linked to a speech by former SEC director Bill Hinman explaining why Bitcoin and Ethereum should not be considered securities. Torres said the documents in question were \u201csubject to a strong presumption of public access.\u201d\n\nRipple\u2019s defense previously made Hinman\u2019s case for XRP, but the SEC countered that Hinman\u2019s speech represented Hinman\u2019s personal views before unsuccessfully requesting the motion to seal the documents.\n\nRipple made headlines again on Thursday with the news that it has launched its Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) platform. The platform is pitched to central banks and governments looking to create their own centrally-issued stablecoins, alongside financial institutions that will distribute them and the users\u2014both retail and corporate\u2014that will trade, hold and use them.\n\nAnother big mover was Litecoin (LTC) which this week blew up 13.2% and trades for $91.29 at the time of writing. The Litecoin network recently increased in popularity as a result of Ordinals Inscriptions, a craze that brings NFT-style assets to blockchains with unsophisticated smart contracts, like Bitcoin and Litecoin.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEthereum staking token Lido DAO (LDO) surged 13.7% this week, sustaining its momentum from last week.\n\nSEC \u201cready to help\u201d\n\nOn Monday, SEC chairman Gary Gensler pushed back against claims that the SEC\u2019s regulatory guidance to crypto companies was not clear. Speaking at a keynote session, Gensler insisted \u201cthe rules have already been published\u201d and added his agency \u201cstands ready to help them to come into compliance.\u201d\n\nThe SEC\u2019s position is widely perceived as disingenuous because the regulator is simultaneously bombarding the industry with lawsuits. Even one of the SEC\u2019s own Commissioners, Hester Pierce, has dissented a couple of times due to the lack of clarity, most recently over her agency\u2019s decision to shut down Kraken\u2019s staking platform and its proposal to amend the definition of \u201cexchange\u201d to bring crypto companies into its jurisdiction.\n\nAnother noteworthy event on Monday was the SEC\u2019s response to Coinbase\u2019s petition for a writ of mandamus, an order that would require the agency to clarify its rules on crypto regulations. The regulator\u2019s lawyers urged the court to dismiss Coinbase\u2019s request.\n\nAround the world\n\nIn the South Korean press on Monday, Samsung announced its partnership with the Bank of Korea (BOK) to jointly conduct research aimed at developing an ecosystem for a CBDC.\n\nBoth parties signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to deepen their research into offline CBDC payments, according to a Korea Herald report.\n\nSamsung previously participated in BOK\u2019s CBDC pilot project last year, developing offline CBDC technology to enable transfers and payments through near-field communication (NFC), even when the transaction\u2019s sender and recipient devices were not connected to the internet.\n\nOn Tuesday, European Union Finance Ministers adopted the bloc\u2019s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) bill with no objections. This marks the final step in the process of the legislation coming into force and now means that the EU has a comprehensive and uniform set of guidelines for regulating crypto throughout its 27 member states.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFinally on Wednesday, a cross-party committee of British MPs on Wednesday published a report recommending that the British government legislates crypto as gambling. The bizarre proposal envisions handing oversight to the Gambling Commission and includes possible taxes to support addiction and debt advice."

It is a newer form of consensus mechanism\u2014the way a blockchain confirms transactions\u2014than the original \u201cproof of work\u201d mechanism used by Bitcoin that relies on energy-intensive mining.\n\nProof of stake relies on \u201cvalidators\u201d to lock up lots of cryptocurrency within a blockchain, then the network chooses a validator to process a transaction. The premise is that those who have locked up the most coins have the most skin in the game, and so are likely to be the most trustworthy. Quantifying trust is crucial in blockchain networks, which operate without intermediaries. If a validator tries to defraud a network, their stake gets \u201cslashed\u201d\u2014and their tokens are forfeited.\n\nThe most popular proof-of-stake network is Ethereum. In September 2022, the blockchain switched from proof of work, the consensus mechanism based on cryptocurrency mining. Other popular proof-of-stake chains include Solana, Avalanche, Tezos, and Polygon.\n\nOne of the driving forces behind Ethereum\u2019s change\u2014and indeed the shift of the wider industry away from proof-of-work models\u2014is energy usage. The Ethereum Foundation, the nonprofit that supports its development, claims that Ethereum shed 99.5% of its energy consumption after the transition.\n\nAdvocates claim that this lightens the burden on the environment and helps the network remain decentralized\u2014it\u2019s a lot easier to lock away a few coins than buy a computer fast enough to profitably mine cryptocurrency through proof of work.\n\nThere are two ways of joining a proof-of-stake network and earning rewards. The first is to set up a node and become a full validator. This is a larger commitment\u2014Ethereum, for instance, requires validators to stake at least 32 ETH. The second is to delegate coins to a validator like Lido or Coinbase, which take a small cut for providing the service.\n\nDelegating is a pretty simple affair. Exchanges like Coinbase allow some users to stake ETH on the Ethereum blockchain without leaving the platform, and wallets like Solflare permit Solana staking within an in-browser web extension similar to MetaMask.\n\nStaking-as-a-service companies let validators stake tranches of 32 ETH while managing the hardware, while pooled staking services, such as Lido, handle the hardware but also let stakers delegate as much or as little ETH as they\u2019d like.\n\n\n\nGo deeper:\n\nEthereum staking\u2014Ethereum Foundation\n\n\n\nSee also:\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nWhat is Solana?\n\nWhat is Bitcoin?"

The blockchain supports smart contracts\u2014which let users run a wide variety of programs in finance and other fields\u2014and runs on a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm called Ouroboros.\n\nDue to its high speeds, low fees, and smart contract-supporting infrastructure, Cardano proponents have long touted it as an \u201cEthereum killer\u201d\u2014a blockchain that promises to overtake the market-leading smart contract blockchain. Cardano launched in 2017 but only implemented the smart contract layer in 2021.\n\nFor now, though, Cardano has not come close to surpassing Ethereum. As of May 2023, investors had locked up around $27 billion into Ethereum compared to the approximately $135 million they had locked into Cardano\u2019s smart contracts. Still, Cardano\u2019s ADA token itself is relatively popular, peaking at a market cap of $95 billion in September 2021 before crashing to about $15 billion a year later.\n\nThe design of Cardano\u2019s settlement layer borrows from Bitcoin, a blockchain that does not support smart contracts. This layer is a system of \u201cunspent transaction output\u201d (UTXO), whereby the network calculates coins held in wallets after processing cryptocurrency transactions. Bitcoin, the most popular blockchain, is also based on UTXO.\n\nThe network is, like all public blockchains, decentralized, although development is led by Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK), a software company founded by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson in 2015, as well as a nonprofit called the Cardano Foundation. Hoskinson stopped working on Ethereum after claiming engineers ignored his advice on how to improve the network. The Ethereum community, for its part, has accused Hoskinson of fabricating or embellishing his contributions and his biography.\n\nWhile anyone can contribute to upgrades on Bitcoin or Ethereum, upgrades to Cardano rely on the determinations of a panel of academics.

It can also respond to demand, determining when tokens are removed from circulation (if ever) and how holders can earn the cryptocurrency.\n\nFor instance, Bitcoin\u2019s tokenomics, outlined in 2008 by Satoshi Nakomoto, dictate that no more than 21 million coins could ever enter circulation and that each coin has to be earned by a network of computers called miners. Ethereum\u2019s tokenomics place no cap on its supply but burns Ether, the blockchain\u2019s native cryptocurrency, used to pay for transactions.\n\nTokenomics influence how people use and value a token. NFTs, one-of-a-kind tokens, incentivize holders to value them for their digital scarcity; that has made NFTs a medium prized for digital art.\n\nMany decentralized finance projects also reserve tokens for early investors, advisers, or the founding team. These tokens are subject to vesting periods, and usually enter circulation after a year or two. Unlocks can crash a coin\u2019s price if newly liberated holders suddenly dump their holdings all at once. This can lead critics to accuse certain projects of having unsound tokenomics that serve to enrich insiders rather than foster long-term viability.\n\nCryptocurrency developers usually outline these tokenomics in a white paper published before its release. Further details are normally covered in a project\u2019s Gitbook documentation, or on its website. A project\u2019s founders will then bake this monetary policy into the cryptocurrency\u2019s code.\n\nAlthough investors do not expect a project\u2019s tokenomics to change, developers authorized to make changes to the contract can do so. For example, the designers of the Ethereum-scaling solution Optimism accidentally set the coin\u2019s annual inflation to 20% instead of 2%\u2014a mistake they rectified after releasing the token.\n\n\n\nGo deeper:\n\nIncentive structures\u2014Cobie, a critical crypto influencer\n\nThings to look out for when investing in cryptocurrencies\u2014Nansen\n\n\n\nSee also:\n\nCrypto investing 101\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\n\n\nTry it:\n\nMarketCapOf\u2014compare tokens and understand how circulating supplies matter"

        "content": "Solana is a popular blockchain that supports decentralized applications and tokens. Launched in 2020, the network is frequently pitched as a leading alternative to the high fees and slow transaction times that have sometimes plagued market leader Ethereum. Solana claims to be capable of processing transactions 4,000 times faster than Ethereum.\n\nThose pitches are often made by venture capitalists, who flooded the project, helmed by former Qualcomm employee Anatoly Yakovenko, with over $300 million in 2021. The cash jolt helped Solana\u2019s native currency, SOL, rise to highs of $78 billion in June of that year.\n\nSolana has since its inception relied on the environmentally-friendly proof-of-stake technique to verify transactions on its blockchain and, like Ethereum, users pay transaction fees in its native currency.\n\nSolana is not compatible with popular Ethereum wallets like MetaMask, and instead relies on its own network of wallet makers. Popular choices include Solflare and Phantom. It also has a lively NFT scene, hosting projects like Solana Monkey Business and the Degenerate Ape Academy.\n\nSolana\u2019s market cap lags behind Ethereum by several hundred billion dollars, and its price is far more volatile. Most of the venture capitalists and investors that boosted the coin in the bull run of 2021 went quiet while its market cap fell from $78 billion in June of that year to $13 billion a year later.\n\nThe blockchain also suffered several crashes and outages that shut down the blockchain for hours at a time. A bug in June 2022 brought down the blockchain for four hours, and in September 2021 a popular DeFi protocol switched off the network for almost 18 hours.\n\nSolana took a bigger hit than most other cryptocurrencies following the November 2022 collapse of FTX because many people regarded the project as intertwined with the exchange\u2019s disgraced founder, Sam Bankman-Fried. Since then, Solana\u2019s founders have stated repeatedly that the blockchain can flourish on its own. By mid-2023, Solana appears to have largely recovered from the scandal, and its token price has climbed.\n\n\n\nGo deeper:\n\nSolana white paper\u2014Anatoly Yakovenko\n\n\n\nSee also:\n\nWhat is DeFi?\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nWhat is cryptocurrency?\n\n\n\nTry it:\n\nSolscan\u2014Solana\u2019s blockchain explorer\n\nPhantom\u2014A popular Solana wallet"

Its supporters hail it as fast, cheap, environmentally friendly, and able to support smart contracts. Avalanche\u2019s native token, AVAX, was one of the strongest and most volatile performers in 2021, rising to a market cap of $30 billion in November\u2014before crashing to $5 billion in June 2022.\n\nAs is the case with other would-be \u201cEthereum killers,\u201d the appeal of Avalanche for many is its ability to process many transactions cheaply and efficiently while also being able to handle smart contracts\u2014a tool that lets anyone run programs on the blockchain.\n\nTransaction fees, paid in AVAX, are generally under a dollar, and take only a few seconds to go through. This is much faster and cheaper than Ethereum, though the latter remains far more popular.\n\nThe Avalanche network is composed of three chains: the X-Chain, for creating and exchanging assets; the P-Chain, for coordinating validators, and the C-Chain, on which developers create smart contracts.\n\nAvalanche\u2019s founding team, led by Cornell computer science professor Emin G\u00fcn Sirer, hoped that splitting the network across three chains would help it grow without slowing down. Avalanche is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine, making it attractive with developers who want to relaunch their Ethereum DeFi projects on Avalanche with little extra effort.\n\nAs a result, many familiar protocols from Ethereum, such as Aave and Curve, are also available on Avalanche. The network has its own protocols, too, such as decentralized exchange Trader Joe and yield aggregator Yield Yak.\n\nA company called Ava Labs is the primary architect of Avalanche. In September 2021, Ava Labs raised around $320 million in funding, with the majority of that\u2014around $230 million\u2014coming from the failed hedge fund Three Arrows Capital.\n\nAvalanche relies on a proof-of-stake consensus protocol, Snowman, that powers the C-Chain and the P-Chain.

The proposal says that users are currently unable to \u201csupply more of those assets, borrow, repay, or withdraw.\u201c\n\nAlthough withdrawals are currently impossible, the team stated that funds are \u201cperfectly safe,\u201d as the bug can be fixed after a governance vote.\n\n.@AaveAave the latest upgrade of ReserveInterestRateStrategy in Aave V2 (Polygon) has caused a temporary halt of the protocol, impacting assets worth ~$110M!\n\nThe root cause is the new ReserveInterestRateStrategy is only compatible with Ethereum, not compatible with Polygon. https://t.co/kg5696QNPo pic.twitter.com/Ze3zSBS8Ck \u2014 BlockSec (@BlockSecTeam) May 19, 2023\n\nThe bug only affects Aave v2 on Polygon. Aave v3 \u2014 the most recent version \u2014 remains unaffected, as do v2 deployments to Ethereum or Avalanche.\n\nThe broken code arose because of a May 16 interest rate curve patch applied to all deployments of v2. The Polygon implementation of v2 uses a slightly different list of function definitions (called an \u201cinterface\u201d) for its rate strategy contracts when compared with the Ethereum and Avalanche implementations. But the interest rate curve changes did not take this difference into account, causing the bug to develop only in the Polygon deployment.\n\nThe new proposal asks Aave\u2019s governing body, Aave DAO, to approve code changes to only the Polygon version to fix the patch. Voting is scheduled to begin on May 20 and will continue until May 23, the proposal stated.\n\nRelated: Aave DAO votes for \u2018rescue plan\u2019 to save lost tokens\n\nAave is most well known for its flash loan feature that allows users to borrow crypto, make trades and pay back the loans within the same block without requiring collateral.

        "content": "Staking refers to the locking up of cryptocurrency in order to help secure a network and earn rewards. There are two types of staking: staking at the blockchain level, also known as proof of stake, and locking up tokens within a decentralized finance project or crypto platform.\n\nProof of stake is a method that blockchains\u2014notably Ethereum, Solana, and Tezos\u2014use to validate transactions. The blockchain takes the number of coins someone has locked up as an indication that they\u2019re trustworthy enough to process the transaction\u2014the idea is that, if someone has a significant financial interest (i.e. stake) in the tokens of a given blockchain, they are unlikely to behave maliciously. If someone does act badly, the network will \u201cslash\u201d their stake.\n\nMost staking requires a single account, known as a validator, to pledge a whole load of crypto. In Ethereum\u2019s case, that\u2019s tranches of 32 ETH. It\u2019s possible to stake with less ETH by delegating crypto to a pool, like Lido. In return, stakers receive a cut of the fee that the blockchain pays the validator.\n\nSome cryptocurrency wallets allow for stakes to be delegated to others running nodes\u2014Solflare lets users delegate stakes to Solana validators, for instance. Centralized crypto exchanges like Binance also support stakers, as well as a handful of bespoke staking pools, like Lido and Ankr. Lido is the largest staking pool on Ethereum, commanding 30% of the market.\n\nDeFi staking is more loosely defined, and is best interpreted as a project saying, \u201cLet us use your tokens and we\u2019ll give you more tokens in return.\u201d The purposes of DeFi staking can vary. Aave locks funds in a security module that covers bad debt, while others use staked tokens to fund risky investments. Crypto exchanges also offer this kind of staking, which is similar to interest-bearing accounts.\n\nStaking has been the subject of scrutiny by U.S. regulators, who have suggested it amounts to a securities offering. The U.S. exchange Kraken shut down its staking operation and paid a large fine in early 2023 to settle claims the service was unlawful.\n\n\n\nGo deeper:\n\nHow not to get slashed\u2014Coinbase\n\nEthereum staking\u2014Ethereum Foundation\n\n\n\nSee also:\n\nProof of stake\n\nProof of work a.k.a. mining\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\n\n\nTry it:\n\nLido\u2014a popular protocol for staking digital assets\n\nKraken\u2014a centralized exchange that lets you stake cryptocurrencies"

        "content": "Blockchain protocols work like regular computer networks, they have different tolerance levels. There\u2019s a limit to the traffic they can handle before getting congested. So, this leads to increased transaction costs. You can find this situation, particularly with Ethereum\u2019s blockchain.\n\nTo address this, layer 2 platforms were launched. These L2 scalability options function as lanes that connect to Ethereum\u2019s highway, unloading traffic to make it efficient and cheap. Let\u2019s find out more about Layer 2 blockchains. These layer 2 platforms provide a series of benefits. For example, they help reduce transaction costs and also allow developers to create better applications.\n\nShould I invest in Layer 2 projects?\n\nEthereum is the second-biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, coming behind Bitcoin. But, there\u2019s been a lot of growth on Ethereum in recent years, fueled by the rise of trends like decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nMany believe Ethereum will someday surpass Bitcoin, and if that were to happen, investing in Ethereum Layer 2 projects would be a smart move. These layers help Ethereum with scalability, so any growth on Ethereum ultimately affects them. We\u2019ve already seen this during the merge. Layer 2 had a fair share of the Ethereum buzz.\n\nWith the rise of transaction on Layer 2 roll-up solutions, here are a few things we should know LAYER 2\n\nWhat is Layer 2?\n\nLayer 2 are roll-up solutions on Ethereum blockchain meant to leverage on the security lethargy of Ethereum to deliver fast transaction. They achieve\u2026 pic.twitter.com/fGE6gtSDB7 \u2014 Bashir Muhammed (@BashirJasper) May 13, 2023\n\nNow, let\u2019s show you three top-layer 2 projects to consider if you\u2019re thinking of investing.\n\n1) Polygon\n\nPolygon is arguably the most popular layer 2 solution for Ethereum. It can process up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS), which puts it on pace with Visa. Fast transactions and cheap fees are two of the significant advantages that Polygon provides.\n\nWhat happens when a transaction is submitted on Polygon zkEVM Mainnet Beta? At a high level: 1\u20e3 A transaction is sequenced into a batch w/ other transactions;\n\n2\u20e3 Data of the batch is broadcast to L2 nodes\n\n3\u20e3 Data of the batch is made available to Ethereum; and then \u2014 Polygon (@0xPolygon) May 11, 2023\n\nYou can imagine Polygon as a train on a track with other trains. But the difference is that it makes very few stops and moves faster. So more people want to get on it because of these features.\n\nFor example, a developer can build and connect Ethereum-compatible blockchains using the Polygon framework. Additionally, it is simple to implement thanks to Polygon\u2019s one-click functionality and modules for creating unique blockchain networks.\n\nWhat is MATIC?\n\nMATIC is Polygon\u2019s native token. Polygon chose to retain MATIC for its sticker after it rebranded to Polygon. Here are some of the roles that MATIC plays:\n\nGovernance: MATIC holders can vote on changes to the blockchain.\n\nMATIC holders can vote on changes to the blockchain. Staking: Token holders can stake their crypto to earn profits.\n\nToken holders can stake their crypto to earn profits. Fees: Users pay network fees on Polygon with MATIC.\n\nThe developers release MATIC tokens on a monthly basis. However, the token has a maximum supply of 10 billion tokens. Currently, it\u2019s circulating supply is 9.25 billion (92%, are in circulation). In addition, Polygon has burned more than 9.6 million MATIC tokens or taken them off circulation.\n\nIn April, the daily avg gas on Polygon #zkEVM was 7X cheaper than Ethereum Mainnet, even during periods of peak network activity. Want to know which growth metrics were +300% this month? Follow the thread\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffd pic.twitter.com/9A3R4I9yiA \u2014 Polygon (@0xPolygon) April 27, 2023\n\nAccording to DeFillama, Polygon offers +350 decentralized applications, including NFT marketplaces, lending and borrowing, gambling, and blockchain gaming. MATIC will rise in value as more people use these applications.\n\n2) Arbitrum\n\nArbitrum is another standout among the list of popular Ethereum Layer 2 scaling options. Arbitrum was created by Off-chain Labs with characteristics that allow for seamless interoperability with Ethereum, making it simpler for Solidity developers to cross-compile their smart contracts.\n\nArbitrum\u2019s smart contracts validate using optimistic rollups. The platform\u2019s focus is on EVM compatibility, and this makes it unique. So, DApp developers can create their applications on the Arbitrum mainnet without having to learn a new programming language.\n\n5/5 We welcome all the new projects joining our ecosystem \ud83d\udc99\ud83e\udde1@ProhibitionArt (NFT Platform)@OlympusDAO (Bridge)@rentfun_io (NFT Rental) @MantaNetwork (Privacy)@ParticleNtwrk (Infrastructure) @parsiq_net (API) Have a great weekend Arbinauts & stay tuned for the next one! \u2014 Arbitrum (\ud83d\udc99,\ud83e\udde1) (@arbitrum) May 12, 2023\n\nArbitrum has an impressive transaction speed of 40,000 transactions per second (TPS). It provides this service at a price of no more than two cents. This way, it alleviates Ethereum\u2019s congestion with cheap fees and fast transactions.\n\nArbitrum recently announced the launch of its governance token, the ARB token, with an initial supply of 10 billion tokens. ARB currently trades at $1.15. It has a market cap of $1,4 billion and a circulating supply of 1,275,000,000 ARB coins.\n\nThe first generative art marketplace is coming to Arbitrum.\ud83c\udfa8 We're excited to see @prohibitionart bring @artblocksengine to the ecosystem. \ud83d\udc99\ud83e\udde1 https://t.co/pPJH9tDdpV \u2014 Arbitrum (\ud83d\udc99,\ud83e\udde1) (@arbitrum) May 11, 2023\n\nArbitrum has huge potential, and early adopters have a lot to gain. The project already competes with platforms like Polygon and Optimism in terms of TVL. TVL shows the amount of value locked within a platform.\n\n3) Stacks\n\nOur final Layer 2 doesn\u2019t exactly concern Ethereum. Instead, it focuses on Ethereum\u2019s rival, Bitcoin. Stacks is a layer 2 platform that unlocks the full potential of Bitcoin.\n\nStack\u2019s token, STX, has been in high demand since the start of the year as trade volumes between Stacks-based NFTs have risen as the growth of Bitcoin Ordinals has brought exposure to Bitcoin NFTs, which exist on Stacks as layer-2 NFTs.\n\nWelcome to #Stacks \ud83d\udc9c \ud83d\udc47 \u2b50 A #Bitcoin layer for smart contracts\n\n\u2b50 Enabling smart contracts and decentralized applications to trustlessly use $BTC as an asset\n\n\u2b50 Settling transactions on the #Bitcoin blockchain\n\n\u2b50 Unlocking #Bitcoin Decentralized Finance, NFTs, BNS, and more pic.twitter.com/VoHnypE1dx \u2014 stacks.btc (@Stacks) February 21, 2023\n\nStacks use self-executing smart contracts to improve the functionality of the Bitcoin blockchain. This means it can provide Bitcoin with trends like decentralized finance without changing Bitcoin\u2019s core features.\n\nStacks\u2019 STX token has seen good days in recent months. And this growth is all thanks to the growing interest in creating Bitcoin. Also, the team claims that users have minted more than 650,000 Bitcoin NFTs on Stacks Layer 2.\n\nLast week, Stacks Builders showed what it means to build on #Bitcoin \u2b50 @ALEXLabBTC launching Bridge, connecting Binance Chain to Stacks, & BRC-20 DEX\n\n\u2b50 NFT/Ordinal Marketplace @trygamma launched descending price auctions\n\n\u2b50 @LiquidiumFi launch date Ordinal DeFi Learn more \ud83d\udc47 \u2014 stacks.btc (@Stacks) May 16, 2023\n\nData from DeFiLlama shows that the Stacks Network\u2019s TVL has increased over the past few months, rising from $8 million in February to $35 million in mid-March. It currently stands at $33.27 million.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe have shown you three good Layer 2 projects for your portfolio. Crypto investments are often volatile. This means the numbers can change. However, these projects have good foundations. So they have long-term potential.\n\nMatic, ARB, and STX are available on a few exchanges, including Bybit.

        "content": "Uniswap Labs suggests Account Abstraction could propel crypto into the mainstream.\n\nThe EIP-4337 feature can change how users interact with Ethereum.\n\nThe shift will improve user experience, making it more flexible and adaptable.\n\nSince its inception, crypto has been struggling to gain mainstream adoption. However, this could soon change, thanks to a new feature on the Ethereum blockchain. Uniswap Labs recently highlighted Account Abstraction as a transformative feature that could mainstream crypto usage.\n\nOne significant barrier for users that want to use decentralized services has always been their relative complexity. On Thursday, May 18, Uniswap explained how Account Abstraction could enable a more seamless user experience on Ethereum.\n\nWhat Account Abstraction Really Does\n\nWhile Account Abstraction is a relatively new concept introduced in Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4337, it holds significant promise. Fundamentally, the idea makes it easier for people to interact with the network.\n\nWhenever users want to do anything on Ethereum, they have to send crypto from their wallets, sign a transaction and pay a gas fee. The process is complicated, especially for people unfamiliar with crypto.\n\n2/ Currently, users interact with Etheruem using EOAs (externally owned accounts\u2014AKA wallets).\n\n\n\nA crypto vet might be used to the EOA process of signing a new transaction and paying gas every time they connect to an app or do an action\u2014but for normies this process is cumbersome. \u2014 Uniswap Labs \ud83e\udd84 (@Uniswap) May 18, 2023\n\nThis could all change with Account Abstraction. Put simply, Account Abstraction enables smart contract wallets to perform complex operations, and determine how transactions process. Instead of users manually signing transactions and paying fees, smart wallets can do that automatically.\n\nThe use cases for this are many. For instance, it can allow someone else to pay the fee for a transaction. Moreover, one possibility includes helping users recover access to their wallets if they forget their seed phrase.\n\n4/ Some examples of what AA can allow for include:\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcb8 Sponsored transactions\n\n\ud83d\udd13 Seed phrase recovery\n\n\ud83e\udd1d Permissioned controls\n\n\n\nand much, much more. \u2014 Uniswap Labs \ud83e\udd84 (@Uniswap) May 18, 2023\n\nAccount Abstraction makes the process of using Ethereum more straightforward and user-friendly. Consequently, according to Uniswap, this will enable more people to start using crypto.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nWhile a promising idea, it is important to note that Ethereum Account Abstraction is still just in the proposal phase.\n\nWhile reducing the risk of errors, Account Abstraction means that users must trust developers that program these smart wallets. This exposes users to the risk of hacks and rug pulls.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nAccount Abstraction will fundamentally change how users interact with the Ethereum network and beyond. It also holds the promise of bringing crypto to mainstream usage.\n\nRead about the recent Uniswap Labs survey about DeFi adoption:\n\nUniswap Survey Uncovers DeFi Barriers, but Users Keen to Experiment\n\nRead about the recent shifts in the Bitcoin Network:\n\nBitcoin Network Usage Drops, But That May Not Be a Bad Thing"

        "content": "A brief history of NFTs: From inception to global recognition What started with Bitcoin-based colored coins in 2012\u20132013 became a phenomenon in 2021 and is still thriving. The Ethereum blockchain had a pivotal role in popularizing NFTs. Though 2021 turned out to be the year of Nonfungible tokens (NFTs), it wasn\u2019t the year when the technology was invented. Kevin McCoy minted the first NFT, \u201cQuantum,\u201d on the Namecoin blockchain in 2014. Nonetheless, the inception of Bitcoin-based colored coins in 2012\u20132013 marked the beginning of the concept that led to the development of BRC-20 tokens. This idea stemmed from a paper authored by Meni Rosenfield in 2012, and it paved the way for the evolution of digital tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. The world, however, noticed NFTs in 2017. This was mainly due to the arrival of the Ethereum blockchain, which overcame the limitations in the blockchains prior to it when it came to hosting NFTs. Ethereum not only provided NFTs with a reliable solution for critical things such as token creation, storage, programming and trading but also lowered the entry barrier for launching NFT projects. A brief history of NFTs can be segregated into a timeline:\n\nThe evolution of NFTs: From colored coins to the emergence of Rare Pepes and Spells of Genesis As mentioned, the story took off with colored coins, which were created to represent and manage ownership of real-world assets on the blockchain. They were different from Bitcoin (BTC) because of the \u201cnonfungible\u201d element that provided them with a unique utility. Demonstrating a humongous leap in Bitcoin\u2019s capabilities, colored coins were composed of tiny fractions of a Bitcoin, which could be as minuscule as a satoshi. Use cases of colored coins, such as the representation of property, coupons, or usage as digital collectibles, subscriptions, shares and access tokens, helped people realize the potential of blockchains for issuing assets. Bitcoin, however, was never intended to be used as a database for tokens, which meant that colored coins just remained at the concept level. However, the development did set off a series of experiments that culminated in NFTs. The first of the NFTs was \u201cQuantum,\u201d as mentioned before, an octagon-shaped animation. The arrival of Ethereum provided NFTs with the platform they required to flourish. A major project of this period that enabled the development of digital assets was The Counterparty platform built on Bitcoin. A spectrum of \u201cRare Pepes\u201d NFTs was released on The Counterparty, initiating the use case of NFT as artwork. \u201cSpells of Genesis,\u201d created on Ethereum, was another big NFT project after The Counterparty.\n\nThe rise of NFTs in gaming and the metaverse: From CryptoPunks to Axie Infinity Ethereum introducing a set of token standards facilitated the steady movement of NFTs toward the blockchain. The token standard informs developers how to deploy new tokens. The success of the Rare Pepes was followed by Larva Labs, a software development company that launched CryptoPunks, its own generative series of NFTs, created by John Watkinson and Matt Hall. Inspired by London punk culture, the project has 10,000 unique pieces, with no two characters resembling each other. CryptoPunks became a huge success and was the foundation of many other NFT projects, including the Bored Ape Yacht Club, one of the biggest NFT collections. The next major launch was CryptoKitties, which came up during the ETHWaterloo hackathon, back in October 2017. The game enables players to buy, sell and create NFTs representing virtual cats with desirable traits on Ethereum. Post CryptoKitties, NFT gaming became increasingly popular. NFT gaming combined with metaverse projects to formulate a new momentum. A major project of this era was Ethereum-based Decentraland, a virtual world that allows players to explore games and build and collect assets. In October 2018, Axie Infinity, an NFT-based battle game, was released. It set the ball rolling for play-to-earn (P2E) games, which enabled gamers to earn in-game rewards while playing. It\u2019s a pioneering video game on the Ethereum blockchain involving Axies, creatures that are rare NFTs with unique attributes. Gamers fight battles using Axies and build more attributes into them.\n\nExpanding beyond Ethereum: Non-Ethereum blockchains and the NFT ecosystem Certain factors propelled NFTs to a sharp surge in 2021. Various blockchains set up new standards specifically for NFTs. NFTs in 2021 witnessed a spike in supply and demand. According to NFT data company NonFungible.com, NFT trading jumped around 21,000% to top $17 billion during the year. The usage of NFTs in the art market was a major factor behind the surge. The emergence of digital art provided artists with another venue to showcase their creativity and store their work, which could be verified as well. Thanks to these advantages, digital art gained traction and helped propel the NFT boon. This was the time when renowned auction houses such as Christie\u2019s and Sotheby\u2019s moved their auctions online. Moreover, these auctions included art that pushed the popularity of NFTs. It was at Christie\u2019s where Beeple\u2019s \u201cEverydays: the First 5000 Days\u201d NFT made a record-shattering sale of $69 million. A sale of that scale drew the attention of non-Ethereum blockchains and blockchain enthusiasts toward NFTs. Buoyed by the NFT mania, blockchains such as Cardano, Solana, Flow and Tezos started work on their own platforms for NFTs. In September 2021, smart contracts became functional on Cardano, which facilitated the development of NFT applications on the platform. A few new standards were set up by various blockchains to establish the authenticity of nonfungible assets. A key event of the year was Facebook rebranding itself as Meta and strolling into the metaverse space. NFTs were always an integral part of the metaverse, leading to the surge in demand for NFTs."

        "content": "In the Cryptocurrency Market, the one standard rule is to invest what you can afford to lose. This explains why investors are often seen searching for projects that would give them a high return on their investment and not plunder them into ruins.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) has been one of the Cryptos that has seen an upsurge even in the face of the bearish spillover, while the same can not be said of Chainlink (LINK), as it hasn\u2019t performed well since the beginning of the year. However, the sensational crypto on the lips of investors now is Yachtify \u2013 a classic crypto bringing innovation to the crypto world.\n\nYachtify (YCHT): The New Crypto Revolution Introducing a New Dimension to Crypto Market Trading\n\nWith uncertainties surrounding LINK and ETC, investors are already calculating their moves and switching to Yachtify. Yatchtify, which is an investment platform for fractional yacht and boat purchases, aims to decentralize the ownership of private yachts by allowing every investor to own a yacht instead of being an exclusive reserve of the wealthy.\n\nHaving undergone KYC application and successfully audited by SolidProof, Yachtify is aiming to get as many individuals as possible into the yacht investment by allowing them to buy a fraction of the private yacht. Existing owners of a yacht can make a minimum of 25% of their investment for rent so that they can make passive income while still retaining the ownership of the yacht.\n\nTo make things easy, Yachtify has developed a token which is called YCHT that can be used to purchase NFTs that have underlying private yachts. At a presale value of $0.10 per token currently, this represents a viable alternative considering the uncertainties surrounding some cryptocurrencies. Savvy investors are already doing the needful and staking their claims by purchasing the YCHT token. The Yachtify project is going to shake the crypto space when it is launched. Thats why you need to stake your claim on the project now by purchasing the YCHT tokens before the price goes higher.\n\nJoin Presale: https://buy.yachtify.market\n\nWebsite: https://yachtify.market\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/yachtify\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/yachtify_market\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) Consolidates As Price Gains Strength\n\nIn the face of uncertainties and the bad performance of some established cryptocurrencies, Ethereum Classic (ETC) has defied the odds by establishing its superiority over others. In the last 24 hours, Ethereum Classic (ETC) has risen to $18.50, an increase of 1.50% \u2013 signifying Ethereum Classic\u2019s (ETC) readiness to continue to serve its admirers.\n\nHowever, despite this consolidation, the current price of Ethereum Classic (ETC) is still way far beyond its all-time high of $176.16 attained in May 2021. With Ethereum Classic (ETC) circulating supply of 140,831,391 and Ethereum Classic (ETC) market capitalization which is over $2 billion, it remains to be seen whether Ethereum Classic (ETC) will be able to sustain its momentum and appreciate further.\n\n>>>> BUY YACHTIFY TOKENS <<<\n\nInvestors Worry as Chainlink\u2019s (LINK) Recent Slip Continues\n\nInvestors are deeply concerned about the performance of Chainlink (LINK) recently after another week of price decline. The bearish moments have not been kind to Chainlink (LINK), with a 4.59% drop in the last 24 hours, giving the inclination that Chainlink (LINK) may experience bullish movement anytime soon.\n\nAfter showing some partial recovery in early April while selling for $8.72, Chainlink (LINK) price has plummeted to $6.57 as of press time. Investors are worried that Chainlink (LINK) may have to go on a massive momentum to get back on track. However, it appears Chainlink (LINK) is edging closer to red lines than it is to green lines.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "In recent years, crypto investors and buyers\u2019 interest in coin staking has grown tremendously as a result of the massive earning opportunities afforded by crypto staking. In this article, we will look at the Best Staking Coins in the crypto market today.\n\nIn this detailed overview, we will explore and summarize the Best Staking Coins that are worth considering for immediate purchase. We will discuss the specifics and highlight the most favorable opportunities for staking coins in 2023 and beyond.

ApeMax is unique in that holders of ApeMax can start earning by staking immediately, even as early as during the presale phase.\n\nAnother very interesting and attractive feature of ApeMax\u2019s staking system is that there are no minimum staking amounts, meaning that buyers with small and big budgets all get the same chance to take part in the staking and earn.

Due to the high 32 ETH minimum amount required to stake Ethereum as a validator, many holders opt for staking via centralized third parties such as Binance.

Based on available data from CoinMarketCap and other sources, Solana staking can generate returns ranging from 2 to 7.3%.\n\nPolygon\n\nPolygon, a secondary layer blockchain that enhances the scalability of the Ethereum network, is also another popular choice when it comes to staking.\n\nMATIC, the native currency of the Polygon network, can be staked by investors to receive rewards in return. There are also several ways to stake your Matic, such as by running a node on the network, or alternatively staking via a non-custodial wallet or with an exchange. Polygon staking APR has historically been between 2 to 7.9%.\n\nCardano\n\nBy staking Cardano, investors of ADA, Cardano\u2019s native token, can generate passive income while contributing to the security and reliability of the Cardano network. Cardano holds a prominent position among the best staking coins for crypto lovers.\n\nSimilar to other proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, there exist several methods to stake Cardano, which include creating a node, delegating your ADA, or via a centralized service. Cardano staking returns usually range between 2 to 6%.\n\nBest Staking Coins \u2013 Conclusion\n\nIn summary, this article presents the best staking coins that hold significant potential. Investing in cryptocurrencies is not suitable for everyone, but those who possess knowledge in the field and comprehend the potential risks and rewards may consider looking into these exciting coin staking options.\n\nStaking Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, and Cardano all offer interesting opportunities, but these all share one thing in common, the price of their native tokens are already quite high and possibly overpriced for some.\n\nApeMax stands out due to its unique staking tokenomics, offering earning possibilities to a wide range of buyers. The ongoing ApeMax presale presents a limited-time chance to obtain ApeMax coins at a very affordable rate. Whether you are an experienced cryptocurrency lover or a newcomer to the crypto space, venturing into the world of ApeMax staking could be an appealing and potentially golden opportunity.\n\nApeMax Official Website: https://www.apemax.io\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Cardano Founder Charles Hoskinson Slams Ethereum Classic As \"A Fraudulent Project With No Vision\" - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Cardano (ADA) Founder, Charles Hoskinson, has taken to Twitter to claim that Ethereum Classic (ETC) is now a \u201cscam\u201d and has no \u201cpurpose other than to allow insiders to dump their holdings\u201d on unsuspecting investors. Hoskinson, who previously worked with ETC, stated that the project has \u201cno roadmap, innovation, team, or vision\u201d, and is only filled with \u201canger and toxicity\u201d.\n\nCardano Founder Backs Ethical Alternative To Scam Operation\n\nHoskinson\u2019s comments were made in response to a Twitter post by the Proof of Work (POW) Summit and have raised eyebrows in the cryptocurrency community. Many have questioned the timing of Hoskinson\u2019s comments, as ETC has recently seen a surge in price and popularity.\n\nETC is now a scam and it's only purpose is for insiders to dump on those they recruit with blind hope of some magical future that will never come. There is no roadmap, innovation, team, or vision. It's just anger and toxicity. The Twitter account was built up from years of effort\u2026 \u2014 Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) May 19, 2023\n\nAccording to Hoskinson, ETC was built up from years of effort and marketing at Input Output Global (IOG), a technology company pre-eminent in engineering and research in blockchain structures, and it was not ethical to inflict upon those followers a project that is now a scam.\n\nFurthermore, Hoskinson believes that Ergo, which he is currently involved with, should have been what ETC is. Ergo is a cryptocurrency focused on improving blockchain technology\u2019s limitations, such as scalability, interoperability, and security.\n\nThe Cardano founder also claims that Ergo continues to innovate and has a purpose, good ethical leadership, and funding for the future. He believes Ergo is a better choice for investors looking for a cryptocurrency with a clear vision and a roadmap for the future.\n\nHoskinson\u2019s comments have sparked a debate in the cryptocurrency community about the legitimacy of ETC and the responsibilities of developers and insiders in the industry. While some have criticized Hoskinson for his comments, others have praised him for speaking out against what he perceives as unethical practices.\n\nHoskinson Shares Tips for \u201cSafe\u201d Crypto Storage\n\nThe recent Ledger controversy has sparked a debate among cryptocurrency users about the importance of security in the hardware wallet space. In response to this controversy, Cardano Founder Charles Hoskinson has shared his thoughts on what users should look for when choosing a hardware wallet.\n\nWith respect to the Ledger controversy, I say the following: 1) always choose open source software whenever possible that has been audited by numerous sources on a regular basis 2) security comes from simplicity- Design the smallest possible footprint 3) non-updateable\u2026 \u2014 Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) May 19, 2023\n\nHoskinson emphasizes the importance of open-source software audited by numerous sources regularly. This ensures that the software is transparent and that potential vulnerabilities are quickly identified and addressed.\n\nAdditionally, he suggests that simplicity is key when it comes to security. Designing a hardware wallet with the smallest possible footprint reduces the attack surface and makes it more difficult for hackers to find vulnerabilities.\n\nFurthermore, Hoskinson notes that non-updateable firmware is important when a company makes specific promises about its security model. This ensures that attackers cannot exploit any vulnerabilities discovered after the release of the hardware wallet. He suggests that decentralizing the process of updates would greatly enhance security in the hardware wallet space.\n\nCardano founder also reminds users that people buy hardware wallets to maximize the personal security of their funds and not for daily use or an equivalent user experience to hot wallets. Hardware wallets are an extreme example of self-custody and are designed to ensure that the private keys stay in one place on hardware that is hard to tamper with.\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView.com"

        "title": "Game Boy to be Soon Turned Into Ethereum and Bitcoin Wallet - The Coin Republic",
        "content": "90\u2019s feeling is the most caved feeling in the 2000s decade and how can somebody forget the Nintendo Game Boy? Keyp, a small crypto startup is trying to revamp and optimize the Nintendo Game Boy consoles to offline crypto wallets. The group of developers is trying hard to convert the gaming console to crypto hardware wallets called the Game Wallet.\n\nWhat\u2019s with the new Game Boy?\n\nThe developers have made sure that the Game wallet is not just another gimmick but a real thing. It is a brand new cartridge of the Game Boy that will be using gamification to generate users\u2019 seed phrases via interactions with non-playable characters and random quests.\n\nOnce it has been developed the wallet will be able to store all cryptocurrencies that use BIP-3 seed phrases. That will allow the wallets to store coins such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. The software aims to be open source and will allow implementations from anybody.\n\nKeyp\u2019s Vision with Game Boy\n\nJoseph Schiarizzi, founder of Keyp, while talking to a media house about the wallet, said that the experience will be \u201dPokemon-like\u201d.\n\nThe founder extends his views by saying that Keyp wants to make Web3 accessible and safe for everyone using tools such as social logins and extra security layers for wallets. The Game wallet is just a fun extension of that aim, said Joseph.\n\nThe nine-person team of Keyp has been developing the wallet since January. The team has recognized the need for offline storage after the recent controversy surrounding Ledger\u2019s new \u201crecovery\u201d has come up. The Game Wallet is marketing itself as offline storage with no firmware updates ever.\n\nSascha Mombartz, co-founder of Keyp mentioned on a Game Wallet product page that with the drama around the Ledger wallet update they\u2019ve realized the need for offline storage that the users can trust.\n\nMombartz added that it started as a fun idea but it seems like a really important product now. Mombartz said that it is not easy to trust a new security device with a supply chain since people don\u2019t have any idea who has tampered with it but to know where your Game Boy has been on the shelf for the last 20 years is easy.\n\nJoseph told a media house that there is no official release date for Game Wallet but they\u2019re planning to open pre-orders and for a summer rollout given there are no hurdles.\n\nThis is not the first instance where crypto enthusiasts have tried to change the Game Boy to a crypto device. The gaming console was turned into a Bitcoin mining machine a few years ago by a pseudonymous IT security researcher. A very slow one though."
