        "content": "What Is Ethereum Proof-of-Stake?\n\nBy Gaurav Roy\n\nRead 6 min Medium\n\nSHARE\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS \u2014 Ethereum officially switched to a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism in 2022 as a more secure and energy-efficient way to validate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Consensus mechanisms like PoS are integral to a network\u2019s security. It is a complex system, and to make informed decisions it is important to gain an understanding of the underlying system.\n\n\n\n\u2014 In this article, we aim to demystify the complex concepts behind Ethereum\u2019s PoS consensus algorithm to provide a clear and comprehensive understanding to our readers.\n\nProof of stake (PoS) is the underlying mechanism for Ethereum\u2019s consensus algorithm. For those unversed about this change, in 2022, Ethereum officially switched to the PoS mechanism, which is believed to be less energy-intensive and provides a platform for implementing new scaling solutions.\n\nIn this article, Ledger Academy will help you understand the intricacies of Ethereum\u2019s PoS consensus algorithm in a simple yet concise manner, so let\u2019s start!\n\nWhat Is Proof of Stake (PoS)?\n\nProof of Stake (PoS) is a type of consensus mechanism that is used to secure blockchain networks. Consensus mechanisms are the backbone of all blockchains, as the underlying rules that determine how a network functions.\n\nWhat\u2019s a Consensus Mechanism?\n\nLet\u2019s start by understanding the idea of consensus. Generally speaking, consensus is a process used to reach an agreement among a group of people.\n\nIn terms of blockchain, the consensus is the process by which a group of nodes on a network determines which blockchain transactions are valid. A consensus mechanism is the methodology to achieve this agreement.\n\nSo, a blockchain is a digital ledger of distributed, decentralized, and often public transactions. Each transaction on a blockchain is recorded as a \u2018block\u2019 of data and must be verified by peer-to-peer computer networks before being added to the chain. This system helps secure the blockchain against fraudulent activity and double-spending.\n\nThere are many types of consensus mechanisms. Each work in different ways but have one purpose: to ensure that transaction records on a blockchain are true and honest. Proof of Stake (PoS) is one of the most popular consensus mechanisms.\n\nPoS Consensus Mechanism\n\nA Proof of Stake (PoS) network is a system that uses staked cryptocurrency to secure itself. Every validator node must have \u201clocked up\u201d a security deposit consisting of ETH on the network in order to participate in consensus. By using the crypto as collateral, it compels the nodes to behave properly and helps to keep the network secure.\n\nWhat Is a Validator?\n\nA validator node is a vital part of a blockchain network. It is responsible for participating in the consensus-building process of a Proof of Stake blockchain. Validator nodes vote on the authenticity of a new block of transactions, thus communally ensuring new blocks are valid before permanently adding them to the blockchain. Meanwhile, one specific node is selected as the \u201cblock proposer\u201d for the current time slot. This node is responsible for building the new block of transactions and broadcasting it to the other nodes to be verified.\n\nHow Are New Blocks Verified?\n\nEach validator node has the same copy of the blockchain\u2019s history. Using this common history, they assess whether new blocks of transactions are valid. Then vote on this point as a group before adding them to the main chain.\n\nHow does the Ethereum Network select Validators?\n\nThe validator selection in Ethereum\u2019s Proof of Stake (PoS) system is based on a validator\u2019s stake in the network. To explain, the greater the stake, the more likely that node will be selected to add the new block to the chain.\n\nEthereum Staking Requirements\n\nIn the Ethereum PoS system, each validator must stake the network\u2019s native tokens (in this case, 32 ETH). The requirement to stake ETH incentivizes validators to act in the network\u2019s best interests. This because validators stand to lose their investment if they try to subvert the system, or fail to validate reliably and effectively.\n\nThrough the Ledger Live app, you can easily and securely stake Ethereum coins to a validator and start earning ETH rewards, passively.\n\nWhat Is Finality?\n\nFinality is the time it takes to protect a transaction on the blockchain. Finality guarantees that a particular block in the blockchain cannot be changed or reversed. The transactions within the block are therefore immutable.\n\nEven after a transaction is confirmed as part of the most recent block, it doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t be changed or undone. For a short period that follows, a transaction may be vulnerable to attacks from bad actors who try to exploit weak points in the blockchain.\n\nBlock Finality Under Ethereum Proof of Stake\n\nUnder Proof of Stake (PoS), Ethereum uses \u201ccheckpoint\u201d blocks to manage validator votes. The first block of each epoch (a period of 32 slots where the validators propose and attest for blocks and is of 6.4 minutes) is a checkpoint.\n\nAs well as voting for the validity of individual blocks, validators subsequently vote for whole checkpoints. If the checkpoint receives votes from at least two-thirds of the total staked ETH, it is upgraded. The most recent checkpoint then becomes \u201cjustified.\u201d The earlier checkpoint, which is already justified because it was the target in the previous epoch, is now upgraded to \u201cfinalized.\u201d\n\nIf an attacker wants to revert a finalized block, they would therefore have to be willing to lose at least one-third of all the ETH that\u2019s been staked.\n\nWhat Is Slashing?\n\nSlashing is a disciplinary system used by PoS protocols to penalize validators for any harmful or irresponsible behaviors. This usually involves the network deducting some of their security deposit (their initial staked coins).\n\nTo understand it further, let\u2019s take a look at some of the key elements of slashing:\n\nIncentivizing Validators\n\nIn the Ethereum PoS system, the sum of crypto staked by validator nodes (32 ETH) acts as a security deposit. Since the amount can be \u201cslashed\u201d by the network (if a validator fails to behave appropriately) validator nodes have a vested interest in behaving in a way that benefits the blockchain.\n\nDeterring Downtime\n\nOne of the most common behaviors that lead to slashing is downtime. The term \u201cdowntime\u201d refers to the period of time during which a validator is offline and unable to produce new blocks. This can be due to network delays, software issues, or hardware problems.\n\nWhen a validator is down, they cannot participate in the consensus process. Since this is detrimental to the overall functioning of the network, it is penalized by the network via slashing.\n\nHow Proof of Stake (PoS) Differs from Proof of Work (PoW)?\n\nBoth PoW and PoS are types of consensus mechanisms that allow cryptocurrency networks to operate with no central governing authority. But they achieve this in different ways and have varying degrees of security and reliability.\n\nProof of Work: Security via Energy Consumption\n\nWith Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanisms, a new block can only be added if the block hash is calculated via an incredibly complex equation. It can take trillions of guesses before that value is randomly discovered by a miner. Which can consume a lot of power. Only the miner who achieves this first will confirm the block and be rewarded. In this system, energy is the resource the network uses to secure itself. The huge amount of energy required to overcome the blockchain\u2019s consensus mechanism is a key deterrent for bad actors.\n\nProof of Stake: Security via Staked Coins\n\nA proof-of-stake network like Ethereum secures itself via staked cryptocurrency. Instead of expending computing energy to solve a puzzle, the nodes validating new transactions stake their own value as collateral. These nodes then run efficiently and honestly to avoid losing that collateral.\n\nMeanwhile, any bad actor wishing to gain control over the network would need to own more than 51% of the coins staked at that time. Controlling 51% of all staked coins on the network is so difficult that it makes such an attack extremely unlikely. This is how the consensus mechanism that secures Proof of Stake networks works.\n\nEthereum Proof of Stake\n\nWith the recent Merge now complete after years of work, Ethereum\u2019s transition to Proof of Stake is now active. But the process as a whole is not complete, so its full impact is still not seen. Ethereum 2.0 is still yet to arrive.\n\nAt the time of writing, staked ETH and staking rewards are yet to be unlocked. Moreover, we are yet to see the implementation of some major new scalability options, such as sharding. Only time will tell exactly how secure the network is under this new consensus mechanism.\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum\u2019s Proof of Stake consensus mechanism will help you make informed decisions about interacting with the blockchain. Knowledge is power, and Ledger Academy is here to act as your guide. Unraveling the complex yet powerful consensus mechanism securing the behemoth blockchain that is Ethereum.\n\nKnowledge is Power."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s native token, Ether (ETH), has printed a death cross technical pattern versus Bitcoin (BTC) for the first time since May, suggesting more pain ahead for ETH/BTC in the coming weeks.\n\nPrevious ETH price death cross preceded 27.5% drop\n\nA death cross appears when an asset\u2019s short-term 50-day moving average moves below its long-term 200-day moving average. Such a chart pattern was seen in December 2007, ahead of the global economic crisis.\n\nSimilarly, the ETH/BTC\u2019s previous death cross, in May, preceded an approximately 27.5% price correction, dropping in part as investors reduced exposure to altcoins and sought safety in Bitcoin amid the Terra collapse.\n\nETH/BTC daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe latest ETH/BTC death cross could lead to a similar short-term sell-off, primarily due to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s crackdown on crypto staking services. Staking is a key feature of many blockchains, including Ethereum.\n\nRelated: Why is Bitcoin price up today?\n\nMeanwhile, capital flows to and from Bitcoin and Ethereum-based funds also reveal BTC gaining the upper hand. Interestingly, Bitcoin-based investment funds have attracted $183 million in 2023 compared to Ethereum\u2019s $15 million, according to CoinShares\u2019 latest weekly report.\n\nNext targets for ETH/BTC\n\nThe next potential targets to watch for ETH/BTC are best visible on the weekly chart.\n\nNamely, the 0.067-0.065 BTC area, which has served as a strong support level in recent history. A successful rebound here could have ETH price rebound toward its multi-month descending trendline resistance (black) near 0.075 BTC.\n\nETH/BTC weekly price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nConversely, a decisive break below the 0.067-0.065 BTC range could have ETH enter an extended selloff toward the 200-week exponential moving average (200-week EMA; the blue wave) near 0.055 BTC, down about 20% from current price levels.\n\nNotably, the 200-week EMA served as a bottom to the November 2021-June 2022 bear cycle.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Should You Buy Ethereum While It's Still Below $2,000? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "This year has been off to a positive start for crypto investors, with many cryptocurrencies surging over the past several weeks.\n\nEthereum (ETH 0.32%) is currently up by more than 26% so far this year, after falling by nearly 68% throughout 2022. This growth is promising for investors, giving hope that perhaps the worst of this crypto winter is behind us.\n\nEthereum was recently priced at just under $1,500 per token. Many investors are optimistic about its potential, though, and there's a chance it could soar past $2,000. Does that mean now is the time to buy?\n\nIs Ethereum still a good investment?\n\nCrypto in general is still largely speculative. Nobody can say for certain what its future looks like, or whether it will even exist a decade or two from now. When you're choosing where to invest, then, it's wise to focus on a cryptocurrency's long-term potential.\n\nAt the moment, Ethereum is one of the strongest investments in the crypto sector. It has a unique set of advantages, including:\n\nA first-mover advantage: Ethereum was launched in 2015, well before competitors like Solana , Cardano , and Avalanche . That first-mover advantage has helped it grow into one of the most widely used blockchains in the crypto industry.\n\nEthereum was launched in 2015, well before competitors like , , and . That first-mover advantage has helped it grow into one of the most widely used blockchains in the crypto industry. A go-to platform for dApps: Ethereum is also the most popular network for decentralized applications (dApps), including DeFi projects, non-fungible token marketplaces, and metaverse uses.

It's also an open-source blockchain, meaning developers can create new projects on the network. If any of these projects take off, Ethereum will benefit from it. A home for other cryptos: Ethereum can also host other cryptos on its network, and it's home to several high-profile projects including Shiba Inu, Polygon, The Sandbox, and Decentraland. If any crypto hosted on Ethereum's blockchain succeeds, Ethereum itself will thrive as well.\n\nLike any investment, Ethereum also has its downsides. The network continues to struggle with sluggish transaction speeds and high gas fees, for example, which have been causing frustration among users.\n\nBut developers have been diligently working on upgrades to improve the blockchain. The much-anticipated update of 2022, The Merge, went off without a hitch and successfully transitioned Ethereum from a proof-of-work protocol to proof of stake. And its upcoming upgrade, Shanghai, will help improve the staking process.\n\nEthereum also has future upgrades in the pipeline to increase its efficiency and reduce fees, and the most important of these updates is currently slated for sometime in 2023 or 2024.\n\nShould you invest in Ethereum right now?\n\nWhether or not you choose to invest in Ethereum now will depend on a couple of factors, including your long-term outlook and tolerance for risk.\n\nAgain, all cryptocurrency is still speculative at the moment, so despite all of Ethereum's advantages, there are no guarantees that the sector as a whole will thrive over the long term. But if you believe in Ethereum's potential and are willing to take that risk, now could be a smart time to buy.\n\nBefore you invest, though, double-check your finances and overall portfolio. Crypto is notoriously volatile, and Ethereum is no exception. Don't invest anything you can't afford to lose, be sure you're willing to keep your money invested for at least a few years, and prepare for more volatility in the near term.\n\nAlso, it's wise to ensure that the rest of your portfolio is well diversified. This will help protect your savings in case your crypto investments don't pan out.\n\nEthereum could be a fantastic long-term investment, but there are never any guarantees when it comes to crypto. By assessing your tolerance for risk, it will be easier to decide whether it's the right investment for you."

        "title": "Why Ethereum Has The Potential To Reach $100K - Tech Guide",
        "content": "Since its humble origins back in 2015, there has been a core of people who strongly believe in the potential Ethereum has to change the world. When the value of the network\u2019s native token of Ether surged past $4,600 last year, this group of people only skyrocketed.\n\nEven when the price of Ether subsequently dropped, the number of people keen to get on board only continued to grow. Because, despite the worldwide drop in crypto prices, Ethereum ploughs on and continues to remain the decentralised blockchain network of choice for countless projects, cryptocurrencies and, increasingly, mainstream sectors, businesses, and industries.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that the Ethereum blockchain and the many applications and projects hosted upon it have drastically changed our world for the better. Increasingly, it\u2019s being used to great effect to overhaul a range of sectors and businesses, from tourism and aviation to the military and real estate.\n\nEthereum is showing no sign of stopping anytime soon. But today, I want to explore an important topic: Can Ethereum hit that monumental milestone of $100,000 per token? And if so, why?\n\nPlus, if you\u2019re one of the many people keen to get on board with Ethereum and invest in it for the future, I\u2019ll also be showing you how to do so in the safest and most popular method whilst simultaneously helping you to avoid scam platforms.\n\nHowever, if you\u2019re short on time and want the short and sweet of this article, here it is!\n\nAccording to many respected crypto experts worldwide, Ethereum can reach a value of $100,000 per token. This is because of the increasing reliance that digital bonds, tokenised real estate and securities, DEFI, and NFTs are showing towards Ethereum, combined with the impending rollout of ETH 2.0, which aims to deal with scalability issues stemming from the flood of people trying to use the network.\n\nWhen? Most people predict that Ethereum could hit the $100,000 mark when Bitcoin hits 1.5 million, which is expected to be sometime within a decade.\n\nHowever, please remember that this article is neither a price prediction nor is it investment advice. It is merely speculation into the future of Ethereum and what it has the potential to achieve. Now, keep reading for the fascinating in-depth answer!\n\nDoes Ethereum Have the Potential to Hit $100K?\n\nTo look into the potential of Ethereum properly, we have to explore some of the blockchain network\u2019s most promising aspects. Firstly is its ability to host decentralised applications (dApps) and allow developers and programmers to build an unlimited array of fascinating projects upon it.\n\nWhen a project, cryptocurrency, or network is built on the Ethereum network, it is then granted the many benefits that come with blockchain technology, such as decentralisation, enhanced security, and better transparency.\n\nFor example, take some current business giants like Twitter or Instagram. The same type of business, albeit centralised and with way better capabilities, can be built upon the Ethereum blockchain. However, Ethereum itself is more closely related to a form of the internet, which is why it\u2019s often referred to as \u201cthe internet 2.0\u201d.\n\nOf course, Ethereum isn\u2019t the only big player in the world of blockchain networks. You also have contenders like Solana and the Binance smart chain. However, when it comes to the first choice of developers and programmers, Ethereum is number one. To prove this point, let\u2019s look at just how much Ethereum has a stronghold in the DeFi and NFT market.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Stronghold in the DeFi and NFT market\n\nRemember when I mentioned Ethereum\u2019s \u201ccompetitors\u201d? Well, some might not even call them competitors at all. Just take the Binance smart chain (Ethereum\u2019s main competition), for example. The former hosts a mere 10% of all DeFi applications on the global DeFi market, whereas Ethereum has an insanely high percentage of 60%. And the number is rapidly rising.\n\nAnd that\u2019s not all. From the birth of the NFT sector, Ethereum has equally had a stronghold in the NFT market, too. However, regarding NFTs, Solana is hot on Ethereum\u2019s heels. But will it last forever?\n\nThe main reason behind Solana\u2019s increasing market share in the NFT market is that it can offer higher speeds, lesser fees, and a better level of scalability than Ethereum. At least, that was the case before the announcement of ETH 2.0., Ethereum\u2019s answer to the scalability issues the network had been facing. As the Ethereum upgrade is successfully rolled out over time, it has the potential to conquer its rivals and remain as the powerhouse of blockchain networks.\n\nAfter all, when ETH 2.0 secures Ethereum\u2019s position as a high-speed, affordable network with a high level of scalability, developers and programmers don\u2019t have much incentive to create decentralised apps or mint NFTs on other networks that are lesser than Ethereum.\n\nEthereum Can Be Used on a State Level\n\nState-level use of decentralised currencies and blockchain technology seemed like a pipedream not too long ago. But these days, it\u2019s a very real reality. Increasingly, governments worldwide are showing intense interest in blockchain technology. In particular, many are interested in writing their national laws on decentralised networks like Ethereum and taking advantage of blockchain technology like many others do.\n\nIn addition, there is an increasing number of governments interested in using blockchains like Ethereum to log data on the ownership of land and property in their country in a more transparent, secure, and interconnected way than the flawed current processes.\n\nWhen it comes to real-world use cases of Ethereum being implemented on a state level by global governments, the list is endless. However, these two examples mentioned above are some which are most commonly seen.\n\nWhere Are People Buying Ethereum & Where Is It Safe to Do So?\n\nAnd now, to answer an important question, and one I\u2019m sure many of you are keen to find out! Where do people buy Ethereum, and how do they do it safely?\n\nSadly, there are many dodgy places and faces in the crypto market, and many of them are lying in wait to take advantage of new investors who are a little green around the gills. However, this can be sidestepped by using a well-liked and popular platform like Binance. Alternatively, you can consider using a marketing tool that will connect you to a suitable crypto broker\n\nEthereum Is Already Being Used by Centralized Banks\n\nRecently, a major piece of news dropped regarding the use of Ethereum by a central bank. It was announced that the EU-owned European Investment Bank (EIB) was planning to issue the institution\u2019s first digital bond created on a public blockchain. And yes, as you\u2019ve probably guessed, it was issued on the Ethereum blockchain!\n\nThat\u2019s seriously big news! A centralised bank backed by multiple EU member states just administered a bond using the Ethereum blockchain. If that\u2019s not bullish, I don\u2019t know what is!\n\nAfter all, the global market for bonds is worth a whopping $100 trillion. Now, imagine if this market sees a significant shift towards using the Ethereum network for issuing bonds. If this happens, it\u2019s almost a given that Ethereum will equally become the go-to network for hosting central bank-issued digital currencies. To say this could cause its price to skyrocket is an understatement.\n\nA good example of this is Norway, where the Scandinavian country\u2019s central bank is currently trialling a CBDC (central bank digital currency) on the Ethereum network. The plan, which a cryptocurrency company is working on with the Norwegian central bank, is to create a digitised version of the Krone, Norway\u2019s national fiat currency. The test phase is underway and is seeing what kind of financial impact the digitised currency will have on the country.\n\nAll of this ties in with the ongoing merge to ETH 2.0, which, with each update being rolled out, is increasingly allowing the Ethereum network to scale enough that it can meet the needs of central banks and governments on a national level, as well as overcome the challenges that come with it.\n\nEthereum and the Real Estate Revolution\n\nTraditionally, the realm of real estate has been seen as a solid investment and one that is often pushed for people to invest their money into. However, getting a foot on the property ladder requires a lot of capital, to begin with. This initial step into the world of real estate can be a major hurdle for many people, but Ethereum has the potential to change this.\n\nLet\u2019s say, for example, that you\u2019re looking to own a property that is 100 square metres in size and worth $100,000. You need money (who doesn\u2019t?), and the property is the bulk of all of your assets. Of course, you could sell, but then you\u2019d be without a house! But, with Ethereum, there is another option at hand. You can tokenise the property.\n\nDoing so is pretty simple. You just need to mint a token on the Ethereum blockchain (one which emanates its worth from the property itself). Let\u2019s say; for example, you create a digital token. For instance; you can create one token per square foot and value them at $100,000/ 100 square metres = $1000 each.\n\nThen? You just need to sell as many tokens to investors as you need while keeping most of them for yourself. Let\u2019s say you sell 20% of tokens for a total of $20,000; you still get to own 80% of your property with a nice profit to spend or reinvest elsewhere.\n\nThis way, you keep 80% of the property while other investors own 20%.\n\nOK, So Just When Will Ether (ETH) Reach $100K?\n\nWell, truth be told, it\u2019s impossible to tell. After all, as I mentioned at the beginning, this article is neither a price prediction nor a piece of investment advice. However, when you look at the opinions of many respected crypto experts worldwide, many have predicted that the Ethereum network\u2019s native currency of Ether (ETH) could potentially hit $100K within the next ten years.\n\nConclusion: Yes, Ethereum Can Reach $100K\n\nTo summarise this article, we\u2019ve looked into several reasons why Ethereum has the potential to one day hit $100,000. The main reasons behind this are the increasing use of Ethereum in the world of digital bonds, real estate, and government and central bank usage of the blockchain network on a state level.\n\nMany experts are eyeing these increasing use cases of Ethereum daily. A growing number of them have all agreed that it\u2019s merely a case of time before Ethereum potentially surges to $100,000 or more."

        "content": "TORONTO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Ether Capital Corporation (\u201cEther Capital'' or \u201cthe Company\u201d) (NEO: ETHC) is pleased to announce it has committed 8,000 Ether (C$18.1 million equivalent) to Ethereum Staking, which is in addition to the 7,488 Ether the Company Staked in January 2023. In total, Ether Capital has Staked 36,000 Ether (C$81.4 million equivalent), representing 79.4 per cent of its portfolio.\n\nStaking Ether is a core part of the Company\u2019s three-pronged strategy: To continue being a net accumulator of Ether, Stake the majority of the Company\u2019s Ether balance to generate yield (Staking Rewards), and use a portion of the revenue generated from Staking to build institutional-grade infrastructure that supports the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n\u201cWe view Staking as the most reliable way to generate yield in the space and create additional value for our shareholders,\u201d said Brian Mosoff, CEO of Ether Capital. \u201cWhen individuals or companies Stake ETH, they are making a commitment to help secure the network and validate future transactions that take place on Ethereum. This is a protocol we believe will one day act as a primary settlement layer for the global economy and support trillions of dollars of activity. Our goal has always been to stake as much Ether as possible and put our weight behind Ethereum as the number one platform of choice for user and developer activity.\u201d\n\nEther Capital will continue to monitor developer progress when it comes to Ethereum upgrades and will update the market if it decides to stake more of its Ether balance.\n\nThe Company is also pleased to announce that Brett Bergmann will be advising the Management Team on technical strategy and execution over the coming months. Mr. Bergmann has several years of experience in the crypto industry and was part of the initial team that designed the Company\u2019s multi-signature wallet in 2018. Shayan Eskandari will be stepping down from the role of Chief Technical Officer as of March 7, 2023. Mr. Eskandari joined Ether Capital in fall 2021 to assist with developing technical infrastructure that allowed the Company to build out its operating businesses. Since that time, Ether Capital has expanded technical resources, become one of the first public companies in the world to stake Ether and will continue developing in-house products to further bolster the Ethereum ecosystem. Mr. Eskandari is planning to return to academia and focus on his PhD. The Company thanks him for his contributions and wishes him well on his next chapter.\n\nAbout Ether Capital Corporation\n\n\u200b\u200bEther Capital (NEO: ETHC) is a public technology company with a long-term objective to become a central business and investment hub for the Ethereum ecosystem. The Company has invested the majority of its balance sheet in Ethereum\u2019s native utility token \u201cEther\u201d as a core strategic asset and yield-generating instrument. The Company is focused on financial infrastructure that supports the Ethereum blockchain and delivers corporate value. Ether Capital\u2019s management team and Board of Directors are comprised of crypto natives, leading venture capitalists and traditional finance experts, which uniquely positions the company to identify and capitalize on opportunities in the digital asset ecosystem.

        "title": "How Many Ethereum Are There in 2023? - Bankless Times",
        "content": "Like many cryptocurrencies, the supply of Ethereum on the market is constantly changing, as new blocks are mined in the blockchain. Currently, Ethereum is the most popular altcoin (alternative to Bitcoin) on the market, and has been the top altcoin for a long time.\n\nRead on to find out everything you need to know about the availability of Ethereum tokens today.\n\nHow Many Ethereum Are There in 2023?\n\nThere is a total of 121,826,163.06 ETH or Ethereum coins in circulation (Q1: Year 2023). Notably, Ethereum is different from Bitcoin. While there can only ever be 21 million BTC (Bitcoins) in circulation, Ethereum\u2019s supply is potentially unlimited.\n\nWhen Vitalik Buterin created Ethereum, he made the network suitable for an unlimited amount of coins. This prevents ETH from having a fixed security budget.\n\n(CoinMarketCap)\n\nExploring the Number of Ethereum Coins Available\n\nEthereum is the world\u2019s most popular altcoin, operating on a different principle from Bitcoin. There\u2019s no specific Ethereum supply cap, which means the total number of coins in circulation will continue to increase for as long as people mine the blockchain.\n\nA total of 18 million ETH coins can be mined per year.\n\nWhile there\u2019s essentially no limit on the number of Ethereum coins we can mine in total, there are caps on the number of coins anyone can mine in a specific time frame.\n\nAccording to the explanation on the Ethereum coin limit shared by Vitalik Buterin, it\u2019s only possible to mine 18 million ETH coins per year. This equates to around 2 ETH being mined per block in the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n(Ethereum.org)\n\nThere are 135.3 billion ETC (Ethereum Classic coins) in circulation.\n\nWhen looking at the circulating supply of Ethereum, it\u2019s worth noting there are two different types of coins on offer. The most common and popular coin is ETH.\n\nHowever, a disagreement between members of the Ethereum community meant a new blockchain was created called \u201cETC\u201d or Ethereum Classic. Both of these coins use the same technology platforms and have a similar formal roadmap for development.\n\n(CoinMarketCap)\n\nIn 2021, the size of the Ethereum blockchain was 175 GB.\n\nThough the exact size of the Ethereum blockchain today is difficult to estimate, we do have some insights into how large it might be. Peter Szilagyi, a team lead and the lead developer of the Go implementation of the Ethereum protocol, revealed the blockchain was 175 GB large in 2021.\n\nIn comparison, a node of Bitcoin is approximately 412 GB. While Ethereum is currently generating more data than Bitcoin, the Bitcoin blockchain is still much larger.\n\n(Peter Szilagyi, Twitter)\n\nThere are 5750 blocks of Ethereum mined per day.\n\nThere are around 5750 Ethereum blocks mined per day as of June 2022. This is a reduction of around 11.61% from the same period in 2021, and insight into how the Ethereum coin limit is maintained. According to some calculators, the average number of Ethereum blocks an individual could mine per hour at a hash rate of 2500 would be 0.00134985 ETH.\n\nWith more miners contributing additional power to the network, the difficulty of mining Ethereum has increased dramatically over the last year. This means even if you mine a full block in a matter of seconds, you\u2019ll only get a small amount of Ethereum.\n\n(YCharts)\n\nThere are around 2,151 nodes running on the Ethereum network.\n\nThe most active country contributing to the amount of Ethereum in circulation is the USA. Around 1,060 of the full 2,151 nodes active right now are located in the US. The United Kingdom is the second biggest player, with 205 nodes.\n\n(Etherscan)\n\nEhereum has the potential to become deflationary.\n\nBecause there\u2019s no limit on the Ethereum total supply available to be mined in the long term, there are some potential risks. According to a disclaimer published on GitHub, if more money is burned on the cost of mining ETH than the value of the rewards, it could become deflationary.\n\n(GitHub)\n\nUnderstanding the Total Ethereum Supply\n\nUltimately, while there\u2019s no chance of ETH running out any time soon, there are still limits on what people can reasonably mine and contribute to the current circulation. Right now, the supply of Ethereum continues to grow at a rapid pace, as it remains the number one altcoin on the market.\n\nSources:\n\nHere Are More Ethereum Guides"

        "content": "A top analyst and trader is detailing the path forward for the two leading crypto assets, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).\n\nStarting with Bitcoin, pseudonymous crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa tells his 10,700 YouTube subscribers in a new video that if the flagship digital asset rises above the 2023 high of around $24,200, it would indicate that it is in a bullish phase.\n\n\u201cSo we consider this high around $24,000: if it breaks that area cleanly\u2026 like a solid break to like $26,000 or something at that point I think that we can see it coming back down, going higher and just continuing up\u2026 That, in my opinion, would be a clear bullish market structure at this point.\u201d\n\nThe pseudonymous crypto analyst and trader, however, says that a lower high would be a bearish indicator for Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cYou know, there\u2019s some bearish indicators where you know, if we hit a lower high, comes back up to say $22,000, $23,000 and then just brings us down or just breaks down here, obviously at that point we\u2019re just going to go down to $20,000.\u201d\n\nAccording to Altcoin Sherpa, Bitcoin could rally by over 30% from the current levels and then collapse to the 2022 low of under $16,000.\n\n\u201cTo be clear I actually don\u2019t really necessarily think the bottom is totally in. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if price continues higher, maybe to $25,000. I have always expected it going to $25,000 \u2013 $30,000 and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it goes to $30,000 eventually.\n\nBut it would make a lot of sense to me if price trades up to $25,000 to $30,000 and then comes back all the way down to $20,000 or something like that. Or $17,000. Or even $15,000.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is trading at $22,568 at time of writing.\n\nTurning to ETH, Altcoin Sherpa says that depending on Bitcoin\u2019s behavior, the second-largest crypto asset by market cap could surge by over 25% from the current levels.\n\n\u201cEthereum looks pretty strong overall. I really still am shooting for the highs around $2,000\u2026 I do believe personally that the $2,000 areas will come through as long as Bitcoin is steady.\u201d\n\nAccording to the pseudonymous crypto analyst, traders should wait for Ethereum to rise above the $1,700 resistance level before considering a long entry.\n\n\u201cBut still, would wait for a break of $1,600 \u2013 $1,700 before really considering the $2,000 area.\u201d\n\nEthereum is trading at $1,577 at time of writing.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "The decentralized autonomous organization behind Lido \u2014 the largest Ethereum staking pool \u2014 is deliberating whether it should sell or stake the $30 million in Ether (ETH) from its treasury.\n\nA proposal was submitted on Feb. 14 by the DAO\u2019s financial unit, Steakhouse Financial, that considers four choices, one of which contemplates staking part or all of its ETH on Lido in the form of Lido Staked ETH (stETH).\n\nAnother would see LidoDAO selling a part or all of its 20,304 ETH for a stablecoin, with the purpose being to extend the DAO\u2019s runway.\n\nThe four proposals submitted by Steakhouse Financial to the LidoDAO asking how it should manage its treasury. Source: Lido\n\nThe proposal comes as ETH staking withdrawals will soon be enabled through Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai and Capella upgrades, which are expected to take place sometime early this year, according to the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nWhile converting the ETH to Staked ETH may lead to more protocol rewards, the DAO is wary that too much staking may risk it not having enough Ether on hand \u201cin case of need.\u201d\n\nAssets currently held in LidoDAO\u2019s treasury. ETH currently accounts for about 9% of the DAO\u2019s over $350 million treasury holdings. Source: Lido\n\nRegarding operating expenses, Steakhouse Financial said it may be necessary to swap Ether for a stablecoin in order to \u201cpreemptively secure additional runway.\u201d\n\nSteakhouse Financial noted that with LidoDAO\u2019s current inflows at about 1000 stETH per month, the DAO is making approximately $1.3 million to 1.5 million per month with the price of ETH hovering between $1,100 and $1,700 over the past few months.\n\nThe monthly inflow of stETH on Lido has steadily increased since January 2021. Source: Dune Analytics\n\nSteakhouse Financial said those figures alone should be \u201csufficient to cover monthly operating expenses.\u201d\n\nHowever, they\u2019re still deliberating whether it is worth converting excess stETH into a stablecoin to better prepare for any change in market conditions that may lead to increased operating expenses.\n\nA business development representative from LidoDAO said that they\u2019re not particularly thrilled with the current state of the stablecoin market:\n\n\u201cConsidering all the FUD and rumors, both DAI due to USDC collateral and USDC itself pose potential risk if they become frozen. That being said I have issues with the liquidity of LUSD and USDT has yet its own issues.\u201d\n\nIt appears as though most LidoDAO members are in favor of partially selling and staking a portion of the 20,304 ETH locked in its Aragon smart contract.\n\nRelated: Lido overtakes MakerDAO and now has the highest TVL in DeFi\n\nThe proposals come as the total value locked (TVL) of stETH fell 6.66% from Feb. 6 to Feb. 13.\n\nLido Analytics: Feb 06 - 13, 2023\n\n\n\nTLDR:\n\n- Lido TVL is down -6.66%, following a -7.22% fall in the price of ETH.\n\n- Lido led in new stake on Ethereum, with a 27% share in weekly deposits.\n\n- New @AaveAave V3 wstETH: 34,726 (+34.87%).\n\n- Lido on Polygon reaches 2% market share. pic.twitter.com/iWA9YccM6e \u2014 Lido (@LidoFinance) February 13, 2023\n\nThe TVL of Lido is currently $8.13 billion, according to on-chain metrics platform DeFiLlama."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nVitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, has recently swapped around 210 ETH, worth approximately $325,000, for USDC stablecoin, according to on-chain data. But what motivated this move?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne potential reason is that Buterin simply decided to cash out some of his holdings while the price of ETH is high. As the cryptocurrency market continues to experience price swings, many investors choose to sell their assets during market rallies to lock in profits.\n\nAnother possibility is that Buterin needed funds for a particular purpose, such as investing in a new project or paying for expenses. While the exact reason for the transaction is unclear, it is worth noting that he has previously donated significant amounts of his wealth to charitable causes.\n\nMoreover, some speculate that Buterin is taking a more risk-averse approach to his holdings, which is why he has chosen to convert some of his ETH into a stablecoin like USDC. USDC is pegged to the U.S. dollar, which makes it less volatile than cryptocurrencies, and it can be used to make purchases or trades on various exchanges.\n\nIt is also possible that Buterin is simply rebalancing his portfolio or making room for new investments. As an experienced blockchain user and developer, he is likely to have a diverse portfolio of cryptocurrencies and other digital assets, and selling Ethereum for USDC might be a strategic move to make further purchases of different tokens, even those that are not EVM-based.\n\nIt is worth noting that Buterin's recent swap has not had a significant impact on the price of Ethereum, which continues to experience price volatility in response to various factors, such as network activity, market sentiment and regulatory developments."

        "content": "A closely followed crypto analyst believes that Bitcoin (BTC) could now be in a position to significantly outperform Ethereum (ETH).\n\nPseudonymous analyst Kaleo tells his 562,700 Twitter followers that the Ethereum/Bitcoin pair (ETH/BTC) is now trading below a diagonal trendline, suggesting that ETH is likely to trail BTC in terms of gains.\n\n\u201cETH/BTC finally broke beneath the high timeframe support line we\u2019ve been watching.\n\nRemember, this chart only shows relative strength to BTC, so expect to see BTC begin to outpace a bit more rapidly sometime over the next several weeks.\u201d\n\nTraditionally, a bearish ETH/BTC chart indicates that Bitcoin will likely rise in value faster than Ethereum and the general altcoin market.\n\nLooking at Bitcoin itself, Kaleo says BTC is likely headed toward the $30,000 price level after it managed to bounce from support at around $21,000.\n\n\u201cHigh timeframe support has held strong. SPX [S&P 500 index] is currently at 4,000 support, which I still see rallying to 4,300 over the coming weeks. $30,000 is a magnet.\u201d\n\nIn the short term, Kaleo says Bitcoin will likely gather more momentum if it takes out resistance at $22,400.\n\n\u201cCPI came in a bit higher than expected and the market is basically flat. SPX / NDX [Nasdaq-100 Index] look primed for a leg higher after a bit of initial volatility, and BTC is knocking on the door of reclaiming a major level it lost last Thursday. $30,000+ is still a magnet.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $22,214.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Crypto Investors Snap Up $260,000,000 in Ethereum Rival That\u2019s Soared 220% This Year: Santiment - The Daily Hodl",
        "content": "Crypto analytics platform Santiment says investors quickly picked up about $260,000,000 in Ethereum (ETH) rival Fantom (FTM).\n\nSantiment says that as Fantom skyrocketed in price this year, shark and whale addressed unloaded $259.7 million of FTM within weeks.\n\nHowever, most of the unloaded tokens were snapped up by small addressees holding anywhere between 0.01 to one FTM token.\n\n\u201cFantom\u2019s shark and whale addresses have dumped heavily during this 2023 rise. Addresses holding 10,000 to 100 million FTM dropped $259.7 million worth of coins in the past four weeks. These coins have largely been scooped up by micro addresses holding 0.01 to 1 FTM.\u201d\n\nFantom opened the year at $0.200 and hit a high of $0.656 on February 3rd, a 228% increase. Fantom is trading for $0.55 at time of writing.\n\nSantiment also looks at the meteoric rise of the artificial intelligence (AI) blockchain project Fetch.ai (FET), calling attention to a huge whale transaction of 135,000,000 FET on February 14th.\n\n\u201cFetch.ai now the #102 asset by market cap in crypto after skyrocketing +395% in 2023, has seen its largest transaction in 567 days. $61.2M worth of FET has been transferred to an existing whale address, which also holds 224.46 million in Ethereum (ETH).\u201d\n\nSanitment says that overall altcoins are showing a lot of strength again as the NASDAQ and tech stocks moved up on February 14th. They say the strongest performers are FTM along with Immutable X (IMX) and The Graph (GRT).\n\n\u201cAltcoins are bouncing back big as Nasdaq and tech stocks performed well on Valentine\u2019s Day. There is still an evident correlation between equities and cryptocurrencies that traders are hoping dissipates, as a correlation break historically foreshadows bull runs.\u201d\n\nLastly, the analytics firm says small shark investors are fleeing stablecoin Binance USD (BUSD) after the Wall Street Journal reported that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) intends to sue its minting company Paxos for allegedly violating investor protection laws. Paxos has already agreed to shut down issuance of the stablecoin but will continue to honor redemptions. BUSD sharks are instead investing in Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC).\n\n\u201cWith BUSD being in hot water, small shark addresses are declining rapidly for Binance\u2019s stablecoin that is being sued by the SEC. Instead, these sharks are increasing their positions in USDT and USDC instead.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe sudden and explosive rise of Bitcoin NFTs via the new Ordinals project has sparked plenty of creativity from Web3 builders. Chainspace is one of the most vibrant examples to date\u2014an experimental art project that connects Bitcoin and Ethereum through a lo-fi video rendering app that\u2019s tied to both chains.\n\nThe project spans 800 total on-chain apps, each a unique portal that pseudonymous co-creators Timshel and el-ranye describe as a \u201cdigital object that emits infinite art.\u201d Put simply, each web app\u2014which lives entirely in an Ordinals inscription on the Bitcoin blockchain\u2014is like a Snapchat filter that manipulates the image coming from your computer or device camera.\n\nEssentially, it takes your detailed selfie cam footage and renders it like old-school ASCII art, using letters and symbols to depict your real-time video view in a more abstract, stylized manner. Each Chainspace portal gives a different effect, and some are inspired by the look and vibe of notable Web3 projects like Loot and Terraforms.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\na @el__ranye x @TimshelXYZ experimental art project \u2514\u2af8 https://t.co/tpkbsRaFdf \ud835\ude8a \ud835\ude99\ud835\ude98\ud835\ude9b\ud835\ude9d\ud835\ude8a\ud835\ude95 \ud835\ude92\ud835\ude97\ud835\ude9d\ud835\ude98 \ud835\ude8c\ud835\ude91\ud835\ude8a\ud835\ude92\ud835\ude97\ud835\ude9c\ud835\ude99\ud835\ude8a\ud835\ude8c\ud835\ude8e inscribed onchain on BTC on a single satoshi will be minting via @ourzora mega thanks to @isiain who worked w/ me on a cross-chain BTC<>ETH renderer https://t.co/B7bvLw0fFD pic.twitter.com/DAjMKdRai0 \u2014 Timshel {\ud835\ude9d\ud835\ude91\ud835\ude98\ud835\ude9e \ud835\ude96\ud835\ude8a\ud835\udea2\ud835\ude8e\ud835\ude9c\ud835\ude9d} (@TimshelXYZ) February 9, 2023\n\nTimshel, who\u2019s a key figure in the emerging \u201cLootverse\u201d gaming community and involved in on-chain publishing efforts, told Decrypt that Chainspace provides a way for Web3 users to share a bit of their humanity with communities without fully doxxing themselves. Timshel showcased Chainspace-derived screenshots that users shared in the project\u2019s Discord.\n\n\u201cThis is beautiful because this \u2018GM\u2019 is much more essential and resonant and human than [a] random Pepe emoji,\u201d Timshel told Decrypt. \u201cThere's something really cool and special to see how people are using this, sharing their feelings, their selves, and their faces.\u201d\n\nThe NFT or inscription is not an \u201caccess pass\u201d to an experience hosted elsewhere. Because Ordinals can hold a lot more on-chain data than an Ethereum NFT, the complete web app is inscribed onto the Bitcoin blockchain as a digital artifact. Each Chainspace portal exists as its own unique Ordinals inscription that can be transferred between owners.\n\n\u201cThe Ordinals innovation, and the idea of inscribing up to now 4MB of content onto a single Satoshi on Bitcoin\u2014it just immediately clicked to me,\u201d Timshel told Decrypt. \u201cIt opened up a whole blossom of ideas in my head about things you can do that are higher fidelity than what's possible on ETH, but still create a token on ETH that's tradable and ownable.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAcross chains\n\nHis comment hints at the Ethereum component of the Chainspace equation, but there are layers to it. Thursday\u2019s NFT mint will actually take place on Ethereum, with each portal represented by an Ethereum NFT that can be minted through Zora and traded through major marketplaces.\n\nThe Ethereum NFT is connected to the Bitcoin-based Ordinal on-chain through a smart contract\u2014which holds the code that powers decentralized apps (dapps) and NFT projects\u2014developed by Zora software engineer Iain Nash. The Ethereum NFT artwork you see on a marketplace like OpenSea is actually a screenshot generated from the Ordinal inscription.\n\nBut they\u2019re also paired in the sense that the NFT buyers can choose to trade in the Ethereum version and take custody of the Bitcoin Ordinal instead. Right now, that requires a manual process that Timshel and el-ranye can handle, but they aim to make it an easier, automated process as more and more Ordinals infrastructure comes online.\n\nAs such, Timshel describes Chainspace as being \u201c200% on-chains\u201d\u2014yes, plural\u2014since there\u2019s a part of the experience on both Bitcoin and Ethereum, and they\u2019re intertwined.\n\nBut the swap of the Ethereum NFT for custody of the Bitcoin Ordinal is a one-way process; they won\u2019t let users swap back and forth or hold both versions at the same time. He also cautioned that the ability to swap is dependent in part on the status of Ordinals, a fast-evolving space that has proven contentious to some Bitcoin aficionados. It\u2019s all an experiment for now.\n\nChainspace portals are publicly accessible, again reinforcing the idea that NFT owners are not buying an exclusive access pass. Anyone can use one of the portals and capture a still image from the manipulated video feed, and then they can do whatever they want with those\u2014share them through social media, mint them on-chain, generate derivative art, etc.\n\nThey\u2019ll put 620 of the NFTs on sale on Thursday, with an allowlist of active Discord users\u2014people who have already shared their Chainspace screenshots and creations\u2014able to mint one of the Ethereum NFTs for 0.33 ETH (about $550). Another 100 NFTs will be airdropped to Web3 builders who helped or influenced the project, with 60 NFTs reserved for the team.\n\nAnother 20 Chainspace apps, called X-portals, will have no Ethereum NFT counterpart and will live exclusively on Bitcoin. Those will be reserved for future auctions, as well as for the community around Ethereum NFT art project, Terraforms.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u2018Smashed penny\u2019\n\nGiven that they\u2019re publicly accessible, why would someone want to buy and own a Chainspace portal that isn\u2019t exclusively available to them? It doesn\u2019t come with any future promised utility or benefits, for example. A handful of the portals are available to play with via the project\u2019s website, while others can be accessed via each Ordinal\u2019s own page.\n\nTimshel cited the growing buzz around Ordinals and early on-chain inscriptions, and bets that people excited about on-chain media and Web3 experiments will want to own a portal. He likened it to public art installations that are open to all but ultimately still owned by someone, and compared an inscribed Satoshi to a souvenir flattened penny from an amusement park.\n\nI'm having so much fun generating these Chainspace templates aka high-functionality digital objects that bridge you into a higher plane. Experimental/performance art by @TimshelXYZ and @richa891 - in Chainspace, you are the art!\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udfa8\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/9c7AOtje3c \u2014 ozorian89 (@richa891) February 11, 2023\n\n\u201cI think people are really excited about owning the actual Satoshi itself,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want the \u2018smashed penny\u2019 with art on it in their wallet.\u201d\n\nAlready, they\u2019re seeing people turn Chainspace still images into derivative projects, such as Ethereum NFTs of screenshots of hand gestures or AI-assisted generative interpretations. People are free to do what they want with the portals, even if they don\u2019t own them.\n\nBut ultimately, the goal is to explore new frontiers in experimental on-chain art tools while giving each user a totally unique experience. It loops back to the phrase that the co-creators have been using since the project was unveiled last week: \u201cYou are the art.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery portal is public and inscribed on Bitcoin for anybody to render, forever. But every viewing is a private one-of-one,\u201d Timshel explained. \u201cI don't think there ever will be another time where somebody's pixels and Chainspace look exactly like what's on my screen right now. It\u2019d be like finding a grain of sand in the universe.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "title": "Complete Guide On Ethereum \u201cMerge\u201d And Evolution Of Ethereum Network - Simplilearn",
        "content": "Ethereum is about to undergo a significat update, one dubbed as \"the single most significant event in crypto history.\" The update would result in a complete restructuring of the blockchain technology, the world's second-largest blockchain infrastructure.\n\nAfter an event known as \"the merge,\" the blockchain network, which presently uses the proof-of-work algorithm that drives bitcoin and other cryptos, will move to proof-of-stake consensus.\n\nTop crypto fund Bitwise Asset Management has hailed this upgrade as the year's most intriguing narrative in the digital asset market.\n\nSo, here is a tutorial for you on \"Ethereum Merge\" to understand how this new evolution of Ethereum will affect and grow the crypto world.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nWhat is the Ethereum \u201cMerge\u201d? By transitioning from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) method, the merging attempts to increase the efficiency of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nCrypto miners secure the Proof of Work (pioneered by Bitcoin), by coming up with solutions for complex, but practically useless mathematical problems-a process that often takes a lot of energy to execute.\n\nMeanwhile, individuals staking crypto to perform transactions do it using a Proof of Stake system.\n\nBoth the techniques are now being used on Ethereum. Combining both the layers is expected to bring about a single proof-of-stake chain.\n\nThe merge and transition of the 2 layers will however have no effect on other Ether cryptocurrency present on the network.\n\nWhy is Ethereum Merging? Ethereum is in the early stages of transitioning to the Beacon Chain, which uses the \"proof of stake\" consensus process. Previous Method: Proof-of-Work When Bitcoin and Ethereum originally launched, every blockchain transaction was validated via a technique known as \"proof of work.\"\n\nIn blocks, a systematic mechanism adds transactions to the Blockchain or digital ledger.\n\nThe proof-of-work system necessitates agreement among all computer networks and the generation of new blocks, which consumes a lot of computational power. Basics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program New Method: Proof-of-Stake Instead of depending on computers, proof-of-stake models conserve energy by requiring network participants to stake ETH as collateral to vouch for new blocks added to the chain.\n\nIts mechanisms in crypto enable ecosystems to circulate cryptocurrency in the same way that fiat money is circulated.\n\nIt takes less time and energy to vouch for new blockchain transactions than proof-of-work models because the coin was previously mined once.\n\nPros and Cons of \u201cThe Merge\u201d Pros Proponents of the PoS model hope that the merger will make Ethereum more scalable, safe, and long-lasting.\n\nPoS will lower the network's energy consumption by 99.95%. This may persuade more people to invest in Ethereum. Cons The transition would render Ethereum's miners obsolete and reduce emissions of the numerous applications that rely on the Ethereum infrastructure, including many NFT platforms.\n\nHowever, the benefits are not universally accepted. Critics have highlighted security problems and reservations regarding Ethereum's scalability.\n\nWhen is the Merge Happening? Although the Ethereum merge was first proposed in 2016, the transition has proven more difficult than anticipated.\n\nThis was expected to happen in June 2022, but insiders have warned of further delays this month.\n\nTim Beiko, a developer at the Ethereum Foundation, tweeted on April 12 that the merge \"won't be in June, but likely in a few months after.\"\n\nWhat Will the Ethereum Merge mean for Crypto Investments? According to several experts, the update would help Ethereum thrive as new blockchain projects have pulled into its market share in the last six months.\n\nThe Ethereum merge could speed up processing, improve security and stability, and reduce Ethereum's energy use by 98% or more.\n\nThis upgrade may result in price increases for related altcoins.\n\nThe upgrade will enable the network to scale, lower transaction costs, and encourage more people to use blockchain technology.\n\nIs There Anything Investors Need To Do With Their Ethereum? According to the Ethereum website, present ETH holders are not required to take any action due to the Merge.\n\nThey can get more involved in the upgrading by staking or assisting in testing the enhancements, but their holdings stay unchanged.\n\nWhat Does the Future Hold for Ethereum? The upgrade is expected to reduce the supply of fresh ETH, and demand in the Ethereum blockchain could rise due to the quantity of ETH available to stake.\n\nFor most Ethereum investors, the fall in supply is good.\n\nInvestors in Defi appear to be eager for the Merge to be completed. At least $31 billion in ETH has been deposited in the new Ethereum Consensus Model staking mechanism, ready to validate new transactions as soon as the green light is given.\n\nHigh-profile crypto experts are expecting a $10,000 ETH bull run in 2022. The signals all point to the Ethereum blockchain maintaining its position as the premier smart contract blockchain and maybe being the next leader in cryptocurrency \u2014 but Ethereum's developers will have a lot of work ahead of them.

        "title": "Why Ethereum Price Could Reach $1,800 Before The Rally Burns Out - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum price has followed the recovery trend of Bitcoin over the last two days, which has helped it wipe the losses from early February. Currently, the digital asset is up around 9% which saw it break above $1,600 once more. However, the cryptocurrency doesn\u2019t seem to be slowing down as there is still some runway for it.\n\nETH Deflation Paints Bullish Picture\n\nOne of the most bullish arguments for Ethereum right now is the fact that while most coins in the space are experiencing inflation, the coin\u2019s supply is deflating. This is a result of the Ethereum Merge that was completed last year, which works to reduce the supply of ETH in the market.\n\nOver the months that have followed the Merge, there has been a steady decrease in the Ethereum supply. Between the time of the Merge and now, the supply of Ethereum has shrunk by more than 23,900 ETH (around $40 million), a 0.047% decrease since the Merge.\n\nThis reduction in supply has pushed the ETH issuance rate into the negative. According to data from the ETH tracking website, Ultrasound Money, the ETH issuance rate now sits at -0.7%.\n\nThe burn rate has also accelerated this time, coming out at more than 4,000 ETH burned daily. This means that around 1.55 million ETH are burned per year going by the current burn rate. Additionally, the website projects that by 2025, the total ETH supply will fall below 118 million.\n\nETH supply expected to fall below 118 million in two years: Source: Ultrasound Money\n\nCan This Push Ethereum Price Above $1,800?\n\nWith the current momentum, coupled with the fact that the Ethereum supply is declining rather than increasing, it serves as a bullish basis for the cryptocurrency since lower supply and higher demand are a recipe for rising prices.\n\nETH, on one hand, is already trying to test the $1,700 resistance. This is a hard one given that bears have pitched their tents at this level, but a break above here can easily guarantee a run-up above $1,800 in short succession.\n\nThere is also the fact that over 14% of the total supply worth over $28 billion is still staked in the Beacon contract. This reduced circulating supply and the spike in the Coinbase Premium Index show more attention from investors, all of which work to cement the bullish trend for the digital asset.\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH is trending at a price of $1,685. The digital asset\u2019s price is up 8.79% in the last 24 hours and 3.17% in the last seven days.\n\nETH price remains steady above $1,600 | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nFollow Best Owie on Twitter for market insights, updates, and the occasional funny tweet\u2026 Featured image from Ethereum Price, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

In the event Bitcoin does break $25,000, there the price momentum may see it push the $26,200 level and perhaps even $27,000.\n\nAlthough the bears may have defended the $25,000 zone, the bulls have support levels to count on, one of which is located near the $24,250 mark. The main breakdown support is situated in the $23,250 zone. Assuming the price closes below the $23,250 level, it could prompt another decline in the coming days. The $22,500 and $21,400 support levels could be revisited in this scenario."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nLido Finance and Optimism are rolling out a new incentive program to get liquid stakers migrated over to the layer-2 network.\n\nAs part of the LidoOnLayer2 initiative, which seeks to improve liquidity for Lido\u2019s staked Ethereum (stETH) product across all layer-2 solutions, the project has been granted 1 million OP tokens from Optimism.\n\nThese tokens will provide an added OP reward for users who stake their Ethereum with Lido, move that staked Ethereum to Optimism, and provide liquidity for select token pairs. The program kicks off today and ends in six months.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOP is the governance token for Optimism, a layer-2 scaling solution that uses rollups to help scale the Ethereum network by moving activity off of the mainnet, batching it, and then executing this compressed data on the mainnet.\n\nLido Finance is the market\u2019s largest liquid staking platform, letting users deposit a variety of proof-of-stake (PoS) tokens and earn rewards for doing so. Instead of needing 32 ETH, a whopping $49,000 today, to begin staking on Ethereum, users can instead deposit any amount into Lido and begin earning. The service is also available for Polygon, Solana, Polkadot, and Kusama.\n\nHow does the Optimism, Lido program work?\n\nIn exchange for their ETH deposits, Lido users get the stETH token in return, which can then be used elsewhere in DeFi to earn yield or to borrow against.\n\nVia this new arrangement with Optimism, users who choose to move their stETH over to the layer-2 network will now earn additional rewards in the form of Optimism\u2019s native OP token.\n\nImportantly, users won\u2019t be migrating stETH to Optimism. Instead, as per Lido\u2019s expansion to a variety of different layer-2 networks, wrapped stETH (wstETH) will be the available asset. This specific asset is more compatible and easier to integrate with crypto protocols.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe value of wstETH on Optimism is that it further democratizes access to liquid staking for those who do not want to pay or cannot afford to pay mainnet fees,\u201d said Lido\u2019s head of business development and partnerships Jacob Blish. \u201cBy incentivizing great wstETH liquidity on Optimism, furthering adoption and contributing to the security of the ecosystem.\u201d\n\nThus, users interested in scooping up this extra OP yield can do so if they turn to what Lido has called \u201cpriority pairs,\u201d namely wstETH-ETH as well as a host of other stablecoin pools.\n\nLido has named Aave, for example, as one project that would benefit from the program. This means that users that deposit their wstETH on the popular DeFi lender via Optimism can earn an additional yield in OP tokens."

        "content": "Bitcoin added NFT support, and now it has a Bored Ape on the network after Bored Ape #1626 was burned on Ethereum and transferred it to Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin recently added NFT support, and now it has a Bored Ape on the network too. The owner of Bored Ape #1626 \"burned\" his NFT on Ethereum and transferred it to the Bitcoin network using a new protocol called Teleburn, which allows NFTs to be burned on one blockchain and inserted into Bitcoin as Ordinals\u2013Bitcoin's new version of an NFT.\n\nThe Bored Ape was originally purchased for 108 ETH (~$430k at the time of purchase) and was worth about $170k when it was burned. Now its value is hard to place, since it's the first Bored Ape NFT on Bitcoin, there's no major exchange for Bitcoin NFTs, and it's not clear if Bitcoin investors even care about NFTs.\n\nThe Teleburn function allows users to send an NFT to an address on a different blockchain by burning it on the original blockchain and minting it on the new blockchain with the same metadata and owner information. But the NFT still technically exists on the old blockchain too, so I don't really see the point.\n\nYou can't \"burn\" an on-chain asset\u2013that's the whole point of the blockchain. Instead, the process of burning is simply sending the NFT to a \"burn\" address that no one controls. You can still see Bored Ape #1626 on Ethereum, but its old owner can't do anything with it anymore.\n\nAs you may remember, Bored Ape holders also hold the intellectual property rights to their Ape's appearance. Seth Green starred in a TV show using his Ape, and other investors have used their Apes to sell merchandise and even fast food. According to Bored Ape parent company Yuga Labs, once you move your ape to a burn address, you lose the rights to the Ape.\n\nSo now Bored Ape #1626 is just... gone? Sure it's on Bitcoin, which has massive liquidity, but there isn't much liquidity for NFTs on Bitcoin yet. Also, Bitcoin is a terrible blockchain for NFTs anyway. Bitcoin is slow, and it's not made to store smart contract data on-chain. Add in that Bitcoin holders are basically gold hoarders with computer skills and there's some serious resistance to mainstream Bitcoin NFT adoption."

During that time, the Polygon zkEVM system has hit several milestones noted by the team.\n\nThese include the deployment of more than 5,000 smart contracts, the generation of over 75,000 zk-proofs, more than 84,000 wallets and two public third-party audits.\n\nA graphic detailing the development so far leading up to the launch. Source: Polygon\n\nThe team noted that security is the highest priority and that\u2019s the reason \u201cwhy Polygon zkEVM has been run through a gauntlet of tests and audits.\u201d\n\nThe technology uses zero-knowledge proofs \u2014 cryptographic confirmations that, in the context of scaling, enable platforms to validate mass amounts of transaction data before bundling and confirming them on Ethereum.\n\nPolygon is not the only team working on a zkEVM solution. Scaling provider zkSync is developing similar EVM technology with its zkPorter \u2014 which puts essential transaction data off-chain.\n\nScroll, another scaling solutions provider, is also building a zkEVM solution in collaboration with the Privacy and Scaling Explorations group, part of the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation is also funding a project called Applied ZKP, which aims to develop an EVM-compatible zk-rollup.\n\nRelated: Polygon tests zero-knowledge rollups, mainnet integration inbound\n\nThe team explained the significance of the technology, stating that true EVM-equivalence means Ethereum can be scaled \u201cwithout resorting to half-measures.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe best way to scale Ethereum is to preserve the existing Ethereum ecosystem: code, tooling, and infrastructure needs to just work. And that\u2019s what Polygon zkEVM is aiming to achieve.\u201d\n\nThe scaling tech also enables significant transaction cost savings. Proof costs for a large batch of hundreds of transactions are down to about $0.06 and less than $0.001 for a simple transfer, the team added.\n\nMatter Labs, the firm behind Polygon, raised $50 million in a Series B round led by Andreessen Horowitz to build EVM-compatible zk-Rollups in November 2021.\n\nPolygon\u2019s native token, MATIC, has reacted positively to the announcement with a 5.3% gain over the past 12 hours or so. As a result, the token was trading for $1.24 at the time of writing, according to Cointelegraph data."

        "content": "Eyebrows Raised as BAYC Owner Ditches Ethereum for Bitcoin\n\nEthereum might be the king when it comes to NFTs, but its reign seems under threat from an unlikely source. A few months ago, NFTs on the Bitcoin network were barely even a thing. However, since the launch of Ordinals, a project that allows individuals to inscribe/mint NFTs directly on Satoshis, things have become very interesting.\n\nLack of smart contracts and growing criticism from Bitcoin maximalists haven\u2019t stopped the Ordinals project from picking up. Three weeks after launch, the number of inscriptions is fast approaching 100,000. One of these is a valuable Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) #1626, which belongs to Jason Williams. It was bought for 108 ETH in November 2021, or $432,000 at the time.\n\nOver the weekend, Williams decided to burn his BAYC NFT and inscribe (mint) it on Bitcoin using TeleBurn. It\u2019s a newly developed feature that allows users to assign an existing asset from another network to Bitcoin while taking it out of circulation, thus transferring it between chains. Williams compares the act to \u201cthrowing a Lamborghini into a trash compactor,\u201d which is \u201ckind of fun.\u201d\n\nBAYC NFT Burn Has Raised Some Eyebrows\n\nHowever, the burn has attracted some criticism within the BAYC community, with some wondering if the NFT has indeed moved from Ethereum to Bitcoin. According to Greg Solano, Yuga Labs cofounder, by choosing to burn the NFT, Williams lost its license, consequently creating an illegitimate ape.\n\nIt\u2019s not \u201cgone from ETH forever.\u201d It\u2019s basically the same as any other transfer: If you transfer your ape to an address you no longer control (even if it\u2019s the \u2018burn\u2019 address), you have effectively given up your license.\n\nAnd no, before someone asks, that doesn\u2019t mean that anyone\u2026 https://t.co/E52b7ZjWbu \u2014 Garga.eth (Greg Solano) (@CryptoGarga) February 13, 2023\n\nIf creating an illegitimate ape devalues the NFT, then others beg to differ. Given that NFTs such as BAYC\u2019s derive value from being unique and rare, this being the first to be minted on Bitcoin places it in a class by itself.\n\nAlex Miller, the CEO of the Web3 development platform, believes this makes the NFT more valuable.\n\n\u201cHe basically turned it into something that is now an ultra-rare [Ape]. The market is going to value it as its own unique piece of art.\u201d\n\nWant more?

        "title": "Picture Of A Rock Just Sold For $235,000 On Ethereum - NewsBTC",
        "content": "A picture of a rock, existing as an NFT on Ethereum, has been sold for 139 ETH, Etherscan data on February 16 shows.\n\nEtherRock NFT Sold For $235,000\n\nAt the time of buying, the 139 ETH used to purchase the NFT translated to around $235,000. For this transaction, the buyer paid 0.003672481899086462 ETH, or approximately $6, at the time.\n\nDescribed as \u201cEtherRock,\u201d the NFT is among the earliest in Ethereum and across the NFT ecosystem. Only 100 of these NFTs were minted, and they have been changing hands since then.\n\nMost importantly, the creator says they were created around the same time the CryptoPunks were minted on Ethereum. There are 10,000 CryptoPunks in circulation. Over the years, CryptoPunks have remained some of the most expensive and coveted NFTs in Ethereum and across the ecosystem.\n\nThe issuer of EtherRock claims that with every new virgin rock being minted, the price of each rock will only become more expensive. As things stand, no \u201cvirgin\u201d rocks will be minted since the last 100 NFTs were all issued. Interested collectors can instead choose to buy \u201cnon-virgin\u201d rocks. All EtherRock NFTs are trustlessly managed via an audited smart contract and are deployed exclusively on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nNFT Without Any Utility\n\nIt is not immediately clear who the buyer of the NFT is. What\u2019s evident is that EtherRock NFTs don\u2019t have a specific use case. They are created to exist as \u201cpets on the blockchain.\u201d What holders can do, however, is to trade the token. The original owner will profit if a buyer is willing to acquire the NFT at a higher price.\n\nPresently, there are several EtherRock NFTs that can be purchased. Even so, it cannot be immediately determined which NFTs available were acquired from the less than 30 available for purchasing, per EtherRock list.\n\nThere are only two owners of EtherRock on OpenSea. These NFTs have a 0.4 ETH in trading volumes and a floor price of 0.1 ETH.\n\nMeanwhile, on the official EtherRock site, the owner of the first EtherRock is selling the NFT for 10,000 ETH. Many of these NFTs are also not available for sale. Even the cheapest EtherRock available is listed for 235 ETH.\n\nThe purchase of the EtherRock comes at a time when the broader DeFi, crypto, and NFT markets are recovering after last year\u2019s winter saw trading volumes drop by over 90%.\n\nFeature image from nftplazas.com, Chart from TradingView.\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Japan-based banking giant Nomura, announced today that its digital assets subsidiary, Laser Digital, has made a strategic investment in Infinity, a non-custodial interest rate protocol built on Ethereum.\n\nInfinity\u2019s wholesale exchange, the first of several planned infrastructures, provides inter-exchange clearing, fixed and floating rate markets, as well as enterprise-grade risk management utilizing hybrid on-chain/off-chain infrastructures that deliver transaction efficiency, security, and scalability.\n\nInfinity is a pioneering interest rate protocol that forms the basis for benchmark rates, institutional-grade lending, borrowing, and risk management in DeFi. The money market exchange protocol was founded by ex-Morgan Stanley Head of Structuring, Kevin Lepsoe.\n\n\u201cInfinity is building critical infrastructure for DeFi, and its protocol enabling price discovery and management of risk within DeFi is transformative for institutions, Infinity\u2019s groundwork paves the way for institutional flows on-chain, new levels of rates, and risk innovation, and we are keen to support their advances in the hybrid finance space.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Olivier Dang, Head of Ventures at Laser Digital\n\nLaser Digital was recently unveiled by Nomura to spearhead its digital asset ambitions and is chaired by Steve Ashley, who previously led Nomura\u2019s wholesale division, with Dr. Jez Mohideen as its CEO. Headquartered in Switzerland, Laser Digital\u2019s investments are focused on DeFi, centralized finance (CeFi), web3, and blockchain infrastructure.\n\nThe investment comes as the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) published guidelines for crypto exposures in December 2022, with bank-prescribed risk weightings for tokenized assets to be treated on par 1:1 with their analog counterparts. The guidelines for banks come into effect on 1 January 2025.\n\nWith USD $300 trillion of credit securities outstanding and multiples of that in the loan, derivative, and equity markets, the new guidelines portend a major wave of tokenization across financial and real assets.\n\nPresently in Beta, the Inifinity mainnet is scheduled to launch by the end of Q2 2023."

        "content": "Ripple and Ethereum used to be huge competitors in the market, in an on-and-off battle for the second spot in rankings.\n\nThat was until XRP got slapped with a lawsuit from the SEC.\n\nNow, with the lawsuit soon coming to an end, we might see this saga continue if the judge rules in Ripple\u2019s favor.\n\nHowever, this is still highly speculative, and experts suggest that presale projects like Meta Masters Guild (MEMAG), Fight Out (FGHT), RobotEra (TARO), and C+Charge (CCHG) are prone to larger gains in a shorter amount of time.\n\n>>>Get the Best Presale Token Now<<<\n\nRipple vs. Ethereum \u2013 Which is the Best Crypto to Buy in 2023?\n\nEven though both XRP and ETH are one of the largest players in the crypto market, they share very few similarities besides some blockchain network technology.\n\nRipple and Ethereum serve very different purposes, with Ripple primarily targeting banks and major companies that require fast money transfer services, whereas Ethereum serves as both a platform for decentralized applications and as a huge smart contract base.\n\nEthereum is the 2nd largest cryptocurrency and currently boasts well over a $180 billion market cap, while XRP is currently working its way toward $20 billion mark.\n\nThose who are considering investing in ETH should keep a close eye on the progress of Ethereum 2.0 and its shift to a proof-of-stake consensus as it will majorly influence the price of the coin.\n\nThe attention of those who are looking to invest in XRP should be directed at the ongoing SEC lawsuit which is soon coming to an end. If the judge rules in Ripple\u2019s favor, they will probably see a massive return on their investment.\n\nAnd while both of these might be good long-term investment options, they are not eligible for any bigger returns in 2023.\n\nIf that\u2019s something that you are looking for, tokens that we will go over next have a much bigger potential of making your wallet fatter.\n\n>>>Get the Best Presale Token Now<<<\n\nMeta Masters Guild (MEMAG)\n\nMeta Masters Guild Is a new gaming crypto project that focuses on building a mobile-only gaming platform to provide users with a fun and immersive P2E experience.\n\nBy doing that, MEMAG is addressing one of the shortcomings of P2E \u2013 boring AAA games.\n\nA couple of games are already in their final stages \u2013 Meta Kart Racer, Meta Masters World, and NFT Raid. With more titles on the horizon.\n\nAnother selling feature of MEMAG is its clever implementation of NFTs into the platform. Users will be able to trade and mint them all within one ecosystem.\n\nMEMAG just entered its final presale phase which is due to end very soon. And experts are sure that the price will skyrocket due to the numerous features MEMAG is offering.\n\n>>>Buy MEMAG Now<<<\n\nFight Out (FGHT)\n\nThere is no better time to invest in M2E crypto platforms than at the start of the New year.\n\nWith everybody still motivated to be more active due to New year\u2019s resolutions, of course.\n\nOne of the most promising M2E platforms is Fight Out (FGHT).\n\nIt is a new Move-to-Earn cryptocurrency platform that combines personalized workout regimes, diet, and soulbound NFT avatars that change as you progress in your journey to becoming fitter.\n\nWhat is making the investors believe that FGHT will be bullish in 2023 is the fact that they are planning to deploy real-life equipment in up to 20 gyms in 4Q of this year.\n\nWhen you combine all of these unique features that Fight Out offers you get a prosperous M2E platform with the potential to skyrocket its value by 30x \u2013 60x.\n\n>>>Buy FGHT Now<<<\n\nC+Charge (CCHG)\n\nThere has been an empty spot in the green crypto space that awaited someone with the right idea to reap the benefits it offers \u2013 EV charging.\n\nC+Charge steps in to fill this void with the creative use of blockchain and a team of seasoned veterans behind the wheel.\n\nNamely, CCHG will reward EV drivers with carbon credits for charging their pets on wheels at designated charging stations.\n\nCCHG has stirred quite a bit of controversy with big partnerships signed with Perfect Solutions Turkey \u2013 a big player in EV charging industry.\n\nA combination of the things mentioned is the sole reason behind investors\u2019 belief that C+Charge could explode at least 50x once it hits the market.\n\n>>>Buy CCHG Now<<<\n\nRobotEra (TARO)\n\nRobotEra is a new Metaverse project set in an apocalyptic Earth with robot NFTs as new leaders tasked with restoring order.\n\nIn order to play TARO, players will have to obtain their personalized robot NFTs which they can use to mine and trade land, create new cities, or complete missions.\n\nAll of these actions will be rewarded with the in-game currency TARO, which can be used in exchange for any fiat currency.\n\nRobotEra is still in its 1st presale stage with a price of 0.020 USDT per TARO, but the price will rise very soon to $0.025.\n\n>>>Buy TARO Now<<<\n\nDogecoin (DOGE)\n\nInternet favorite meme coin, DOGE has seen a small price drop over the last two weeks, probably due to the Bitcoins price drop since the start of February.\n\nDespite this drop, experts seem to believe that this is just temporary and that DOGE will enter a long bullish period once the announced new features are released.\n\nThe Conclusion\n\nEthereum and Ripple are one of the biggest players in the crypto market and their prices will surely rise over 2023, which makes for a reasonable argument to have them in your portfolio.\n\nHowever, big projects like XRP and ETH brought the biggest profits to the early investors, that\u2019s why it would be smart to stock up on some smaller projects that have the potential to reach the heights of Ethereum and Ripple.\n\nSeasoned crypto experts suggest that some of the most promising projects like that are MEMAG, FGHT, TARO, and CCHG. Investors who invest in these projects can easily expect returns of up to 30x as soon as they hit the major exchanges.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin's IQ and Other Facts About Ethereum's Creator - Bankless Times",
        "content": "Vitalik Buterin is one of the most recognizable names in the world of crypto. One of the youngest crypto founders, the creator of Ethereum is often described as a \u201ccrypto prodigy\u201d and \u201cyoung genius.\u201d In this article, you\u2019ll find out what Vitalik Buterin\u2019s IQ is. You\u2019ll also learn more about his childhood, upbringing, academic life, path to creating Ethereum, and current net worth.\n\nHow Old Is Vitalik Buterin?\n\nButerin was born Vitaliy Dmitriyevich Buterin on January 31, 1994, which would make him 28 years old as of late 2022. He is the only child of Dmitry \u201cDima\u201d Buterin, a computer scientist and entrepreneur, and Natalia Ameline, a blockchain literacy activist.\n\nDima and Natalia married very young and had Vitalik when they were both just 21. Their marriage didn\u2019t last long, but they were determined to create a safe and loving environment for Vitalik. Even as they fled their home country, both parents moved to the same city, intent on playing an active role in their son\u2019s upbringing.\n\nWhere Is Vitalik Buterin From?\n\nVitalik was born in Kolomna, a small city near the Russian capital of Moscow, which is where he spent the first six years of his life. His parents then decided to move to Canada, disillusioned with Russia\u2019s political situation and eager to find better employment opportunities.\n\nNatalia was the first to move to Canada \u2014 she chose Edmonton, the capital of the Alberta province. A year later, Dmitry and Vitalik arrived in Toronto and were soon joined by Natalia, who wanted to be near her son. Vitalik would remain in Toronto for the rest of his childhood.\n\nWhat Is Vitalik Buterin\u2019s IQ?\n\nWhile this hasn\u2019t been officially confirmed, numerous sources cite Buterin\u2019s IQ as 257. Any score above 130 on standardized tests constitutes a high IQ, so at nearly twice that number, Buterin\u2019s score is deemed unusually high. What\u2019s more, according to the high-IQ organization Mensa, people who score above 132 are among the top 2% of test takers. This means that Vitalik Buterin\u2019s IQ level ranks him as one of the most intelligent people in the world.\n\nTo those who know Buterin\u2019s life story, the fact that he has an unusually high IQ is by no means a surprise. In third grade, he was placed in a program for gifted students. He was interested in mathematics and programming, developed a knack for economics, and could add large numbers in his head twice as fast as his peers. His hunger for knowledge and reputation for being a math genius followed him into his high school years.\n\nDoes Vitalik Buterin Have a PhD?\n\nLike many of the world\u2019s leading entrepreneurs, Buterin didn\u2019t even graduate from the university. And while this means he didn\u2019t obtain a PhD the traditional way, in 2018, he was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Basel in Switzerland.\n\nAs for his academic journey, Buterin graduated from the Abelard School, one of Toronto\u2019s leading private high schools. After that, he enrolled in the University of Waterloo, where he took some advanced courses. However, by that time, he was already obsessed with blockchain technology and the idea of decentralized services. Soon enough, traveling, writing, and crypto-related research consumed all his time, prompting him to drop out of the university.\n\nWho Created Ethereum with Buterin?\n\nWhile researching various crypto projects around the world, Buterin noticed they weren\u2019t broad enough. His idea was to implement a programming language that would enable computers to solve a wide range of problems with the help of appropriate algorithms. As other existing crypto projects weren\u2019t interested in implementing his idea, there was only one possible solution \u2014 the creation of a brand-new blockchain platform by Vitalik Buterin.\n\nDubbed Ethereum, the blockchain platform built around the cryptocurrency of the same name was first introduced in 2014. Buterin wasn\u2019t alone in this \u2014 Charles Hoskinson, Mihai Alise, Joe Lubin, Gavin Wood, and Anthony Di Iorio were all among the founders of Ethereum. Following a successful crowdfunding campaign, Ethereum was registered in Switzerland and officially launched. Nowadays, Ethereum is the second most popular cryptocurrency behind Bitcoin.\n\nHow Much Is Vitalik Buterin Worth?\n\nUnlike most entrepreneurs, Buterin keeps all his assets in cryptocurrencies. According to the latest estimates, he has close to 290,000 Ethereum (ETH) divided across two wallets. With ETH valued at around $1,610, the creator of Ethereum\u2019s net worth is estimated at $466 million.\n\nThe value of cryptocurrency constantly fluctuates, so Buterin\u2019s net worth is also subject to change. During the crypto boom of 2021, his assets were worth $1.5 billion at one point, earning him the title of the youngest crypto billionaire. And while he no longer ranks as a billionaire, he could become one in the future if the value of Ethereum goes up again.\n\nVitalik Buterin IQ: The Takeaway\n\nIf online rumors are anything to go by, the founder of Ethereum has an unusually high IQ of 257. Considering that he was merely 19 when he launched his immensely successful cryptocurrency, the fact that Vitalik Buterin\u2019s IQ makes him a genius isn\u2019t hard to believe. His constant pursuit of innovation has brought him countless recognitions around the globe. He is also among the rare entrepreneurs who keep all their assets in crypto, proving that he truly believes in his mission.\n\nHere Are More Ethereum Guides"

        "title": "Polygon ecosystem development and upcoming zkEVM launch add to MATIC's bullish momentum - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Polygon Labs, the development and growth team for Polygon, announced that the beta version of its zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) would launch on March 27, 2023. It\u2019s possible that Polygon will enjoy a first-mover advantage in this space by launching a public mainnet before zkSync and Scroll.\n\nZk-based roll-up technology is accepted as the gold standard for scaling. The existing optimistic-based rollups like Arbitrum and Optimism have EVM capability but are less secure because they are \u201cfraud-proof.\u201d Malicious transactions on an Optimistic Rollup can stay valid for up to seven days or more before being reversed. Thus, giving an advantage to zk-technology.\n\nMoreover, the Ethereum community\u2019s focus on Liquid Staking Derivatives may shift toward layer-2 networks after the anticipated Shanghai upgrade in March. This is because the update following Shanghai, Ethereum Improvement Proposal 4844, will reduce the cost of L2 rollups by 10\u2013100-fold. A working zk-based rollup solution will likely attract new projects to its ecosystem.\n\nPolygon (MATIC) has built a strong bullish narrative in the market with the upcoming zkEVM launch. The team\u2019s efforts in the Web3 space are promising and show signs of increasing activity. The growth in its decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem has stalled, which could likely stay this way for more extended periods.\n\nTechnically, the market structure for Polygon looks bullish. However, the recent 78% increase in MATIC\u2019s price since the start of 2023 could see a correction as speculative buying cools down. Such a situation could possibly provide an ideal entry in MATIC for a swing trade.\n\nPolygon\u2019s DeFi sector has stalled, but Web3 activity is on the rise\n\nSince the start of 2023, Polygon has witnessed a spike in its nonfungible token (NFT) activity, especially for low-cost gaming assets. According to data from Dune Analytics, the number of NFT sales on Polygon surpassed Ethereum for two consecutive months in December 2022 and January 2023. While Ethereum still leads in total volumes, Nansen\u2019s NFT activity data shows that the minting and sale volume on Polygon has been picking up since the start of 2023.\n\nThe volume of NFT sales and mints on Polygon. Source: Nansen\n\nMeta also chose Polygon as the base layer for minting digital collectibles on its social media app Instagram. This feature is currently in the limited testing phase but should see traction soon among the 1.28 billion Instagram users.\n\nIn November 2022, Matter Labs appointed the former gaming head of YouTube, Ryan Watt, to lead its gaming venture, Polygon Studios. Watt told Cointelegraph that Polygon\u2019s Web3 strategy takes a holistic approach by incorporating \u201cWeb2 companies, including Starbucks, Adobe, Clinique and Stripe, to integrate Web3 functionality.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the blockchain houses the development of over 60 metaverse projects, including the leaders in The Sandbox, Decentraland and Somnium Space. Lastly, Polygon\u2019s $450-million raise in February 2022 will likely provide the necessary tailwinds to continue development on the Web3 front.\n\nOn the other hand, the Ethereum sidechain\u2019s growth in its DeFi sector has stalled. It could remain stressed due to the ongoing macroeconomic pressure and a regulatory crackdown on stablecoins.\n\nThe total liquidity across DeFi applications on Polygon has stayed below November 2022 levels, suggesting that users are still reluctant to interact with these protocols. Besides security risks, the decreasing yield across the DeFi space is also a prominent reason for the decline in activity.\n\nTotal liquidity across DeFi applications on Polygon. Source: DefiLlama\n\nIn comparison, Arbitrum\u2019s DeFi ecosystem has fared relatively better than most thanks to the anticipation around its token airdrop and active development.\n\nStill, Polygon ranks fifth in total liquidity across DeFi platforms above Avalanche, Solana, Optimism and Fantom, which is encouraging. Favorable liquidity conditions are a crucial necessity for a prospering DeFi ecosystem, and Polygon can benefit from it when focus on DeFi picks up. Moreover, the launch of zkEVM may also attract DeFi development.\n\nInvestors are bullish on MATIC\n\nFutures market data shows traders are bullish on MATIC, with an increase in open interest volume toward 2022 highs and a long-to-short ratio of 1.58. While a bullish outlook is encouraging, the prices may pull back to wipe out overleveraged positions.\n\nOpen interest volume for MATIC futures contracts. Source: CoinGlass\n\nThe on-chain balance on exchanges suggests that not many investors moved their coins onto exchanges as the price surged from $0.75 to $1.25. It suggests confidence among buyers, who are unlikely to sell unless the price falls below $0.75 support.\n\nPolygon balance on exchanges. Source: glassnode\n\nRelated: Solana (SOL) price rally could fizzle out due to weak fundamentals\n\nHowever, the price could pull back toward the $1 support level as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) metric begins to tap resistance around the 65 level. The bullish momentum likely requires consolidation around the 50 RSI level before more upside.\n\nMATIC/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe organic development of Polgyon\u2019s NFT trading activity and bullish narrative building around zkEVM will likely continue to push MATIC\u2019s price higher in 2023. Needless to say, a lot will depend on the price action of market leaders in Bitcoin (BTC) and whether Ether (ETH) maintains its uptrend.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Who Owns the Most Ethereum in 2023? - Bankless Times",
        "content": "Have you ever wondered who owns the most Ethereum? As one of the most popular altcoins on the market today, Ethereum has attracted countless investors. However, only a handful of these buyers have spent enough to be considered Ethereum whales.\n\nWhile there are a number of people who have earned a significant amount from their Ethereum investment, some have achieved greater returns than others. Read on to learn more about the biggest Ethereum users.\n\nWho Owns the Most Ethereum?\n\nWith a balance of around 12,940,565 Ether, the Eth2 Deposit contract currently stands as the largest Ethereum wallet. This wallet accounts for a little over 10% of the Ethereum in circulation today and was created as a staking contract for the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade. Notably, because this is a smart contract, no single address is able to access the funds.\n\n(Etherscan)\n\nExploring the Largest Ethereum Holders in 2023\n\nAs demand for Ethereum continues to grow in the cryptocurrency landscape, the number of people investing in it is increasing. Notably, many of the top Ethereum investors you\u2019ll see online today aren\u2019t single individuals but groups or companies like Binance.\n\nThere were 71 million Ethereum addresses in 2021.\n\nIn December 2021, Glassnode Alerts revealed on Twitter that the amount of Ethereum addresses with a confirmed balance hit a new high. There were more than 71.3 million active addresses and Ethereum investors in the market at this time. According to the tracking site, the number of Ethereum holders has been steadily increasing over the years.\n\n(Glassnode)\n\nThere are around 3.9 million active crypto wallets.\n\nThe website also found the total number of active Ethereum wallets hit an all-time high in 2022. While there\u2019s little information about the average wallet size, the report shows around 3.9 million active wallets holding at least 0.1 ETH. This accounts to around $312 in fiat currency. The amount of Ethereum investors has increased by 10% since 2021.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Ethereum\u2019s popularity has jumped by around 50% since 2020. The price of Ethereum has also jumped by around 1000% in this time.\n\n(Glassnode)\n\nVitalik Buterin only has around 51.7 ETH in his wallet.\n\nMost people consider the creator of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, to be one of the biggest Ethereum holders. However, Vitalik released the address of his ETH wallet in 2018, which now holds around 51.7 ETH, equalling over $56,730 in value.\n\nNotably, while Buterin\u2019s wallet might seem small, it\u2019s worth noting he has also moved the majority of his wallet's contents to new addresses. There\u2019s around 142 ETH in Vitalin\u2019s VB 3 wallet and hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of Ethereum located in other wallets.\n\n(Etherscan)\n\n8 out of the 10 biggest investors in Ethereum aren\u2019t individuals.\n\nLooking at the top accounts by ETH balance, we can see that 8 out of 10 of the biggest owners on the Ethereum rich list aren\u2019t individual people. The biggest Ethereum holder by far is the Eth2 Deposit contact, followed by Wrapped Ether, with 4,798,197 Ether.\n\nOther big investors in Ethereum currently include Binance, with the Binance 7 wallet holding 1.9 million Ether and the Binance 8 wallet holding over 678,000. Bitfinex, Kraken, and the Gemini contract also make up some of the top spots.\n\n(Etherscan)\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum Investors\n\nCurrently, there\u2019s limited information available to determine the average Ethereum holdings of the everyday person. While estimates suggest the number of investors has increased, there\u2019s nothing to track who exactly owns what amount of ETH.\n\nWhat we do know is that Ethereum investments are continuing to attract attention at a time when more people are exploring cryptocurrencies and altcoins.\n\nSources:\n\nHere Are More Ethereum Guides"

        "title": "How to buy and sell NFTs on Polygon - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "While cryptocurrencies have been quite the rage over the past couple of years, nonfungible tokens (NFTs) have risen as an alternate asset class within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This ecosystem is revolutionizing the world of art and gaming, among a host of other industries.\n\nServing as a digital certificate that proves a collectible\u2019s authenticity, NFTs also provide investors with proof of ownership and utmost security, aspects that have been instrumental in their proliferation as the future of representing real-world objects in the virtual world.\n\nAs a result, NFTs are gaining increasing popularity among crypto investors looking to invest in metaverse platforms, with many purchasing these unique digital assets on blockchain protocols like Polygon using cryptocurrencies. A layer-2 Ethereum protocol, Polygon has emerged as the preferred platform for many NFT marketplaces that offer investors the opportunity to create, buy and sell NFTs.\n\nUnderstanding the Polygon blockchain\n\nDesigned to address Ethereum\u2019s scalability concerns, the Polygon network acts as a parallel blockchain or sidechain that runs alongside the Ethereum blockchain and uses a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism to validate on-chain transactions.\n\nApart from providing the security, interoperability and smart contract features of the Ethereum blockchain, Polygon boasts significantly lower transaction fees, or gas, and offers developers a much higher degree of flexibility and scalability than that provided by Ethereum.\n\nIn fact, Polygon has come to be known as a multichain network of Ethereum-compatible blockchains. This is largely due to its ability to deploy other blockchain networks and enable communication among them, making it most suitable for developing decentralized applications (DApps).\n\nWith its Finity Design System and Polygon Bridge, developers can not only build cross-platform DApps but also connect them to other compatible blockchain networks to transfer assets such as ERC-20 tokens and NFTs to the Polygon sidechain. Consequently, developers prefer Polygon to create NFT projects that have a high frequency of low-value transactions. They also use it to set up NFT marketplaces that enable users to list NFTs for a small fee.\n\nHow to create free NFTs on Polygon\n\nTo facilitate artists and content creators in jumping onto the NFT bandwagon, a number of platforms using the Polygon blockchain to host nonfungible tokens offer their users the ability to mint NFTs for free. Polygon NFT marketplaces such as OpenSea and Rarible provide the option of \u201clazy minting,\u201d a functionality by which nonfungible token creators can monetize their content with no upfront cost involved.\n\nIt is because the NFT in question is actually minted when a user buys it. As a result, not only does this reduce the number of transactions that get relayed onto Ethereum but it also ensures that the buyer pays for the applicable gas rather than the NFT creator.\n\nIn terms of the steps to follow, an NFT creator needs to first select or create a digital file that will be converted into a bespoke nonfungible token. This file could be an image, video, GIF or even a song that will be used to create an immutable version of it on the Polygon blockchain.\n\nEven in the case of \u201clazy minting,\u201d it is necessary for the NFT creator to have a crypto wallet with sufficient amounts of Polygon\u2019s MATIC or Ether (ETH) tokens available to cover any fees that may be applicable at a later stage.\n\nOnce both of these requirements are fulfilled, a nonfungible token creator needs to choose from the different NFT marketplaces available on Polygon and connect their crypto wallet to sign in. After completing this step, the digital file needs to be uploaded onto the marketplace.\n\nTo do so, click on the \u201cFree Minting\u201d option and sign the minting authorizations that need to be provided to the marketplace. Upon completing this final step, the NFT will be put up for sale on the marketplace and will be available for purchase by other users.\n\nThe NFT remains listed on the respective marketplace, while all its related data is stored on the InterPlanetary File System, a distributed file storage protocol that permits anyone with a computer to store and share files as part of its giant peer-to-peer network.\n\nBy linking their crypto wallets with the marketplace and receiving minting permissions, NFT creators are assured that their NFT is minted as soon as the funds are deposited by the buyer and the same are then credited to their crypto wallet, without any additional hassles.\n\nIn the event that the NFT\u2019s creator wants to delist or \u201cburn\u201d an NFT that has been minted via this option, they\u2019ll have to pay an applicable gas fee before taking down the NFT from the marketplace.\n\nHow to purchase NFTs on Polygon\n\nFor investors and NFT enthusiasts who are inquisitive about how to buy NFTs on Polygon, their journey would have to begin with any of the NFT aggregators or marketplaces on the blockchain network. They may choose from Polygon NFT marketplaces such as Floor, TixHive, NFTrade, Candy Shop and Hodl My Moon in addition to OpenSea and Rarible marketplaces.\n\nWhile Hodl My Moon and TixHive are aggregators that exclusively work with the Polygon network, the others are examples of multichain marketplaces that facilitate transactions across blockchain networks, such as Ethereum, Solana and BNB Smart Chain among others.\n\nUsers will have to link their Polygon NFT wallet with the chosen marketplace and then proceed to browse through NFT collections available on Polygon. Depending on whether it is a fixed-price sale or an auction, the process of purchasing NFTs differs slightly for platforms such as OpenSea. For fixed-price NFTs, users can add one or more of such NFTs to their cart and pay for them in one single purchase flow.\n\nAfter clicking \u201cAdd to Cart,\u201d the user needs to navigate to the cart and finish the buying process by clicking on the \u201cComplete Purchase\u201d option. Upon doing this, the user will be redirected to the wallet window where the signature request has to be accepted after switching the wallet\u2019s network to that of Polygon.\n\nFor fixed-price NFT sales, the type of token depends on the preference set by the seller and, therefore, the buyer will have to comply with the price. For Polygon NFTs, the most common preference is that of Polygon ETH or MATIC tokens, with the former being bridged to the Polygon network.\n\nBy bridging ETH tokens to the Polygon network, users can save on the high and volatile gas or transaction fees requested by the Ethereum network, thereby bringing down the cost of acquisition.\n\nTo make an offer for an NFT or to place a bid for an auctioned NFT, users will need to lock ETH in a Wrapped Ether (wETH) smart contract to place pre-authorized bids, without the need for any additional input from the buyer.\n\nThe wETH smart contract mines an equivalent amount of wETH tokens when ETH funds are held in it, with the wETH tokens appearing in the user\u2019s wallet until it is used in a bid.\n\nHow to sell NFTs on Polygon\n\nAfter minting an NFT, the digital collectible will be visible in the \u201cMy Collections\u201d tab on the OpenSea marketplace and can be subsequently put up for sale by the NFT\u2019s owner. Here are the steps to sell NFTs on Polygon:\n\nHow to find Polygon NFTs on OpenSea\n\nAlthough the OpenSea NFT marketplace runs on the Ethereum blockchain, it allows users to buy, sell or trade NFTs from various other blockchain platforms, namely Solana, Klaytn and Polygon.\n\nOn such multichain NFT platforms, Polygon NFTs will have a Polygon logo in the upper-left corner of the representative image used to denote the item. Alternatively, one could filter Polygon from the list of blockchains that the platform supports to see only those NFTs that are hosted on the Polygon network.\n\nWith more than 43 million OpenSea Polygon NFTs already listed across categories such as art, collectibles, music, photography, sports, trading cards, utility and domain names, users could also use the range of filters available on the OpenSea platform to narrow down their eventual purchase.\n\nBy giving users the choice to browse popular NFT collections or even selecting NFTs that are priced within a defined budget range, the OpenSea marketplace offers an intuitive experience for those looking to buy their first NFT or add to their existing collection."

        "title": "Polygon\u2019s zkEVM Mainnet Beta Set For March Launch Date - CryptoDaily",
        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nEthereum Layer-2 scaling solution provider Polygon has picked the 27th of March, 2023, as the date when its zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) beta launch will go live.\n\nWith the launch date set, Polygon has stated that it would release more details about the zkEVM beta network over the next few weeks.\n\nLaunch Date Confirmed\n\nLayer-2 Ethereum scaling solution Polygon has finally announced the launch date of its long-awaited Ethereum Virtual Machine rollup technology. Polygon has stated that the beta launch of its zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) has been set for the 27th of March, 2023. Polygon took to Twitter to announce the launch from its official Twitter handle, stating that after over three months of \u201cbattle testing,\u201d the system is finally ready for its mainnet beta launch.\n\n\u201cRoses are red, Violets are blue, Poems are hard Mainnet Beta is here ON THE 27TH OF MARCH, Polygon #zkEVM launches the future of Ethereum scaling.\u201d\n\nWhile the protocol has not specified what the beta network will include, it did share that the Polygon team will release more details regarding the launch and the zkEVM beta network in the coming few weeks leading up to the launch date. It also added that the security of the network would be given the highest priority. Polygon\u2019a new zkEVM network has been hailed for bringing \u201cseamless scaling for Ethereum\u201d and saw its testnet launch in December.\n\nSecurity The Highest Priority\n\nThe Polygon team stated that it has given security the highest priority, which is why the new Polygon zkEVM has gone through a \u201cgauntlet of tests and audits.\u201d Zero Knowledge technology is widely considered as a significant improvement for blockchains and cryptography, increasing the speed of transactions and greatly reducing their cost. ZKevms are a type of ZK rollups that can process transactions on a separate Layer-2 and then send the transaction data back to the primary mainnet blockchain.\n\nPolygon\u2019s zkEVM testnet, which deploys the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) for its ZK rollup, went live in October, enabling developers on Ethereum to move their smart contracts from the main blockchain without any major reprogramming required. Since the launch of the testnet, over 75,000 ZK proofs have been generated, with over 5000 smart contracts already deployed. Mihailo Bjelic, the co-founder of Polygon, also revealed that the team is looking at ways to bring the ZK-technology to the Polygon POS chain. Sandeep Nailwal, Polygon co-founder, stated,\n\n\u201cPolygon zkEVM Mainnet is set to be the first fully EVM equivalent ZK rollup to reach mainnet. This represents a huge step towards scaling Ethereum and bringing Web3 to the masses.\u201d\n\nNot The Only Ones Working On zkEVM\n\nPolygon is far from the only team that is working on creating a viable zkEVM solution. zkSync, a scaling provider, is also working to create and develop a similar EVM technology with zkPorter, which takes transaction data off-chain. Another scaling solution provider, Scroll, is looking to create a zkEVM solution through a collaboration with the Privacy and Scaling Explorations Group, which is a part of the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nFurthermore, the Ethereum Foundation is also funding a project titled Applied ZKP. Applied ZKP is looking to develop an EVM-compatible zk-rollup. Explaining the significance behind the technology, the team stated that true EVM equivalence means Ethereum can successfully be scaled without half measures.\n\n\u201cThe best way to scale Ethereum is to preserve the existing Ethereum ecosystem: code, tooling, and infrastructure needs to just work. And that\u2019s what Polygon zkEVM is aiming to achieve.\u201d\n\nThe technology also helps to enable significant savings when it comes to transaction costs, with proof costs for large batches of transactions being brought down to around $0.06, with simple transactions costing as less as $0.001. Meanwhile, MATIC, Polygon\u2019s native token, had a positive reaction to the news and is currently up by over 5.50%.\n\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "content": "In addition to his already successful career in Hollywood, Ashton Kutcher\u2019s investments make up a large chunk of his overall earnings. Although some aspects of his digital assets are undisclosed, we take a dive into Ashton Kutcher\u2019s connection with cryptocurrency.\n\nHow much crypto does Ashton Kutcher have today?\n\nPrecisely how much crypto Kutcher has is debatable. Eventually, he might become transparent about it, but for now, we can only speculate. What we do know about his capital and finances are his startup investments, his affiliation with the company MoonPay, and his own company A-Grade Investments.\n\nFacts About Ashton Kutcher\u2019s Investments\n\nAshton Kutcher\u2019s net worth is $26 million.\n\nApart from being a well-established actor Ashton Kutcher is maybe less known for his investing savvy and enthusiasm for the world of tech, crypto, and investing. He has done pretty well for himself and plans on diving even deeper. According to Forbes, Ashton Kutcher\u2019s business farsightedness has earned him a net worth of $26 million.\n\n(Forbes)\n\nHe invested in Uber and Airbnb early on.\n\nThe A-list celebrity has a knack for spotting business success stories early on as he was an investor in companies like Uber and Airbnb when they were still up and coming. Be that as it may, Ashton Kutcher\u2019s net worth at Uber and Airbnb is still unknown.\n\n(People)\n\nAshton Kutcher is an investor in the fintech company MoonPay.\n\nHe is one of the investors in MoonPay which is a fintech startup recently valued at $3.4 billion. The company allows people to buy cryptocurrency via traditional payment methods such as bank transfer, cards, Apple pay, etc.\n\n(CNBC)\n\nAshton Kutcher\u2019s crypto portfolio is still unknown.\n\nAshton Kutcher\u2019s crypto collection has not been revealed. He is not the only celebrity to have made this choice. Nevertheless, one thing that seems to be common for stock markets everywhere is the ongoing inflation and that there has been a significant post-pandemic plummet in stocks. This might be the reason why famous people choose to keep their digital assets on the down low.\n\n(NBC News)\n\nHe co-founded a company called A-Grade Investments.\n\nKutcher co-founded the company in 2010 with Guy Oseary and billionaire Ron Burkle. Though Ashton Kutcher\u2019s crypto portfolio remains undisclosed, we know that A-Grade Investments has an impressive investment portfolio including investments in Uber, Skype, Spotify, Shazam, Airbnb, Pinterest, and so on.\n\n(Forbes)\n\nKutcher regularly invests in promising startups.\n\nKutcher has an astute business sense and often invests in promising new startups. He invested in ResearchGate, Kopari Beauty, and Neighborly early on. Is Ashton Kutcher a billionaire? Well, officially not yet, but it seems like he is paving the way toward becoming one.\n\n(Variety)\n\nHis wife Mila Kunis has put out 10,420 NFTs.\n\nHis celebrity wife, the famous actress Mila Kunis, has also dipped her toes in the waters of digital assets. By co-founding a company named 3050 Gang, she has established one of the few all-female crews that work with crypto. She recently put out 10,420 NFTs that are connected to her animated series called Stoner Cats.\n\n(People)\n\nConclusion\n\nHaving digital assets has always been dubbed risky business. However, Kutcher seems to be a natural at it. Ashton Kutcher\u2019s cryptocurrency trajectory is ever-changing, however, it looks like this is slowly becoming his area of expertise.\n\nSources:"

        "title": "The 10 Biggest Crypto Whales in the Market - Bankless Times",
        "content": "Who are the biggest crypto whales in the market today, and what kind of impact do they have on the investment landscape? In the cryptocurrency space, \u201cwhale\u201d is the term given to an investor who holds a huge amount of coins or tokens of a particular cryptocurrency.\n\nCrypto whales are important to the cryptocurrency investment space because they can create a ripple effect in the market, generating changes in token valuation.\n\nIf you know where the whales are swimming, you can often gain a better idea of how the markets they\u2019re involved in might be influenced going forward.\n\nWho Are the Biggest Cryptocurrency Whales Right Now?\n\nDefining the biggest whales in crypto can be difficult. While some of the biggest investors in cryptocurrency are very open about how many tokens they hold, others are less straightforward. Cryptocurrency can be a highly anonymized area, so it\u2019s difficult to know for certain which big wallets belong to which people.\n\nSome of the biggest cryptocurrency whales are actually major companies responsible for trading or managing large amounts of tokens.\n\nHowever, this list focuses on individuals known to us by name (or pseudonym), and these are some of the biggest crypto whales we\u2019re aware of right now based on estimates by experts.\n\n1. Satoshi Nakamoto\n\nUndoubtedly the biggest cryptocurrency whale in the world, Satoshi Nakamoto is the pseudonym for the inventor of Bitcoin. We\u2019re not sure for certain whether this is a person or a group of people, but we do know they continue to hold ownership of around 1 million BTC.\n\nIn today\u2019s market, 1 million BTC equates to around 19.2 billion US dollars. If Nakamoto is a single person, this would make them the biggest crypto whale of all time.\n\n2. Brian Armstrong\n\nBrian Armstrong is the CEO of Coinbase, one of the largest crypto exchanges on the market. The website handles billions of trades every day, and Brian has a significant amount of crypto contributing to his own net worth.\n\nEstimates suggest the CEO has a crypto fortune worth of around $6.5 billion. However, it\u2019s difficult to know what kind of crypto whale Armstrong is and which currencies he holds.\n\n3. Michael Saylor\n\nMichael Saylor is an American entrepreneur and businessman, as well as one of the biggest Bitcoin whales of all time. Experts even believe he might have been responsible for some major movements in the Bitcoin landscape, and he currently owns more than 17,732 bitcoins, worth over $1.14 billion.\n\nSaylor\u2019s company, MicroStrategy, also began accumulating bitcoins in 2020. While we don\u2019t know exactly how many Bitcoins Michael holds today, some experts say the BTC bank for the company is worth billions.\n\n4. Chris Larsen\n\nOne of the co-founders of the credit lending company Eloan, and peer-to-peer lending site Prosper, Chris Larsen helped to launch the Ripple cryptocurrency in 2012. Ripple is a blockchain network that has grown popular in the crypto whales list over the years.\n\nWhile there\u2019s no direct information on how much crypto Larsen holds overall, Larsen does have at least 5.19 billion XRP, creating a net holding worth of around $37.3 billion.\n\n5. Changpeng Zhao\n\nThe CEO of Binance, Changpeng Zhao, is considered to be one of the biggest Bitcoin whales on the market, though he hasn\u2019t released a lot of information about his holdings. Unsurprisingly, Zhao\u2019s crypto holdings fall into both Binance coin and Bitcoin.\n\nAccording to reports, Zhao\u2019s net worth is around $96 billion, but this doesn\u2019t take into account his cryptocurrency holdings, which he says he plans on donating to charity.\n\n6. Vitalik Buterin\n\nVitalik Buterin is considered to be one of the biggest Ethereum whales on the market, though his holdings in ETH remain unknown at this time. As the co-creator of Ethereum, Buterin was once said to hold around 355,000 Ethereum, as well as various whale-sized quantities of other coins, like SHIB, Akita, and Dogecoin.\n\nIn 2022, Vitalik announced he was no longer a crypto whale following the collapse of various coin investments. However, we don\u2019t know for certain how much he holds today.\n\n7. Tim Draper\n\nWell-known venture capitalist, tech billionaire, and entrepreneur Tim Draper is considered to be one of the biggest players on the Bitcoin whales list after he purchased 30,000 bitcoins for a bargain price when they were seized by Silk Road.\n\nThough Draper won\u2019t reveal how many bitcoins he currently owns today, he also has wallets in various other cryptocurrencies, such as Aragon\u2019s \u201cANT\u201d tokens. The tech expert is expected to be worth a little over $1 billion.\n\n8. The Winklevoss Twins\n\nThe Winklevoss twins are perhaps best known for accusing Mark Zuckerberg for stealing their idea for a social network. In a 2012 settlement, they won around $65 million in court and invested it in a stack of Bitcoin. At the time, the twins were said to purchase about 1% of all the BTC in existence.\n\nThe twins are still considered to be some of the biggest Bitcoin whales around, with around 70,000 bitcoins in their portfolio, as well as a variety of other cryptocurrencies.\n\n9. Barry Silbert\n\nBarry Silbert acquired Digital Currency Group with funds from the sale of Second-Market, an equity trading platform acquired by Nasdaq in 2015.\n\nThis conglomerate consists of five companies, one of which is Grayscale, a digital asset management company.\n\nGrayscale manages a portfolio of assets worth over $28 billion (\u00a320.6 billion), including Bitcoin and Ether. It was the first application approved to trade securities backed by Bitcoin and raised about \u00a3434 million annually.\n\n10. Jed McCaleb\n\nJed McCaleb was one of the co-founders of Ripple and is, therefore, one of the biggest XRP whales in the market today. Although McCaleb left the company following a disagreement with his other founders, he\u2019s still said to own around 3.4 billion XRP.\n\nBy today\u2019s standards, this gives McCaleb\u2019s wallet a net worth of around $1.6 billion, which makes up a significant portion of his overall wealth. Apparently, Jed also has investments in other crypto markets, though he hasn\u2019t revealed the details of his portfolio.\n\nThe Biggest Crypto Whales Today\n\nCrypto whales\u2019 fortunes can be difficult to estimate because not everyone is open about their cryptocurrency holdings. The information we have about the current crypto whales is based on the news reports issued by major crypto purchases over the years. However, the volatility of the crypto market means many new whales could emerge in the future.\n\nFAQ\n\nWho are the biggest crypto whales? The biggest crypto whales are people with the largest numbers of tokens in a specific cryptocurrency. For instance, one of the top crypto whales in Bitcoin is Satoshi Nakamoto, the individual responsible for initially creating BTC. How many crypto whales are there? While we do have some information about the largest crypto whales to hit the market throughout the years, many of these people and entities remain anonymous. As such, it\u2019s difficult to determine how many crypto whales there really are. How much money do you need to be a crypto whale? Being a crypto whale isn\u2019t about the amount of money you have as much as it is about the number of tokens or coins you own in a specific currency. Crypto whales usually have around at least $10 million worth of a specific coin.\n\nHere Are More Crypto Guides"

        "content": "A list of the biggest crypto losers of the year so far offers an insight into some of the cryptocurrencies experiencing the biggest issues this year. Overall, 2023 has been far from a lucrative year for cryptocurrencies, with some major names approaching the \u201ctop losers\u201d status.\n\nThe world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC) lost over 50% of its value by the time June arrived and dropped beneath its $20,000 support level. Other major currencies such as Ethereum (ETH) lost approximately 70% of its value during 2023.\n\nWhile many companies experienced significant losses in the last year, some have fared worse than most. Here\u2019s your guide to the biggest losers in cryptocurrency in 2023 so far.\n\nThe Top Crypto Losers in 2023 (So Far)\n\nA significant number of the top cryptocurrency losses this year have been linked to Exchange Traded Funds. The $63 million Global X blockchain lost around 64% of its value by the close of August 2023, and many other vendors are also struggling.\n\nThough crypto-linked ETFs have gained popularity in recent years, experts believe unrest in the market has led to a number of losses. Even cryptocurrency exchange platforms like Coinbase have seen drops of around 79.6% in market value over the year.\n\nAccording to Coincodex, a tracker of some of the trending gainers and losers in crypto, 61% of cryptocurrencies are experiencing negative movement as of October 2023.\n\nThe worst performing crypto losers of the year to date include:\n\n10. SUSHI (-88.51% reduction)\n\nSUSHI is the governance token of a DeFi protocol forked from Uniswap for SushiSwap. It\u2019s also one of the top losers today. At the beginning of the year, the token was valued at $9.17, whereas as of October 2023, it\u2019s now worth around $1.10336. It\u2019s value is also more than 95% lower than its all-time high trading price.\n\n9. CVX (-88.54% reduction)\n\nCreated by Convex Value, the CVX coin allows liquidity providers to earn trading fees and claim CRV boosts without locking CRV themselves. The coin previously outperformed both Bitcoin and Ethereum, but has lost over 88% of its value this year. The coin started the year with a value of $54.23 and has since dropped to $5.19.\n\n8. KDA (-89.08% reduction)\n\nOtherwise known as Kadena, the KDA token is among the top loser coin options listed this year. This coin belongs to a blockchain with a braided, high-throughput Proof of Work system, running Chainweb. In January 2023, the coin was worth $12.24, and its value as of October 2023 has dipped to $1.407247.\n\n7. FTM (-86.91% reduction)\n\nFantom, or FTM is a token belonging to a next-generation blockchain solution. The company behind the technology claims it\u2019s the world\u2019s first DAG based smart contract system. At the start of the year, FTM tokens were trading at $2.44 each. The price rose slightly throughout January to $3.36, before dropping to only $0.228661 as of October 2023.\n\n6. AMP (-89.98% reduction)\n\nAMP has emerged as one of the biggest crypto losers 2023 has created so far. This digital collateral token exists on the Ethereum blockchain, and is used to facilitate value transfers. In January 2023, the token reached a value of $0.55503, before dropping to approximately $0.004964 by October.\n\n5. GALA (-91.21% reduction)\n\nGALA is a coin designed for the new age of gaming, and powers the Gala Games ecosystem. Despite a strong background in decentralized gaming, and a low inflation rate, the GALA coin has emerged as one of the major loser coins in 2023. At the beginning of the year, it was trading at around $0.462875, and is now trading at $0.041096.\n\n4. ONE (-91.41% reduction)\n\nKnown as the \u201cHarmony\u201d coin by collectors, ONE, is the token of the Harmony protocol, which aims to scale blockchain transactions for lower latency and increased speed. In January 2023 the coin had a value of 0.37809, and is now trading at $0.019988.\n\n3. GLMR (-95.79% reduction)\n\nOtherwise known as Moonbeam, the GLMR coin is one of the major market losers in cryptocurrency right now. Moonbeam leverages Ethereum and Polkadot technology as part of the Polkadot network. At the beginning of January 2023, it was trading at a value of $15.35. In October, this value has dropped to $0.471000.\n\n2. USTC (-96.90% reduction)\n\nTerraClassicUSD, or USTC is an algorithmic stablecoin intended to track the price of the US Dollar, built on the Terra blockchain. At the start of the year, it was trading at a value of $1 and has since dropped to $0.031066.\n\n1. LUNC (-100% reduction)\n\nThe Terra Classic coin, LUNC, belongs to the blockchain platform launched in 2019, for the development of algorithmic stablecoins. The system has since come under extreme market pressure, preventing stablecoins from maintaining their intended value. The token has dropped from a value of $1 at the start of the year to $0.000311 today.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nTerra Classic or LUNC has emerged as the biggest loser coin in the crypto landscape this year, due to the extreme market pressure placed on stablecoins in 2023. However, various other well-known coins have experienced massive losses including the SAND coin for sandbox (-85.77%), the NFT coin (-81.32%), and even SOL (Solana) (-80.58%).\n\nAt this time, with so many cryptocurrencies experiencing losses, the issues facing major crypto innovators are likely to continue.\n\nCrypto Losers FAQ\n\nWhich cryptocurrency has lost the most? Terra Classic or LUNC is the cryptocurrency which has lost the most value in 2023, with nearly 100% of its value disappearing over the course of the year. Who are the losers in cryptocurrency? Losers in cryptocurrency are coin and token providers who have experienced significant dips to the value of their coins in a certain period of time. What is the biggest crypto crash? Many coins have faced significant issues during 2023. In 2023, Bitcoin was the most valuable cryptocurrency in the world again for a time, but is now trading at less than 70% of its all-time high value.\n\nHere Are More Crypto Guides"

        "content": "Interest in Non-Fungible Tokens, or \u201cNFTs,\u201d has been growing drastically over the last couple of years. Today, experts even predict the market value of NFTs will increase to more than $13 billion by 2030. But how many people have their own NFT? Read on to learn more about the number of NFT owners in 2023.\n\nHow Many People Own NFTs?\n\nAccording to a study that concluded at the end of 2021, there were approximately 360,000 NFT owners. These individuals accounted for a shared collection of more than 2.7 million NFTs at the time. Of these NFT investors, approximately 9% (equalling around 32,400 wallets) held 80% of the market\u2019s value.\n\n(Financial Times)\n\nNFT Owners in 2023\n\nThe demand for NFTs is rising as investors look for new ways to expand their portfolios with a wide range of unique products. Let\u2019s take a closer look at the current NFT market.\n\n3.3% of the UK population plans on owning an NFT, yet 78.8% say they don\u2019t know what an NFT is.\n\nNFT popularity is increasing worldwide. Around 3.3% of the UK population plans on owning an NFT in the future. At the same time, 78.8% of the population say they don\u2019t know what an NFT is.\n\nThe UK ranks second last out of all countries, with investors planning on owning NFTs in the future. The United States was fourth to last, with 3.9% planning on buying NFTs. The number one country on the list was Nigeria, with 21.7% of people saying they wanted to purchase their own NFTs.\n\n(Finder)\n\nIn 2021, trade volume for NFTs was measured at $24.9 billion.\n\nThe rising NFT sales in 2021 offered an insight into the growing popularity of non-fungible tokens. As of 2021, the trade volume in this industry was valued at $24.9 billion. This is a huge increase from the $95 million trade volume in 2020.\n\nAccording to available reports, by the end of 2021, there were also 2.7 million unique active NFT wallets trading in the marketplace. However, 49% of those wallets were connected to NFT games.\n\n(DappRadar, Fool.com)\n\n29% of US adults are interested in buying NFTs.\n\nNearly a third of surveyed US adults said they were interested in NFTs, with around 9% claiming their NFT interest was particularly high. Notably, Millennials and men were deemed the most likely to get involved with NFT collecting in the future.\n\nAround 15% of men said they already collect NFTs, and 23% of Millennials said the same. Baby Boomers were the least likely to be interested in the marketplace, with only 2% saying they would collect NFTs.\n\n(Morning Consult)\n\nApproximately 12,000 NFT sales take place every day.\n\nThe biggest NFT owners purchase hundreds of non-fungible tokens per day, according to market trackers. Around 12,000 sales are conducted in the marketplace each day, with an average value of $2000.\n\nIt\u2019s also revealed that there are around 10,000 active wallets interacting with NFTs on any given day, and around 6,000 unique buyers. This indicates a significant number of purchases are made for more than one NFT per day.\n\n(NonFungible)\n\nAxie Infinity produces the most popular NFTs.\n\nThough the number of available NFTs on the market is constantly changing, some are more popular than others. According to an NFT popularity chart by NonFungible, Axie Infinity is currently responsible for the highest number of NFT sales, with around 22,788,129 transactions.\n\nThese purchases account for over $4 billion in value. The second most popular NFT creator in terms of sales is Cryptokitties, with 2,871,438 recorded sales, followed by Ethereum Name Service, with 1,725,810 sales.\n\n(NonFungible)\n\nGary Vee is the celebrity with the most NFTs.\n\nThough it\u2019s difficult to estimate the top NFT owners around the world, some celebrities have bigger collections than others. Gary Vee currently holds around 2,961 NFTs, giving him the most significant portfolio among celebrities. He\u2019s followed by Logan Paul with 2,497 NFTs, and Snoop Dog with 1,424 NFTs in their collections.\n\nNotably, though Gary Vee has the most NFT, he isn\u2019t the richest NFT owner among celebrities. Mark Cuban\u2019s NFT portfolio is almost five times the value of the one owned by Gary Vee, at $502,610,000.\n\n(City A.M.)\n\nExploring the Popularity of NFTs\n\nA lack of tracking tools for NFT collectors makes it difficult to know for certain how many people own NFTs. However, the statistics show interest in this area has been growing at a significant rate. We\u2019re likely to see a lot of people joining famous NFT owners in the years ahead.\n\nSources:\n\nHere Are More NFT Guides"

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin\u2019s net worth is kept in crypto\u2014almost entirely in Ether. Even as crypto undergoes a bear market, the Ethereum platform continues to develop moving on to proof of stake. It also provides the framework for the most interesting developments in crypto such as DeFi, NFTs, and stablecoins. So the co-founder keeps his money in the project he believes in. But how much money is that? Read on and find out.\n\nWhat Is Vitalik Buterin's Net Worth?\n\nVitalik Buterin is worth $320 million at the time of writing and Ether being valued at $1,286. This estimation of Buterin\u2019s net worth is based on his public crypto wallet in which he keeps the majority of his funds.\n\n(Etherscan)\n\nDetails about Vitalik Buterin\u2019s Crypto Holdings, Donations, and More\n\nWith cryptocurrencies fluctuating in response to economic and technological changes, the net worth of crypto holders changes as well. So while $320 million is the easy answer, it is important to take a look at the history of the Ethereum founder\u2019s net worth to get the whole picture.\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s Ethereum holdings are currently at 250,001 ETH.\n\nWhile Vitalik Buterin has several wallets, his main wallet contains by far the highest number of Ether. While he doesn\u2019t move funds frequently, on November 24, 2022, he moved 40,000 ETH to another address, bringing Vitalik Buterin\u2019s net worth in late 2022 to 250,001 ETH or $320 million.\n\n(Etherscan)\n\nButerin used to be a billionaire, but he is currently not.\n\nVitalik\u2019s net worth exceeded $1 billion in early May 2021 for the first time. It has been fluctuating with the value of ether since, peaking at $1.5 billion on November 13, 2021 when ether was at $4,645 and he had 325,000 ETH in his crypto wallet.\n\n(Forbes)\n\nVitalik Buterin has other crypto holdings, however, much lower in value.\n\nIn the two known wallets, the mathematics prodigy owns other tokens besides Ether, including KNC, OMG, 0xBTC, and DAI. Also, in an AMA Reddit post several years ago, he revealed he had other crypto holdings including BTC. He also disclosed owning shares of Clearmatics, a blockchain company where he also serves as an advisor, and Starkware, a company specializing in cryptography. He did not specify how many shares he had in each.\n\n(Etherscan, Reddit)\n\nShiba Inu creators sent Buterin 50% of all the SHIB tokens.\n\nButerin\u2019s crypto holdings have also included memecoins that he did not actually want or ask for. Vitalik Buterin\u2019s Shiba burn became famous as he destroyed 90% of the coins sent to him (worth about $8 billion at the time) and donated the rest. At the coin\u2019s peak value, the burned coins would have been worth $32.5 billion. However, Buterin burned the coins quickly saying he did not want to be a locus of that kind of power.\n\n(Business Insider)\n\nButerin donated over 50 trillion SHIB to CryptoRelief to help solve the covid crisis in India.\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s Shiba donation would have exceeded $1 billion at the time, however, its staggering amount could not be in the same way as fiat donations, due to regulations and price fluctuations. The donation started a conversation about crypto philanthropy and regulations.\n\n(Business Insider)\n\nVitalik owns 0.20742967% of Ether, having the 26th largest Ether account.\n\nDespite being a co-founder of the platform, for the Ethereum creator, net worth increase is not the main driver. He has been more focused on what the technology can bring beyond monetary value, including banking the unbanked and enabling smart contracts. The richest Ethereum holders are mostly exchanges and some other accounts.\n\n(Etherscan)\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nTo sum up, Vitalik Buterin\u2019s net worth is almost completely in crypto, meaning that its value fluctuates quite significantly. The current value of Buterin\u2019s 250,001 ETH is $320 million, with other crypto holdings being drastically less valuable.\n\nSources:"

        "title": "How To Send Ethereum Anonymously [The Simple Guide] - Crypto News Flash",
        "content": "Following the wake of the crypto trials that saw many people taken to court over illicit Bitcoin transactions that they assumed were anonymous, the issue of anonymity when making cryptocurrency transactions became a hot topic amongst the crypto community, especially amongst those using the native token of Ethereum, Ether.\n\nPut simply, Ether transactions are effectively classed as pseudo-anonymous because you need to conduct intense chain analysis and mine a lot of data to properly trace the identification of a person who owns an Ethereum wallet or who has recently received funds.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain is completely open and transparent; this means that all transaction data that takes place upon it is publicly accessible. It\u2019s exceptionally straightforward for someone to use a tool like Etherscan to trace and track the movement of funds. They only need to know the exact Ethereum wallet address or the ID of the transaction in question.\n\nSounds easy? Well, hold your horses! If you want to join the dots and connect an ETH wallet with the real person using it, you\u2019ll need more than that. You\u2019ll need to conduct a complex chain analysis to discover where the Ether was originally bought.\n\nMost Ethereum is bought on popular exchanges and platforms, but the crypto scam platforms are lurking around the corner as well. To set aside these two types of platforms is crucial for the future of your crypto adventure. Having said that, Immediate Bitmasters is an exemplary platform that is verified and an actual trader heaven in terms of interface and tools. Because many of these platforms require users to buy crypto with a bank transfer, Paypal payment, or bank card, it\u2019s possible to find out the owner\u2019s identity that way. Plus, even those extra craft buyers who avoid exchanges and brokerages to buy crypto can still be traced through their IP address.\n\nAlongside a user\u2019s IP address, online sleuths can use methods like social engineering and triangulation to identify a person\u2019s identity behind a particular wallet.\n\nHow Do You Send Ethereum Anonymously?\n\nOk, at this point, you\u2019re probably wondering how to send Ethereum anonymously. Fear not! That\u2019s where I come in.\n\nSending ETH anonymously is actually pretty straightforward once you know what you\u2019re doing. In this section, I will show you the most straightforward way of sending Ethereum anonymously. And don\u2019t worry if you\u2019re not the most tech-savvy person; this is very beginner-friendly.\n\nCreate and utilise a crypto wallet\n\nHide your IP address\n\nUse a reputable exchange or platform to send ETH anonymously\n\nHow to Hide Your IP Address\n\nYou need to hide your IP address in order to lay the foundations of solid online security. Sadly, many people are blissfully unaware of how vital it is to mask your IP online, not just for sending ETH! (But it certainly does help for that, too!)\n\nPut simply; if someone wants to find you online, they don\u2019t have to look far if you\u2019re making no effort to hide your IP address. Thankfully, you don\u2019t need to be a computer genius to do so, either. It\u2019s actually very simple and can be done in several ways, such as:\n\nA VPN\n\na proxy server\n\nTor browser\n\nPersonally, my go-to choice for masking my IP address is to use a good ol\u2019 VPN. A VPN connection serves to reroute and anonymise all traffic you send over a network you\u2019re using, whether it\u2019s your home internet router or public wifi. With a decent VPN, you\u2019ll be amazed at the level of features available to anonymise yourself.\n\nIn contrast to a VPN, a proxy server can only redirect web requests.\n\nA TOR browser is a more hardcore version of a VPN and is best reserved for those who are more well-versed in cyber security. The downside? It can be laggy and slow for a lot of users.\n\nThere is a huge demand for well-made VPNs, but all of them generally work in the same format, so I\u2019ll provide a general guide on how to set one up so you can complete the most important step; making an anonymous ETH transaction!\n\nHow to Set Up a VPN\n\nWhatever VPN you decide upon, most must be installed on your browser for it to work properly. Install the proper software through the verified VPN site, then click on it to sign up. The best VPNs naturally require payment, and you really get what you pay for here.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve signed up for a VPN and installed it, it\u2019s time to get it moving! A good VPN will give you a decent selection of countries for you to switch your IP address, simply connect, and you\u2019re good to go!\n\nAll of the traffic on your network is now being masked. Congratulations!\n\nA solid tip for using a VPN is to turn on the auto-connect feature because you can easily forget to switch it on and leave your traffic exposed.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nAnd so, to sum up, this guide to making Ethereum transactions anonymously has shown that Ethereum transactions are traceable, but only if you let it be like that. There are a few tried-and-tested ways to carry out Ethereum transactions anonymously successfully.\n\nAfter all, it should be a human right to keep your financial history as personal and private as possible. However, you need to play a part and be responsible if you truly wish to retain your anonymity online and offline.\n\nAs we round off, I just want to remind you to always remember to turn on your VPN whenever you\u2019re online and, when dealing with cryptocurrencies like ETH, always ensure you use beginner-friendly and straightforward platforms like Bitcoin 360, eToro, or Binance.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

        "content": "Last week\u2019s sell-off signaled a correction for ETH and dragged the price to a low of $1470 earlier this week. Surprisingly, this low held as solid support for a fresh bullish wave. This rebound came earlier than expected!\n\nThings have changed so quickly, as Ethereum witnessed a fast recovery over the last 24 hours of trading. It took many by surprise with the current surge in volatility across the crypto space.\n\nThis volatility inflow was led by the sudden upswing in Bitcoin\u2019s price, which puts the second-largest crypto by market cap above $200 billion.\n\nA daily 7.3% recovery has bought ETH back to around its previous multi-month resistance level. It trades at $1,666 and is now on the verge of breaking out. Undoubtedly, it is important to note that the bulls are back at full speed.\n\nMeanwhile, the expected correction level was the $1350 \u2013 $1400 price range, where the diagonal support line is drawn. But unexpectedly, Ethereum found solid support nearby and rebounded far above those price ranges.\n\nThe newly initiated leg-up is expected to hit $2k with a big price movement in the coming days. However, it may face some hurdles around the $1.7k level before soaring higher.\n\nAs of now, buy orders are getting filled faster than sell. If ETH continues to experience a high bid, more volumes will keep the price rising in the near term.\n\nEthereum Key Level To Watch\n\nThe price is currently facing a resistance level of $1,678. If it flips this holding resistance, the next stop would be $1,788 and $1,950. The resistance to watch above the $2k lies at $2,170 and $2350.\n\nEthereum has left some crucial support untested. But if the asset attempts a pullback, the level to consider for support is $1,473, followed by $1,403. There\u2019s also support at $1,350, which remains a key untested level.\n\nKey Resistance Levels: $1,678, $1,788, $1,950\n\nKey Support Levels: $1,560, $1,473, $1,403\n\nSpot Price: $1,666\n\nTrend: Bullish\n\nVolatility: High\n\nDisclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

        "content": "Los Angeles, California, 14th February, 2023, Chainwire\n\nDeSo, the layer-1 blockchain that raised $200M from top funds, including Sequoia, Andreessen Horowitz, and Coinbase-Ventures, announces the launch of DeSo Chat Protocol (DCP) \u2014 an on-chain, end-to-end encrypted wallet-to-wallet messaging protocol for web3.\n\nDeSo Chat Protocol (DCP) is a secure, censorship-resistant messaging platform for web3 communities. It is built with cross-chain interoperability in mind, so it can easily integrate with any blockchain. With its ability to sustain 40,000 messages per second, it can scale to millions of users, cross-chain, with little to no gas fees. Ethereum is the first integration for DCP, but there are plans to partner with other chains like Solana and Near in the future. When an Ethereum user logs in using MetaMask, they are instantly airdropped enough $DESO to send up to 10,000 messages.\n\nFounder of DeSo, Nader Al-Naji, explains, \u201cWith its built-in interoperability, DeSo Chat Protocol is positioned to become the universal communicator for the entire web3 ecosystem. For the first time ever, NFT marketplaces like Opensea, MagicEden, and Rarible can integrate DCP to provide a safe, secure way for founders, builders, or creators to communicate regardless of the blockchain they use.\u201d\n\nDeSo Chat Protocol is a powerful communication tool that can be added to any app on any blockchain. Additionally, developers can create new, never before seen social experiences 100% on-chain. Furthermore, it provides white-labeling options so that web3 apps can launch with group chat and community-building capabilities without having to set up everything from scratch. DeSo is currently in talks with apps and NFT marketplaces to integrate DeSo Chat Protocol in the near future. That means communities on platforms like Opensea, Rarible, and MagicEden can communicate with each other no matter which app or blockchain they\u2019re on.\n\nAl-Naji continues, \u201cThat means that a user on Opensea can send a message to someone on Rarible, and a user on Rarible can send a message to someone on MagicEden without having to worry about gas fees making it easier than ever for web3 communities to scale and monetize on-chain with heightened safety and security to prevent hacks.\u201d\n\nDeSo Chat Protocol offers a wide range of features that popular messaging apps like Signal, Telegram, and Whatsapp have, such as group chat management, message edits, end-to-end encryption, and emoji reactions. Additionally, thanks to the money-native features that come with the DeSo blockchain, DCP can be customized to build novel messaging experiences that integrate NFTs, Social Tokens, Gated Messaging, and much more!\n\nCrypto communities have been clamoring for their own web3 native chat application for the last several years, especially after the high-profile Bored Ape Yacht Club hacks on Discord. Most web3 communities are fragmented and forced to use archaic web2 messaging protocols, leaving them susceptible to hacks, attacks, and stolen assets.\n\nInternet scams are expected to increase due to the explosion in popularity of AI, where deep fakes are difficult to discern from reality; blockchain-based identity and reputation could be the only way to verify whether someone is real, mitigating scams along the way.\n\nAdditionally, the DeSo Chat Protocol is positioned to become a major player in the global Blockchain Messaging Apps Market, which is expected to grow from USD 42.23 million in 2022 to USD 628.72 million by 2030 (an increase of 1389%). It stands out among other options because it\u2019s built on the DeSo blockchain, specifically designed with scalability in mind, allowing decentralized social networks to reach billions of users while offering unmatched trust and transparency thanks to everything being stored 100% on-chain.\n\nThis is yet another step towards DeSo\u2019s mission of becoming The Social Layer of Web3, a creator-led and user-owned internet powering the future of social media. With the recent launch of Openfund and MegaSwap , DeSo now boasts a full set of tools for founders and builders to launch apps that attract millions of users while creators can monetize in ways never before possible.\n\nAbout Deso\n\nDeSo is a new layer-1 blockchain built from the ground up to decentralize social media and scale storage-heavy applications to billions of users. It raised $200 million and is backed by Sequoia, Andreessen Horowitz, Coinbase Ventures, Social Capital, Polychain Capital, Winklevoss Capital, Pantera, and other blue chip funds.\n\nCheck out the full roadmap and claim your username.\n\nContact\n\nGrowth Marketing Lead\n\nAsh\n\nash@deso.org\n\nThis publication is sponsored.

        "content": "Chainspace has emerged to be an exciting new avenue.\n\nOrdinals project acts like Snapchat filters.\n\nNew creativity is sparked among the Web3 builders with the smashing rise of Bitcoin NFTs by the Ordinals project. On Tuesday, its inscriptions crossed 100,000, proving that the project could bring digital assets native to various Bitcoin blockchains to keep intriguing the crypto space.\n\nSource: Ordinals Inscription; Dune\n\nThe Chainspace Emergence\n\nChainspace emerged as an exciting example, with an experimental art project connecting Bitcoin and Ethereum via a lo-fi video rendering app, binding both coins. The project expands to a total of 800 on-chain apps, each with a unique portal. On which its pseudonymous creator duo, el-ranye and Timshel, describe it as a \u201cdigital object that emits infinite art.\u201d\n\nSimplifying the puzzle, it can be said that every app on Ordinals inscription is like a Snapchat filter, manipulating images coming from either computer or camera. It takes detailed images or footage and renders them like old-school ASCII art. This uses symbols and letters to depict real-time video viewing in an abstract and stylized manner. Every Chainspace portal offers different effects.\n\na @el__ranye x @TimshelXYZ experimental art project\n\n\n\n\u2514\u2af8 https://t.co/tpkbsRaFdf\n\n\n\n\ud835\ude8a \ud835\ude99\ud835\ude98\ud835\ude9b\ud835\ude9d\ud835\ude8a\ud835\ude95 \ud835\ude92\ud835\ude97\ud835\ude9d\ud835\ude98 \ud835\ude8c\ud835\ude91\ud835\ude8a\ud835\ude92\ud835\ude97\ud835\ude9c\ud835\ude99\ud835\ude8a\ud835\ude8c\ud835\ude8e\n\n\n\ninscribed onchain on BTC on a single satoshi\n\n\n\nwill be minting via @ourzora\n\n\n\nmega thanks to @isiain who worked w/ me on a cross-chain BTC<>ETH renderer https://t.co/B7bvLw0fFD pic.twitter.com/DAjMKdRai0 \u2014 Timshel {\ud835\ude9d\ud835\ude91\ud835\ude98\ud835\ude9e \ud835\ude96\ud835\ude8a\ud835\udea2\ud835\ude8e\ud835\ude9c\ud835\ude9d} (@TimshelXYZ) February 9, 2023\n\nAs the Ordinals can hold more on-chain data than an Ethereum NFT, this provides a unique experience that is not available elsewhere. All the web app are totally inscribed as digital art on the Bitcoin blockchain. Every portal has its unique inscription, ready to be shared among owners. The Ordinals\u2019 innovative idea is to inscribe upto 4MB of content on a single Satoshi in Bitcoin.\n\nConnecting Bitcoin & Ethereum\n\nSmart contracts connect Ethereum NFT to the Bitcoin-based Ondinal chain, holding the codes powering dApps and NFT projects. Visible Ethereum NFT artwork on the market is basically a screenshot of the Ordinal inscription. However, both are paired for an NFT buyer wishing to trade in the Ethereum version and take the Bitcoin Ordinal into custody. Currently, it\u2019s done via manual process, but efforts to automate it are ongoing.\n\nHowever, the swap of Ethereum NFT for Bitcoin Ordinal custody is a one-way process, and swapping back or holding both versions simultaneously is not allowed. The public accessibility of Chainspace portals underpins the idea that NFT owners are not interested in buying exclusive access passes.\n\n620 NFTs will be on sale on Thursday with certain active Discord users; individuals who have already shared their Chainspace creations and screenshots will be able to mint at 0.33 ETH ($550). Additional 100 NFTs would be airdropped to Web3 builders, while 60 NFTs are for the team.\n\nWhy the Buzz?\n\nAll these are readily and publicly available, which raises the question of why to bother owning something if its exclusivity is ambiguous. Also, there are no prior hints that this would happen in the future. Timsel referred to the growing buzz surrounding Ordinals and on-chain inscriptions to answer this. Betting that people are excited about the on-chain media and Web3 experimentations and love to own a portal.\n\nLiking the scenario with the public art installations, although they are open for public viewing but are owned by someone.\n\nI'm having so much fun generating these Chainspace templates aka high-functionality digital objects that bridge you into a higher plane.\n\n\n\nExperimental/performance art by @TimshelXYZ and @richa891 \u2013 in Chainspace, you are the art!\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udfa8\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/9c7AOtje3c \u2014 ozorian89 (@richa891) February 11, 2023\n\n\u201cI think people are really excited about owning the actual Satoshi itself [\u2026] They want the \u2018smashed penny\u2019 with art on it in their wallet.\u201d\n\nThe ultimate goal here is to explore new avenues in the experimental on-chain art tools and provide each user with a unique experience."

        "content": "This article will analyze Ethereum\u2019s market dynamics through current developments of the network, performing technical analysis, and price action to determine whether it is a good time to invest in the cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum is the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and has established itself as a leading player in the crypto space. It was created in 2015 with the aim of becoming a decentralized platform for building decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. Unlike Bitcoin, which primarily serves as a store of value, Ethereum provides a blockchain platform that enables developers to build and deploy a wide range of decentralized applications.\n\nOver the years, Ethereum has seen significant growth in terms of both its technology and its ecosystem, attracting a large developer community, partnerships with major corporations, and a growing number of decentralized applications. These factors have contributed to Ethereum\u2019s status as the second largest cryptocurrency and have solidified its position as a key player in the crypto space.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade is fast approaching\n\nEthereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade is a hard fork that is scheduled to occur in March 2023. Since the Merge in September 2022, validators have been extremely important to the Ethereum blockchain because they were required to lock away their ETH as well as any incentives they had earned until a later chain upgrade.\n\nValidators will be able to recover all of the ETH that they have staked as a result of the Shanghai hard fork, and they will potentially be able to get in line to retrieve their staked tokens and remove them from the system. Almost 14% of the ETH supply will be unlocked.\n\nA withdrawal queue has been created by Ethereum developers to avoid any selling pressure in the markets. Only six validators, each worth 32 ETH, are permitted to leave the network throughout each epoch. Therefore, a total of 1,350 validators are permitted to withdraw each day.\n\nIndicators\n\nDisclaimer: The information and publications are not intended to be and do not constitute financial advice, investment advice, trading advice or any other advice or recommendation of any sort offered or endorsed by Blockzeit. You should consider seeking a financial advisor to check how the website information relates to your unique circumstances.\n\nEthereum has successfully broken through the 200-day moving average resistance, and it is now hovering above it, indicating that traders have a bullish sentiment for the second biggest cryptocurrency.\n\nIn order for the bullish case for Ethereum to continue, it is necessary for the price to maintain its position above higher time frames. The longer a certain cryptocurrency\u2019s support has been maintained, the stronger the support is expected to be.\n\nShould you buy now or wait?\n\nOn a non-logarithmic scale, and by using the line chart to avoid wicks, Ethereum on the weekly can still retest the trendline as support of the falling wedge.\n\nEthereum will be making big moves in 2024 once the price has tested the line as support. The best course of action is to wait and make sure to set your buy orders in advance to catch massive dips in Q3-Q4 of 2023.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nBecause of Ethereum\u2019s robust developer community, creative usage of smart contracts, and position as a pioneer in the quickly expanding decentralized finance area, it is a fantastic investment opportunity independent of its price movement. With its capacity to run sophisticated decentralized apps, Ethereum has a large amount of room for expansion. Ethereum is a tempting investment opportunity for anyone wishing to enter the blockchain industry because of its distinctive characteristics and capabilities, which positions it well for long-term success as the blockchain ecosystem continues to develop and mature."

        "content": "Kava announced the launch of Kava 12, which aims to make its KAVA token deflationary.\n\nNEW DELHI (CoinChapter.com) \u2014 DeFi lending platform Kava underwent its 12th major upgrade on Feb 15, which it deemed as a \u201cgame changer for the Cosmos Ecosystem,\u201d bringing the \u201cdeveloper power of Ethereum\u201d to its blockchain network.\n\nThe much-awaited upgrade went live after being delayed multiple times in January this year. In its announcement, Kava Labs claimed that the upgrade would help DAOs on \u201cany Cosmos chain\u201d exert better control over their expenses.\n\nKava claimed the latest upgrade would be a game-changer.\n\nMoreover, the upgrade would help track Cosmos chain emissions flow. Kava\u2019s announcement shared that the new DAO structure would help channel the emissions into initiatives.\n\nHighlights Of The Kava 12 Upgrade\n\nWith the new upgrade, Kava would introduce a mechanism to hold Cosmos emissions in community pools. Moreover, the Kava DAO community pool would include a portfolio of assets instead of only the native KAVA tokens.\n\nA community pool backed by a portfolio of assets would likely help Kava DAO withstand changing market direction. The reliance on only one or a few particular assets led to the downfall of several crypto firms in 2022, and it seems Kava developers were taking notes.\n\nAdditionally, the crypto market\u2019s downturn in 2022 highlighted the impact of the lack of transparency in the sector. Likely inspired by the FTX collapse and its impact, Kava Labs announced that the new upgrade would increase the transparency of the network.\n\nWith Kava 12, users would have permanent access to a snapshot of the community pool portfolio\u2019s value.\n\nKava outlined changes in its community pool inflation and staking rewards in the latest upgrade.\n\nMeanwhile, Kava 12 will mint tokens for staking rewards and the community pool. In the previous version, the community pool depended on an abstract tax on the staking rewards and fee pool through the Authorization module.\n\nHowever, the latest upgrade would mean the new module would feed the community pool. As a result, the community pool would become a function of inflation and the total token supply. The authorization module would directly send rewards to validators.\n\nIs KAVA Becoming Deflationary?\n\nOne aspect of the latest upgrade that traders are talking about is the Kava developers\u2019 claim of making the KAVA token deflationary.\n\nThe Kava 12 upgrade would cap the total supply per the DAO\u2019s guidelines. Furthermore, the developers claimed that KAVA would become \u201cultimately deflationary.\u201d\n\nIt is very important for a top crypto ecosystem to be deflationary against the revenues it generates from demand of the products built on it. [\u2026] Kava DAO\u2019s new architecture is a big step in the direction of providing tools for all cosmos projects to achieve these goals Scott Stuart, Founder Kava Labs, said\n\nThe upgrade announcement highlighted that the DeFi lending platform could cap the maximum supply of KAVA tokens. This is because deflationary tokens have a limited supply, which means their price increases with demand.\n\nAdditionally, the upgrade would help KAVA staking become independent of token supply. Finally, kava developers claim that improved staking APY would make rewards \u201cmore predictable for the community.\u201c"

        "content": "RECOMMENDED FOREX BROKERS\n\nDo not invest more money than you can afford to lose.\n\nBroker Minimum Deposit Processing time FPMarkets $100 1 hour HFM $30 10 minutes OctaFX 0.03 ETH 30 minutes eToro $10 n/a Fusion Markets $1 n/a DukasCopy $100 n/a FxChoice $100 3 days Blueberry Markets $100 1 minute IronFX $100 n/a Evolve Markets 0.01 ETH n/a\n\nStop us if you\u2019ve heard this: cryptocurrencies are experiencing an unprecedented boom, and have become a convenient replacement for conventional cash. But did you know that ETH, one of the biggest crypto assets in circulation, is far more interesting that you though, and it might be a good idea to learn more about this digital coin, because by the looks of it Ethereum is just beginning to blossom.\n\nSo what is Ethereum? Technically, Ethereum is not the name of the cryptocurrency but namesake of the distribution software platform that is based on blockchain tech. ETH, or ether, is the platform\u2019s native cryptocurrency, which is bought and sold within the blockchain\u2019s matrix, and even though ETH is the supporting asset of the Ethereum network (it services the apps built within Ethereum ), many other digital coins can be used within Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem. Interactions within the network of Ethereum are called \u201ctransactions\u201d\n\nA defining feature of Ethereum is its limitless supply brough about by its inherent nature: it is a serviceable token designed as a practical assets as well as one that can bring in profit, without the risk of inflation decreasing or increasing its value.\n\nThe Ethereum platform is spread on computers all around the world, in what is consider a \u201cdecentralized\u201d network \u2013 otherwise referred to as the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) \u2013 , in which users are active life supporters, or \u201cnodes\u201d, essentially enabling the network to become immune to any sort of disruptive attacks or otherwise. The case can be summed up with the maxim \u201cthe whole is better than the one\u201d; as one computer shuts down due to benevolent actors, the Ethereum network remains virtually unscathed as thousands of other machines keep all systems up.\n\nEthereum came to be after Vitalik Buterin, of Russian-Canadian descent, started to notice flaws in Bitcoin\u2019s operations. More like shortcoming, Vitalik decided to build upon the Bitcoin ideal by expanding on its capabilities but at the same time focusing on his own project that would later become Ethereum.\n\nInitially in 2013 Vitalik came up with the idea of smart contracts \u2013 a programing method based on the fundamental axiom of \u201cif x, then y \u201c- that completely revolutionized decentralized operations by allowing just about anyone with a capable machine and computational knowledge to develop decentralized application within the Ethereum 1.0 network.\n\nWhile decentralized apps, or DApps, already existed, Buterin aimed to unify them under the same banner, that of Ethereum. A DApp is a program that runs on blockchain ware or a peer-to-peer network completely open-source under no one\u2019s jurisdiction, making is, essentially, decentralized. DApps can be any number of applications, from standards games to social media outlets, to utilizing and storing NFTs, and everything in between. Of course, the main usage of Ethereum\u2019s platform is to act as a payment mediator between transaction parties.\n\nIn Ethereum 1.0 there are no rules as there is no hierarchy of power to enforce inside regulations and control. Instead, all those individual \u201cnodes\u201d hold the power, shifting the governance system within Ethereum 1.0 into one of a pure democracy. Ether is the backbone of these operations, the currency that allows all processes to function within a certain consensus-based framework.\n\nOne of Ethereum\u2019s biggest use is to create the so-called \u201csmart contracts\u2019. It\u2019s what separates this crypto asset\u2019s environment from others, and is the \u201csecret sauce\u201d 0f the ETH network. Smart contracts are standardized systems within Ethereum that enable various processes to function and run smoothly. It\u2019s essentially an automated agreement that runs of four foundational pillars:\n\nA cryptographic voucher system enabling the creation of various systems and assets to be built on pre-existing blockchains.\n\nPeer-to-peer capabilities that form the matrix of ETH system-running computers, scratching the need for a central server. Most cryptocurrencies run on P2P networks.\n\nConsensus algorithms acting as decision making apparatus for the ETH blockchain, with every 15 seconds marking the endorsement of a new consent, generally one having to do with the addition of new blocks to be added to the blockchain tech.\n\nThe Turing virtual machine allows for complex and demanding processes to be smoothly performed on the ETH network, in turn increasing Ethereum\u2019s ability to handle \u201cheavier\u201d programs.\n\nEthereum is arguably the most advantageous of all crypto assets, with millions of users relying on it as a means of digital transfers. With Ethereum 2.0 coming (pilot phases have already been launched), this massively successful crypto system has deserved its spot as Bitcoin\u2019s main competition. ETH adoption has spread like wild fire, and many want in on the action. That\u2019s why big brokerage companies have rallied their engineers, their system administrators, and payment operators, all in the effort to make Ether a payment method. Here we have some of the best brokers offering ETH-based deposit and withdrawal methods.\n\nFPMARKETS\n\nFP Market might be one of the best brokers in the world today, and that is saying something when you consider how competitive things have gotten. This entity has it all, and one should look only at the ASIC and CySEC licenses to know for a fact that the firm is not only safe but abundant in options and features; there is a lot to do here. Moreover, the broker has a base of operation in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines which allows it to offer its services to markets in Kenya, Malaysia, and South Africa. On top of everything, the firm has a stable Canadian presence.\n\nEthereum/Ether Ether Minimum Deposit $100 Ether Minimum Withdrawal N/A Ether Deposit Fees system fees Ether Withdrawal Fees system fees Ether Deposit Process Time up to 1 hour Ether Withdraw Process Time up to 1 day\n\nIt was not a surprise that ETH payments were available as well, considering the sheer amount of options. Here the minimum deposit is $100 using ETH, and the only fees are those applicable by the blockchain system. Deposits using ETH take up to 1 hour to process. Withdrawals can take up to a 1 day to process, and withdrawal system fees apply there where need. Please note that the European branches of FP Markets don\u2019t allow for ETH payments.\n\nHFM\n\nThis is a major broker and one of the main global players in the FX market industry. It has been around for a while, which is a testament to its ability to endure and adapt to the ever changing market trends, not all of which are positive. And it has done so by sticking to a principle: to offer its services in a user friendly way, but also be a broker chuck full of things to do and see. HFM goes a long way, and one way to make sure of this is to consider its regulatory power. The broker holds a license from the UK\u2019s FCA, from CySEC, the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA), the Financial Sector Conduct Authority of South Africa (FSCA), the Financial Services Authority of Seychelles (FSA), and the Capital Markets Authority of Kenya (CMA).\n\nEthereum/Ether Ether Minimum Deposit $30 Ether Minimum Withdrawal $10 Ether Deposit Fees system fees Ether Withdrawal Fees system fees Ether Deposit Process Time 1o minutes Ether Withdraw Process Time 24 hours\n\nHowever, we are here for the Ethereum-based payments. The minimum ETH deposit requirement is just $30, with no fees attached to the transaction which take sup to 10 minutes to process.\n\nFor ETH withdrawals, the minimum to request is $10, and while there are no fees issued by the broker, there can potentially be system fees. It takes around 24 hours for a withdrawal request to get processed.\n\nOctaFX\n\nOctaFX is a great broker, an alterative to the huge brokerages that at times can seem quite intimidating both in scope and in sheer quantity of services, many of which can be neglected by users wishing to follow a simple path. OctaFX is here for you, but this entity is far from being simple. One thing that stands out here is the way it organizes its interface; and don\u2019t get us wrong, there is a lot to unravel here. The broker is fully regulated by CySEC, and has an offshore branch registered in Saint Vincent and the Grenadine through which OctaFX offers its services to developing trading communities in Nigeria, Malesia, and India.\n\nEthereum/Ether Ether Minimum Deposit 0.03 ETH Ether Minimum Withdrawal 0.005 ETH Ether Deposit Fees system fees Ether Withdrawal Fees system fees Ether Deposit Process Time 3 to 30 minutes Ether Withdraw Process Time up to 3 hours\n\nObviously OctaFX strives for a more progressive approach, evidences also by its inclusion of ETH-based payments. Here the minimum ETH deposit requirement is 0.03 ETH with applicable system fees. The deposit process takes some 3 to 30 minutes.\n\nThe minimum withdrawal is 0.005 ETH, and there are no fees, unless you count the system ones that differ from person to person based on jurisdiction. A withdrawal request can take up to 3 hours to process.\n\neToro\n\nOver the last couple of years eToro has really expanded, and has morphed into an impressive broker rivaling the bigger names of the industry. In part due to its savvy marketing campaign, and in part due to the broker\u2019s services themselves, eToro\u2019s current state is that of a massive and reputable FX broker that is reaching for the stars. With licenses from CySEC, the FCA, ASIC, and the Financial Services Authority Seychelles, it\u2019s obvious that this one eToro does not want to stop until it reaches the furthest edges of the world.\n\nEthereum/Ether Ether Minimum Deposit $10 Ether Minimum Withdrawal N/A Ether Deposit Fees conversion fees Ether Withdrawal Fees conversion fees, $5 per transaction Ether Deposit Process Time N/A Ether Withdraw Process Time N/A\n\nEthereum payments are part of its plan, and here the conditions are sublime. The minimum ETH deposit is just $10.\n\nThere is a withdrawal fee of $5 for each ETH transaction, and there are also conversion fees depending on the user\u2019s base currency.\n\nFusion Markets\n\nFusion Markets is a superb blend of new school broker aesthetic and a certain king of simplicity that not many brokers realize is a trend of value. Toped with some great trading services, and a double regulatory combo from both ASIC and the Vanuatu Financial Services Commission (VFSC), results in a broker that is definitely worth your time.\n\nEthereum/Ether Ether Minimum Deposit $1 Ether Minimum Withdrawal N/A Ether Deposit Fees system fees Ether Withdrawal Fees system fees Ether Deposit Process Time N/A Ether Withdraw Process Time N/A\n\nFusion Markets has said yes to ETH payments, and allows for both ETH-based deposits and withdrawals. There are no fees for wither withdrawals and deposits using Ether, if you don\u2019t count the ones applied by the payment systems. There is no minimum deposit requirement; it\u2019s only $1.\n\nDukasCopy\n\nDukasCopy is a Swiss broker, and that should be enough to convey the seriousness and severity of its operations, as Switzerland is the top European FX destination, and perhaps only second to the US on the global scale. DukasCopy is heavily regulated by the pedantic Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA), but is also approved by the Financial and Capital Market Commission of Latvia for offering service to Europeans, as well as a Financial Services Agency of Japan (JFSA) regulation for for Japanese users.\n\nEthereum/Ether Ether Minimum Deposit $100 Ether Minimum Withdrawal N/A Ether Deposit Fees system fees Ether Withdrawal Fees system fees Ether Deposit Process Time N/A Ether Withdraw Process Time N/A\n\nIt is a serious broker. And part of its operations are the availability of various crypto-based payment methods, including ETH. The minimum deposit requirement is $100, and the only fees here are those issued by the payment systems themselves.\n\nFXChoice\n\nFXChoice is another sublime broker that pretty much covers all the basic necessities and then some. It is particularly useful to users wishing to experience a more docile FX trading environment, as the broker has made sure to simplify everything and arrange it in an accessible manner. However, unlike others, FXChoice has not sacrificed practicality and abundance for accessibility; the broker is filled with opportunities for both novice and pro users. It holds a license from the Financial Services Commission of Belize (FSC), but is registered in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.\n\nEthereum/Ether Ether Minimum Deposit $100 Ether Minimum Withdrawal N/A Ether Deposit Fees 0.5% per transaction Ether Withdrawal Fees system fees Ether Deposit Process Time N/A Ether Withdraw Process Time up to 3 days\n\nAll ETH deposits are charged a 0.5% deposit fee, where the minimum amount to invest is $100. Withdrawals take up to 3 days to process, and there are payment fees issued by the systems not by FXChoice.\n\nBlueberryMarkets\n\nAs one of Australia\u2019s most popular, and definitely more unique, FX brands, BlueberryMarkets is like that friend that never ceases to amaze with his radiant positivity and charm. This one might have moved on, but BlueberryMarkets stays with you for good. We have known BlueberryMarkets for a long time, and each time is seems to have evolved for the better. This broker has everything you have being looking for, like ETH-based payments. And it is all kept stable with its ASIC and Securities Commission of the Bahamas regulations.\n\nEthereum/Ether Ether Minimum Deposit $100 Ether Minimum Withdrawal $50 Ether Deposit Fees no fees Ether Withdrawal Fees system fees Ether Deposit Process Time instant Ether Withdraw Process Time N/A\n\nThe minimum deposit using ETH is $100, it is processed instantly and there are no payment fees. The minimum withdrawal amount is $50, with attached system fees.\n\nIronFX\n\nSometimes it\u2019s good to be an accessible broker. This is the guiding philosophy of IronFX, but it takes it up a notch by including countless options, all of which feel just advanced enough to suit all users. In this way, IronFX is quite a surprise in just how good it is and how accessible it is. Add to that the CySEC regulation, and what you get is a superb broker.\n\nEthereum/Ether Ether Minimum Deposit $50 Ether Minimum Withdrawal N/A Ether Deposit Fees no fees Ether Withdrawal Fees no fees Ether Deposit Process Time N/A Ether Withdraw Process Time N/A\n\nNot to mention that ETH payments are available. The minimum deposit requirement is $50 using ETH, and there are no payment fees.\n\nEvolveMarkets\n\nEvolveMarkets has it going. In the right direction at that. It\u2019s simple to use, as the interface it opens to users is perhaps the most accessible one we have seen. And that is just the start of it. Here we can apply the \u201cdon\u2019t judge the book by its cover\u201d saying, since at first sight IronFX seems quite simple, but as soon as you explore its many sides you understand how well it adapted itslef to current needs. Even without a current regulation, EvolveMarkets is definitely worth a shot.\n\nEthereum/Ether Ether Minimum Deposit 0.01 ETH Ether Minimum Withdrawal 0.01 ETH Ether Deposit Fees no fees Ether Withdrawal Fees no fees Ether Deposit Process Time N/A Ether Withdraw Process Time N/A\n\nEthereum payments are made simple. The minimum deposit using ETH is 0.01, while the minimum for the withdrawal is also 0.01 ETH. There are no fees; all system fees are covered by the broker."
