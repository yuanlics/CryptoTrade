        "title": "3 Crypto Stocks to Watch in the 2023 Ethereum Rally - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "While Bitcoin (BTC) had a great first half of 2023, so did another crypto coin Ethereum (ETH). Ethereum, which trails only Bitcoin in the crypto world, is known for its uses as a blockchain-powered, open-ended decentralized software platform.\n\nSince the \u201ccrypto winter\u201d of 2022, the network completed a significant update, known as the Shanghai Upgrade, under which it shifted its blockchain validation system from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, and marked one of the most significant developments in the relatively small history of cryptocurrency.\n\nUnder the proof-of-stake system, miners of Ethereum will rely on Ether holders who will act as validators, thus lending more assurance to the system. In essence, proof-of-stake allows holders of Ether to lock up their funds as collateral to validate transactions and create new blocks, reducing the need for extensive computation and energy consumption.\n\nPowered by this development and what has largely been hailed as a crypto rebound, the price of Ethereum has soared in 2023, going up 54.9% year to date, as of Jul 25. In this endeavor, it lags behind Bitcoin, which has gone up 76.4% in the same period. But one must remember that while Bitcoin is primarily a digital currency, Ethereum is a programmable blockchain platform. Ethereum\u2019s blockchain has a reputation for being highly versatile and adept in building complex applications.\n\nHistorically, a state of fast-rising interest rates has not proven conducive to the crypto market. However, a recent spate of data, which showed cooling inflation and market speculation that the Fed might be ending its hawkish monetary policy stance soon, means that things are looking up again for the sector.\n\nSo, with a \u201ccrypto spring\u201d in the offing and Ethereum already starting to make good of the state of the market, it might be prudent to keep a watch on stocks exposed to this open-source, decentralized blockchain platform.\n\nAccenture plc ACN: This global system integrator, which provides consulting, technology and other services, markets Ethereum-based blockchain solutions to businesses to make it easier to process payments.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccenture\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 8.2%.

        "content": "Since last quarter, Ethereum layer-2s have witnessed vastly more activity than Ethereum mainnet, marking a significant increase compared to last year.\n\nThe average total transactions per second (TPS) of those chains seeking to scale Ethereum stood at roughly 45.3 \u2014 four times greater than Ethereum\u2019s 11.91 TPS, data shows.\n\nNow that multiple layer-2 rollups have come online, activity is 287% busier than a year ago. There are now more than 20 separate L-2 networks built atop Ethereum, all aiming to improve scalability and efficiency, reducing the cost per transaction.\n\nThe amount of computational resources, known as \u201cgas,\u201d used on the Ethereum network every month to validate and settle transactions taking place on L-2s also remains elevated this year.\n\nL-2 growth appears to be concentrated around airdrop farming transactions Sam Holman, derivatives analyst at Australian trading firm Zerocap, told Blockworks. Airdrop farming is a process where users perform certain actions to be eligible to receive free tokens.\n\n\u201cIf you look into the specific chains the volumes have increased on, you\u2019ll see [zkSync] Era and also Polygon [zkEVM] having an elevated contribution, as well as Optimism.\u201d\n\nA notable uptick in L-2 volume was also observed following Arbitrum\u2019s airdrop in March, as airdrop hunters migrated from there to zkSync speculating on the eventual debut of a native token to reward early adopters.\n\nUsers transacting on Optimism are primarily doing so via platforms like Uniswap V3 and Stargate, DappRadar daily volume data shows.\n\nAs it stands, Stargate, a LayerZero bridge and airdrop candidate, has about seven times more active users though only around half of the volume of Uniswap. Holman pointed to users cycling through different addresses, repeating the same transactions, to inflate their chances of getting a higher airdrop allocation.\n\n\u201cI would put down the consistent volume through Stargate to farmers trying to be eligible for the LayerZero token,\u201d Holman said. \u201cIt\u2019s the cheapest chain to bridge funds on and a lot of the market seems to think the number of transactions will be a primary criterion for a LayerZero airdrop.\u201d\n\nLayerZero CEO Bryan Pellegrino recently told Blockworks\u2019 0xResearch podcast that, in his view, airdrop hunting was not a dominant factor, but perhaps accounts for around 54% of the volume.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t spend too much time thinking about it \u2014 ultimately it\u2019s something that\u2019s outside of my control,\u201d Pellegrino said. \u201cRight now, if 98% of the volume was [airdrop farmers] it would still be the most used bridge in the world by a factor of like 4.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "A closely followed strategist is predicting that one Ethereum (ETH) rival will repeat the competitor\u2019s parabolic rally from the last crypto cycle.\n\nPseudonymous analyst The Flow Horse, also known as Cantering Clark, tells his 179,700 Twitter followers that Solana (SOL) is mirroring the price action of ETH before a massive move to the upside.\n\n\u201cIn a private group (can\u2019t dox Excel chart of picks or people), my pick for the best-performing coin of the bounce this year was SOL. The idea that a darling of the last cycle would do very well. I shared this chart of the beginnings of ETH vs. SOL, and I still think SOL probably does more or less the same. The cheering got pretty loud for this one.\u201d\n\nAccording to his chart, SOL\u2019s recent price action to the $27 level mirrors ETH\u2019s sudden move to $280 in 2020. ETH then went on a parabolic rally, which he says SOL will likely mirror as well.\n\nSolana is trading for $25.23 at time of writing, up 8.7% during the last 24 hours.\n\nThe trader also weighs in on Bitcoin (BTC) and ETH and says that the top two performing digital assets are in an uptrend with most investors taking long positions and accumulating.\n\n\u201cI think I have probably beat this drum during every stream, and weekly here on Twitter now for the last six months. The view around BTC, ETH, and a handful of others is much longer now. Spot bags are built and there are no outright shorts. Everything short is trading around a core position.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is trading for $29,459 at time of writing, up 0.8% in the last 24 hours, while Ethereum is worth $1,868, up 0.4% in the last 24 hours.\n\nAlso on the trader\u2019s radar is the declining market cap of stablecoins, which indicates a decline in liquidity in the overall crypto markets.\n\nHe says that the market cap of stablecoins will likely start to increase either when there is an approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) or the halving event expected in April of next year when miners\u2019 rewards are cut in half.\n\n\u201cCryptos own money supply.

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction: Buy Signal With 78% Accuracy Flashes - NewsBTC",
        "content": "After Ethereum (ETH) once again failed to break the $2,000 level in the 1-day chart, the price has been on a downward slide in recent days. However, this could now change, as a historically accurate trend indicator shows.\n\nCrypto traders and analysts constantly seek reliable indicators to navigate the turbulent market. One such indicator gaining attention is the Tom Demark 9 (TD9), which has flashed a buy signal for Ethereum (ETH) on the daily chart. Renowned analyst Joe McCann shared his insights via Twitter, revealing an intriguing success rate of 78% for ETH\u2019s historical TD9 buy signals.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Buy Signal\n\nJoe McCann\u2019s tweet brought the spotlight on ETHUSD\u2019s TD9 buy signal, which occurred after the asset dropped 8.7% from its recent high. The TD9 indicator, an indicator that also measures whether an asset is overbought or oversold, similar to the RSI, aims to identify potential trend reversals. According to McCann, historical data showcases the TD9 buy signal\u2019s remarkable accuracy for ETH, with a win rate of nearly 78%.\n\nPossible price targets include the July open at $1,933, the August 2022 bear market rally high at $2,031, and the year-to-date 2021 high at $2,142, according to the analyst.\n\nDigging deeper into the data, McCann highlights the impressive performance of ETH following TD9 buy signals. The statistics reveal that, on average, the asset surged by over 2.6% in the seven days following the signal, with a median return of almost 5%. These figures alone could pique the interest of traders looking for an edge in the crypto market.\n\nTo provide a more nuanced picture, McCann narrowed the data to examine the year 2019, a period he deems analogous to the 2023 crypto market cycle. The results are even more captivating, showing a remarkable win rate of nearly 90% for TD9 buy signals during this period.\n\nHowever, if we trim the data back to starting in 2019 (a year very similar to 2023 in terms of crypto market cycles), ETH has a win rate of nearly 90% with the average return over +7%.\n\nBut, as with any indicator, there are exceptions and occasional inaccuracies. McCann\u2019s data shows several instances where the TD9 buy signal failed to predict ETH\u2019s price movement accurately.\n\nNoteworthy is March 13, 2018, when the ETH price slid massively after the buy signal. The ETH price plummeted by 19.3% within seven days and by as much as 34.8% within the next 14 days. The signal was similarly bad on May 8, 2018, after which ETH fell by 22.1% in the following seven days and 26.7% in the following 14 days.\n\nOn the other hand, the TD9 buy signal has predicted some massive rallies. For example, on December 10, 2018, following the signal, ETH initially rose by 3.7% in the first seven days, but then came a fabulous 53.0% rise in 14 days and 64.5% in 30 days. The most recent TD9 buy signal on March 11, 20223 delivered a price increase of 18.8% in the first seven days and 29.9% after 30 days.\n\nIn general, it can be seen that the accuracy of the TD9 indicator decreases over time. While the indicator has a success rate of 78% in the first seven days with an average 7-day forward return of +2.65% and a median return of almost 5%, the success rate falls in the subsequent period of time. After 14 days, the TD9 indicator has a success rate of only 55.5% (mean 3.8%, median 5.7%), after 30 days of 63.0% (mean 6.9%, median 3.8%) since 2018.\n\nFederal Reserve Meeting Looms\n\nWhile the TD9 buy signal paints a positive picture for ETH, the crypto market remains vulnerable to external factors, including the upcoming FOMC meeting today. There is a 98.9% probability that there will be a 25 basis point rate hike. But the big question is whether this will be the last hike in this cycle. McCann writes:\n\nJuly 26th is the latest meeting of the Federal Reserve and Jerome Powell is expected to hike rates another 25 bps. Will Jerome Powell ruin the party for the ETH bulls at the press conference?\n\nAt press time, the Ether (ETH) price stood at $1,859.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIn spite of crypto\u2019s enduring winter and the ever-spiraling NFT market, on-chain generative artwork has seen something of a renaissance in the last year. Now, a new platform with a major backer aims to take on the stalwarts of the space.\n\nLed by boutique, curatorial collectives like Art Blocks and globe-trotting experiential collections like Bright Moments, generative art pieces\u2014digital works created by computer code, that are only realized in their final form by a randomized generation that takes place at the time of minting\u2014continue to fetch record prices and regale art world elites.\n\nMuch of the generative art movement\u2019s success has thus far stemmed from projects associated with a certain level of curatorial authority and exclusivity. Highlight, a digital art marketplace and artist tool suite debuting today, aims to shift that paradigm.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n48 hours until our Ethereum-based generative art platform is open for all Our genesis project, \u201cSum\u201d by @DuaneKing, is an onchain SVG representation of your unique wallet address It pushes all the boundaries of what generative art and personal identity mean for Ethereum\ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/xlkPKfBfX1 \u2014 Highlight (@Highlight_xyz) July 24, 2023\n\nIt claims to be the first-ever \u201copen access\u201d generative art platform launched on the Ethereum blockchain. The company, which is backed by prominent venture fund Haun Ventures and raised $11 million in 2022 with the broader aim of launching no-tool Web3 tools for creators, says it has created a platform that will do away with many barriers to entry across the generative art ecosystem.\n\n\u201cAll the tools that exist on Ethereum at this point, they're not open access,\u201d Highlight co-founder and CEO Nathaniel Emodi told Decrypt. \u201cThere are different levels of curation or gatekeeping. To us, that was a screaming opportunity.\u201d\n\nUnlike leading platform Art Blocks, which carefully curates the generative artists it spotlights for its most prominent collection\u2014but also has secondary categories with less stringent requirements\u2014Highlight will be entirely free to use and list on by any member of the public.\n\nSimon De Mai, an artist who has launched projects on Art Blocks and will also release work via Highlight, told Decrypt that the upstart's model is a welcome shift from the norm.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"Releasing a project on Art Blocks today is an exciting but very challenging process, and they are very selective,\" he said. \"New platforms like Highlight offer open access; artists are free to experiment and start their own projects in a more autonomous way and with less financial risk. I\u2019m happy to see that this sense of openness is still present today, as it will definitely lead to a richer digital art landscape.\"\n\nMost leading generative art platforms also charge artists a creator fee. Art Blocks, for example, levies a 10% fee on its artists for primary NFT sales, and a 2.5% fee for secondary sales. Highlight, by contrast, will request no such fee from artists who use its services. Instead, the site will generate revenue from a small fee charged to buyers.\n\nHighlight will also provide users with a suite of tools designed to streamline and simplify the process of creating generative artworks, which can be fairly technical and involved. These tools, said Emodi, will simplify a process that could easily take an artist weeks or months to complete independently and reduce it down to minutes.\n\nIn addition to the Ethereum mainnet, Highlight will also support scaling networks that typically enable cheaper transactions\u2014such as Polygon, Arbitrum, OP Mainnet (or Optimism), Zora Network, and Coinbase's upcoming Base.\n\nThe first project launching on Highlight today is \"Sum\" by artist Duane King, also creative director for the startup, with the pieces resembling rainbow-colored bullseye targets. But there's more than meets the eye: the colors and characteristics of each generated work are drawn from the minter's Ethereum wallet address string and other on-chain details.\n\n\"With 'Sum,' we wanted to flip the idea of scarcity on its head and instead focus on abundance,\" reads a post by King. \"Abundance is a more appropriate representation of the diversity within the blockchain community and more fitting for the medium of long-form generative.\"\n\nAn example of artwork from Holger Lippmann's upcoming collection, \"Fractal Tapestries.\" Image: Holger Lippmann/Highlight\n\nDespite the fact that Highlight\u2019s raison-d\u2019\u00eatre appears decidedly populist, the platform is also partnering with a number of established generative artists who will debut new collections on the site this summer. Several of those artists, including De Mai, Melissa Wiederrecht, Emanuele Pasin, and James Merrill, have previously launched projects on Art Blocks.\n\nA number of those artists gave input directly to Highlight\u2019s team during the platform\u2019s construction, regarding what they would want out of a generative art platform crafted to their needs.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPer Emodi, several artists requested a loosening of restrictions around the type of code able to be used in a generative art piece. Highlight obliged; now, artists on the site will be able to experiment with sound, image files, and several other types of media that have not yet found their way into the generative art mainstream.\n\n\u201cAll of those things are outside of the existing definition of generative art, but it's art that these artists want to create,\u201d Emodi said. \u201cWe think that will push the definition of generative art forward. And that\u2019s really healthy.\u201d\n\nEditor's note: This article was updated after publication to include comment from artist Simon De Mai."

        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin price maintains an overall uptrend with critical support at $29,000 as the FOMC decision comes as expected.\n\nEthereum price requires a substantial push to surpass $1,873 and break from below the 50-day EMA foothold.\n\nRipple price faces initial resistance at $0.7237 (50-day EMA) with pullback potential on the three-hour chart.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price continues to hover above Monday's low at $28,830, not giving traders an opportunity to get in on the recovery rally. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting failed to induce volatility as chairman Jerome Powell hinted at meeting-by-meeting decisions based on data. This sentiment is shared for Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) prices, flashing green with lean margins. The meager surges come as Fed Chairman Jerome Powell committed to a data-dependent approach to interest rate hikes. Despite a sell-off in the US Dollar, Bitcoin price remains rangebound, with little volatility post-FOMC.\n\nMacroeconomics priced in\n\nThe little volatility witnessed in the crypto market, pre and post-FOMC, shows that the macroeconomics had already been priced. Notably, traders anticipated the 0.25% rate hike. Since markets tend to react to developments that investors were not expecting, Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s comments today did not move the market. Now crypto has fallen back to regular programming, driven by natural or plain buying and selling activity.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin and crypto market unphased as FOMC commits to a meeting-by-meeting approach.\n\nBitcoin Price finds support following FOMC report\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price on the four-chart exhibits an ascending broadening wedge pattern.

Despite the current support, the overall uptrend remains intact.\n\nTraders should closely monitor the ascending support trendline, which is crucial in determining future price action. However, a bearish scenario may come into play if the price breaks down below the ascending support trendline; the same trendline then acts as a resistance. This would signal a potential trend reversal and indicate a shift from a bullish to bearish market sentiment.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nIn the event of a breakdown below the trendline, the next important support level for Bitcoin price is $28,452, standing 2.93% below the current price level. A breach of this support may lead to further downside momentum. However, it is worth noting that the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) histograms have just crossed above the zero line, indicating a recent increase in buying activity, albeit with limited volume.\n\nAlso Read: Federal Reserve raises interest rates by 25 bps, Bitcoin price floats above $29,000\n\nEthereum price faces consolidation as indicators flash bearish\n\nEthereum (ETH) price for the daily timeframe indicates prices falling below the 50-EMA and encountering resistance at the 38% Fibonacci Retracement level at $1,873. A break and close above this level could potentially change the trend, but technical indicators suggest this is unlikely in the short term. The Awesome Oscillators (AO) histograms show bearish pressure with a red color below the zero line, and the RSI is moving in the middle.\n\nETH/USD 1-Day Chart\n\nCurrently, support is at the 50% Retracement level at $1,827, approximately 1.7% below the current price level. The market seems to be consolidating within the $1,827 and $1,873 range, as the 25 bps rate hike decision of the FOMC has already been priced in.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum classic is looking for more gains\n\nRipple price faces possible pullback - break and close above 25-EMA\n\nRipple (XRP) price on the three-hour chart reveals that the remittance token is encountering initial resistance at $0.7128, coinciding with the position of the 25-EMA. A decisive breakthrough and subsequent close above this level could pave the way for further price gains toward the subsequent resistance at $0.7754.\n\nHowever, the crossover of the higher 50-EMA below the 25-EMA indicates a bearish sentiment, possibly leading to a prolonged consolidation period. In this case, the initial support lies at $0.6673.\n\nXRP/USD 3-hour chart\n\nNonetheless, there are indications of buying pressure as depicted by the AO Oscillator histograms displaying green bars, accompanied by the Relative Strength Index (RSI) trending higher. These factors suggest some positive momentum in XRP price movement in the short run. Traders should wait for any closing above $0.7128 to enter long.\n\nAlso Read: SEC vs. Ripple update: Pro crypto lawyer outlines four options for the regulator to fight the XRP ruling"

Within a fortnight, the Ethereum price has plunged from a high of $2028 to a current price of $1862, registering a 7.8% loss. Amid this downfall, the coin price also breached the support trendline of the megaphone pattern suggesting further downfall in ETH.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Price Charts Signals 18% Upside; Liquid Staking Hits ATH in 2023\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Price Daily Chart\n\nThe strong support of the rising trendline could offer buyers an opportunity to rebound.\n\nThe Ethereum Fear and Greed index at 46% reflect a neutral sentiment among traders\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $4.13 Billion, indicating a 36% loss.\n\nSource- Tradingview\n\nFor over a month, the Ethereum price showcased a silent recovery within the divergence trendline of the Megaphone pattern. This pattern formation is a sign of uncertainty and increasing volatility among market participants.\n\nWith the recent downturn in the crypto market, the ETH price breached the support trendline of the aforementioned pattern on July 22nd. This crackdown flipped significant support into a potential resistance that sellers can use to pressurize the coin price lower.\n\nIf the coin sellers manage to sustain this breakdown, the altcoin price could fall 4-5% to reset the ascending trendline at $1775. This trendline currently maintains the overall uptrend in the second-largest cryptocurrency and offers a dip opportunity to interested buyers.\n\nCan ETH Price Regain Bullish Momentum?\n\nTaking a look at the bigger picture, the rising channel pattern is leading to an uptrend in Ethereum price. In the last eight months, the price retest to the lower trendline of this pattern has bolstered buyers with bullish momentum to create a new high of 2023. Thus, the crypto holders must keep a watch on the support trendline of signs of a reversal to catch the next recovery cycle.\n\nRelative Strength Index: The daily RSI slope below 50% reflects a weakening bullish momentum\n\nExponential Moving Average: The 200-day EMA walking along with a lower trendline increases the support strength of the channel pattern."

For more discussion on the potential Fed and USD scenarios, see \u201cUS Dollar Scenarios Ahead of Fed Rate Decision: EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY Price Setups,\u201d published July 26.\n\nBTC/USD Weekly Chart\n\nChart Created by Manish Jaradi Using TradingView\n\nBITCOIN: Still looking for the bullish break\n\nBTC/USD has struggled to break past a key converged barrier at the April high of around 31000, coinciding with the 89-week moving average and the upper edge of the Ichimoku cloud on the weekly chart. The back-to-back small body candles in recent weeks are a sign of indecision, given the significance of the resistance. A break above the barrier would be a strong signal that the medium-term bearish pressure is fading. Such a move could open the door toward 40000.\n\nBTC/USD 240-Minute Chart\n\nChart Created by Manish Jaradi Using TradingView\n\nHaving said that, near-term technical charts suggest BTC/USD may have to wait a bit longer for the bullish move to ensue. On the 240-minute charts, BTC/USD has fallen below the 200-period moving average, and key support on the lower edge of a sideway channel since late June, potentially opening the door toward 28000 in the near term.

However, it hasn\u2019t broken any significant support either to suggest the rebound from the end of 2022 is over. In this regard, the June low of 1620 is crucial support \u2013 ETH/USD needs to hold above this support for the broader upward trajectory to remain intact.\n\nETH/USD 240-Minute Chart\n\nChart Created by Manish Jaradi Using TradingView\n\nIn the near term, though, ETH/USD has a tough cushion on a horizontal trendline from late June at about 1815.

        "content": "Linea Mainnet Appears on Metamask: What is it, and Why is it There?\n\nThose with a keen eye, and a nose for the curious, may have noticed a small but significant update to their Metamask wallets. When selecting a desired chain, an additional option has been quietly added to the list by default, but what is the Linea Mainnet on Metamask, and why is it there?\n\nIn essence, Linea Mainnet is an Ethereum virtual machine compliant layer 2 scaling solution designed for developers, and optimized for decentralized applications (dApps). It uses the latest zero knowledge roll up technology, which effectively bundles up large volumes of transactions off-chain, then executes that \u2018rollup\u2019 in a single transaction. As a result, it is able to perform tasks at much greater speeds, while costing a fraction of the transaction (gas) fees.\n\n1/\n\n\ud83d\ude80Linea's Mainnet Alpha launch has been incredible! Over $20m bridged and 670k transactions in under a week, thanks to our amazing community's support. As a result of the excitement, Ethereum withdrawal times have temporarily increased. \ud83e\uddf5 \u2014 Linea (@LineaBuild) July 24, 2023\n\nWhy is Linea Mainnet Automatically added to the Metamask Wallet\n\nTo get to the bare bones of why Linea Mainnet is there, you need to take a look under the hood. A quick investigation into the new chain reveals that it has come from ConsenSys, the developer responsible for the Metamask wallet.\n\nAs the Ethereum network has expanded, incorporating an ever-growing number of projects and use cases, its blockchain has inevitably faced a surge in congestion. The immense volume of transactions it handles can lead to a significant rise in gas fees, making them skyrocket during periods of high activity. However, a practical solution to this issue lies in the implementation of a layer 2 chain, like Linea. By seamlessly integrating with Ethereum, Linea effectively alleviates the strain on the network and substantially reduces transaction costs.\n\nWhat will Linea Mainnet Mean for Metamask Users\n\nThrough Linea, ConsenSys aims to reduce the burden on Ethereum so that dApps can run more efficiently. By developing a dedicated chain specifically for the purpose, the team has built the infrastructure to easily port existing dApps onto the new chain, while also providing the tools for new projects to launch using the Linea system.\n\nFor the end user, this simply means that Linea will allow them to interact with the dApps operating on its mainnet, with greater efficiency, and fewer fees. As a result, Linea estimates that its system will process transactions at a cost of approximately 15 times less than the equivalent on Ethereum mainnet.\n\nLinea, is not the only zk rollup in town, with competition coming in form the likes of Polygon and Immutable, among others. The general consensus however, is that this new generation of layer 2 blockchains represent the future of the Ethereum network. For NFTs, it will effectively mean that games and collections can conduct large volumes of traffic, without leaving community members out of pocket.\n\nWant more?

        "content": "Bitcoin and other crypto tokens were trading higher on Thursday after the US Federal Reserve announced that it will increase the interest rates by 25 basis points, which was on the expected lines. However, the US central lender said that it is open to push rates again, if need be, which capped the gains in the digital assets.\n\n\n\nBitcoin extended its gains on Thursday as the largest crypto token added as much as a per cent but remained below 29,500-mark. However, Its largest peer, Ethereum outperformed and gained more than a per cent but it also remained below $1,900-levels. Price in the action altcoins was on the higher side.\n\n\n\nAfter the US Federal Reserve raised its interest rates by 25 basis points, as anticipated by the market, most cryptocurrencies experienced a slight increase. This rate hike was the highest since 2001, said Edul Patel, Co-founder and CEO at Mudrex.\n\n\n\n\"Bitcoin, which had dipped to a low of $29,097 on Tuesday, has now shown signs of recovery and is trading above the $29,400 mark. However, to fend off the aggressive bears, the bulls need to drive the price back up and maintain it above the $31,000 threshold. Meanwhile, Ethereum was observed being traded at the $1,870 level,\" he said.\n\n\n\nBarring a few exceptions, all other top crypto tokens were trading higher on Thursday. Solana surged about 6 per cent, while Polygon and Bitcoin Cash added 3 per cent each. Cardano, Litcoin and Polkadot rose 2 per cent each for the day. Among the laggards, Toncoin shed 4 per cent and Dogecoin was down over 2 per cent each.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading quite higher, rising down to $1.19 trillion-mark as it gained about a per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes jumped more than 16 per cent to $30.56 billion.\n\n\n\nBitcoin has remained relatively stagnant, stuck below the $30,000 level, primarily due to apprehension surrounding the Federal Reserve's upcoming decision on rate hike, which is widely expected to include a 25-basis point. Bitcoin investment products suffered a $13 million outflow last week, said CoinDCX Research Team.\n\n\n\n\"XRP has emerged as the most traded altcoin of 2023 so far, with a record-breaking $150 billion trading volume. The crypto has benefited from the recent court ruling that it is not a security, capturing the attention of traders worldwide and signaling a potential shift in how crypto assets are perceived and regulated,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nTech View by WazirX Trade Desk\n\nClover Finance, also known as Clover, functions as a blockchain operating system that offers a comprehensive and user-friendly blockchain infrastructure. It includes a framework compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) for Substrate-based applications, providing a convenient all-in-one solution.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the weekly time period, the CLV/USDT trend has broken out of the descending triangle pattern with a jump in trading volumes. The token has gained over 2% in the last 24 hours. The price is expected to have a positive trajectory in the coming days. The next resistance is expected at $0.57 and an immediate support is expected at $0.36 levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

Discover SCENE\n\nApparel brand Lacoste is opening up a new virtual store for the summer. Created by retail technology developer Emperia, the digital rendition combines a more traditional immersive retail experience with elements exclusive to holders of Lacoste\u2019s UNDW3 NFT passes.\n\nUNDW3 (pronounced \u201cunderwater\u201d) is the name of the French brand\u2019s NFT-based loyalty program. The virtual store experience is accessed via Lacoste\u2019s standard e-commerce platform. After entering via the mouth of the brand\u2019s emblematic crocodile, shoppers can explore a tiled boutique before taking the elevator up to an outdoor pool area overlooking a beach.\n\nPieces from Lacoste\u2019s summer apparel collection are available for purchase throughout, and visitors can also participate in a crocodile-themed scavenger hunt game.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA screenshot from Lacoste's new virtual store. Image: Lacoste/Emperia\n\nHolders of Lacoste\u2019s UNDW3 tokens on Ethereum can access an additional underwater VIP space, which can be unlocked either by an email login or by connecting a digital wallet containing the token.\n\nFor sale in the VIP space is an exclusive UNDW3 apparel collection, made for and co-created in March by Lacoste\u2019s UNDW3 community members. Each physical garment comes with its own digital twin as an NFT, plus an augmented reality (AR) feature accessed by scanning a QR code.\n\nAn exclusive extra level of the scavenger hunt game also plays out in the member space, with the opportunity to win prizes every week during the summer-long activation.\n\n\u201cOur ongoing work with Lacoste and its advanced view of e-commerce and customer loyalty has given birth to new technologies that yield an improved user journey which connects the dots between virtual and physical retail,\u201d Emperia co-founder and CEO Olga Dogadkina said in a statement.\n\nIn fact, this is the second shoppable activation that Emperia has built for Lacoste. The first, which launched in December 2022 and also involved a token-gated gamified element for UNDW3 holders, went on to win a Webby Award in May.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEarlier this year, Emperia developed a virtual experience for L\u2019Occitane, which showcased the French beauty brand's retail universe and spotlighted ingredients and best-selling products. Visitors could take a bicycle ride through the lavender fields of Provence and fly over Corsica in a hot air balloon.\n\nThe tech company has previously worked with Bloomingdale\u2019s, Burberry, Christie\u2019s, and Dior as well.\n\nA screenshot from Lacoste's new virtual store. Image: Lacoste/Emperia\n\nAfter launching its Web3 loyalty program UNDW3 in 2022, Lacoste rolled out the second phase in June. The brand evolved its genesis NFT pass into a new dynamic token, and introduced a gated community platform where holders can chalk up rewards by participating in interactive games and fashion design challenges.\n\nThe fashion challenges take place in close collaboration with Lacoste\u2019s physical studio, and members can leverage 3D and AI-based tools. Points tallies are displayed on a leaderboard on the site, and those who achieve the highest scores can win prizes such as a week with Lacoste in Paris, or the chance to represent the UNDW3 community via a social media campaign."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nWorldcoin launched to much fanfare on Monday\u2014but Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin has identified four \"major issues\" with the project's design.\n\nFounded by Sam Altman\u2014the CEO of OpenAI\u2014the company is offering a \"digital passport\" that allows owners to prove they're human, and not a bot. This is achieved through the use of Orbs, machines that scan a person's eyeball to create a World ID.\n\nIn a lengthy new blog post, Buterin argues that an effective, reliable proof-of-personhood system, like Worldcoin, \"seems very valuable,\" but warns there are big risks in the race to develop one.\n\nThe Ethereum co-founder's first concern relates to privacy\u2014and the act of scanning someone's iris. Buterin fears this could capture much more data than meets the eye, including a person's sex, ethnicity and even certain medical conditions.\n\nPerhaps Buterin's most practical argument concerns accessibility\u2014and how likely it's going to be that everyone who wants a World ID can get one.\n\nThe latest figures from Worldcoin suggest 1,500 Orbs will be available in 35 global cities as the year progresses\u2014helping the total number of weekly registrations surge from 40,000 people a week to 200,000.\n\nOverall, it estimates that two million have already signed up for a World ID.\n\nSuggesting that sign-ups could plateau quickly, Buterin wrote: \"While there are billions of smartphones, there are only a few hundred Orbs. Even with much higher-scale distributed manufacturing, it would be hard to get to a world where there's an Orb within five kilometers of everyone.\"\n\nIf Orbs do become prolific, he believes the headaches wouldn't stop here. He pointed out that there's nothing to stop a government from banning Orbs in their country\u2014or using this technology to coerce citizens.\n\nButerin issues centralization, security concerns\n\nButerin's third concern centers on centralization\u2014a pejorative for crypto projects the world over.\n\nIn his blog, he points out that Orbs are hardware devices where backdoors could be installed into the system\u2014allowing malicious manufacturers to create many bogus human identities.\n\n\"If even one Orb manufacturer is malicious or hacked, it can generate an unlimited number of fake iris scan hashes, and give them World IDs,\" Buterin warned.\n\nWhile Worldcoin vows to perform regular audits on Orbs to ensure they are built correctly, Buterin is calling for the project to ensure that World IDs generated with different manufacturers are distinguishable from one another. He believes this could weed out malicious activity, adding: \"If we see the North Korean government going around and forcing people to scan their eyeballs, those Orbs and any accounts produced by them could be immediately retroactively disabled.\"\n\nFinally, he warned about security\u2014but stressed this affects all proof-of-personhood systems and not just Worldcoin.\n\nHe believes an \"unlimited amount of identities\" could be generated if Orbs mistakenly approve the irises of AI-generated photographs or 3D prints of fake people. There's also a danger of someone selling on or renting their World ID to someone else\u2014or losing it after a phone hacking.\n\nButerin argues that, while there could be some solutions to all of his concerns, Worldcoin may need to team up with other proof-of-personhood projects that score more highly on decentralization, accessibility, and protection against fake users.\n\nHe concluded by stressing he believes a world without proof-of-personhood also has dangers\u2014and said building a robust system won't be easy nor quick.\n\n\"I definitely do not envy the people attempting the task, and it will likely take years to find a formula that works,\" he said.\n\nWorldcoin did not immediately respond to Decrypt\u2019s request for comment."

How Democrats and Republicans came together, and what\u2019s next for the proposed legislation. \uec24 Ethereum turns eight. A look back at major milestones from the CryptoKitties craze to the transition to proof of stake. \uec24 The week in numbers. The total amount of crypto donated to Ukraine since 2022, and other key stats to know.\n\nBILLS BILLS BILLS\n\nBipartisan crypto legislation passes U.S. House committees\n\nDespite being the world\u2019s biggest economy and home to many of the most innovative companies in the crypto industry (from mining and protocol startups to venture funds and major exchanges), the United States has lagged behind much of the world when it comes to crypto regulation. But a set of bills that would help set clear guardrails for the industry and establish consumer protections recently advanced in the House of Representatives, a key step in the long process of making them into laws.\n\nHere\u2019s what you should know.\n\nWhat are the bills being considered by Congress?\n\nFirst up is the \u201cFinancial Innovation and Technology Act for the 21st Century,\u201d or FIT21, which advanced through the House Financial Services Committee and the House Committee on Agriculture last week with bipartisan support.\n\nAs the latest attempt at comprehensive crypto reform, the bill defines when a cryptocurrency is a commodity versus a security; empowers the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to regulate digital asset commodity spot markets; and establishes a pathway for crypto trading platforms to register with the CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commision (SEC).\n\nAs the bill made its way through committee votes, several amendments were added \u2014 including a provision that would create a process to certify whether a blockchain is sufficiently decentralized and another to provide an extra $150 million in funding for the CFTC over three years.\n\nThe other key bill under consideration is the \u201cClarity for Payment Stablecoins Act,\u201d which would create a regulatory framework for stablecoins (cryptocurrencies pegged to a \u201cstable\u201d reserve asset, often the U.S. dollar) with the Federal Reserve creating a set of rules for their issuance.\n\nThe bill clarifies that stablecoins are payment instruments that are neither securities nor commodities. The proposed legislation also provides rules for reserves, transparency, compliance, and risk management, and creates a path for banks and non-banks to issue stablecoins with proper oversight.\n\nWhile the bill did pass out of the House Financial Services Committee with bipartisan support, some Democrats said they didn\u2019t have sufficient input on the bill and would have preferred to hold the committee vote in the fall, after congressional recess.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nLast week\u2019s moves were a big deal. They marked the first time that standalone regulatory crypto bills advanced on their own merit and not as part of broader bills. But advancing past committee votes is just the beginning of the process \u2014 next up is a vote from the full House of Representatives this fall. Notably, both bills were supported in committee by both Democrats and Republicans \u2014 creating optimism that consensus can be reached. As Axios put it, \u201ccrypto policy is looking less like a partisan issue.\u201d\n\nHAPPY ETHDAY\n\nA brief history of Ethereum to celebrate its 8th birthday\n\nEthereum \u2014 the second-biggest cryptocurrency by market cap after bitcoin \u2014 celebrated its eighth birthday on Monday, with cofounder Vitalik Buterin enjoying cake (and a dosa) in Bangalore, India. Ethereum\u2019s founders set out to build a new kind of global, decentralized computing platform that takes the security and openness of blockchains and extends those attributes to a vast range of applications. In the years since, an entire economy ranging from NFTs to DeFi has been built on top of Ethereum\u2019s adaptable blockchain.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look back at some milestones.\n\n2013: Buterin, then a 19-year-old computer programmer (and Bitcoin Magazine cofounder), releases a whitepaper proposing a highly flexible blockchain that could support virtually any kind of transaction.\n\n2015: The first public version of the Ethereum blockchain launches in July (and smart-contract functionality begins to roll out).\n\n2017: The ERC-20 standard is created, defining a way that developers can create an asset (or token) on top of the Ethereum blockchain, making it easier to build Ethereum-compatible apps. The first widely popular Ethereum-based app arrives in the form of a game called CryptoKitties, in which users collect and trade digital cats. It becomes a genuine craze with rare digital cats selling for upwards of $200,000.\n\n2018: Decentralized finance (or DeFi) protocols built on Ethereum gain momentum. DeFi aims to transform the financial services industry by making transactions faster, cheaper, and more secure. Among the top early DeFi initiatives are lending protocol Compound, decentralized exchange Uniswap, and the USDC stablecoin \u2014 with more than $1 billion in USDC issued in the first year.\n\n2020: Ethereum begins its transition from a proof-of-work blockchain (like Bitcoin) to a proof-of-stake blockchain. Via staking, users can lock some of their ETH into a smart contract to help secure the network and earn rewards.\n\n2021: As crypto markets surge, NFT projects built on Ethereum\u2019s ERC-721 standard like CryptoPunks and Bored Ape Yacht Club become multibillion-dollar asset classes. Meanwhile, the EIP-1559 upgrade is rolled out with the intention of reducing the supply of ETH circulating at any given time and making transaction fees more predictable.\n\n2022: Ethereum completes the Merge in September, completing its multi-year migration to the 99% more eco-friendly proof-of-stake system.\n\n2023: April\u2019s Shappella upgrade allows staked funds to be withdrawn from the network.\n\nNUMBERS TO KNOW\n\n$100 billion\n\nBitcoin\u2019s approximate trading volume in July, the lowest level since November 2020. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap has also seen five year volatility lows, with Bloomberg noting that \u201cthe digital currency\u2019s five-day volatility [is] sitting below that of the S&P 500, tech stocks and gold.\u201d\n\n$225 million\n\nDollar value of crypto raised for Ukraine since March 2022, according to a report from Crystal Blockchain. Roughly $134 million supported humanitarian needs while the remainder went to military defense. In the early days of the conflict, crypto was a crucial lifeline for many Ukrainians.\n\n$1.2 million\n\nTotal price of a 500-piece generative art NFT collection (Vera Moln\u00e1r\u2019s \u201cThemes and Variations\u201d) that sold out in less than an hour at a Sotheby\u2019s auction.

In an interview with Cointelegraph, the ERC-20 inventor discussed his motivation for creating his multiverse blockchain, as well as the latest token standard developments in the sector.\n\nLet\u2019s pump that creator economy they are currently rekt. pic.twitter.com/tIGiGjTpYn \u2014 Fabian Vogelsteller (@feindura) July 20, 2023\n\nCointelegraph: Currently, ERC-20 is the gold token standard in the ecosystem. But in 2018, you left Ethereum to develop Lukso. What was the motivation behind that?\n\nFabian Vogelsteller: The human story behind it is that Marjorie [who is also Lukso\u2019s co-founder], my wife at the time, had an idea of creating a blockchain for lifestyle and fashion. And I thought that\u2019s a great idea. So, the story evolved to create a blockchain specifically focused on more mainstream use cases, such as for lifestyle, fashion designers, social media, content creators and YouTubers. Anything that's more like what the internet users today would use rather than the token, finance or DeFi world.\n\nCT: What inspired you to create the ERC-20 standard?\n\nFV: I proposed the ERC-20 standard based on a concept from Vitalik. We discussed this, and it became the first smart contract standard. I called it an Ethereum Request for Comment because I just wanted to have comments. And I thought we\u2019d issue a number randomly, like 20. This was never really thought out. So everything was just us going with the flow and figuring out how we use this stuff.\n\nCT: How does the traction currently look for Lukso?\n\nFV: Basically, we built out this smart contract account completely over the last five or six years. On May 23, we launched a mainnet that\u2019s exactly like Ethereum. It\u2019s the same tech and the same consensus algorithm. We started with 10,300 validator keys that are only community members. Now, the network has been running for one and a half months, and we have around 23,000 validators and growing.\n\nCT: So, if it\u2019s so similar to Ethereum, what was your rationale for spending all these years to create your own blockchain instead of just launching it as a layer-1 or layer-2 on Ethereum?\n\nFV: There are multiple reasons. Number one, we are trying to attract a new crowd, a new group of people, a new ecosystem \u2014 an ecosystem that doesn\u2019t currently exist \u2014 to create our economy.\n\nBut the main reason is to get people to adopt these new building blocks. You could never do this on Ethereum. If I would go and propose an ERC and say, \"Here\u2019s a super smart contract account system,\" everyone will say we have ERC-20 already. You know, nobody would do anything; nobody would adopt this.\n\nAnd the other thing is when you are proposing a base account, you have the problem that you need to pay for the deployment for users, and they also need to pay gas fees. In order to solve this problem, we basically create a new chain to subsidize early users.\n\nCT: Another token standard that\u2019s getting very popular recently is BRC-20 tokens. What are your thoughts on the future of Bitcoin or Inscriptions and Ordinals?\n\nFV: The fact that it\u2019s called BRC-20 makes it already a joke. Obviously, he [the developer] means that as a joke. It\u2019s good if people like us to create new standards. That said, Bitcoin is extremely limited; it\u2019s not a generic programmable blockchain, and it\u2019s slow. I stopped using Bitcoin in 2014 because it\u2019s just slow and outdated.\n\nCT: You\u2019ve been focusing your attention on Lukso for nearly six years now. How are you guys doing in terms of the runway?\n\nFV: We did an ICO in 2019-2020, [and it] kind of kicked off the ICO wave. I made something called a reversible ICO. What we did is that people had eight months to buy LYX tokens with refunds. So, for example, after four months, if they realize, \u201cOh, Fabian is an idiot, and this project is shit,\" they could have gotten their money back. Out of the 42 million LYX in circulation, the foundation holds about 26% of it. We are building everything from the LYX we have. And we are operating from that.\n\nFabian Vogelsteller (center).

        "content": "The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group, which operates a derivatives marketplace, published a report on July 26 discussing the potential dynamics between Bitcoin and Ethereum in the context of the upcoming 2024 halving event.\n\nAccording to the report\u2019s author, Erik Norland, who serves as CME Group\u2019s senior economist, Ethereum might outperform Bitcoin even if BTC rallies after its halving. This event cuts its issuance in half.\n\nEthereum And Bitcoin Correlation Before Halving\n\nThe CME Group is analyzing the correlation between Bitcoin and Ethereum months before halving, an event whose ripple effects would likely be felt across the market considering Bitcoin\u2019s capitalization and status. Historically, Bitcoin halving events have supported BTC prices while also lifting altcoins in the process.\n\nBitcoin has been, in recent years, moving independently and emerging as a distinctive asset class, its high correlation with altcoins, especially legacy coins like Ethereum, has seen its expansion drive altcoins even higher. A recent report reveals that Bitcoin\u2019s correlation with Nasdaq was at a 2-year low.\n\nThe report recognizes the correlation between Ethereum and Bitcoin and how the ETHBTC pair has moved over the years. However, Norland mentions other possible triggers of a Bitcoin bull run that could impact the ETHBTC pair and influence ETH\u2019s valuation, possibly forcing Ethereum to outperform Bitcoin in 2024.\n\nTop of the list, he says, are the effects of the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine which could increase Bitcoin\u2019s demand, driving prices higher. Besides, the report highlights the unexpected impact of events like the collapse of regional banks, as it did happen in March 2023, which temporarily boosted prices for Bitcoin and Ethereum, as factors to watch out for.\n\n\n\nThe possibility of a Bitcoin rally is on the table, looking at past price performances. Nonetheless, the report acknowledges the case of these predictions and potentially influential factors being wrong.\n\nThis is considering the level of market maturation over the last four years. Moreover, while past halvings have seen price surges in Bitcoin, there is no guarantee that historical patterns will be repeated.\n\nMacroeconomic Factors And Interest Rates\n\nExploring macroeconomic factors, including central banks\u2019 monetary policies, and their impact on Bitcoin and Ethereum, Norland said central banks would play a critical role going forward. On July 26, the Federal Reserve increased interest rates after an initial pause, forcing Bitcoin prices higher. Prices are now edging lower when writing, trending towards $30,000.\n\nLooking back, in 2020, central banks reduced rates and engaged in quantitative easing, pumping ETH and BTC prices to all-time highs. However, as inflation took root in 2021, central banks adjusted their policies and hiked rates, triggering a crypto winter from which most coins, including Ethereum, have yet to recover from fully.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView"

        "content": "Ethereum Classic (ETC) is a smart contract network split from Ethereum (ETH) in July 2016. It hosts and supports decentralized applications (DApps). Ethereum Classic wanted to keep the original Ethereum blockchain after a hack stole 3.6 million ETH. Ethereum Classic and Ethereum have different technical goals and paths.\n\nThe Ethereum Classic price is currently trading at $18.05, with a decline of 0.04% in the past 24 hours. Ethereum Classic holds a total market cap of $2.56 Billion and ranks 29th in the crypto market.\n\nETC token has a trading volume of $99.19 Million, with a decline of 27.18% over the past 24 hours. It has over 142.17 Million tokens in circulating supply. The volume-to-market cap ratio of the Ethereum Classic coin is 3.86% indicating low volatility in the market.\n\nEthereum Classic Price Prediction Using Price Action Strategy\n\nSource: ETC/USD By TradingView\n\nEthereum Classic price analysis reveals that the ETC token surged nearly 180% in July 2022, breaking above the previous swing high. After that, the price declined and went into a correction phase, forming a descending triangle pattern with resistance from an upper trendline and support from a horizontal demand zone.\n\nRecently, the price bounced back from the demand zone with a rise in volume but could not break above the trendline resistance and got detained. Currently, the price is consolidating near the trendline resistance.\n\n\n\nNow, If the price can sustain above the trendline resistance, it may result in a trend change from the correction phase to an advancement phase. This may attract buyers and push the price higher.\n\nETC Price Forecast from Indicators\u2019 point of view\n\nSource: ETC/USD By TradingView\n\nAs per the EMA analysis, the ETC price suffered rejection from the 200 EMA. Currently, the price tried to sustain above 50 EMA but suffered rejection indicating bearish sentiment prevailing in the short term.\n\nAt the time of publishing, the RSI value of the ETC token is 44.18, and that of the SMA line is 50.11. RSI has gone flat, showing a neutral bias in the market for now.\n\nMACD lines have made a bearish crossover. Also, Histogram bars are being formed below the mean line with increasing height, indicating a negative sentiment being built in the market for now.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum Classic price prediction shows that the price has undergone a correction phase after a surge of nearly 180% in July 2022 and formed a descending triangle pattern. Recently, the price hiked nearly 40% after getting support from the demand zone. But could not break above the trendline resistance and is consolidated. Now, if the price can break and sustain above the trendline resistance, then it may surge higher.\n\nTechnical Levels\n\nSupport levels: $14.1 and $10.3.\n\nResistance levels: $26.9 and $34.7.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe views and opinions stated by the author, or any people named in this article, are for informational purposes only and do not establish financial, investment, or other advice.

        "title": "Ethereum or Bitcoin: What is a Better Investment Option? - PC Tech Magazine",
        "content": "When it comes to cryptocurrencies and the cryptocurrency market, any person interested in them will, first of all, mention Bitcoin and Ethereum. The major cryptocurrencies have really changed the world, but which one is better for investment? Should I convert USDC to ETH now or is it better to buy BTC?\n\nWhat is the difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum?\n\nBitcoin was the first successful cryptocurrency and was created as an alternative means of payment, a decentralized digital currency. Although during its existence it has not yet become an alternative form of money, it is still evolving towards a means of payment and a means of storing value. Experts say that Bitcoin is acquiring more and more features that bring it closer to gold.\n\nEthereum is a multifunctional blockchain platform and cryptocurrency. Initially, the goal of creating Ethereum was to develop an improved version of Bitcoin, but today there are more differences between the main cryptocurrencies than similarities. Ethereum is multi-tasking and, above all, it remains a development tool. The massive emergence of new crypto projects and entire areas of the crypto industry is primarily the merit of Ethereum.\n\nBitcoin is more independent and decentralized and has more confidence from investors. There are fewer hard forks in its history, while Ethereum already boasts a whole bunch of individual options that are available for purchase, including on https://letsexchange.io/exchange/eth-to-btc on par with the original coin.\n\nOn the other hand, ETH has more applications. The platform\u2019s capabilities can potentially be used in logistics, finance, and audit. Another undoubted advantage of Ethereum is the high speed of transaction processing. To eliminate problems with the scalability of the blockchain, a transition was made to the Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. It is expected that after the phased introduction of additional updates, the throughput of the platform will increase by orders of magnitude.\n\nIn terms of the combination of characteristics and capabilities, Ethereum surpasses Bitcoin in terms of the increase in the volume of transactions and the number of active users. At the same time, Ether is more volatile than Bitcoin.\n\nAnother significant difference concerns monetary policy. The emission of Bitcoin is limited to 21 million units, and this creates the preconditions for an increase in the price of the asset. The supply of ETH coins is unlimited, although anti-inflationary measures are provided in the tokenomics.\n\nThe price of BTC is formed directly by the market, while the price of ETH is highly dependent on the platform itself and the pace of development of the DeFi industry. At the moment, the Ethereum blockchain is the leader in its segment, but the emergence of a worthy competitor is a matter of time.\n\nWhich coin to choose for long-term investment\n\nThe long-term prospects for Ethereum and Bitcoin depend on many variables. First of all, it is the functionality of each asset, the ratio of supply and demand, as well as pressure from regulators.\n\nEthereum firmly holds the second position in the ranking of the most capitalized cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is also consistently the flagship of the market and sets its overall dynamics. There are no prerequisites for moving ETH in the rating one line lower or higher yet.\n\nToday, we can confidently say that both assets are suitable for long-term investment. Bitcoin is more stable, less volatile, it has a more stable reputation. The adoption of Bitcoin as a means of payment increases its credibility of it, and institutional investors are investing in the coin.\n\nHowever, Ethereum is now cheaper and could potentially be more profitable. Therefore, it makes sense not only to follow the Ethereum rate but also to include it in an investment portfolio to diversify risks.\n\nALSO READ: INVESTING IN CRYPTOCURRENCY, TOO LATE TO THE PARTY?"

        "content": "Welcome to the comprehensive guide on the biggest crypto bull run predictions. This well-researched and in-depth analysis looks into the exciting world of cryptocurrency bull runs, covering top contenders like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, Ripple, and the new exciting coin ApeMax. Get ready to explore the crypto market as we discuss and dissect some of the latest predictions and insights, and answer essential questions to help you navigate this exhilarating journey. Whether you are a seasoned crypto veteran or a newcomer to the crypto space, this guide discusses news and events surrounding the crypto bull run phenomenon.\n\nList of the Biggest Crypto Predictions\n\nOver the past few months and years, some cryptocurrency analysts have discussed the following topics:\n\nThe convergence of crypto, AI, and the metaverse creates potential for innovation in the crypto space, offering exciting new opportunities and utility.\n\nApeMax staking may emerge as an exciting contender with its innovative tokenomics and boost-to-earn staking model.\n\nMaturation of crypto infrastructure empowers decentralized applications (dApps) to thrive, attracting genuine users and driving further use cases.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s upcoming halving event in April 2024 may trigger reduced supply, historically correlating with potential bull market conditions.\n\nThe final stages of Ethereum 2.0 upgrade by the end of 2023 could lead to improved scalability which could possibly have an impact on the overall crypto market.\n\nWhat is ApeMax?\n\nApeMax is an emerging cryptocurrency that has garnered growing attention within the crypto community. This unique digital token has introduced an innovative tokenomics model, featuring boost-to-earn staking, making it an intriguing option for eligible buyers looking for innovative new coins.\n\nWhy ApeMax?\n\nThere are several compelling reasons why eligible buyers might consider ApeMax.\n\nFirstly, the innovative boost-to-earn staking mechanism allows holders to take part in boost-to-earn staking and potentially earn rewards, creating a dynamic and engaging experience.\n\nSecondly, ApeMax\u2019s unique tokenomics model, sets it apart from other cryptocurrencies in the market.\n\nAdditionally, early buyers have the opportunity to participate in the ApeMax presale , which allows them to secure tokens at presale prices.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to exercise due diligence, assess personal risk tolerance, and carefully consider one\u2019s own goals before making any crypto decisions.\n\nWhat is the ApeMax presale?\n\nThe ApeMax presale represents an exciting opportunity for eligible buyers to acquire ApeMax tokens. During the presale phase, a limited number of tokens are offered for sale at presale prices. ApeMax\u2019s fun features such as the boost-to-earn staking work even during the presale phase, and buyers get instant access to their coins as soon as they purchase them. All of this makes ApeMax stand out compared to other new coins in the space today.\n\nHow to know if crypto bull run is coming?\n\nPredicting the timing of a crypto bull run is a challenging task, as it involves numerous unpredictable factors that influence the market. However, there are some potential indicators that crypto analysts and investors have historically studied to gauge the likelihood of past bull markets. Increased trading activity and rising trading volumes, along with positive sentiment in the crypto community, have been past early signs of a potential bull run. Moreover, institutional interest and investment in cryptocurrencies could signal growing confidence in the market and contribute to a potential upswing in prices. However, it is essential to approach such predictions with skepticism, as the crypto market is highly volatile, unpredictable, and subject to rapid changes. One should always exercise caution, conduct thorough research, and understand the risks before making any crypto related decisions.\n\nWhat is the bitcoin halving event?\n\nThe bitcoin halving event is a crucial aspect of the Bitcoin protocol that occurs approximately every four years. During this event, the block reward for miners is halved, reducing the number of new bitcoins entering circulation. Historically, Bitcoin halving events have been associated with significant price increases, as the reduced supply creates a scarcity effect. With a fixed supply of 21 million bitcoins, the halving event leads to a decrease in the rate of new bitcoin creation, potentially impacting supply. While historical patterns suggest bullish trends around halving events, it is important to note that past performance and historical trends are not indicative of future results. The crypto market is highly uncertain, and price movements are influenced by various factors, including market sentiment, adoption rates, macroeconomic conditions, and many other unpredictable factors.\n\nWhat will be the price of Bitcoin in 2030?\n\nAttempting to predict the price of Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency in 2030 involves a significant degree of speculation, as it depends on multiple factors that are challenging to forecast accurately. Bitcoin\u2019s future price will be influenced by factors such as adoption rates, regulatory developments, macroeconomic trends, and technological advancements in the crypto space. While some analysts and enthusiasts may make long-term predictions based on current market conditions and historical trends, it is crucial to approach such forecasts with caution and skepticism. The crypto market is known for its volatility and unpredictability, and future developments can impact prices in unforeseen ways. Crypto buyers should focus on conducting thorough research and making decisions based on their individual goals and risk tolerance.\n\nBefore making decisions related to cryptocurrencies, thorough market research and independent due diligence are paramount. Take your time to conduct independent research, ask impartial experts for advice, and understand your own risk tolerance. Remember that cryptocurrencies are not for everyone, and they come with high risks and can be very volatile. Also, keep in mind that individuals from the United States, Canada, countries under sanctions, and other blocked countries are not eligible to purchase ApeMax tokens. For the full list of blocked countries, check the official ApeMax website.\n\nThis publication is sponsored.

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin Net Worth 2024: How Rich Is Ethereum\u2019s Founder? - Coin Culture",
        "content": "Vitalik Buterin\u2019s net worth is a topic of great interest, with his estimated fortune reaching around $600 million. This figure includes about $555 million in on-chain Ethereum holdings, supplemented by $45 million in off-chain assets.\n\nWho Is Vitalik Buterin?\n\nVitalik Buterin (@VitalikButerin), born on January 31, 1994, is a distinguished Russian-Canadian programmer known as one of the co-founders of the Ethereum blockchain. Before Ethereum, Buterin was pivotal in founding Bitcoin Magazine in 2011, an influential publication dedicated to Bitcoin and digital currencies.\n\nIn late 2013, Buterin proposed Ethereum, and the platform was officially launched in 2015, heralding a groundbreaking shift in blockchain technology. The introduction of smart self-executing contracts revolutionised the industry, facilitating the creation of decentralised applications (dApps).\n\nButerin\u2019s profound impact on the blockchain sphere has garnered him international acclaim. Notable among his honours, he was awarded the prestigious Thiel Fellowship in 2014 and received an honorary doctorate from the University of Basel in 2018.\n\nThe founder of Ethereum remains deeply engaged in Ethereum\u2019s continuous development and evolution. He frequently shares his research and insights through his blog, vitalik.ca, further solidifying his reputation as a visionary and influential figure in blockchain technology.\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s Crypto Ventures\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s involvement in the crypto world extends beyond his role in Ethereum. He has actively participated in several blockchain projects, showcasing his commitment to advancing the industry.\n\nAmong these ventures is the L4 research group, focusing on blockchain scalability, and the Plasma Group, aligning with his vision of Ethereum as a \u201cworld computer\u201d and contributing to the metaverse. In a tweet from July 2022, Buterin expressed his scepticism about existing corporate attempts to create the metaverse, hinting at his interest in contributing to its development in a more decentralised manner.\n\nThe \u201cmetaverse\u201d is going to happen but I don\u2019t think any of the existing corporate attempts to intentionally create the metaverse are going anywhere. https://t.co/tVUfq4CWmP \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) July 30, 2022\n\nThe Ethereum founder is associated with other significant projects, such as the Ethereum Foundation, which supports Ethereum\u2019s ongoing development, and the Zcash Foundation, dedicated to advancing the privacy-focused coin, Zcash (ZEC). He consistently advocates for decentralisation, smart contracts, and open-source code.\n\nWhat Is Vitalik Buterin Net Worth?\n\nVitalik Buterin has an estimated net worth of around $600 million, including digital assets held in his three verified crypto wallets (0xab, 0xD0 & 0x22), which amount to approximately $555 million, along with an estimated $45 million in personal off-chain assets. However, note that his financial standing remains dynamic, owing to the ever-changing nature of crypto markets and his contributions to charitable endeavours.\n\nIn 2013, Vitalik was estimated to hold over 300,000 ETH, a staggering value of over $1 billion at present rates. Demonstrating his benevolence, he has made significant donations of ETH to charitable causes and supported various projects within the cryptocurrency and blockchain domains.\n\nIn May 2021, Buterin made headlines with a remarkable act of generosity. He contributed a substantial amount of cryptocurrency, including 500 ETH and over 50 trillion SHIB tokens, collectively valued at $1.14 billion, to India\u2019s COVID-Crypto Relief Fund. This donation exemplifies his commitment to using his wealth to positively impact society and help those in need.\n\nHow Did Vitalik Become Rich?\n\nBased on Etherscan\u2019s list of the largest Ethereum account balances, Vitalik Buterin holds the 26th position, accounting for approximately 0.207% of all ETH in circulation. This status places him among the most significant ETH owners regarding funds held in a single account. His crypto wallet holdings slightly surpass the net worth of Justin Sun, a prominent figure in the crypto world and the founder of the TRON cryptocurrency.\n\nVitalik\u2019s wealth comes from co-founding Ethereum and amassing substantial holdings of Ether tokens. Ether\u2019s remarkable growth has been extraordinary, soaring from a market cap of $50 million to over $600 billion at its peak.\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s Plans For The Future\n\nVitalik Buterin envisions a future where Ethereum will dominate the metaverse within the next decade. The metaverse represents a vast virtual world where individuals interact with each other and digital objects through avatars.\n\nButerin believes Ethereum is ideally positioned to be a foundational element of the metaverse. Its combination of the internet and a shared state creates seamless object flow between platforms. The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) ecosystem offers a Web3 username for crypto addresses and decentralised websites for users and items with cross-platform identities. These solutions may seem overlooked by some, but they hold great potential for shaping the metaverse.\n\nAmong various technologies, Vitalik is particularly fascinated by Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (zk-SNARKs). This cryptographic proof allows one party to verify specific information without revealing it and removes the need for interaction between the prover and the verifier, enhancing privacy and security.\n\nHe firmly believes that zk-SNARKs will witness widespread adoption as a leading privacy-preserving technology over the next three decades. As it gains traction in mainstream usage over the next 10\u201320 years, Buterin anticipates a significant revolution brought about by this groundbreaking technology.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nVitalik Buterin has left an indelible mark on blockchain technology. As a co-founder of Ethereum and the visionary behind smart contracts, his contributions have been groundbreaking and have earned him global acclaim. Not only has this innovation led to substantial wealth, with an estimated net worth of $600 million, but it has also positioned him as a prominent figure in the industry."
