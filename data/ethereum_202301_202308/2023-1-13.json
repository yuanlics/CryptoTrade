        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana Jumped Over 10% in the Last 24 Hours - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "What happened\n\nThe cryptocurrency market suddenly came to life on Friday night for the first time since FTX collapsed in early November. Nearly every asset was up big, and some with ties to FTX are significantly higher.\n\nBitcoin (BTC 0.56%) jumped 10.9% and is trading at $20,909 at 8 a.m. ET, surpassing the $20,000 level for the first time since FTX became insolvent in early November. Ethereum (ETH 0.04%) is up 10.1% in the last day to $1,540 and Solana (SOL -0.87%) is the big mover, popping 36.1% to $22.53. Over the past week, the cryptocurrencies are up 23.2%, 21.5%, and 69.9%, respectively.\n\nSo what\n\nMomentum can be a powerful force in cryptocurrencies, especially on the weekend. Trading on weekends often leads to some of the biggest moves, as traders take time off and there's less liquidity (buyers and sellers) in the market.\n\nFueling some of the moves is liquidations of short positions. According to coinglass.com, $730 million of short positions have been liquidated in the last 24 hours with $240 million of that being in Bitcoin, $261 million in Ethereum, and $26.3 million of Solana short trades.\n\nThe two macro news items this week were inflation data that showed a reduction in prices over the past month, leading to speculation the Federal Reserve will soon stop raising rates and may even be forced to lower rates sooner than expected. This pushed growth stocks and high-risk assets higher this week, but the momentum really hit crypto hard on Friday evening into Saturday morning.\n\nSince FTX got us here, it may in part be FTX that has driven the rally. By that, I mean that liquidators of FTX's assets have recovered $5 billion in assets to return to customers and they've been selling leveraged positions as quickly as possible. That added selling pressure to a market with lower liquidity, and when added to the short positions this can drop prices. But when they slow selling and short positions get liquidated (as they have today), the bounce higher can be swift.\n\nNow what\n\nThe price of cryptocurrencies fundamentally comes down to supply and demand. Supply isn't rising very quickly, so demand is the key. When FTX collapsed and the crypto winter wore on, many investors and traders either gave up on the market or took short positions to take advantage of weakness. But over time there should be more and more users of the blockchain, helped lately by significant corporate interest.\n\nI think the long-term trend for cryptocurrencies is still higher, but the volatility seen over the last two months will continue. There needs to be more use cases that disrupt old businesses or create new businesses, and that's when mass adoption will come. That's why Solana is my top cryptocurrency long term, given its low costs and high speed. But a rising tide lifts all boats, and bullishness on crypto overall is helping everything trade higher today."

        "content": "Are you interested in getting involved in the cryptocurrency market but don\u2019t know where to begin? Have you heard about Bitcoin and Ethereum, but aren\u2019t sure if you can buy one with the other? Look no further! In this blog post, we\u2019ll be exploring the ins and outs of buying Bitcoin with Ethereum.\n\nHow to buy bitcoin with ethereum\n\nEthereum and Bitcoin are both digital currencies that are becoming more widely accepted. Since these two virtual coins are both popular with investors, it makes sense to explore the possibility of using one to purchase the other. By understanding how to buy bitcoin with ethereum, you can open up a new way of investing that could help you grow your portfolio.\n\nWhen it comes to buying bitcoin with ethereum, there are several steps that must be followed in order to complete a successful purchase:\n\nGet a suitable Ethereum wallet: Make sure the wallet you choose is secure and allows you to make purchases safely. Some wallets may also require the use of two-factor authentication or other forms of security. Connect your wallet directly to an exchange: Most exchanges allow users to transfer funds directly from their Ethereum wallets without having an intermediary party involved in the transaction. Calculate fees: Before making any purchases, make sure you understand what fees might be associated with your transaction, especially if you\u2019re buying from an exchange that isn\u2019t based in your own country or jurisdiction. Buy Bitcoin through an exchange: After connecting your Ethereum wallet to an exchange and calculating any applicable fees, you can then start buying Bitcoin directly from the platform by placing prices accordingly and responding quickly when those higher offer prices come along!\n\nHow to find the best bitcoin exchange to buy bitcoin with ethereum\n\nWhen deciding which Bitcoin exchange to use, it is important to consider a few factors:\n\nAmount of Bitcoin that the exchange offers and the fees associated with buying or selling them.\n\nthat the exchange offers and the fees associated with buying or selling them. Liquidity of the exchange and how quickly it can be bought or sold.\n\nof the exchange and how quickly it can be bought or sold. User reviews \u2013 are there any customer service issues or bug reports that can help you make a decision?\n\n\u2013 are there any customer service issues or bug reports that can help you make a decision? Security of each exchange and whether or not there have been any prior hacking attempts.\n\nFinding a reliable Bitcoin exchange requires research into available exchanges, particularly those that accept Ethereum as an alternative payment method in addition to fiat currencies like USD or EUR. Some popular exchanges offer both crypto-to-crypto trading along with fiat-to-crypto trading while others may have only one option available. Many exchanges also offer margin trading (trading on leverage) which may significantly increase your risk but can also potentially bring higher profits if handled well. Leverage should only be used by advanced traders who understand its risks!\n\nMany users choose to secure their own wallets as best protection against theft or losses due to scams; this will require additional research into best practices for securely storing cryptocurrency assets safely offline before making trades on any given platform.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhen it comes to buying Bitcoin with Ethereum, it is important to evaluate the costs and benefits. Exchange rates vary from exchange to exchange, and the fees associated with buying or trading cryptocurrencies can add up quickly. It is recommended that potential buyers research the different exchanges available and use caution when transferring funds from one platform to another.\n\nMany exchanges offer users the opportunity to purchase Bitcoin with Ethereum through a cryptocurrency contract for difference (CFD). Before investing in crypto-assets, users should be aware of the risks associated with trading and ensure that they are comfortable assuming those risks. With careful attention and due diligence, it can be possible for investors to safely buy Bitcoin using their Ethereum holdings."

        "title": "Ethereum 'shark' accumulation, Shanghai hard fork put $2K ETH price in play - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ether (ETH) price technicals suggest that 35% gains are in play by March 2022 due to several bullish technical and fundamental factors.\n\nEther price rises above two key moving averages\n\nOn Jan. 8, Ether\u2019s price crossed above its 21-week exponential moving average (21-week EMA; the purple wave) and 200-day simple moving average (200-day SMA; the orange wave).\n\nHistorically, these two moving averages have separated bull and bear markets. When ETH\u2019s price trades above them, it is considered to be in a bull market, and vice versa.\n\nETH/USD daily price chart featuring 21-week EMA and 200-day SMA. Source: TradingView\n\nThe last time Ether crossed above its 21-week EMA and 200-day SMA was in April 2022. But this was a fakeout, in part due to the collapse of Terra (LUNA) the following month.\n\nBut while Ether\u2019s MA crossover does not guarantee further gains, the upside potential becomes greater if one looks at it in conjugation with other bullish factors, described below.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Shanghai hard fork, shark accumulation\n\nEther\u2019s price has risen by up to 20% in the first two weeks of January 2023, driven upward by an easing macro outlook and growing anticipation of Ethereum\u2019s upcoming Shanghai upgrade.\n\nThe upgrade is expected to go live in March and will enable withdrawals of staked ETH.\n\nRelated: 5 signs that an altcoin bull run could be underway\n\nSeveral experts, including Messari research analyst Kunal Goel and IntoTheBlock head of research Lucas Outumuro, believe the Shanghai upgrade will make staking Ether more attractive despite the sell-off risks of unlocking a large chunk of Ether\u2019s supply.\n\nMeanwhile, a rise in Ethereum\u2019s richest addresses is already underway by entities called \u201csharks\u201d that hold anywhere between 100 and 10,000 ETH. The number of sharks has grown by 3,000 since November 2022, according to data from Santiment.\n\nEthereum shark addresses. Source: Santiment\n\nThis suggests a strong accumulation of ETH, which may be a key reason behind ETH\u2019s current rebound so far in 2023.\n\nETH\u2019s price eyes breakout above key trendline\n\nFrom a technical perspective, Ether is eyeing a breakout above a resistance confluence, namely the 50-3D EMA (the red wave) near $1,395, and a descending trendline that comes as a part of a prevailing symmetrical triangle.\n\nETH/USD three-day price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nIn other words, a decisive close above the confluence could have ETH pursue a run-up toward its next upside target at its 200-3D EMA (the blue wave) near $1,880, up around 35% compared to current price levels.\n\nInterestingly, the $1,880 level was instrumental as resistance in May 2022 and August 2022.\n\nConversely, a pullback from the confluence would increase Ether\u2019s possibility of undergoing a correction toward the symmetrical triangle\u2019s lower trendline around $1,200, or a 15% price decline from current levels.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations. Every investment and trading move involves risk, and readers should conduct their own research when making a decision."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe popular crypto wallet MetaMask has launched its staking functionality, meaning that users can now lock up their Ethereum through the new feature via Lido or Rocket Pool to earn financial rewards.\n\nWhat that means is anyone with a MetaMask wallet can now easily start earning yield on any amount of ETH they\u2019d like right from their wallet, and without having to navigate what can often be complicated user interfaces on staking applications. But should they?\n\nStaking, after all, isn\u2019t without risk\u2014not to mention the fact that unstaking (i.e. getting your ETH back from a staking contract) isn\u2019t an option right now. Ethereum developers say, however, that this feature will be coming soon.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWEN STAKING? We are extremely happy to announce that you can now stake ETH with Lido or Rocket Pool through the Portfolio Dapp\ud83c\udf89 \ud83d\udd17https://t.co/HVLvcSDbw6 pic.twitter.com/9VkiU5jlsw \u2014 MetaMask \ud83e\udd8a\ud83d\udc99 (@MetaMask) January 13, 2023\n\nStaking Providers\n\nFor users who don\u2019t mind the risks, staking can be a lucrative activity. While the rewards rates vary, MetaMask\u2019s site claims users can earn a yield of about 5.22% per year on ETH deposits with Lido, and 4.59% with Rocket Pool.\n\nAccording to Lido\u2019s website, over $6.9 billion of ETH is currently staked through its service, earning users roughly 4.9% annually. Lido is a so-called liquid staking provider, meaning users who stake ETH through Lido receive an equivalent amount of Staked Ethereum (stETH) in return for their staked tokens. This enables stakers to remain \u201cliquid\u201d while locking up their ETH, allowing them to use their stETH on other DeFi services.\n\nStaked Ethereum currently trades at a slight discount to ETH. While ETH is priced at around $1,418, stETH currently trades for $1,407, per CoinGecko data.\n\nLido is currently the most popular staking provider, with 29% of all staked ETH, according to Dune Analytics data.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRocket Pool is another liquid staking service, which provides users with rETH in return for their staked tokens. But Rocket Pool on MetaMask appears to have already reached \u201cmax capacity,\u201d meaning users may only have the option to stake ETH through Lido on MetaMask for now.\n\nRocket Pool staking via MetaMask has reached capacity. Image: MetaMask.\n\nHow many have already staked through MetaMask so far? While MetaMask\u2019s Senior Product Manager Abad Mian did not offer precise numbers, he told Decrypt that the team is pleased with the rollout thus far.\n\n\u201cWe started rolling out yesterday at 10% with full roll-out today. We have seen an exciting engagement since the news went live four hours ago,\u201d Mian said.\n\nBut there are other options for ETH staking beyond the two providers MetaMask now offers through its platform. Coinbase, Binance US, Kraken, and Nexo also offer Ethereum staking, each with varying rewards rates. Of those centralized providers, only Coinbase and Nexo currently offer a liquid staking option, returning Coinbase Wrapped Staked ETH (cbETH) tokens or Nexo Staked Ethereum (NETH) in exchange for ETH, respectively.\n\nSolo staking is also an option\u2014but users will need a minimum of 32 ETH (roughly $45,800) to do so.\n\nStaking Benefits\n\nBecause Ethereum is a proof-of-stake blockchain, more users staking ETH and running validators around the globe will, in theory, make the network more secure and decentralized over time. That\u2019s a good thing for the network, which has been criticized for being more centralized when compared to Bitcoin.\n\nPassive income through staking rewards might also seem like a no-brainer to some who are long-term holders and don\u2019t plan to immediately sell or trade their bags of ETH in the short term.\n\nStaking Risks\n\nBut locking up crypto with a third party has its risks. There\u2019s a common phrase in crypto: \u201cNot your keys, not your coins.\u201d And it has unfortunately rung true as the market deals with the devastating effects of Terra\u2019s crash and FTX\u2019s meltdown. Even now, as Gemini shutters its \u201cEarn\u201d program following the collapses of crypto lenders BlockFi and Celsius, should holders ever trust their crypto with a third party at all? What are the risks, and what do Ethereum developers think?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMetaMask parent firm ConsenSys explained in a post last month what it believes to be the primary risks that come with staking ETH. Specifically, it points to potential risks surrounding compromised third-party software, buggy smart contracts, and substantial token price fluctuations.\n\nIt also raises the possible risks associated with undesirable governance decisions made through any related DAOs, issues with code transfers, \u201clegal uncertainty,\u201d and the possibility of compromised private keys. While that might seem like a broad range of potential risks, each one is possible if the user compromises their own data\u2014or a powerful third-party makes decisions that change the rules of the game.\n\nStaking Withdrawals\n\nBefore considering staking Ethereum, it\u2019s essential to know that unstaking is not currently available. This means that right now, your Ethereum can go in\u2014but it can\u2019t yet come out. This might come as a shock to some, as it means that staking is currently a one-way experience, but Ethereum developers have plans to change that very soon.\n\nThe Shanghai update slated for early this year will enable staked ETH withdrawals.\n\n\u201cAfter the Shanghai update, stakers will then be able to withdraw their rewards and/or principle deposit from their validator balance if they choose,\u201d the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s website reads.\n\nEthereum developer Marius van der Wijden told Decrypt that withdrawals could come as soon as March.\n\n\u201cWe have launched three withdrawal devnets and will do some withdrawal shadow forks soon (where we enable the feature on a shadow copy of the normal Ethereum chain),\u201d he told Decrypt in a message. \u201cWithdrawals are expected to go live in March.\u201d\n\nAs to whether Ethereum holders should stake their ETH or not, \u201cpeople should listen to their gut whether they want to stake now or in a couple of months,\u201d van der Wijden said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe code for withdrawals is mostly done, but it still needs to be thoroughly tested before being rolled out,\u201d he said."

        "content": "Crypto trader Jason Pizzino warns that Ethereum (ETH) could undergo a heavy correction after experiencing a modest rally this week.\n\nIn a new video, Pizzino tells his 279,000 YouTube subscribers that Ethereum\u2019s bear market downtrend remains intact despite the second-largest crypto asset by market rallying by over 10% this week.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t broken the bear market downtrend on the log scale yet, we haven\u2019t got past the monthly swing tops here at around $1,700 and $2,000. So there\u2019s still a little bit of resistance or a significant amount of resistance to the upside for ETH.\u201d\n\nEthereum is trading at $1,400 at time of writing.\n\nPizzino says that despite Ethereum looking bullish for the short-term, that could change if the US dollar appreciates and Bitcoin (BTC) and other risk assets turn bearish.\n\n\u201cIf Bitcoin does happen to turn down and the S&P [stocks index] starts to turn down, the dollar index starts to rise and put pressure on the commodities, and of course, these risk assets will also be hit, then maybe we start to see Ethereum roll over.\u201d\n\nAccording to the analyst, Ethereum could hit a low last recorded in December of 2020 once the critical support levels crumble.\n\n\u201cThese are going to be the two key areas \u2013 $1,080, watch that level, and then also watch $880 as well.\n\nIf these levels start to break, then we\u2019re probably going to test this particular zone right here [between $700 and $900] and that could lead to some much cheaper ETH prices.\n\nHopefully, we can get something between sort of $700 and $900 on ETH. Long way off, maybe it doesn\u2019t happen.

        "content": "Cryptocurrency is essentially decentralized digital or virtual money that lacks a central bank and a central authority. It can be compared to an online currency that operates without the help of conventional financial institutions like banks or credit card firms and instead relies on blockchain technology.\n\nIt is called a cryptocurrency because the money units are kept in blocks of cryptographic algorithms encrypted for security. Each block has a header that includes details like the transfer amount, date of creation, and various other fields and hashes that uniquely identify each transaction in that block.\n\nIn addition to its decentralized structure, which makes it highly challenging for hackers, millions upon millions of devices called miners take account of every single transaction to ensure that nothing ever gets lost or stolen.\n\nOne of the most well-known applications of blockchain technology is for developers to create their own cryptocurrency. Blockchain has numerous valuable characteristics, like total transparency and the impossibility for anyone outside the network to alter data that is kept there.\n\nEthereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency platform by market value, trailing only Bitcoin. It is a decentralized blockchain technology platform that enables developers to create their currencies. Ethereum is one of the most valuable cryptocurrencies by market cap, Ethereum\u2019s value has risen by more than 100% during the past few years. When making a choice in the market, it is crucial to keep an eye on the current Ethereum price."

        "content": "The internet has become quickly fascinated by ChatGPT \u2013 the language model chatbot that seems to effortlessly provide long-form answers to any question.\n\nCrypto Twitter seems especially fascinated with the AI bot \u2013 from Casa founder Jameson Lopp to Twitter\u2019s new chief and Dogecoin enthusiast, Elon Musk.\n\nWe decided to ask ChatGPT a number of questions related to Bitcoin and crypto adoption \u2013 including those that are still hotly debated by humans. Here\u2019s what the infamous bot had to say.\n\nBitcoin or Ethereum?\n\nWe first asked what ChatGPT thought about Bitcoin: \u201cDoes Bitcoin have intrinsic value?\u201d\n\nMany of Bitcoin\u2019s biggest critics, such as gold bug Peter Schiff, would say no, arguing that the asset is purely speculative and destined to crash to zero. Yet the AI bot\u2019s answer was a bit more nuanced:\n\n\u201cSome people might argue that Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized nature and its ability to function as a digital store of value could be considered as intrinsic value,\u201d it stated.\n\nIts answer captures the view shared by some of Bitcoin\u2019s biggest proponents that the asset can become the \u201cdigital gold\u201d of the 21st century, thanks to its unmanipulable monetary policy.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what ChatGPT pointed out afterward when asked to compare Bitcoin to Ethereum. \u201cIt\u2019s often referred to as digital gold,\u201d it stated. \u201cIts primary use case is as a digital alternative to traditional fiat currencies, such as the US dollar or the Euro.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, it described Ether as having \u201cmore potential for innovation than Bitcoin,\u201d thus making it more attractive to developers. As explained by BitMEX in July, Ethereum\u2019s scripting language and culture have historically been more welcoming to change than Bitcoin\u2019s \u2013 though more dapps are starting to develop on the Bitcoin lightning network.\n\nWho is Satoshi?\n\nChatGPT isn\u2019t all-knowing, however: it admitted that the identity of Bitcoin\u2019s pseudonymous creator \u2013 Satoshi Nakamoto \u2013 \u201chas not been revealed and is not publicly known.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile some individuals have claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto or have been suspected of being the creator, none of these claims have been independently verified,\u201d it said. Bitcoin SV founder Craig Wright has often accused others of defaming him when he claims to be the enigmatic founder \u2013 but he\u2019s yet to see much recent success in court.\n\nWhen asked if Bitcoin would ever become the world reserve currency, the bot didn\u2019t rule out the possibility. While it still lacks the \u201cinfrastructure, regulations, and stability,\u201d to be considered as such, it is still \u201cpossible that the future may bring changes to this situation\u201d as the technology grows and develops.\n\nFinally, ChatGPT is not a total nocoiner.\n\n\u201cCryptocurrency and blockchain technology are not a scam,\u201d it said when asked \u201cIs crypto a scam?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cBut like any other financial market, there are risks and frauds to be aware of,\u201d it clarified."

        "content": "The Ethereum blockchain is the second biggest blockchain in the world. It\u2019s also the poster boy, as it were, of flexibility. The chain hosts hundreds of dApps and thousands of transactions are completed on it every day. Ethereum can host this number of transactions because it has smart contract compatibility, which means anyone can build anything they want on it via a contract.\n\nBut there\u2019s one problem. The popularity of Ethereum means that there are too many projects built on it. Since Ethereum has a scalability problem, the chain struggles to complete all these transactions in time. This means that people experience slow and buggy transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. It also means that the transaction fees can rise to unviable heights.\n\nThis was a huge structural problem for Ethereum as it meant that it couldn\u2019t fulfill its potential. However, the solution to this problem wasn\u2019t to tinker with Ethereum\u2019s code to make it faster. It was to create a new parallel chain.\n\nPolygon was that new and parallel chain. The Polygon chain is a fast parallel blockchain that\u2019s running alongside Ethereum. It\u2019s a side chain of Ethereum that makes it faster and connects users, at the same time, to all the projects on Ethereum.\n\nAside from the fact that Polygon is hitched onto the Ethereum blockchain, it\u2019s just like every other Layer-1 (L1) blockchain. This means it also has a consensus mechanism, blocks, and validators.\n\nPolygon, like Ethereum, runs a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. This means that validators have to stake their MATIC tokens\u2014 which means they agree not to use or sell them\u2014 and hope that the system picks one of the validators to validate a particular block.\n\nValidators of Polygon then validate the new block of transactions and add them to the accepted pile. In exchange for this, they get a cut of the newly minted MATIC. Validators who are malicious or mischievous will lose much of their staked MATIC, and this incentivizes honest behavior amongst validators."

Discover SCENE\n\nDecrypting DeFi is Decrypt's DeFi email newsletter. (art: Grant Kempster)\n\nThe second week of the new year has been a heady week for the coins, with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana racking up serious gains.\n\nZooming in closer, however, the market\u2019s biggest winners are none other than liquid staking tokens, also called \u201cliquid staking derivatives\u201d (LSD).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe tokens behind projects like Lido Finance (up 50.3%) and Rocket Pool (up 23.3%) have absolutely soared over the last few days. The reason? Ethereum devs are rolling up their sleeves ahead of a key upgrade to the network: Shanghai.\n\nLet\u2019s break that down.\n\nSince executing the merge last September, Ethereum has swapped to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. This means no more power-hungry mining machines, and, in their place, so-called validators. Validators and miners effectively do the same thing, verifying transactions and ensuring little on-chain mischief occurs.\n\nStill, validators can be better distributed than miners due to their lower cost of capital and maintenance. Instead of having to buy out a multi-million-dollar mining farm somewhere in Siberia and hiring a team of engineers to keep those miners running non-stop, all you need to become a validator is 32 ETH and the know-how to keep a single node connected to the Ethereum network at all times.\n\n32 ETH, though, is still roughly $45,000 at press time, so it\u2019s a hefty sum. And that\u2019s where these LSD projects come into play.\n\nThey let you stake any amount of Ethereum you can afford. In exchange, they\u2019ll give you another token (Lido\u2019s staked ETH token is called \u201cstETH,\u201d for example) that can be put to use elsewhere.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nToday, you can earn as much as 301% when you stake your stETH in certain parts of the ecosystem, according to DeFi Llama. Its wide adoption in DeFi is likely one of the reasons why it\u2019s so popular; of this type of offering (excluding centralized exchange-based equivalents), Lido commands more than 88% of the LSD market.\n\nBeacon chain depositors over time. (Source: Dune)\n\nWhen compared with centralized platforms like Kraken, Bitcoin Suisse, or services like Staked.US, Lido still enjoys 28.9% of the market. Runner-up Kraken has just 5.57%.\n\nWhat does this have to do with the Shanghai update?\n\nLike the merge, Shanghai is another key upgrade to Ethereum. It will bundle several key improvements, but the most important is the one which will let the above-mentioned stakers finally withdraw their holdings from the network. Currently, that\u2019s not possible (and last year it had a lot of folks rattled about whether it would ever happen).\n\nThis meant that stakers who rushed into the Beacon Chain with their 32 Ethereum or a liquid-staking alternative with a smaller sum were basically depositing funds with merely a promise that one day they\u2019d be able to withdraw.\n\nNow, though, that promise appears to be approaching reality (and reducing stakers risks considerably).\n\nFor more evidence of folks rushing to try out LSDs, look no further than Lido overtaking DeFi\u2019s unofficial central bank MakerDAO as the largest DeFi protocol.\n\nDecrypting DeFi is our DeFi newsletter, led by this essay.

        "content": "Ethereum layer-2 scaling protocol Polygon (MATIC) is carrying out performance testing of zero-knowledge rollup (zk-Rollups) technology ahead of full integration with its mainnet.\n\nThe development of the technology, called Polygon zkEVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine), has been ongoing for over three years by the Polygon Hermez team. The team has already confirmed that zero-knowledge proofs are possible on Ethereum by generating over 12,000 zk-Proofs in a primary version of the zkEVM testnet.\n\nDavid Schwartz, project lead of Polygon zkEVM and PolygonID, unpacked the development of the functionality in correspondence with Cointelegraph. Layer-2 platforms have continued to evolve and improve functionality which has played a key role in driving Ethereum\u2019s scalability.\n\nAs he explained, zero-knowledge rollups have increased the speed at which layer-2 platforms can achieve finality while ensuring secure validation of transactions with zero-knowledge technology. In blockchain terms, finality is the point at which a block of transactions is considered to have been permanently and irreversibly added to the blockchain:\n\n\u201cFinally, we have zkEVMs, such as Polygon zkEVM, that offer all the above in addition to the equivalence to Ethereum Virtual Machine with its advanced methods of zk-STARKs and zk-SNARKs.\u201d\n\nAccording to Schwartz, Polygon zkEVM includes the first complete source code available EVM-equivalent zkProver, which passes all Ethereum vector tests at over 99%. He described the completion of validity proofs for conventional user transactions as \u201cthe most challenging and rewarding effort\u201d since his team began developing its native zkEVM.\n\nTwo years ago, the Polygon team estimated that developing zk-Rollups with EVM compatibility would take up to ten years. Given the strides made, the team describes zkEVM as the end game, combining advances with layer-2 scalability and fast finality. This offers a myriad of benefits to users when adding greater throughput and lower fees.\n\nCointelegraph also queried the difference between Polygon zkEVM and fellow Ethereum layer-2 scaling network StarkNet\u2019s proprietary ZK-SNARK and ZK-STARK technology. As previously reported, Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent Argument of Knowledge, or zk-SNARKS, primarily increases scalability by batching thousands of transactions with a single proof to confirm validity on-chain.\n\nRelated: What the Ethereum Merge means for the blockchain\u2019s layer-2 solutions\n\nSchwartz said the main difference between the projects is that zkEVM focuses on natively scaling the Ethereum ecosystem instead of other zk-Rollups just scaling transactions and enhancing performance in a different VM format.\n\nPolygon\u2019s approach purports to meet the classification of a type 2 zkEVM described by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin in August 2022. As per Buterin\u2019s summary, type 2 zkEVMs aim to be fully compatible with existing applications, but make minor modifications to Ethereum for easier development and faster proof generation. Schwartz added:\n\n\u201cIn contrast, StarkNet is positioned as a Type 4, introducing a new high-level language and requiring transpilers to translate solidity code into their language.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Schwartz welcomed the opportunity to have more benchmarks and source code available from other projects in order to learn from different approaches. Activity on Ethereum layer-2 solutions continues to grow, with blockchain data showing that transaction volume Arbitrum and Optimism overshadowed transactions on the Ethereum mainnet going into 2023."

Discover SCENE\n\nThe ongoing crypto winter has been painful for the entire industry, but 2022 was particularly rough for Solana. The collapse of FTX and Alameda Research, which were closely linked to and financially entrenched in the Solana ecosystem, accelerated a decline in a year marked by technical issues and high-profile hacks.\n\nAlthough Solana hosts a thriving NFT ecosystem and growing gaming push, the turbulent times and 94% token price plunge have pushed some creators to look for greener pastures elsewhere. Solana game Tiny Colony is the latest project to chart a move to another blockchain, following a similar announcement from the creator of DeGods and y00ts.\n\nTiny Colony developer Tinyverse Games announced its plan today to move its still-in-development NFT game\u2014a blockchain-based construction and management simulator\u2014from the Solana blockchain to Ethereum scaling network, Immutable X.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"Immutable has been very gaming-focused since the beginning,\" Tinyverse co-founder and CEO Arshia Navabi told Decrypt. \"They have an amazing development team and incredible technology focused around gaming.\"\n\nIn Tiny Colony, players must build and manage underground humanoid ant colonies, and strategically farm, mine, hatch larvae, and defend their colony to survive. Players earn NFTs that can be used in-game or traded on marketplaces. An early version of the game was launched for testers on Solana last summer, but the full version will now debut later this year on Immutable X.\n\nTiny Colony is a relatively small project compared to Ethereum games that have respectively yielded over a billion dollars or more worth of NFT sales, such as Axie Infinity and the Bored Ape Yacht Club's Otherside.\n\nThe project originally launched via Solana marketplace Fractal and has generated more than $3 million worth of NFT sales to date, according to Tinyverse. The game's NFTs currently start at less than $5 worth of SOL apiece on the secondary market.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAn NFT is a blockchain token that represents a unique item. In video games, that can mean things like in-game characters, accessories, digital land plots, and more. Elsewhere, NFTs are used for things like profile pictures (PFPs), artwork, sports and entertainment collectibles, and access passes to exclusive events and experiences.\n\nNavabi told Decrypt that Tiny Colony will let current Solana NFT holders swap for an Immutable X version of the same asset through a process it's calling a \"burn-in mint.\" More details on the redemption process will be shared \"over the next month or so\" as the technical process is finalized with help from Immutable X developers.\n\nWhy Immutable X?\n\nImmutable is both the creator of the Immutable X network and the developer of the NFT-based card game, Gods Unchained. Immutable X is a layer-2 scaling solution that enables faster and cheaper transactions than Ethereum's own mainnet. Navabi said that Immutable's focus on gaming and the player experience was an ideal fit for Tiny Colony.\n\nConsidered by some to be an \"Ethereum killer,\" Solana has been a prominent alternative destination builders for decentralized apps (dapps) and NFTs, due to low fees and the ability to handle a larger bulk of transactions per second than Ethereum's own mainnet.\n\nBut the buzz that Solana garnered in 2021 didn't sustain throughout 2022, with network outages, increasing competition, and NFT market turmoil apparently helping to fuel a sharp decline in the token price. SOL has fallen from a November 2021 peak of $260 to a current price of around $16\u2014a much steeper drop than leading cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nWe\u2019re fortunate that we haven\u2019t lost any funds in the FTX fallout, but we do have significant SOL reserves that we\u2019ll need to hold onto for a longer timeframe while the value of SOL and the market recovers. \u2014 Tiny Colony (@TinyColonyGame) November 17, 2022\n\nTinyverse previously commented on Solana's decline in a November tweet thread, writing that it while it didn't lose funds in the FTX collapse, it has \"significant SOL reserves that we\u2019ll need to hold onto for a longer timeframe while the value of SOL and the market recovers.\"\n\n\"Don't get me wrong, Solana was an incredible starting point for us. We got everything we have today because of [Solana],\" Navabi told Decrypt. However, when Tinyverse began discussions with Immutable and learned about its future plans and focus on games and NFTs, Navabi said he \"immediately got hooked.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFounded in 2021, Tinyverse consists of gaming, film, and TV veterans that have worked on projects for Netflix, Disney, Amazon Prime, and Paramount, as well as gaming brands EA, Capcom, and PlayStation.\n\nAlthough Ethereum's own technical limitations make it too slow and expensive for many Web3 games, scaling networks like Immutable X and Polygon have increasingly been embraced by creators to enable games that allow for user-owned assets without significant transaction fees along the way.\n\n\"We're thrilled to welcome Tiny Colony to the rapidly growing Immutable X family and provide the team with our full suite of tools and solutions to make the game as accessible, engaging, and performant as possible,\" Immutable VP of Global Business Development Andrew Sorokovsky said in a statement.\n\nImmutable X's lack of gas fees for completing transactions was a key reason for the move, Navabi said, calling the network user-friendly for traditional (or Web2) gamers who may not understand what using gas means.\n\n\"Game developers and producers should stop expecting Web2 gamers to understand these elements, and just try to make this a very good landing home for them\u2014and make our Web3 games a very familiar space for them,\u201d he said. Navabi added that he believes Immutable X's \"strategies, timelines, and focus are very aligned with that.\"\n\nSolana exodus?\n\nTiny Colony's pivot comes less than a month after DeLabs announced that two of Solana's top PFP projects, DeGods and y00ts, will bridge to other platforms.\n\nDetails on the process are still unclear, but DeGods will shift to Ethereum and y00ts will migrate to Polygon, with the latter move facilitated by a $3 million grant from Polygon Labs (formerly Polygon Studios). Polygon Labs has reportedly tried recruiting other Solana projects, as well, with president Ryan Wyatt acknowledging in a tweet reply in December that the team has \"reached out to many projects across multiple chains.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNavabi said that while Tinyverse did not receive direct funding for its move, Immutable will provide a grant of IMX tokens based on project milestones hit once it's live on Immutable X. He claimed, however, that moving away from Solana to a new home was never about the money.\n\n\"That wasn't our focus,\" he said. \"If our focus were money, then we would go to Polygon or these different blockchains that offer massive dollar incentives for us to switch over.\u201d"

        "content": "MetaMask users are set to have access to Ethereum liquid staking providers Lido and Rocket Pool courtesy of a new integration unveiled by ConsenSys.\n\nMetaMask Staking will unlock the ability for users to stake Ether (ETH) through the Lido and Rocket Pool protocols, touting the service to improve the security and decentralization of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nUsers will be able to compare reward rates, network control and popularity of different liquid staking providers, providing additional information to inform staking solution choices. The service begins with a public beta through the MetaMask portfolio decentralized application.\n\nUsers will be able to stake through Lido and Rocket Pool and view Lido (stETH) and Rocket Pool (rETH) staking token balances. These tokens can also be swapped back to ETH through MetaMask Swaps.\n\nLiquid staking is a method of staking assets on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to earn rewards while maintaining the ability to freely transfer and trade their assets. The assets are deposited in a smart contract, earning rewards based on the total amount staked by all users.\n\nMetaMask product manager Abad Mian told Cointelegraph that the service saw increased user demand for staking solutions following Ethereum\u2019s transition to a proof-of-stake consensus in September 2022.\n\n\u201cFrom an internal survey, 85% of respondents said they like to review several options before deciding where to stake their assets. In addition, over 74% of respondents stated that they are staking or interested in staking.\u201d\n\nMian also confirmed that MetaMask will explore the potential of offering additional liquid staking providers. He also clarified that MetaMask was not providing staking services directly but connecting users to Ethereum\u2019s major liquid staking providers through smart contract functionality.\n\nCointelegraph also enquired about the possibility of staking services being rolled out to MetaMask Institutional, the platform\u2019s offering serving institutional clients. While Mian declined to comment specifically, he noted that MetaMask continues to evaluate its offerings across its range of services.\n\nMian also said that the impact of staking tools on Ethereum\u2019s decentralization would depend on their popularity, user experience and demand for staking services.\n\n\u201cStaking is just one factor that can impact decentralization in a blockchain network.\u201d\n\nBlockchain analysis carried out by Nansen in December 2022 revealed that demand for liquid Ethereum staking services was on the rise following the Merge. As of Jan. 13, the Ethereum staking contract contains over 16 million ETH, with Lido\u2019s liquid staking pool the largest contributor with over 4.6 million ETH deposited."

        "content": "Gm. This is Milk Road. The daily newsletter that brings you the best news from crypto, rain or shine.\n\nI don't know if you checked your portfolio but prices are up BIG.\n\nWe haven't seen this much green since Saint Paddy's day.\n\nETH is up 9% and Bitcoin is up 11% since Friday. Some people think this is a dead cat bounce, but after the year we just had, we'll take it.\n\nNow, onto the good stuff\u2026\n\nBlockchains.\n\nWe all use \u2018em. Everyone talks about \u2018em. But not many people know how they actually work.\n\nAnd the reality is that\u2019s okay, because\u2026 Blockchains are a lot like cars.\n\nPeople use them all the time. They get us from Point A \u2192 Point B. But no one really knows what\u2019s going on under the hood or what a Catalytic Converter does.\n\n(Except my mechanic Rico, that mfer is the Car Whisperer.)\n\nThe important thing you need to know is there are different cars for different use cases.\n\nYou don\u2019t wanna use a Fiat car for your 8-person family. Unless you\u2019re performing at the next Cirque du Soleil.\n\nYou don\u2019t wanna use a Diesel-powered Ford F-150 Raptor to drive around New York City. Unless you wanna end up on the cover of Villains of the Environment.\n\nYou don\u2019t wanna use a Volkswagen Beetle to drive in the jungle. Unless you wanna end up stranded and on an improv episode of Survivor.\n\nYou get the point \u2013 different cars for different cases.\n\nBlockchains are the same way. There is no \u201cone-blockchain-fits-all.\"\n\nOne blockchain might be faster, while another is more secure. One might be better for NFTs, while another is better for decentralized finance apps.\n\nWhich is exactly why we\u2019re big believers that the future of crypto is multichain.\n\nSo today, we\u2019re presenting the Milk Road Blockchain Show. Where we\u2019ll take a look under the hood to better understand some of the blockchains and what they\u2019re good for.\n\nAnd we\u2019re teaming up with a special friend to make it all happen\u2026\n\nthirdweb \u2013 they provide tools for companies and developers to build Web3 apps. thirdweb doesn\u2019t just think the future of crypto is multichain, they\u2019re building tools compatible with over 10 different blockchains, including every single EVM chain.\n\nFirst up, we got\u2026\n\nBITCOIN\n\nBitcoin is la creme-de-la-creme of crypto. When you think of Bitcoin, you think of things like\u2026.\n\nLuxury. Security. Durability. And of course, OG status.\n\nSo it\u2019s only right to compare Bitcoin to\u2026 *drumroll* \u2026The Bentley.\n\nHere\u2019s how Bitcoin and Bentleys are similar:\n\n1/ Both are slow to produce\n\nBentleys might be fast, but they\u2019re one of the slowest producing manufacturers out there.\n\nIn total, it takes 400+ hours to produce one single Bentley Mulsanne. ~136 hours are spent just on the interior trim.\n\n(Almost as long as my wife takes on her eyeliner. As she says, \"Beauty takes time\u201d.)\n\nBitcoin is the same way \u2013 it's the slowest blockchain out there.\n\nIt can only process 7-10 transactions per second and the average transaction time is ~10 minutes. (But those numbers are on a good day \u2013 when the stars are aligned, the moon is full, and LeBron is hitting all his 3\u2019s.)\n\nSometimes transactions can take up to 60 minutes. Which is why all Bitcoin users know this pain\u2026\n\n2/ Both take a lot of energy & work to produce\n\nFun fact: it takes ~45 people to build one single Bentley W12 engine. And some of those lucky people have to go through a 600-point checklist before the final sign-off.\n\nIn other words, it takes a f*ck ton of energy & work to make the Bentley go vroom.\n\nBitcoin is the same way. Its what\u2019s called a proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain. Now, we won\u2019t go into all the nitty gritty details of what PoW is, but all you need to know is\u2026\n\nIt takes a lot of work & energy to maintain the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nUses 7x more energy than Google\u2019s global operations\n\nUses more energy than countries like Denmark, Chile, Finland, and the Netherlands\n\n1 BTC transaction uses as much energy as 50 days of power for the avg US house\n\nBut all this time & energy are needed. And that\u2019s because\u2026\n\n3/ Both are secure & durable\n\nYou see, blockchains have a trilemma between being scalable, being decentralized, or being secure. And they can only pick 2 out of those 3\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s a lot like the college trilemma \u2013 you have to pick between good grades, a good social life, or good sleep. Which is why the Milk Man was living on Red Bull and 26-minute power naps. (Don\u2019t try this at home, kids.)\n\nWhat Bitcoin lacks in scalability, it makes up for in security & decentralization. It\u2019s one of the most secure & durable blockchains out there. It\u2019s lasted 14+ years and hasn\u2019t had a major hack take it down, yet.\n\nBentleys are similar \u2013 they\u2019re all about durability & security. ~80% of all Bentleys ever created are still functional (#BuiltDifferent).\n\nThey even have bullet-proof cars for celebs & royalty like Queen Elizabeth (R.I.P.), James Bond, and the Milk Man.\n\nAnd finally\u2026\n\n4/ Both are symbols of luxury & have unique use cases\n\nBitcoin & Bentley are both expensive.\n\nBTC hit an all-time high of $69k and has the largest market cap out of any crypto\n\nBentleys can cost up to ~$300,000\n\nIn other words, if someone owns Bitcoins or Bentleys\u2026 you\u2019ll know it. They\u2019ll be at your nearest Country Club or SoHo House talking about it. And yes, I\u2019ll eavesdrop to hear how many they own.\n\nWhich makes Bentleys & Bitcoin good for one thing.\n\nBentleys are a good weekend-flex car. You aren\u2019t gonna use a Bentley to drive in the city much or use it to help you move.\n\nBitcoin is good as a secure, decentralized, financial asset. Do you like money but don\u2019t like the government? Bitcoin is your answer.\n\nBut you aren\u2019t really going to use the Bitcoin blockchain for NFTs or Decentralized applications.\n\nThat\u2019s where other blockchains come in\u2026\n\nETHEREUM\n\nEthereum can do a lot of things. You can build DeFi apps. You can create NFTs. You can use it as a financial asset.\n\nIt\u2019s a multi-purpose chain. So it\u2019s only right to compare Ethereum to\u2026 Toyota.\n\nHere\u2019s how Ethereum & Toyota are similar:\n\n1/ Both are versatile\n\nToyotas are used for anything and everything.\n\nGot kids? Say Hello to the Toyota Sienna. The King of all Mini Vans.\n\nWant speed? Look no further than the Toyota Supra.\n\nWant comfort & convenience? Roll up in the Toyota Corolla.\n\nWant to pull a mountain? The Toyota Tundras got your back.\n\nWant to save the environment? Have no fear, the Toyota Prius is here.\n\nEthereum is the same way. All the most popular NFTs, DeFi apps, etc are on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThat\u2019s because Ethereum is scalable. Remember the blockchain trilemma? Well, Vitalik and the Ethereum founders decided to prioritize scalability above all.\n\nAnd it\u2019s all thanks to something called smart contracts. In simple terms, they\u2019re computer programs stored on the blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met.\n\nIt lets users transact securely & anonymously without having to go through a central authority. Smart contracts are at the core of everything on Ethereum. (DeFi apps, NFTs, etc all use em\u2019.)\n\n2/ Both are eco-friendly\n\nRemember how much work & energy it takes to complete a Bitcoin transaction?\n\nWell, Ethereum is the opposite. It\u2019s now running on what\u2019s called Proof-of-Stake (PoS,) which a lot less energy consuming than PoW.\n\nEthereum used to use PoW, but it made the switch over to PoS last year during The Merge.\n\nWhy? By using PoS, Ethereum is using 99.99% less energy than it did before. In other words, it went from a Toyota Supra (sports car) to a Toyota Prius (eco-friendly, hybrid car.)\n\nWe won\u2019t go through all the specifics here, but if you wanna learn more about it here\u2019s an amazing thread by our friend Jon Wu. The best part is he explains it like a mechanic with a Brooklyn accent\u2026 fuhgeddaboudit.\n\nYou\u2019ve probably heard about Ethereum Layer 2 solutions and how they promise to scale the Ethereum network and reduce gas fees. It\u2019s a little confusing. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here to explain ETH L2 to you like a mechanic from Brooklyn: \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\udd27 https://t.co/EHcWo3UOFO \u2014 jonwu.eth (@jonwu_)\n\nMay 27, 2021\n\nAnd finally\u2026\n\n3/ Both are super popular, which means it can get expensive to use\n\nEthereum has become one of the most used blockchains.\n\nThe most popular NFT collections like Bored Ape, Crypto Punks, etc and DeFi apps like Uniswap, Compound, and Aave are all on Ethereum. Which is great\u2026\n\nExcept for the fact that the more popular Ethereum has become, the more expensive it is to use the blockchain to complete transactions. No bueno.\n\nWhen things are busy on the Ethereum blockchain, it can sometimes cost you up to $100+ just in transaction fees. It\u2019s one of the big downsides of using Ethereum right now.\n\nWhich is where Layer 2s come in\u2026\n\nLAYER 2s\n\nTo help explain, let\u2019s go back to the Toyota comparison. Toyotas are one of the most popular cars out there. And it\u2019s now become the most used car for\u2026\n\nUber rides.\n\nBut as more people use Uber, the more expensive it gets. AKA if you\u2019re using Uber on a Friday night, you\u2019re gonna need to take out a loan from the bank beforehand.\n\nThat\u2019s where Layer 2s come in. You can think of them as yellow taxi cabs.\n\nSure, they\u2019re not as convenient or prestigious and sometimes smell like vomit from the drunk guy the night before. BUT\u2026\n\nThey make it cheaper, faster, and more scalable to do transactions on Ethereum. And there are a few L2s that have been making some noise recently:\n\nARBITRUM\n\nArbitrum is a Layer 2 Optimistic Rollup. It makes transactions a lot cheaper & faster.\n\nTo compare, sending ETH will cost ~$0.05 on Arbitrum vs $0.82 on Ethereum's main network. (16x cheaper)\n\nAnd our friends at thirdweb tell us Arbitrum has put up big numbers on their supported blockchain. There have been 10k+ transactions, 500+ unique smart contracts, and 400+ unique deployers.\n\nPOLYGON\n\nPolygon is a decentralized Ethereum scaling platform. And it was a top contender for MVP (Most Valuable Protocol) of 2022.\n\nIt had the biggest partnerships of the year \u2013 including with Starbucks, JP Morgan, and Disney. And its usage & adoption has exploded recently.\n\nNumber of transactions on Polygon smart contracts (deployed on thirdweb.)\n\nOctober: 166,481\n\nNovember: 232,203\n\nDecember: 592,738\n\nOPTIMISM\n\nOptimism is a fast, stable, and scalable L2 blockchain \u201cbuilt by Ethereum developers, for Ethereum developers.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s also seen a huge spike in activity recently. Optimism transactions on thirdweb jumped 6,000% month on month in December. They had 350k+ transactions, 400+ unique contracts, and 100+ deployers.\n\nIn a nutshell: The Layer 2 Wave is here. A bunch of DeFi apps, NFT collections, etc are all being built using L2s on Ethereum.\n\nSOLANA\n\nSolana is built for one thing\u2026 speed. The creators of Solana were a lot like Tom Cruise in Top Gun.\n\nThey feel the need, the need for speed.\n\nSo, it\u2019s only right to compare Solana to\u2026 The Alfa Romeo.\n\nHere\u2019s how Solana & Alfa Romeo are similar:\n\n1/ They\u2019re both super fast\n\nAlfa Romeo can hit the speed of 200 mph and can hit 0-to-60 in under 3.6 seconds.\n\nSolana is one of the fastest blockchains out there. It can complete ~65k transactions per second. It\u2019s 10,000 times faster than Bitcoin. 4,000 times faster than Ethereum. 2x faster than a bullet or Usain Bolt.\n\nIf you wanna go fast, use Solana. It\u2019s currently used a lot by game developers and users that prefer a faster blockchain.\n\nBut be warned. With speed comes\u2026\n\n2/ Both have performance issues\n\nSolana and Alfa Romeo are both known to break down more than the McDonalds ice cream machine.\n\nSolana went down 8 times last year\n\nAlfa Romeos are known for breaking down at least once within the first few months of usage. If you don\u2019t know where your local car shop is, you will now.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWell ladies & gents, that\u2019s a wrap for this year's Milk Road Car Show. And remember, the future is multichain. There will always be different chains for different cases.\n\nThere are a bunch of blockchains we didn\u2019t cover here, so if you\u2019d want a Part 2 reply to this email with \u201cEncore please!\u201d\n\nFor blockchains to grow, they need developers.

        "content": "A popular analyst and trader who accurately predicted Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) 2018 bottom six months ahead of time appears to be transforming into a bull.\n\nThe pseudonymous analyst Smart Contracter tells his 218,100 Twitter followers that he\u2019s dropping his bearish bias after Bitcoin broke out of an upper range.\n\nHe\u2019s now looking for opportunities to enter long positions whenever a breakdown occurs.\n\nAccording to Smart Contracter, Bitcoin will likely outperform other crypto assets moving forward.\n\n\u201cNow that BTC broke out of this slow choppy grind up, I\u2019m scrapping bearish bias and looking to long pullbacks.\n\nPrice action looks impulsive to me now and I also believe with BTC on the cusp of taking out the December high, BTC dominance will rise and BTC outperform altcoins.\u201d\n\nLooking at the crypto analyst\u2019s charts, Smart Contracter appears to suggest that Bitcoin is primed to rise above $18,800. In his technical analysis, Smart Contracter applies Elliot Wave Theory, which states that the main trend occurs in a five-wave pattern while a corrective trend occurs in a three-wave pattern.\n\nBitcoin is trading at $18,157 at time of writing.\n\nAs for Bitcoin dominance, Smart Contracter appears to be forecasting that BTC will reach over 43%. Bitcoin dominance is currently 38%.\n\nNext up is the smart contract-enabled blockchain Avalanche (AVAX). Smart Contracter says that the 19th-largest crypto asset by market cap appears to have bottomed out after a 90% correction from the all-time high. The crypto analyst says that he will look for buying opportunities when Avalanche corrects downwards.\n\n\u201cNow that AVAX broke out of that high timeframe ending diagonal with a god candle, it does look like a bottom to me.\n\nDefinitely can\u2019t chase here.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nCameron and Tyler Winklevoss went from being the co-originators of Facebook deceived by Mark Zuckerberg (as dramatized in the film \u201cThe Social Network\u201d) to early crypto adopters who became \"Bitcoin billionaires.\" Now their firm has been charged by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe SEC hit the twins\u2019 cryptocurrency exchange Gemini with charges of securities violations on Thursday due to its Gemini Earn program, which promised a return to customers who deposited their crypto holdings. Genesis, its lending partner in the program and a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group (DCG), was also charged in tandem with Gemini.\n\nThe charges come after several weeks of increasingly public disputes between Gemini and DCG leadership following November\u2019s collapse of crypto exchange FTX, which triggered a fresh wave of industry contagion as funds stored on FTX were either locked away or missing. Genesis is reportedly on the hook for more than $900 million worth of Gemini customer funds.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHow did it come to this? Here\u2019s a look at the Winklevoss twins\u2019 rapid rise in the crypto industry and the recent moves that led to a public spat between Gemini and DCG, the SEC charges, and an apparently vast hole in Gemini\u2019s finances.\n\nFounding Gemini\n\nThe Winklevoss twins received some $65 million in cash and Facebook stock in the 2008 settlement over the creation of the social media giant. After establishing family office Winklevoss Capital in 2012, the brothers began amassing large amounts of Bitcoin. The twins owned as much as 1% of the circulating supply of the leading cryptocurrency as of November 2013, according to the Washington Post.\n\nThey went from buying up a stash of Bitcoin to leading an investment round in BitInstant, an early Bitcoin exchange whose founder Charlie Shrem was later imprisoned for money laundering related to the Silk Road marketplace. Also that year, the twins attempted to launch the first-ever Bitcoin ETF (or exchange-traded fund), which was rejected by the SEC.\n\nIn 2015, the Winklevoss brothers opened Gemini, a cryptocurrency exchange licensed in its home state of New York. The platform expanded over the years and acquired NFT marketplace Nifty Gateway in 2019, ahead of the eventual NFT market boom in 2021. Parent company Gemini Space Station was valued at $7.1 billion as of November 2021.\n\nCameron and Tyler were deemed \u201cBitcoin billionaires\u201d for the first time in 2017 (as chronicled in the Ben Mezrich book of the same name) as Bitcoin\u2019s price surged to nearly $20,000, and Forbes currently estimates each brother to have a net worth of $1.1 billion.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut with the crypto industry in turmoil over the past several months, Gemini and its founders have faced new challenges. In June 2022, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission charged Gemini \u201cfor making material false or misleading statements\u201d as it sought approval of its Bitcoin futures product, and Gemini laid off 10% of its staff as the crypto market tumbled.\n\nGemini vs. Genesis\n\nA fresh wave of crypto industry turmoil sparked Gemini\u2019s recent troubles, kick-started by the early November collapse of crypto exchange FTX and sister trading firm Alameda Research.\n\nSoon after, Genesis announced that it would suspend customer withdrawals from its lending arm due to the \u201cFTX impact,\u201d citing \u201cunprecedented market turmoil\u201d in being unable to continue business as usual. Genesis was Gemini\u2019s partner for its interest-bearing Earn product, and Gemini said that it would have to freeze customer funds as a result.\n\nIn December, the Financial Times reported that Genesis held some $900 million worth of customer funds from the Gemini Earn program. Digital Currency Group\u2014which owns Genesis, Grayscale Investments, and other crypto firms\u2014is allegedly dealing with liquidity problems, according to Cameron Winklevoss, although founder and CEO Barry Silbert has assured investors otherwise.\n\nAt the start of 2023, the private negotiations between Gemini and Genesis spilled into public when Winklevoss penned an open letter to Silbert. In the letter, he accused Silbert of \u201cbad faith stall tactics\u201d towards finding a resolution to the dispute over the funds, suggesting evasive tactics on the part of the DCG head. Silbert denied the accusations.\n\nThe allegations intensified on January 10 as Cameron Winklevoss called for Silbert\u2019s resignation, suggesting misrepresentation and accounting fraud at DCG. The company responded by calling Winklevoss\u2019 claims \u201canother desperate and unconstructive publicity stunt\u201d on the part of the Gemini founders, which it said were \u201csolely responsible for operating Gemini Earn and marketing the program to its customers.\u201d\n\nGemini then announced that it had officially terminated its Earn program, which it said would force Genesis to pay back what it said is over $900 million worth of customer funds that it holds. The program had operated for nearly two years in partnership between Gemini and Genesis.\n\nSEC charges\n\nThat situation remains unresolved as of this writing, but now both Gemini and Genesis both face a new hurdle in the form of the SEC charges related to Gemini Earn. The agency alleges that the firms sold unregistered securities to customers, raising billions of dollars\u2019 worth of crypto in the process from hundreds of thousands of users.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"We allege that Genesis and Gemini offered unregistered securities to the public, bypassing disclosure requirements designed to protect investors,\" SEC Chair Gary Gensler said. \"Today's charges build on previous actions to make clear to the marketplace and the investing public that crypto lending platforms and other intermediaries need to comply with our time-tested securities laws.\"\n\nIn a tweet response, Tyler Winklevoss questioned the timing of the charges, saying that Gemini had been in discussions with the SEC for 17 months and that the program was regulated by the New York Department of Financial Services.\n\n1/ It\u2019s disappointing that the @SECGov chose to file an action today as @Gemini and other creditors are working hard together to recover funds. This action does nothing to further our efforts and help Earn users get their assets back. Their behavior is totally counterproductive. \u2014 Tyler Winklevoss (@tyler) January 12, 2023\n\n\u201cDespite these ongoing conversations, the SEC chose to announce their lawsuit to the press before notifying us. Super lame,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that they\u2019re optimizing for political points instead of helping us advance the cause of 340,000 Earn users and other creditors.\u201d\n\nHe added that \u201cGemini has always worked hard to comply with all relevant laws and regulations.\u201d Genesis and DCG have yet to comment on the SEC charges."

        "title": "How to connect the Avalanche network to MetaMask? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "One of the main properties advanced in blockchain technology is interoperability, the art of different blockchains communicating with one another. Interoperability is crucial when it comes to exchanging data and assets such as nonfungible tokens (NFTs) or cryptocurrencies while enjoying the best of two or more platforms to save on fees, for example, or transact faster.\n\nThe Avalanche blockchain is an interoperable, versatile platform and cryptocurrency network that addresses scalability, security and decentralization issues with a unique proof-of-stake (PoS) governance type. It was developed by Ava Labs, a New York-based research and development company, to launch decentralized finance (DeFi) and enterprise blockchain applications.\n\nIt is powered by its native token, AVAX, and has smart contract functionality that puts it in direct competition with Ethereum. The PoS platform\u2019s smart contracts primarily support decentralized applications (DApps) and autonomous blockchains with fast transaction processing times, a reward structure incentivizing participation, and advanced interoperability.\n\nAvalanche interaction with Ethereum and its DeFi ecosystems is facilitated by the crypto wallet MetaMask, a software that as many as 10 million people use. It can be downloaded as a browser extension on Chrome and Firefox or as an iOS and Android mobile phone app. Before interacting with Ethereum\u2019s blockchain and DApps, users need to add the Avalanche network to their MetaMask wallet, and this guide will show them how to do it.\n\nHow to set up MetaMask?\n\nMetaMask is a cryptocurrency wallet that allows users to connect with DApps besides storing Ether (ETH) and ERC-20 tokens. Connecting MetaMask to Avalanche allows AVAX users to enjoy all the DApps Ethereum has to offer without leaving the Avalanche network. The Avalanche interoperability also makes the network more accessible for developers to build on since it shares its smart contract programming language, Solidity, with Ethereum.\n\nIt needs to be noted that there are three blockchains on the Avalanche network: the Exchange Chain (X-Chain), the Contract Chain (C-Chain) and the Platform Chain (P-Chain).\n\nThe Avalanche X-chain\u2019s primary use is to send and receive AVAX and cannot be employed on Web3 platforms or added to Web3 wallets like MetaMask. The P-Chain is the metadata blockchain on Avalanche that coordinates validators, keeps track of active Subnets \u2014 sovereign networks that define their own rules regarding their membership and tokenomics \u2014 and enables the creation of new Subnets.\n\nOnly the Avalanche default smart contract C-Chain wallet is compatible with MetaMask, an essential piece of information to bear in mind since, if you select the wrong chain when adding Avalanche to MetaMask, you may lose your coins.\n\nTherefore, to transfer AVAX from an Avalanche wallet, a user\u2019s tokens need to be in the C-Chain wallet or use an exchange wallet integrated with C-Chain, such as Binance. If the token does not reside in the C-Chain, it can easily be transferred internally from any of the other two Avalanche blockchains by paying a small transaction fee.\n\nMetaMask can be added as an extension to Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Brave browser and iOS or Android on mobile from the MetaMask website; however, for the purpose of this article, the Chrome extension will be considered.\n\nUsers must verify the legitimacy of the MetaMask website to avoid being tricked by scams and compromised web pages. Downloading the right extension from the official website is strictly recommended.\n\nFrom the MetaMask website, click \u201cDownload for Chrome\u201d and \u201cAdd to Chrome\u201d to add the extension. Further steps are listed below:\n\nInstall the MetaMask Chrome extension and click \u201cGet Started\u201d on the MetaMask welcome page. You can import your existing cryptocurrency wallet, but you\u2019ll need to enter the wallet seed phrase; then click on the \u201cImport wallet\u201d option. You can also set up a new wallet by clicking on the \u201cCreate a wallet\u201d button. Here, you must create a secure password to access the wallet from your device. Essential information about your seed phrase will be displayed on the next page, and you\u2019ll have to pay particular attention to it. The seed phrase, or recovery phrase, is a crucial security feature and backup for your cryptocurrency wallet. It will allow you to access your wallet with your tokens even if you lose or forget your password. Next, click on the lock button to view the seed phrase. Take note of the words in the proper order, store them securely offline, and never share them with anyone. Your assets may be at risk if someone compromises your device and gets access to your seed phrase. The system will ask you to repeat the seed phrase on the next page; make sure you select the words in the correct order. Click \u201cConfirm\u201d to finish and then \u201cAll Done\u201d to access your new wallet.\n\nThe process described above will connect MetaMask automatically to Ethereum. However, you must complete the steps highlighted below to add the Avalanche network to MetaMask.\n\nHow to set up the Avalanche network on MetaMask?\n\nConnecting MetaMask to Avalanche is a rather straightforward process. Once you\u2019ve logged in to the MetaMask wallet, click on the Ethereum mainnet drop-down menu and select Custom RPC, as shown below.\n\nYou will be redirected to the \u201cAdd a network\u201d page, where you\u2019ll need to add the following information:\n\nNetwork Name: Avalanche Network\n\nNew RPC URL: https://api.avax.network/ext/bc/C/rpc\n\nChainID: 43114\n\nSymbol: AVAX\n\nExplorer: https://snowtrace.io/\n\nYou can view the \u201cAdd a network\u201d requirements to use MetaMask on Avalanche here:\n\nClick on \u201cSave\u201d to complete the process. You\u2019re now ready to use MetaMask on Avalanche and all its DeFi and Web3 applications.\n\nHow to send AVAX tokens to MetaMask?\n\nAfter connecting the Avalanche network to MetaMask, you can send your AVAX coins from an Avalanche wallet to your MetaMask wallet. Remember that only the C-Chain is compatible with MetaMask.\n\nLog in to your Avalanche wallet and transfer your tokens to the C-Chain blockchain if they reside on the P- or X-Chain blockchains. Simply click \u201cCross Chain\u201d on the left menu bar and select \u201cC-Chain\u201d as the destination chain. Enter the amount you wish to transfer and click \u201cConfirm.\u201d A small transaction fee will be added to the final amount. You can now send the AVAX coins to MetaMask by clicking on \u201cSend\u201d from the left menu.\n\nSelect \u201cC Contract\u201d as the source chain and enter the amount you want to send to MetaMask.\n\nNow go to your MetaMask wallet and copy the address, which you will paste into the Avalanche wallet in the \u201cTo Address\u201d field.\n\nCheck whether you have sufficient gas for the transaction fee. Confirm and finalize the transaction. Once the transaction is confirmed, you will be able to view the AVAX coins in your MetaMask wallet.\n\nWhat other wallets are compatible with Avalanche?\n\nMetaMask is surely the versatile DeFi wallet for running smart contracts and DApps; however, AVAX can be transferred, stored, staked and exchanged in other cold and hot wallets. With over 90 million verified users worldwide, the Coinbase wallet is a secure and easy-to-use hot wallet to exchange, earn and store AVAX. Security is enhanced through the software\u2019s two-factor authentication making it a safe wallet to use for both beginners and advanced users.\n\nThe Trust Wallet is another hot wallet that supports all DeFi programs, including NFT storage, Web3 capabilities, staking, swaps and purchases. It supports the Avalanche C-Chain in addition to many other blockchains so that DApps could be bridged to AVAX easily. This hot wallet is one of the most utilized among Web3 enthusiasts because of its user-friendly interface and versatility.\n\nLedger Nano S or X cold wallets both support Avalanche, and users can access and store their AVAX tokens through all Avalanche chain addresses. Cold wallets are recommended over hot wallets, as the private keys to access the cryptocurrency are stored offline in a hardware device, making it difficult for hackers and malicious actors to steal them."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) founder Vitalik Buterin has warned that new blockchain chains will likely fail if they don\u2019t offer something unique to users.\n\nAccording to Buterin, emerging chains should put more focus on meeting the needs of the average user and work towards enacting a fresh philosophy into the crypto sector, he said during an Ethereum Ask Me Anything (AMA) session on Reddit.\n\nHe equated the situation to the existence of Twitter (NYSE: TWTR) and Facebook (NASDAQ: FB), which were among the original social media sites and have partly remained the dominant players despite the emergence of other platforms. In this line, he noted that as two leading crypto projects, Ethereum and Bitcoin (BTC), have established themselves and emulating them might lead to failure.\n\n\u201cI am just getting more and more convinced that chains that try to be indistinguishable from Ethereum to the average user are going to get ignored and fail, and users are going to interpret Bitcoin vs Ethereum vs Cosmos vs \u2026 as different ecosystems much as they do Twitter, Facebook,\u201d he said.\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s comment on crypto chains. Source: Reddit\n\nButerin on crypto adoption\n\nThe Ethereum creator was responding to a user who stated that focusing on the underlying crypto chain should not be an issue for adoption to occur.\n\nButerin\u2019s sentiments align with his previous views noting that for crypto adoption to be realized, there is a need to give the sector room to mature. This comes as industry players opine that with new projects launching, for maturity to occur, the market will undergo a wipeout similar to the dot-com bubble.\n\nIn early December, Buterin also pointed out that the focus of the crypto space should be on developing the underlying technology and not the price at a time the market was battling extended sell-offs.\n\nIndeed, Buterin has been a big advocate of transparency in the crypto space while warning of the threat of human interference that can be placed over a protocol.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

In the past few hours, the \u2018Fear & Greed Index\u2019 has risen to 31 points, on a scale of zero to 100. This is the highest level since the beginning of last November.\n\nAmong the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies, Cardano (ADA) climbs to the podium with a gain of over 25% in the past 7 days, which rises to 35% when adding up the previous week\u2019s performance.\n\nAnalysis of the price trend of Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nBitcoin (BTC)\n\nThe first cryptocurrency for the largest market capitalization and the strongest network, rises above the psychological threshold of $19k for the first time in over two months.\n\nIn the last few hours, the price tries to push toward US$19,200, aiming for the historic US$20k level.\n\nTechnical signals supporting the uptrend are beginning to increase, even though support levels need to be consolidated to validate a solid bullish structure.\n\nTo continue a bullish trend in the coming weeks, it will be necessary not to return below $17,500.\n\nA break from the bulls must not allow the return of bearish speculation that would become aggressive below $17,200, undoing all the good work done so far.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nIt goes hand in hand with the price trend of ETH, which in the last few hours revisits $1,440, levels abandoned on 8 November, the first of the two worst days of the last six months in the midst of the FTX exchange storm.\n\nEthereum also needs to confirm in the coming days the support levels that the price has been tapping in recent days.\n\nIt is $1,300 the first support level in importance and proximity that will have to prove to be well defended by the buy positions used to protect the massive derivative strategies present and growing since the beginning of the year.\n\nIf, on the contrary, the rise should continue without the need for a pause, the run will find no technical obstacles until the $1,600 area where it will be inevitable to take profits for short-term traders."
