        "content": "The chairman of the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has taken a firm stance against the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC)\u2019s subtle power creep over the digital asset market.\n\nRostin Behnam told the Senate Agriculture Committee on Wednesday that Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency next to Bitcoin, is a commodity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been listed on CFTC exchanges for quite some time, and for that reason,\u201d said Behnam, who argued that it creates a \u201cdirect jurisdictional hook\u201d for the agency to police both ETH\u2019s derivatives market and underlying market.\n\nHis opinion appears to directly contradict that of SEC chairman Gary Gensler, who argued last month that \u201ceverything other than Bitcoin\u201d falls under securities laws. While not naming any names, the chairman has hinted many times that this would include Ethereum\u2014especially after the network transitioned to a proof of stake consensus mechanism.\n\nSEC Commissioner Hester Peirce Outlines Problems With the SEC\u2019s Howey Test\n\nUnder the Howey Test, a security counts as an asset sold to raise money from the public, from which they expect profits based on the efforts of others. Gensler\u2019s own words reinforced this in January 2022. However, under the securities act, the definition can be much broader.\n\nComments in late November suggested that Behnam had come to agree with the SEC chief that Ethereum fell under this umbrella, but his argument Wednesday shows that he is standing by his long-held position that there\u2019s room for more than one crypto commodity.\n\n\u201cWe would not have allowed the Ether futures product to be listed on a CFTC exchange if we did not feel strongly that it was a commodity asset,\u201d he elaborated, stating that his agency has \u201cserious legal defences\u201d to support their case.\n\nThe regulatory chiefs also disagree on stablecoins. While the SEC recently threatened to sue Paxos for issuing BUSD as an unregistered security, Behnam believes stablecoins should be considered commodities\u2014absent any legislation to claim otherwise.\n\nBehnam cited an investigation into Tether during a 2021 lawsuit, after which Tether agreed to pay over $40 million to settle charges that it had lied about its dollar reserves.\n\n\u201cExamining the circumstances around the Tether case, it was clear to our enforcement team and the commission that the Tether stablecoin was a commodity, and that we needed to move forward, and swiftly, to police that market,\u201d he said."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe New York Attorney General's office today filed a lawsuit against cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin for allegedly violating securities and commodities laws in the state.\n\nIn the complaint, Attorney General Letitia James makes the startling claim that not only are Terra (LUNA) and TerraUSD (UST) securities, as previously alleged by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, but also Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\n\u201cThis action is one of the first times a regulator is claiming in court that ETH, one of the largest cryptocurrencies available, is a security,\u201d today\u2019s announcement read. \u201cThe petition argues that ETH, just like LUNA and UST, is a speculative asset that relies on the efforts of third-party developers in order to provide profit to the holders of ETH.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe NYAG's lawsuit targets KuCoin for allegedly \u201cfalsely representing itself as an exchange\u201d when really it is a \u201csecurities and commodities broker-dealer.\u201d It aims to block access to the exchange in New York by forcing KuCoin to geo-fence its website based on IP addresses and GPS location.\n\nThe Seychelles-based exchange ranks fifth on CoinGecko's list of crypto exchanges based on \"trust score\" and 17th in the world based on 24-hour trading volume. KuCoin allows users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum from virtually anywhere in the world, including the United States. The company once touted itself as \u201cthe most advanced and secure cryptocurrency exchange,\" before suffering a $150 million hack in 2020.\n\nThe lawsuit argues that ETH is a security because, among other reasons, users can now earn financial rewards by holding the cryptocurrency. \u201cSince transitioning to the proof-of-stake consensus, possession of ETH translates directly to profit potential by earning staking rewards,\u201d reads the lawsuit.\n\nEthereum last year became a proof-of-stake blockchain. This is a consensus mechanism which requires users to stake or \u201clock-up\u201d its native cryptocurrency, ETH, to keep the network running. And the more ETH a user stakes, the more rewards they can potentially earn.\n\nThe timing of the lawsuit is also notable, given the attention that staking services have received lately from regulators. Just last month, the SEC fined popular American exchange Kraken $30 million because its staking product allegedly violated securities laws. And SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has hinted that Ethereum may be on the Commission's radar, repeatedly making public statements that suggest Bitcoin is the only crypto asset the SEC believes is a non-security.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAttorney General Letitia James\u2019s move is the latest in a tough crackdown by U.S. authorities on the crypto industry.\n\nThe SEC has ramped up enforcement actions of late, and politicians and lawmakers have turned up the anti-crypto rhetoric following the dramatic collapse of the once-dominant FTX crypto exchange and the arrest of its founder Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nThe state of New York, which has some of the strictest laws in the country regarding crypto, last month filed a lawsuit against crypto exchange CoinEx for also failing to register itself as a securities and commodities broker-dealer."

Rostin Behnam of the CFTC told the Senate Agriculture Committee as recently as Wednesday that ETH is in fact a commodity, not a security.\n\n\u201cWe would not have allowed the Ether futures product to be listed on a CFTC exchange if we did not feel strongly that it was a commodity asset,\u201d he explained.\n\nSEC leaders have made similar statements. In 2018, William Hinman, the then-Director of Corporate Finance at the SEC, said in a speech that both bitcoin and ETH are not securities. His justification was that bitcoin is \u201cdecentralized\u201d and ETH, despite its 2014 initial coin offering, had become \u201csufficiently decentralized\u201d over the past four years to make it a non-security.\n\nThe Office of the State Attorney General (OAG) confirmed KuCoin\u2019s alleged unlawful actions because OAG Detective Brian Metz has been transacting on the exchange from New York since May 2022, the lawsuit states.\n\nKuCoin\u2019s lending and staking product, KuCoin Earn, is also an unregistered security offering, the lawsuit alleges.\n\nThe OAG served KuCoin a subpoena on Jan. 10, 2023 but respondents did not reply and failed to appear to testify on the date specified in the subpoena, the lawsuit claims.\n\nThe lawsuit is similar to a suit brought against exchange CoinEx in February alleging the exchange offered trading services for tokens including AMP, LUNA and LBC, all of which the Attorney General\u2019s office says are securities."

The crypto industry has widely voiced support for CFTC as a preferred regulator over the SEC.\n\nAccording to Gensler, proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies such as Etherium pass the Howey Test, which refers to a U.S. Supreme Court case for determining whether a transaction qualifies as a security asset.\n\nBehnam also seemed to diverge from Gensler on stablecoins.

        "content": "Last week, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and the Digital Finance Cooperative Research Centre (DFCRC) outlined their retail and wholesale central bank digital currency (CBDC) pilot projects. One of the partners selected for the 14 CBDC use cases is Mastercard, which is working with Cuscal on an interoperable CBDC for trusted Web3 commerce. The aim is to enable the use of an eAUD on public blockchains.\n\nThe pilot proposal will use the CBDC to pay for an NFT on Ethereum. Since the CBDC itself is not issued on a public blockchain, the test will \u201clock\u201d the required amount on the CBDC platform and mint an equivalent sum of wrapped tokens on Ethereum. However, for the transaction to go through, the Ethereum wallets of the buyer and seller and the smart contract itself must first be whitelisted. This will illustrate the possibility of implementing controls on public blockchains, such as know-your-customer (KYC) rules.\n\nHowever, wrapping is not without risks. Essentially, a wrapped token is a tokenized copy of a coin that exists on a different blockchain, pegged to the value of the other asset and backed on a 1:1 basis. Hence, wrapping allows building bridges between different chains, circumventing the limitation on non-native assets on public blockchains such as Ethereum or BNB Smart Chain.\n\nThe risks of wrapping CBDCs\n\nYet the process needs to be transparent. Earlier this year, it surfaced that the Binance USD (BUSD) stablecoin, which is issued by the New York-regulated trust company Paxos on Ethereum, was not always 1:1 backed on other chains, despite being rock solid on Ethereum. As it turned out, Paxos was not involved in managing or supporting wrapped versions of BUSD, which it was upfront about on its website. Instead, other actors were issuing wrapped or pegged BUSD on other chains.\n\nJust as important is who wraps a CBDC, not specific to this particular use case. Locking currency on one blockchain and issuing on another means that code runs the process. Numerous smart contract vulnerabilities have resulted in the loss of significant sums of crypto through bridges between blockchains. It\u2019s one thing if a vulnerability damages the reputation of a crypto firm, but another issue if there\u2019s institutional reputational damage or one connected to a central bank.\n\nAdditionally, a group of people will be responsible for the keys that control wallets. It\u2019s not unheard of for protocol creators to run off with funds. So they need to be trustworthy.\n\nApart from that, the central bank will be fussier about anti-money laundering than a stablecoin issuer. So they\u2019ll want to influence who wraps their CBDC. But on permissionless public blockchains, in theory, anyone can wrap anything they want if someone is willing to use it.\n\nCentral banks around the world are taking different approaches to public blockchain. Many completely ignore public blockchains, such as Europe, which so far has focused on payment for retail sales and P2P transfers. Others are more accepting, including Brazil, which tested its digital real for a couple of retail applications using public blockchains. But CBDCs will inevitably be wrapped, so some regulations on what is allowed will likely be implemented.\n\nThe Mastercard solution will enable CBDCs to be tokenized into other chains with controls to ensure that only authorized parties can hold, use, and redeem them. According to the project team, this will allow consumers\u201d to participate in crypto ecosystems using trusted and reliable forms of money\u201d. More broadly, it will increase the utility of the CBDC and exploit many of the benefits offered by cryptocurrencies and Web3 commerce."

Median transaction gas prices came in at 35 Gwei (a denomination of ETH) on Monday, and exceeded 38 Gwei on Feb. 16, the highest since June 2022, Glassnode data showed.\n\n\u201cMiners are the clear winners right now, as they\u2019re processing this massive increase in transactions on Ethereum,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT relations strategist of Forkast Labs\u2019 Cryptoslam.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re reminded of that each time you go to transact, whether sending some ETH between wallets or buying an NFT. That little warning pops up in MetaMask telling you that the network is busy, and you can\u2019t help but think of how well the miners are doing,\u201d Petscher added.\n\nThe Blur NFT marketplace, which launched in October, has gained traction as it doesn\u2019t charge transaction fees for users and recommends a low royalty rate payment for NFT creators. The moves were seen as a clear challenge to NFT market leader OpenSea, which responded by slashing its fees to zero for popular NFT collections as it lost ground to Blur.\n\nShort-term win?\n\nAlice Kohn, an analyst at Glassnode, wrote in a report last week that the recent market focus on Blur has \u201cled to a surge in demand for blockspace, resulting in increased fees for validators.\u201d\n\nOver the past seven days, the Blur NFT marketplace recorded US$410.93 million in trading volume, more than seven times higher than OpenSea\u2019s US$52.4 million, DappRadar data showed.\n\nElsa Kong, head of research of Singapore-based NFT data firm NFTGo, told Forkast that the high gas fees caused by the Blur token airdrop may be seen as beneficial for Ethereum validators in the short term, but \u201cprobably it wouldn\u2019t bring any big changes in the long run.\u201d\n\nKong said that it was not entirely accurate to call Ethereum miners the \u201cwinners\u201d in this situation, as the success of the Ethereum network depends on a variety of factors, including user adoption, network security and developer activity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to note that the Blur token airdrop is not directly related to Ethereum miners, as the miners care more about the Ethereum upgrade such as (the switch from) proof-of-work to proof-of-stake,\u201d Kong said.\n\nBigger stakes\n\nNick Ruck, head of strategy of NFT intellectual property licensing firm ContentFi, said smaller stakers may not see a big difference in their earnings, adding he has been an active Ether staker since November.\n\n\u201cObviously, higher gas fees aren\u2019t great for everyday users, but you get more fees for stakers anyway,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cPersonally, the higher gas fees from my own day trading aren\u2019t offset by the increase in earned fees, but I\u2019m also not staking a whole lot compared to a larger staking-as-a-service firm,\u201d Ruck added. \u201cFor most people staking in pools, they might not see a big difference since they\u2019re sharing in portions.\u201d\n\nRuck said that there\u2019s \u201ca lot of maintenance\u201d that goes into validating. \u201cThe more industrialized your setup is, the more you\u2019ll earn simply due to being more efficient. If you do this at home, you\u2019ll get penalized for going offline, for example.\u201d\n\nRuck agreed that validators will not be long-term beneficiaries from the Blur and OpenSea fight for dominance \u201csimply because I think it\u2019ll be short-lived.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor now, they may earn more, but I think it\u2019s too temporary,\u201d Ruck said. \u201cHow long can Blur and OpenSea go without earning those fees, or just earn minimally compared to previously?\u201d\n\nKohn of Glassnode wrote that the recent attention surrounding Blur has \u201cyet to have an appreciable impact on network adoption.\u201d\n\nKohn said Blur and OpenSea may be fighting over the same pre-existing user base, as the latest interest in NFTs \u201cappear to primarily appeal to existing users, and are as yet, unable to attract new users to the Ethereum network.\u201d\n\nValida Pau contributed to this report."

        "content": "Data shows Ethereum\u2019s year of high correlation with Bitcoin is coming to an end with the metric hitting ATH values.\n\nEthereum Ends 2022 With All-Time High Correlation To Bitcoin\n\nAccording to the year-end report from Arcane Research, the global markets have all fallen strongly correlated this year. The \u201c30-day correlations\u201d is an indicator that measures how in-tune Bitcoin has been with another asset in terms of price movement over a 30-day period.\n\nWhen the value of this metric is greater than zero, it means there has been a positive correlation between BTC and the other asset in the past month. On the other hand, negative values imply that the price of the crypto has been reacting to changes in the value of the other asset by moving in the opposite direction.\n\nAlso, the higher the metric value (in either direction), the more the degree of the correlation. Naturally, the metric has a value equal to zero suggesting the two prices aren\u2019t tied to each other at the moment.\n\nNow, here is a chart that shows the trend in Bitcoin\u2019s 30-day correlations with Ethereum, S&P 500, and Nasdaq over the past year:\n\nLooks like the metric's value corresponding to ETH has been very high in recent weeks | Source: Arcane Research's 2022 - Year in Review\n\nAs the above graph displays, Bitcoin positively correlated with these three assets during 2022. BTC\u2019s correlation has been around or above 0.5 for most of the year for the US equities, suggesting it has been decently tied with them.\n\nThe correlation with Ethereum, however, has been at values of around 0.9 or more, implying Bitcoin has been extremely correlated with it. Even now, as the year\u2019s end, the correlation between these cryptos stands at 0.97, around ATH levels.\n\nBack in September of this year, ETH successfully finished its much-anticipated transition to a Proof-of-Stake consensus system, an event known as the Merge. Since the Merge brought some developments unique to Ethereum, the correlation with BTC dropped, as is apparent in the chart.\n\nHowever, it wasn\u2019t long before the two started moving on the same wavelength again, so even the Merge wasn\u2019t enough to cause sufficient impact to separate the coins.\n\nAlso, since Bitcoin is highly correlated with stocks, so is Ethereum. Though, Arcane Research expects that this correlation between the cryptos and the US equities will soften in the next year due to trading volumes in the crypto market declining substantially.\n\nETH Price\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum\u2019s price floats around $1,200, down 2% in the last week.\n\nETH seems to have gone down recently | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Pierre Borthiry \u2013 Peiobty on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, Arcane Research\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Ethereum Price Balks As Dormant Whales Reactivate - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum price closely followed that of bitcoin throughout the week and this saw the digital asset fall below the $1,200 level once more. Presently, the entire market looks to be consolidating but Ethereum has been put under some pressure following the activation of two whale addresses. These addresses which had not transacted for about half a decade had suddenly moved tens of millions of dollars worth of ETH between them.\n\nFive-Year-Old Whales Move $27 Million\n\nIn the early hours of Monday, Lookonchain, an on-chain data tracker, took to Twitter to post the re-awakening of long-dormant Ethereum addresses. These addresses both held at least $10 million worth of ETH on their balances and had not seen any type of activity in the last five years, until today.\n\nBoth wallets, seemingly out of nowhere, had first transferred out 1 ETH to a new wallet in what looks like test transactions. What followed was another large transaction that would empty out their balances.\n\nThe first wallet would transfer a total of 9,877 ETH in a single transaction, worth $11.7 million at current prices, while the second wallet would transfer out a total of 13,103.99 ETH in its second transaction, worth $15.5 million at press time. This brought their cumulative total transactions to more than $27 million.\n\nETH stalls at $1,185 | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nAll of the ETH was transferred to new, unknown wallets with no prior history besides the 1 ETH test transaction. The ETH is now sitting in these new Ethereum addresses and has not been touched so far.\n\nBad News For Ethereum?\n\nThe movement of such a large amount of ETH has stopped the digital asset in its tracks. So far, there has not been any meaningful movement in the Ethereum price which shows a lot of wariness on the part of investors and traders alike.\n\nHowever, despite the ETH from these whales being significant, it does not look to have any market impact since the coins were just moved from one storage wallet to another, as it seems. There has been no movement to centralized exchanges, and if this was a sale, it was an OTC trade which eliminates the pressure such a sale would have had on the open market.\n\nEthereum price on the other hand has now moved into the control of the bears. The $1,200 support was flipped and is now a resistance level that bulls must beat to attain any momentum. This also drags the digital asset well below the 100-day moving average of $1,439, showing bearishness for the medium to long term.\n\nETH\u2019s price is currently trending at $1,180. It is down 5.22% in the last 7 days and saw trading volumes of approximately $4 billion in the last 24 hours.\n\nFeatured image from Bitcoinist, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Solana (SOL) has been completely engulfed in FUD since the FTX crash. This invariably resulted in the price of the token declining much faster than the rest of the market, and last week, SOL touched single-digit values for the first time in almost two years. However, there seems to be a turn in the tide for the digital asset as it receives support from Vitalik Buterin.\n\nVitalik Buterin Offers Support To Solana\n\nTaking to Twitter, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin expressed support for Solana for the first time. Solana which had been the fiercest competitor of Ethereum had been unable to keep up given its ties to FTX crypto exchange, its sister company Alameda Research, and its disgraced founder Sam Bankman-Fried, but Buterin is not pleased that the competitor is essentially crumbling.\n\nIn the tweet, the Ethereum founder explained that \u201csome smart people\u201d had told it that there was still a good developer community on the blockchain who are earnest and smart. Furthermore, they added that since the opportunistic people trying to make a quick buck had now been pushed out, they expect the network to have a bright future.\n\nButerin himself explains that he couldn\u2019t tell if this was true looking in from the outside but said that he hoped that \u201cthe community gets its fair chance to thrive. This tweet was made about four days ago and it had an incredibly positive impact on Solana.\n\nSOL Price Rallies On Buterin Comments\n\nThe price of SOL saw an upward trend following the tweets from the Ethereum founder. Although Solana remains a long way from its glory days, Buterin\u2019s tweets had given the bulls just the morale boost they needed and by Monday, SOL\u2019s price had surged as high as $12 before correcting back down.\n\nSOL recovers above $11 | Source: SOLUSD on TradingView.com\n\nPresently, the price of the digital asset is sitting above $11, rising over 15% in the last 24 hours. This recovery has also helped to wipe out most of the losses recorded over the last week, and now, it is down only 1.81% in the last 7 days compared to over 20% losses being recorded last week.\n\nThis recovery also puts the digital asset close to the top of the list of gainers for the day. It sits only behind Lido DAO which is up over 16% in the last hours.\n\nAs for whether SOL will be able to maintain current prices and go higher, it depends on the momentum in the market. The cryptocurrency is still subject to intense FUD and community morale remains low but the $13 level remains within sights as long as buy pressure keeps up.\n\nFeatured image from Coin Culture, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Ethereum is still closely mirroring the price of bitcoin through the bear market and that has seen its price basically stall in the last day in tandem with BTC. ETH\u2019s price is presently resting just above $1,200, and while this would have served as a good bounce-off point for the digital asset, it shows no signs of doing so.\n\nEthereum Price Stuck At $1,200\n\nGiven the current market circumstances, Ethereum at $1,200 presents one of the best prices that the market will see for the digital asset before 2022 runs out. The momentum in the market was already on a decline but the 49% jump in Ethereum\u2019s trading volume in the last day put a perhaps temporary stop to that decline. Short-term indicators pointing towards sell points to this being temporary.\n\nNow, for the lull in price, it can be explained by ETH\u2019s price sitting so close to the 20-day moving average of $1,247. Since there isn\u2019t much movement in the market, it makes sense that the digital asset would only try to maintain its price at just above $1,200 at this time.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s tight correlation to the stock market has also impacted Ethereum. Although cryptocurrencies did not fall like the stock market following the release of the US GDP data on Thursday, it definitely hindered any growth from taking place in the market.\n\nETH price struggling at $1,200 | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nWhy Is ETH Struggling?\n\nEthereum has received some bad press over the last couple of days. One of the most prominent was when the Paxful peer-to-peer exchange announced that it was delisting Ethereum. CEO Ray Youssef presented the reason as \u201cIntegrity over revenue\u201d as the exchange believes that the network was not decentralized.\n\nThis stoked fears that had previously subsided following the move to proof of stake. For many, this move made Ethereum much easier to control and Youssef said, \u201cOne day you will need permission to use it.\u201d\n\nGiven this, the price of ETH has buckled under the pressure of the FUD it created. If bulls are unable to hold the $1,200 support, then it could send the digital asset into free fall, with no significant support until $1,140. The cryptocurrency is already headed for a close below its year-to-date peak but a close below $1,200 would see it start the new year with a very bearish outlook.\n\nETH is trading at $1,224 at the time of this writing, according to data from Coinmarketcap. It is up 0.64% in the last 24 hours and boasts a market cap of $149.8 billion.\n\nFeatured image from Ledger Insights, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "An analyst has explained that the absence of miners on the Ethereum network could be bullish for the ETHBTC ratio.\n\nMiners Provide A Persistent Selling Pressure On Bitcoin\n\nAs explained in a tweet by Tom Dunleavy, a Messari research analyst, BTC miners sell almost all the coins they mine. The below chart contains data about the top ten public Bitcoin mining companies, displaying information such as how much each of them mined this year, the amounts that they sold, and the size of their current holdings:\n\nLooks like Marathon is holding the largest reserve right now | Source: Tom Dunleavy on Twitter\n\nIn total, the ten largest mining companies in the space mined a collective 40.7 BTC this year and sold 40.3 BTC. This means that they roughly dumped the entire supply that they mined in 2022 and in the process, applied constant selling pressure on the network.\n\nEarlier in the year, Ethereum successfully transitioned to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, which means the blockchain no longer uses miners for handling transactions, and rather uses stakers (investors that have locked 32 ETH in the PoS contract) to act as validating nodes.\n\nIn a Proof-of-Work (PoW) system, miners compete with each other using large amounts of computing power. Therefore, many expenses are involved in getting up their facilities, but one cost, in particular, stays with them as long as they continue to operate: the electricity bills. It is because of these electricity bills that miners have to continuously sell what they mine to keep their business sustainable.\n\nSome miners try to hold onto their reserves for as long as possible, like Marathon, and Hut8 can be seen doing in the chart. Still, in a market like right now, where electricity prices have shot up while the BTC price has plummeted due to the bear, margins are fine for the already debt-ridden public miners, and thus most of them can\u2019t afford to accumulate.\n\nIn the case of a PoS chain, however, stakers don\u2019t incur such expenses and thus don\u2019t have any particular need to sell the rewards they earn while staking. This implies that the type of selling pressure that miners put on Bitcoin isn\u2019t present on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe analyst believes that this fact provides a good thesis to be bullish on the ETHBTC ratio.\n\nEthereum Price\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH is trading around $1,200, down 1% in the last week.\n\nThe value of the crypto doesn't seem to have moved much during the last few days | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Pierre Borthiry \u2013 Peiobty on Unsplash.com, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "In an interesting development, the U.S. Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) exerted jurisdictional power over Ethereum and stablecoins while calling them commodities. With this, the CFTC sets a direct confrontation with the U.S. SEC which is keen to treat all cryptocurrencies, except Bitcoin, as securities.\n\nInterestingly, the latest development also shows the non-alignment among US regulators to regulate the crypto space. Addressing the Senate Agriculture Committee on Wednesday, March 8, CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam said:\n\nadvertisement\n\n\u201cNot withstanding that, they are a commodity, and we have to police that market without a clear direction from Congress that they\u2019re some other type of asset. Based on the cases that we\u2019ve brought around stablecoins, I think that there\u2019s a strong legal argument that USDC and other similar stablecoins would be commodities\u201d.\n\nThe CFTC chair added that the fiat-backed stablecoins don\u2019t work with the expectation of profit and return to its holder. Thus, Behman was hinting that stablecoins shouldn\u2019t fall in the category of securities.\n\nAlso, the CFTC chair cited the investigation into Tether during a 2021 lawsuit. After that, Tether agreed to pay $40 million in settlement charges.\n\nCFTC Chair Calls Ethereum A Commodity\n\nNot only stablecoin, but Behnam also stated that Ethereum, the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency and Bitcoin competitor, is also a commodity. He added: \u201cIt\u2019s been listed on CFTC exchanges for quite some time, and for that reason,\u201d it creates a \u201cdirect jurisdictional hook\u201d for the CFTC to look after the Ethereum derivatives and underlying market.\n\n\u201cWe would not have allowed the Ether futures product to be listed on a CFTC exchange if we did not feel strongly that it was a commodity asset,\u201d added the CFTC chair. Furthermore, he added that his agency has \u201cserious legal defences\u201d to support their case.\n\nAdditionally, Rostin Behnam called out the Congress, seeking more clarity regarding the jurisdictional powers in regulating the crypto space. Behnam also demanded comprehensive regulatory legislation from Congress adding that enforcement alone is not enough to address the risks and consumer protection issues in crypto.\n\n\u201cAnd as our markets have proven, as our regulations have proven over many, many decades, comprehensive regulation can prevent fraud, can prevent manipulation, and can stabilize markets and ultimately protect customers,\u201d he said."

        "content": "ZKSync, an Ethereum layer-2 platform designed to scale transaction throughput using zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs and Rollups, has released a new software development kit (SDK) in Swift.\n\nZKSync Releases SDK in Swift\n\nIn a tweet on January 17, ZKSync said the goal is to make their features more accessible to developers and dApps. With a Swift SDK, ZKSync would support more platforms and use cases, especially for teams building iOS and macOS applications on ZKSync 2.0.\n\nWe want to make zkSync 2.0\u2019s features accessible to more developers and applications, so we\u2019ve released a new SDK in Swift. #scalingthemission 1/4 pic.twitter.com/GdH8naXxHI \u2014 zkSync (@zksync) January 17, 2023\n\nSwift is the programming language behind iOS and Mac devices. However, Swift cloud storage software for iOS and macOS enables users to retrieve data through an API. Cloud storage is scalable and designed to store unstructured data that can limitlessly grow.\n\nSDKs in Popular Programming Languages\n\nBesides Swift, ZKSync also supports Python, Java, Android, Rust, and Dart programming languages. Dart, the layer-2 platform explains, is the \u201cunofficial\u201d open-sourced SDK in Alpha. However, the layer-2 portal plans to support more SDKs in various programming languages to cater to their expanding developer community, allowing them to build more solutions addressing multiple problems.\n\nSDKs are critical for developers since they allow the building to be simpler, faster, and standardized. For creators to integrate into existing services, they require kits, which often include necessary documentation, code samples, libraries, APIs, and more, providing guidance when developing blockchain solutions. However, within any developer kit, APIs are critical because they act as an interface for dApps to relay information and coordinate.\n\nScaling Ethereum Using ZKSync v2\n\n\n\nZKSync layer-2 is building a solution for users to quickly transfer ethereum (ETH) and ERC-20 tokens without paying the relatively high fees in the mainnet.\n\nEthereum gas fees often fluctuate depending on on-chain activities. As ETH prices rally, DeFi and NFT activities often expand, leading to high gas fees. With Gas rising on a public, transparent layer, users have to pay more to transfer or execute smart contracts.\n\nETH price at $1,578 | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe layer-2 platform is positioning itself as a better alternative for teams and users, preferring scalability, privacy, and security. Following the launch of the ZKSync 2.0 mainnet, there is a scaling and privacy engine using ZK proofs. Earlier, Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, relayed his confidence in ZK Rollups that dApps on ZKSync leverages. In the co-founder\u2019s assessment, ZK Rollups \u201cwill win out in all use cases.\u201d\n\nZKSync 2.0 Is Live on Mainnet\n\nUsers deploying on the ZKSync 2.0 mainnet, which launched in Q4 2022, enjoy low fees and faster transaction settlement. Developers are free to experiment and add more features.\n\nFor instance, ZKSync supports account abstraction for users to pay fees in other tokens apart from ETH and build smart contracts in Vyper or Solidity. The layer-2 solution also supports Atomic Swaps. It is a feature that ZKSync creators say can benefit cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nNewsBTC reported earlier that Optimism, a general-purpose Ethereum layer-2, and ZKSync competitor, was more Gas efficient despite revenue and assets under its management dropping.\n\nFeatured image by Matter Labs, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "These Are My Top Risk-Averse Cryptocurrencies - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "After a strong start to the year, the crypto market has been trading sideways recently. There are concerns about the liquidity and ongoing viability of key crypto market intermediaries, as well as a considerable amount of anxiety about further Federal Reserve rate hikes.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, the race is on to find the best risk-averse cryptocurrencies. These are the cryptos that are most likely to hold on to their gains, even if the market starts to move downward. These are also the cryptos that are less volatile when it comes to daily market moves, due to their superior long-term growth prospects.\n\nBitcoin\n\nThe starting point is Bitcoin (BTC 0.86%), which remains the most popular crypto in the market for both retail and institutional investors. At a current price of $22,385, Bitcoin has a total market cap of more than $432 billion, which represents approximately 40% of the market cap of the entire crypto market. For many investors, Bitcoin is the first crypto they ever add to their portfolios, as well as the one crypto they are most likely to buy and hold.\n\nWhile everybody knows about the tremendous gains that Bitcoin is capable of producing, what might not be as well-known is how well Bitcoin has bounced back from previous market meltdowns and crypto collapses. In its history, Bitcoin has staged at least five different comebacks, including one time in 2011 when the price of Bitcoin almost fell to $0.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Bitcoin's decline of 65% in 2022 is not as troubling to longtime crypto investors. Remember: Bitcoin fell by 73% in 2018 but later recovered and eventually soared to an all-time high in 2021.\n\nWhile Bitcoin has been notoriously volatile in the past, it is actually losing much of its famed volatility. Traders now are actually complaining that Bitcoin is not volatile enough, since the crypto has been trading in a relatively narrow trading range since mid-2022. In fact, Bitcoin is starting to trade much more like a large high-tech stock than a risky crypto in 2023.\n\nFinally, Bitcoin is becoming increasingly diversified on an international scale as it becomes an important part of the global economy. Brazil just put into place a comprehensive framework for the use of Bitcoin, while other countries are looking to ramp up the use of Bitcoin within their financial systems. The latest survey on Bitcoin payments highlights the potential for Bitcoin adoption to grow 50% by the year 2025.\n\nEthereum\n\nAnother risk-averse cryptocurrency is Ethereum (ETH 1.46%), which has a massive market cap of $191.6 billion, trailing only Bitcoin in terms of market size. Like Bitcoin, Ethereum has become a popular crypto for both retail and institutional investors, and now accounts for nearly 20% of the entire market cap of the entire crypto industry.\n\nWhat makes Ethereum unique is the size and scope of its ecosystem, which now includes everything from non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to decentralized finance (DeFi). It also includes blockchain gaming, metaverse platforms, and decentralized applications using smart contracts. This provides a tremendous amount of diversification and enables Ethereum investors to diversify away some of the systemic risk found within the crypto market.\n\nEthereum also remains the top Layer 1 blockchain network, giving investors the peace of mind of knowing they are investing in a best-in-class crypto. Back in 2021, it looked like a handful of Layer 1 blockchain upstarts might unseat Ethereum.\n\nHowever, last year Ethereum completed The Merge, which was one of the most celebrated feats ever in the crypto and blockchain industry. As a result, Ethereum is cheaper, faster, and more efficient than ever. And this gives it a tremendous economic moat to fend off potential \"Ethereum killers.\"\n\nShould you buy Bitcoin or Ethereum?\n\nAt the end of the day, Bitcoin and Ethereum both offer an optimal blend of risk and reward. Both are capable of churning out massive upside performance. At the same time, both are relatively less risky than other, more speculative coins in the crypto market. Sure, Bitcoin or Ethereum might not have the stratospheric upside potential of a hot new AI crypto token, but you also don't have to worry about Bitcoin or Ethereum falling to $0 overnight.\n\nI'm bullish both short term and long term on these two cryptos, and I think they should be the building blocks of any diversified crypto portfolio. They are two cryptos you can buy and hold forever."

        "content": "Ether (ETH) bulls are facing a do-or-die moment, as the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization that powers the dominant smart-contract-enabled Ethereum blockchain retests key support in the form of its 200-Day Moving Average in the $1,420s.\n\nThe ETH price briefly dipped below the 200DMA to hit $1,408, before regaining some composure to trade closer to $1,450 once again. But ETH/USD is still trading down by around 6% on the day, as per TradingView, and by more than 8% in the past 24 hours, as per CoinMarketCap.\n\nCryptocurrency markets have been taking a broad beating on Thursday in wake of Wednesday's collapse of crypto-friendly bank Silvergate, which has raised concerns that fellow crypto-friendly financial institutions SVB Financial and Signature Bank might be next.\n\nThe demise of Silvergate is widely viewed as a blow to crypto adoption, given the bank\u2019s prior efforts to better connect the fiat monetary system and crypto exchanges via its now-shuttered 24/7 wire transfer service between the two.\n\nOngoing macro headwinds, with the US dollar and US yields having seen significant upside in recent weeks as markets up their Fed tightening bets, have been compounding things. Crypto traders will be nervously watching Friday\u2019s US jobs report and next week\u2019s US CPI report, which could determine whether or not the Fed hikes interest rates by 25 or 50 bps later this month.The 200DMA is Key to ETH\u2019s Near-term Outlook\n\nThe 200DMA is viewed as a key technical level by most traders. A break above or below it can signal, or act as confirmation of a significant shift in the market\u2019s near-term momentum. Meanwhile, if the market finds strong support at the 200DMA, or fails an attempt to break above it, this is also sometimes interpreted as a signal that the market isn\u2019t ready to shift direction just yet, and may revert to its prior trend.\n\nIndeed, the 200DMA has certainly been a key level for Ethereum in recent months. It acted as a ceiling to the price action twice in 2022 (April and November), twice confirming that the Ether bear market was still in play. Meanwhile, Ether\u2019s decisive break above its 200DMA in mid-January was viewed as a signal that the 2022 bear market might well be over, with the cryptocurrency going on to find strong support above it in mid-February.\n\nIt would be a significant blow to the market\u2019s near-term sentiment if Ethereum was to lose its grip on its 200DMA. Indeed, a swift test of the mid-December highs in the $1,350s would become overwhelmingly likely, with a break below here possibly opening the door to a run lower towards November\u2019s sub-$1,100 lows.\n\nOne saving grace for ETH might come in the form of its 14-Day Relative Strength Index (RSI), which is close to entering over-sold territory, signaling some consolidation might soon be in order."

My one assumption is that his accountant warned him these tokens would count as income on his tax sheet.

        "title": "What are Bitcoin ordinals? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "What are Bitcoin NFTs? Bitcoin NFTs \u2014 aka Bitcoin ordinals, aka digital artifacts \u2014 are a way to inscribe digital content on the Bitcoin blockchain. The Bitcoin ordinals protocol was launched in January 2023 by Casey Rodarmor. The protocol allows inscribing of digital content like art onto the Bitcoin blockchain. Unlike nonfungible tokens (NFTs) on Ethereum and other blockchains, Rodarmor wanted to create an immutable on-chain presence of a piece of art, text or video. The genesis ordinal was a pixel art of a skull that Rodarmor inscribed on Dec. 14, 2022. As the NFT space based on Ethereum\u2019s ERC-721 standard skyrocketed in 2021, Rodarmor, who was a programmer and an artist, saw the opportunity to create a similar yet unique experience on the Bitcoin blockchain. His solution was Bitcoin ordinals, based on ordinal theory, which he went on to implement through 2022. Ordinal theory concerns itself with satoshis, giving them individual identities and allowing them to be tracked, transferred and imbued with meaning. The ordinals hype really kicked off in February 2023, six weeks after the genesis ordinal was created. The number of inscriptions doubled every week for a few weeks. However, the number could have been much higher if the infrastructure to inscribe and trade ordinals had been better planned and executed. The rise of Bitcoin ordinals has seen the Bitcoin network explode in terms of usage, fees and storage space as shown in the chart above. This may also be the first big breakthrough for the Bitcoin application tier and can help move the narrative from a pure \u201cstore of value\u201d to something more utilitarian.\n\nHow do Bitcoin ordinals work? Bitcoin ordinals are based on ordinals theory that essentially has brought life to satoshis (sats) and allows them to be treated as atomic units on the Bitcoin blockchain. Ordinals, in their simplest state, are a numbering scheme for sats. Ordinals theory drives the mechanics behind how Bitcoin ordinals work. Ordinals theory defines satoshis (sats) as the atomic unit that can be identified and traded individually on the Bitcoin network. There are 100 million sats that make up 1 Bitcoin (BTC). Sats are numbered based on the order of mining, and this number, which uniquely identifies a sat, is an ordinal number. Related: Bitcoin vs. Satoshi: Key differences explained By being a unit of transaction, sats can also be inscribed with digital content that make up Bitcoin ordinals. They become immutable digital collectibles that can be transacted on the Bitcoin network using Bitcoin wallets. As per ordinal theory, sats can be attached to security tokens, accounts or stablecoins using ordinal numbers as stable identifiers. Due to the broad set of use cases that ordinals can support, Rodarmor prefers not to equate Bitcoin ordinals with NFTs. The use case of ordinals to number a sat that\u2019s been attached to or inscribed with a JPEG can be called a nonfungible token on the Bitcoin blockchain. Although the ordinal\u2019s use that found market fit is that of NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain, ordinals are much more than just nonfungible tokens.\n\nHow to mine Bitcoin ordinals? Mining, minting or inscribing Bitcoin ordinals are the terms that have been used to refer to this process. Unlike minting NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain, which is a relatively matured process, mining Bitcoin ordinals is a technically complex process and lacks intuitive tools. Bitcoin ordinals, in the initial days, could only be mined by those who ran a Bitcoin node. For tech-savvy users, a Bitcoin node with the ord app, a command line wallet, would be the gateway to mining ordinals. Node operators would load their wallets with some sats to pay for the gas fees and perform an inscribing process on their ordinals. However, no-code ordinal mining applications like the Gamma or the Ordinals Bot aim to allow users to upload the content that they want to inscribe to create their Bitcoin ordinal. The user journey takes them through a payment process using a QR code and is intuitive enough for the less technically gifted. The tools around Bitcoin ordinals are still at a very early stage. It has only been a few months since the genesis ordinals were inscribed. As demand from ordinary users and followers increases, the ecosystem and the tooling should start maturing with more user-friendly journeys.\n\nHow to buy, sell and trade ordinals Much like the process of minting Bitcoin ordinals, the trading process hasn\u2019t had the matured tooling. Yet there are a few tools to trade these digital artifacts. As Bitcoin ordinals grow in popularity, most of the trades have been largely over-the-counter. Collections, such as \u201cPlanetary Ordinals\u201d and \u201cBitcoin Punks,\u201d among the first 1,000 inscriptions were transacted mostly without an NFT marketplace such as OpenSea or Blur. However, tools like the Ordinals Wallet, Hiro and Xverse allow users to buy and sell Bitcoin ordinals. Users can buy some sats within the wallet, using on-ramp payment plugins, and perform the transactions to buy and sell ordinals. The typical user journey involved in buying Bitcoin ordinals using Ordinals Wallet is as follows. Go to ordinalswallet.com Click on \u201cCreate Wallet\u201d Take a backup of the recovery phrase for your wallet Set up a password for wallet access Use the address of the Ordinals Wallet to send some sats to the wallet Go to \u201cCollections\u201d at the top of the page Choose the ordinals collection and the inscription that you would like to buy Buy the ordinal (using the sats in your wallet).\n\nHow have ordinals been perceived by the broader Bitcoin ecosystem? Bitcoin ordinals are a great innovation that can highlight various applications unique to the chain, thereby driving developers to participate and create the tools needed by users. Bitcoin ordinals have certainly seen a hype that potentially peaked sometime in February 2023, based on transaction data. However, the hype around the application tier on the Bitcoin blockchain is just getting started. For instance, Stacks (STX) has seen a rise in price since the ordinals episode warmed up. It is clearly the early days for the Bitcoin ecosystem, but if developers are attracted to the chain, then the network effects between developers and users could come in time for the next crypto cycle. Related: Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem explained However, there are downsides to the way ordinals have been designed. As the inscribed content is all on-chain with ordinals unlike with most Ethereum-based NFTs, the size of the blockchain would increase. As new applications emerge and network utilization and transactions increase, so will the cost of transactions. The other potential impact of Bitcoin ordinals is whether it will affect the fungibility of sats. So far, satoshis have been exchanged with one sat being valued the same as another. With various applications of ordinals, this may not be true in the future. A sat with a Bitcoin Punk inscribed in it could be priced differently. Nonetheless, it would be interesting to see how this narrative evolves over the next few months and years."

        "title": "Why Sending 'Free' Coins to Vitalik Buterin May Soon Be Illegal - DailyCoin",
        "content": "ETH founder Vitalik Buterin receives s *** coins daily. Few are worth anything.\n\n*** Projects send out free tokens for marketing purposes or to raise their profile.\n\nUnwanted airdrops may violate securities regulations if they benefit the distributor.\n\nCrypto users have to deal with an incessant amount of spam. As a major name in the industry, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin receives numerous unsolicited token drops daily. Few are worth anything.\n\nOn Monday, Buterin decided to get rid of some of his unwanted tokens. According to data from Etherscan, he sold nearly $700,000 worth of SHIK, CULT, and MOPS tokens.\n\nProjects like Shikoku Inu (SHIK), which gifted Vitalik 50% of the token supply, send unsolicited tokens for several reasons. For one, it helps with marketing. Airdroping to famous people helps raise the profile of a token. Crypto projects that don\u2019t have a lot going for them can claim association with a big name in the industry.\n\nThis strategy is not without its risks. SHIK token dropped 86% after Vitalik dumped all his holdings. However, that risk doesn\u2019t deter most s***coin projects from sending worthless tokens.\n\nOn Tuesday, Buterin\u2019s wallet received 500,000,000 \u201cVitalik Jeeterin,\u201d 4,200,000,000,000 \u201cJeetalik Buter Inu,\u201d and 99,000,000,000,000 \u201cVitalik Dont Sell\u201d tokens. According to Etherscan, these tokens are worth exactly $0.\n\nWill the SEC Crack Down on Airdrops?\n\nWhat could potentially deter s***coin airdrops in the future is tougher securities regulation. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is going after securities offering in crypto. Airdrops are not safe from the SEC crackdown.\n\nAlthough technically free, an airdrop could still violate securities regulations, according to Nirav Gala, CFA at Vivriti Asset Management.\n\n\u201cAs has been held in the case of SEC v. Sierra Brokerage Servs., Inc, as long as the issuer receives some real benefit by disposing of securities, it is considered a sale of securities,\u201d Gala said.\n\nA \u201creal benefit\u201d could be anything from marketing and promotion, getting referrals, increasing traffic to their website, and so on. With a definition so broad, any form of an airdrop could fit the SEC\u2019s definition.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is,\u201d Gala said,\u201d no matter how you structure an airdrop, it will always result in a direct or indirect benefit for the issuer, and thus would be considered a sale of securities by the SEC,\u201d Gala concluded.\n\nIt is unclear how the SEC will enforce a ban on airdrops. In the meantime, crypto users can simply hide unwanted tokens in their wallet interfaces.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nButerin still holds 10,000,000,420 CULT tokens, worth $89,000, according to his wallet data. It\u2019s unclear why the Ethereum founder held on to that amount other than to reference the \u201c420\u201d meme.\n\nThe SEC has been cracking down on segments of the crypto industry ever since the FTX crash.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nToken spam is mostly a nuisance but can also be a serious problem. Scammers will sometimes use spam tokens to steal a person\u2019s wallet information. It\u2019s always best not to interact with these tokens.\n\nRead more about Vitalik\u2019s views on crypto:\n\nEthereum Founder Vitalik Buterin Bashes Governance Token Speculation, Calls it \u201cPathological\u201d\n\nRead more about the SEC crackdown on exchanges:\n\nBinance Leaks Spell Trouble with SEC, \u2018Nuclear Fallout\u2019"

        "title": "Observers Assess Coinbase's Base as A Bold Bet on Ethereum and L2 Infrastructure - Securities.io",
        "content": "Last month, Coinbase announced the launch of its Ethereum layer two network Base in collaboration with Optimism. The platform's launch in the last full week of February aligned with the company's master plan to onboard a billion people into crypto, in this case, by aiming to slash the transaction fees on the Ethereum network to one cent and eventually integrating with other networks such as Avalanche and Solana. America's largest exchange choice to build on Ethereum was an endorsement of the chain and a move expected to stimulate innovation in DeFi and NFTs and attract more institutional investors to the space. The Base offering notably pulled the exchange into a layer-two race that has already been heated for a while now.\n\nThe latest on Coinbase's L2 blockchain\n\nCoinbase described Base as a secure, low-cost, developer-friendly platform for builders to create applications. Leveraging the modular, open-source OP Stack, Base would work with other layer two networks and layer ones like Solana. Following the testnet release, decentralization advocate Chris Blec published a blog post about the new blockchain. Blec explained that in the current dispensation, layer two infrastructure is highly centralized as it uses sequencers to aggregate and batch transactions.\n\nIn the case of Base, Coinbase, as the sole sequencer, will be responsible for aggregating and publishing transactions to the Ethereum layer one. Blec suggested that Base would be obligated to abide by the same demands since the crypto exchange has to comply with certain legal requirements, such as the Bank Secrecy Act. He further pointed out that Base might implement know-your-customer (KYC) requirements and AML, becoming the first layer two platforms to do so and contravening the very essence of decentralization.\n\nTo learn more about Optimism, check out our Investing in Optimism guide.\n\nBase integrates Chainlink\n\nChainlink, which saw its price feeds integrated into the Base testnet and onboarded the layer two platform into the scale program last week, has recently seen some of the largest transactions in the last three months. Market intelligence platform Santiment pointed out that a Chainlink whale moved as much as $79.7 million in a series of transactions late last Friday.\n\nThe on-chain analytics firm observed that in the late hours of Friday, there were three massive whale transactions to the tune of 11.6 million LINK, all completed within 11 minutes. Notably, Lookonchain also noted these transactions, explaining that the same addresses had sent 17.5 million LINK ($124 million) to Binance in August last year and a further 14.55 million LINK ($90 million) in November. Explorer tool Etherscan shows the whale's most recent token transfers came from three distinct non-circulating supply addresses and ended up in Binance, where the LINK could be sold in the open market.\n\nTo learn more about Chainlink, check out our Investing in Chainlink guide.\n\nCEO Brian Armstrong says Base will likely monitor transactions\n\nSpeaking with Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong on Bloomberg Radio recently, Odd Lots podcast host Joe Weisenthal queried what role the crypto exchange would play in terms of compliance as a regulated entity running Base. Armstrong acknowledged that presently, certain components of Base are centralized, but the layer two network would adopt decentralization over time. The exchange executive added that Base would likely feature transaction monitoring and AML requirements for users as part of the responsibility of centralized actors.\n\nArmstrong's statement could have been clearer, as it did not elucidate whether he meant it to refer specifically to centralized actors operating on Base or to all centralized actors. When it first announced Base, Coinbase said that its layer two solution would become progressively decentralized, but that did not mean disregarding regulatory compliance. Moreover, Coinbase said that though Base would be accessible to all developers at launch, it would be a home for Coinbase's on-chain products, meaning any current products that Coinbase incorporates with Base will likely uphold their existing KYC/AML procedures.\n\nEclipse launches Polygon SVM for seamless Solana developer migration\n\nIn related news last week, Polygon Ventures' portfolio company Eclipse announced Polygon SVM, a blockchain compatible with the Solana ecosystem. The news generated excitement in the Solana community, as the upcoming chain will allow Solana developers to easily move their apps to Polygon without rebuilding their code for Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility.\n\nSolana's interoperability with Polygon, outside of the EVM\n\nPolygon SVM leverages optimistic roll-up technology to generate blocks, allowing Rust developers to port their code from Solana to Eclipse and deploy it on the Polygon network. Speaking to The Block, Eclipse founder Neel Somani observed that currently, Solana developers are constrained by the fact that they have to rewrite all smart contract code if they would like to migrate to Polygon. Somani also noted that the introduction of Polygon SVM presents an opportunity for collaboration in areas such as gaming, which have garnered significant interest from the Polygon and Solana communities.\n\nBy running smart contracts and tooling compatible with Solana, Polygon SVM would ultimately proliferate throughput speed and interoperability for sects, including gaming and DeFi in crypto. Decentralized applications (dApps) built for Solana can also migrate or become multi-chain via the SVM, allowing developers from the two communities to exist and grow on different blockchains. Eclipse views the recent launch only as the beginning for scaling and checks out for the rollup-centric future school of thought in helping make base layer ones faster and cheaper. The Solana Foundation grant recipient plans a testnet launch for Polygon SVM in Q1 before a mainnet launch can be scheduled for Q2 this year.\n\nTo learn more, check out our Polygon vs. Solana guide."

        "title": "Ethereum's Ideological Battle with Communism - Myrepublica",
        "content": "If humans cannot be trusted to do what's best for them, why not pass the responsibility onto something that could - an AI? According to a recent survey conducted by IE University in Madrid, approximately 30 percent of the 25,000 people surveyed said they would be willing to be governed by AI. One of the main reasons for this line of thinking is that people have simply lost faith in their political leaders and believe that machines would be able to make better, fairer, and more rational decisions that would benefit everyone.\n\nVitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum, recently sparked a thought-provoking conversation with his tweet: \"What even is an institution?\" Accompanying the tweet was a blog post by Dennis Pourteaux titled \"Institutional Alignment\" with a subtitle of \"Navigating a Disorienting Era with a New Political Matrix.\" This highlights the significance and relevance of institutions in today's rapidly changing world, particularly for disenfranchised youth. The tweet and blog post come at a time when people around the world feel that institutions such as parliament, political parties, bureaucracy, and central banks - that we are used to - are already obsolete. The new paradigm of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) has emerged as a fit for the 21st century digital world.\n\nWith the tweet, Vitalik successfully prompted many people to question whether institutions like the government still serve a valuable purpose in society, as well as the effectiveness of current institutions. If the government is not fulfilling its purpose and delivering value to society, what roles can encryption, artificial intelligence, automation, and cryptocurrency play in shaping and refining our society and its institutions? In a similar fashion, Dennis argues that the disastrous institutional failures of the last decade have brought the question of their value and purpose in society to the forefront. Therefore, it is time for us to take a hard look at the role of government and other institutions in shaping our world and collectively ensure the greater good is delivered to society.\n\nThe Nepal Rastra Bank, the central bank of Nepal, has declared a ban on the use of cryptocurrencies. Even though the ban was implemented due to concerns over the absence of proper regulation and the potential for financial fraud, this decision is akin to banning the internet in the 90s. Despite the republican setup portraying itself as one of the most progressive to date, many believe that its policies, and those of most political parties, are outdated and do not align with modern thinking. The current government and political parties can be described as being stuck in the past, failing to keep pace with modern technological advancements. At its core, communism advocates for the abolition of private property and the creation of a classless society in which the means of production are collectively owned and controlled by the people. However, Ethereum enables individuals to create and manage their own digital assets through smart contracts, effectively allowing for the creation of private property within the platform. The interplay between these opposing forces is sure to be intriguing to observe.\n\nThe traditional institutions of democracy, politics, and bureaucracy are at risk of becoming defunct. With the advent of ChatGPT, people's hopes of replacing heads of state with AI have increased. In an article titled \"AI presidents \u2013 a good idea or a disaster waiting to happen?\" Richard van Hooijdonk discusses how the idea of having an AI president is gaining ground as the public becomes increasingly disillusioned with their current political leaders, who have failed to govern people based on facts and common sense, instead letting their emotions influence their decisions. Unfortunately, this is unlikely to change anytime soon. If humans cannot be trusted to do what's best for them, why not pass the responsibility onto something that could - an AI? In any case, government leaders will not be exempt from the upcoming robotic revolution, especially in light of the public's growing disillusionment with those in power.\n\nBrilliant individuals such as Elon Musk and the late Stephen Hawking have echoed this grim vision by repeatedly warning about the existential threat that AI poses to humanity. However, many people seem to have a different outlook. According to a recent survey conducted by IE University in Madrid, approximately 30 percent of the 25,000 people surveyed said they would be willing to be governed by AI. One of the main reasons for this line of thinking is that people have simply lost faith in their political leaders and believe that machines would be able to make better, fairer, and more rational decisions that would benefit everyone.\n\nOne of the big problems with human leaders is that they are selfish mammals, while an artificial intelligence president could be truly altruistic,\" says Bart Selman, a professor of computer science at Cornell University. \"Humans are actually quite poor at making compromises or looking at issues from multiple perspectives. I think there\u2019s a possibility that machines could use psychological theories and behavioral ideas to help us govern and live much more in harmony.\n\nAt first, the idea of having an AI president may seem silly. However, considering that people already trust AI to perform tasks such as driving cars and airplanes, managing bank accounts, and making medical diagnoses, it may not be such a big leap to entrust the governing of a country to an AI.\n\nIn fact, some experts already believe that an AI president could potentially make more rational and impartial decisions, free from the biases and emotions that often influence human leaders. With advancements in technology, we could even envision building a new Nepal on Ethereum network and electing an AI president. While this idea may still seem far-fetched to some, it's worth considering the potential benefits and exploring the possibilities that technology can offer in shaping our future. Ethereum has the potential to disrupt old institutions, particularly those that rely on centralized leadership and control."

        "content": "By EWN \u2022 Published: 09 Mar 2023 \u2022 10:00\n\nThe renowned crypto analyst, and the famous YouTuber Nicholas Marten\u2019s recent price prediction on Ethereum, one of the top cryptocurrencies in the market, has shocked crypto investors across the world.\n\nEthereum faces a gloomy future\n\nEthereum is the second biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation. The currency is, at the time of writing, trading at 68.05% lower than its all-time high value. Though the coin has been in revival mode since the beginning of this year, the price fell below $1,600 due to the silver gate bank\u2019s insolvency crisis. Before that, Ethereum was trying to breach the $1,677 mark but failed to achieve it. On Thursday, Nicholas Martin, founder of the DataDash, one of the largest YouTube channels for cryptocurrencies with over 500K Subscribers, shared his prediction on the Ethereum price action. In his video, he expressed his disappointment over Ethereum not being able to elevate beyond $1,600-$1,800 for multiple months. He also said that if Ethereum sees again what it saw in previous bear markets, it could go down to just a few hundred dollars.\n\nAs his prediction sent shock waves across the crypto community, other crypto analysts predicted Ethereum would rise. Chris Burniske, the founder of the venture firm Placeholder, predicted that if the dollar and rates slip lower, Bitcoin could push through $25,000. And Ethereum could also see another round of fireworks if it follows the trend. Another crypto analyst Guy Turne, who is also the host of YouTube Series Coin bureau, predicts a bright future for Ethereum. Garner said that he can only see Ethereum growing. Over the past 30 days, Ethereum\u2019s price decreased by 6.0%. In the past week alone it lost 4.5% in its price.\n\nFloki Inu \u2013 No Looking Back\n\nIf Floki Vikings, an investors community of Floki Inu meme-coin, has anyone to thank, it\u2019s certainly Elon Musk. The World\u2019s Richest man\u2019s single tweet has skyrocketed its price to surge by 489% since the beginning of this year. It also broke into the list of top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalisation in late February.\n\nOn 25 June 2021, Elon musk tweeted that he named his Shiba Inu breed dog Floki. It was how the Floki Inu meme-coin came into existence. It has a long relationship with Elon Musk\u2019s family. Floki Inu is the partner of The Million Gardens Movement founded by Elon Musk\u2019s brother Kimbel Musk. On February 15, right after Elon Musk published his dog Floki\u2019s pic posing as the CEO of Twitter, the meme-coin market witnessed a sudden surge in price. Floki Inu utilised the hype and became the top gainer. Since then Floki Inu has been outperforming the crypto analysts\u2019 predictions. It also surpassed its rivals Dogecoin and Shiba Inu by trading volume. With an ambitious goal of becoming the world\u2019s most used cryptocurrency, it released a road map for 2023 consisting of 4 phases and 18 amazing plans. It has recently secured a strategic marketing partnership with the Real Madrid Football club. As part of this partnership, Floki Inu\u2019s sign will be displayed during Real Madrid Home Games.\n\nBig Eyes Coin \u2013 $31 Million and Counting\n\nBig Eyes Coin, a cat-themed, cryptocurrency is reaching new heights in the meme-coin market filled with Dogs. Big Eyes Coin\u2019s presale was rolled out in 2022. In the beginning, a single unit of BIG token cost only $0.0001. Now in stage 12 of the presale, a single unit of BIG token costs 0.00049, which is a 390% rise from the initial price. The price will be increased to $0.0006 at launch. Big Eyes Coin is planning to donate 5% of its total supply to save oceans. It promised not to impose any tax or fee. Big Eyes Coin is planning to launch an NFT called Sushi crew where users can buy exclusive digital assets. It also made a few notable charities to help children, pet animals, elderly people, and the people of Turkey who lost their livelihood in the earthquake. Big Eyes\u2019 unique features and concern for the community have been bringing more investors to its ecosystem. It has raised more than 31 million dollars in the presale. To encourage investors, it has recently released 5 types of loot boxes at different prices which could offer the BIG tokens worth up to one million dollars. As each and every loot box has BIG tokens worth equal to or more than what they cost to open, the investors won\u2019t lose even a penny.

The Ethereum co-founder had ditched other meme coins like MOPS, SHIK, and CULT. Cumulatively, these tokens earned him over $300,000.\n\nMeanwhile, Buterin\u2019s latest warning has negatively impacted the meme coin\u2019s price performance. The token has fallen by 27% in the last 24 hours, according to dexscreener data.\n\nAnother developer sends Buterin 450 trillion unsolicited tokens\n\nDingo\u2019s deployer sent 50% of the asset\u2019s total supply \u2014 450 trillion tokens \u2014 to Vitalik Buterin\u2019s public address on March 8. According to on-chain data, the deployer also burnt 50 trillion of the token\u2019s supply.\n\nBlockchain analytical firm Arkham Intelligence reported the transfer and questioned the motive of the deployer. According to the firm, Buterin had recently sold off unsolicited tokens sent to his addresses.\n\nDingo is an ERC-20 token designed to burn 10% of the tokens involved in every transaction. According to its website, the burn function would help to control its overall supply and increase its value over time.\n\nIts five-phase roadmap showed it was supposed to reach 100,000 holders by the fourth quarter of 2022. However, it has only 444 holders as of press time.\n\nThe website showed no further information about its use case or other details. The token was previously deployed on Binance Smart Chain, according to tweets seen on its Twitter page.\n\nThe token is available on the decentralized exchange Uniswap.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Flashbots is seeking to raise $50 million with a $1 billion pre-money valuation, according to The Block, citing sources aware of the deal.\n\nPitch To Flashbots For A Chance to Invest\n\nAs they look to crowdfund, it has been revealed that Flashbots is doing a \u201creverse pitching\u201d where interested investors have to pitch, not the other way around. In this arrangement, investors confident of Flashbots\u2019 prospects must explain, in detail, why they should have a slot in this investment round.\n\nEventually, the goal is to raise between $30 million and $50 million in \u201cequity investment,\u201d pushing the firm\u2019s valuation to unicorn status. Flashbot plans to split this investment round into two.\n\nAlthough Paradigm didn\u2019t respond publicly to the publication\u2019s request for comment or comment on the inquiry, details reveal that the crypto fund was among the first to show interest. They participated in Flashbots\u2019 seed sale in 2020. However, Flashbots didn\u2019t indicate the amount raised in the seed sale.\n\nFlashbots is a research and development organization claiming to negate the effects of maximum extraction value (MEV) in account-based blockchains like Ethereum and the BNB Smart Chain (BSC).\n\nSpecifically, Flashbots focuses on Ethereum, where the costs of MEV can be high considering the high on-chain activity and the impact of gas fees, which is also relatively high versus other more scalable networks, including BSC. Their involvement, Flashbots\u2019s documents explain, avoids the \u201cexistential risks MEV could cause to state-rich blockchains like Ethereum.\u201d\n\nTackling MEV\n\nMEV in blockchains is the maximum value that can be extracted from block production after validators, tasked with confirming transactions and securing the network, include or even re-order transactions in a block.\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, where transaction order is given, in Ethereum and similar networks, ordering is haphazard. It means profit-seeking validators can prioritize transactions tagged with higher fees.\n\nThis explains why whenever the MEV in a block is higher than the network block reward, a validator can decide to re-order transactions in a block, creating vectors for possible centralization and exploitation.\n\nRelated Reading: ViaBTC Capital | Reasons Behind Solana\u2019s Frequent Downtime: Design Flaws in the Gas Economy\n\nFlashbots curbs this problem using MEV Boost. It is software allowing builders to auction blocks to validators, averting MEV centralization. Each party earns a fee for their contribution.\n\nFlashbots\u2019s recent open source tool, Single Unifying Auctions for Value Expression (SUAVE), further decentralizes and avails, to everyone, including competitors, the MEV Boost.\n\nThe reason for open-sourcing SUAVE is novel and meant to help the entire ecosystem grow stronger by proper decentralization.\n\nIn Devcon Bogota, Philip Daian of Flashbots said:\n\n\u201cSo, we\u2019re going to use MEV as this decentralized engine in the long term to make sure the users get the best execution on their trades in a way that will make TradFi look embarrassing very shortly.\u201d\n\nFeature Image by The Block, Chart from Trading View\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Bitcoin vs Ethereum: How Is Ethereum Different From Bitcoin - ClearTax",
        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum are the Xbox and Playstation of the cryptocurrency world. They are two of the most popular cryptocurrencies whose contribution to the sector's growth has been enormous. From price to the premise, their concepts are unique but with a few things in common.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin?\n\nUsers under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto first created the concept of Bitcoin in 2008. Bitcoin allows users to manage a currency not controlled by any financial institution or government.\n\nA set of decentralised networks runs the Bitcoin blockchain software with its own rules to which every participant must agree. These rules determine how every transaction works. It was the first cryptocurrency based on DLT (Decentralized Ledger Technology) blockchain.\n\nThe Bitcoin network processes multiple data sets and converts them into hashes through an algorithm called the SHA-256 hash function. It processes data and converts them into long strings of numbers.\n\nBitcoin's mining and consensus mechanism ensures that users cannot spend their funds twice, enabling it to stand out as a tamper-proof currency. Moreover, Bitcoin also features a store of value, which users can stock as an asset and use over time. Bitcoin's hassle-free mode of transactions has increased its popularity over time.\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nThe Ethereum network was launched in July 2015, and its co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, published its white paper in 2013. Ethereum uses its blockchain to create a decentralised computer, like interacting with applications and making transactions based on the Ethereum network.\n\nThe main goal of Ethereum was to decentralise everything on the internet. This cryptocurrency operates on its programming language and solidity and is surging daily on the ladders of innovation. For instance, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and decentralised financial service applications are examples of what developers can create using Ethereum-based smart contracts.\n\nUsers must pay a fee for creating smart contracts, paying for transactions, and using decentralised apps in Ether. Today, as this ambitious cryptocurrency's value is increasing, it is also being used to store value.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum: Overview\n\nQuite often, these two biggies of the crypto world are compared against each other. However, you should know that Bitcoin and Ethereum are merely systems, whilst the cryptocurrencies these two systems use are called bitcoin (small letter b) and Ether. Their respective stock symbols are:\n\nbitcoin: BTC\n\nEther: ETH\n\nMain takeaways: Bitcoin v/s Ethereum\n\nParticulars Bitcoin Ethereum Currency v/s platform A feasible alternative to traditional currency. Acts as a medium of exchange and store of value. A platform that runs programmatic applications and contracts via Ether. Launch date January 2009 July 2015 Price** \u00a323,756 \u00a31,575 Market cap** \u00a3478 bn \u00a3191 bn Consensus mechanism Proof of work Proof of stake Block time 10 minutes 12 to 14 seconds Max supply 21 million Unlimited\n\n**Please note that the abovementioned data is current as of 27th May 2022 and is subject to change over time.\n\nSpeaking of how similar these two systems are, both use blockchain technology to record and validate all their transactions. However, Ethereum's upcoming change plans differ concerning accessibility, sustainability, and speed.\n\nBefore discussing their major difference in the consensus mechanism, let's understand what a consensus mechanism is.\n\nConsensus Mechanism\n\nA consensus mechanism refers to a computer algorithm which mainly aims at solving the problem of 'double spending' by making any blockchain viable. BTC is a string of codes that can be infinitely copied. In other words, you can become as wealthy as you want to be by simply making multiple copies of your BTC.\n\nHowever, the reality is very different. Every time you spend a bitcoin, its copy gets destroyed, and the recipient on the other side of the transaction receives a new version. A record of all details of transactions is maintained on a distributed ledger, where the world can see that you have spent your BTC.\n\nThe ledger holders' consensus would clearly indicate the fake one if you attempt to spend a copied version. Counterfeiting even one such transaction would be difficult, and then you have to modify each transaction since all of them are correlated.\n\nTo work around this, you either have to control at least 51% of that network's mining hash rate or have massive computing power. Therefore, an attack as such on Bitcoin or Ethereum is probable but still hypothetical. From the very beginning, Bitcoin and Ethereum used distinct consensus mechanisms. Bitcoin uses 'proof of work' while Ethereum aims at using a 'proof of stake' consensus mechanism.\n\nBitcoin: Proof of Work\n\nProof of work (PoW) is the decentralised consensus mechanism, where network members put feasible amounts of effort to deter anyone from gaming the system. It is mainly used in cryptocurrency mining for mining new tokens and validating transactions.\n\nProof of Work: Understanding\n\n'Work' involves estimating a unique 64 characters string that is alphanumeric as accurately as possible. Within a 10-minute window, anyone making the maximum number of guesses per second has the highest chance of being chosen as a validator.\n\nProof of Work: Criticism\n\nEarlier, hobbyists sitting at home used to do this 'work'. However, the processing power required to get it done has increased exponentially. As a result, only those able to afford the necessary power and hardware can get this work done today, like companies and specialist mining organisations.\n\nThe energy required for computer hardware is enormous and is the sole reason behind Bitcoin's criticism. Currently, it uses 19 terawatt hours (TWh) every year, nearly the amount used by an entire country like Norway.\n\nEthereum: Proof of Stake\n\nThis consensus mechanism initiates processing transactions and helps create new blocks in the blockchain based on the total number of validator stakes coins. The PoS structure has less potential for a network attack thanks to its well-designed structure.\n\nUnder Proof of Stake, the next block writer is selected randomly, with nodes having larger stake positions being assigned with higher odds.\n\nProof of Stake: Understanding\n\nUnder proof of stake (PoS), owners themself offer coins as collateral and are given a chance to validate blocks. As a result, coin owners with 'stake coins' are eligible to become 'validators'; however, they should own a specific amount of stake coins. Next, a random validator is selected who gets to do the 'mining' unlike the competition-based mechanism as in the proof of work.\n\nProof of Work v/s Proof of Stake: Main Takeaways"

        "title": "Is Crypto Mining Still Profitable in 2023? Know All About It Here - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency mining is still profitable in 2023, but it may not be as rewarding as in the past.\n\nCryptocurrency mining is still profitable in 2023, but it may not be as rewarding as in the past. That\u2019s accurate for a variety of factors, including the fact that cryptocurrency prices were significantly lower than their peaks for the majority of 2022 and into early 2023.\n\nThe majority of cryptocurrencies still have value, but estimating miner profitability can be a little trickier now that mining machinery requires expensive computer gear and software as well as electricity to operate.\n\nBitcoin, which employs a proof-of-work consensus method and is the biggest and earliest cryptocurrency, is one of the primary sources of cryptocurrency mining. Understanding how crypto mining functions and the benefits and drawbacks is crucial before choosing whether mining for Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies is worthwhile.\n\nBitcoin Mining Pools:\n\nThe majority of Bitcoin miners today use what is known as a mining group, as previously stated, due to the high cost and increasing challenge of mining Bitcoin. Today, many believe that joining mining groups is the only way for smaller miners to make any money, and even then, it can be challenging to recover the costs of energy and equipment.\n\nOwners of mining pools frequently charge mining costs to run and use the pool. There are a variety of groups to pick from, each with a unique framework. Additionally, there are Bitcoin cloud mining possibilities available, allowing miners to use processing resources remotely. This method of mining involves hiring other people\u2019s machinery, which is more expensive.\n\nConsiderations to Make When Selecting a mining pool:\n\nA small miner must locate an appropriate mining pool after getting the Bitcoin mining hardware and energy needed for mining.\n\nFees: Most Bitcoin processing groups, but not all, levie fees. The costs, which can be as high as 4%, are deducted from the reward payment.\n\nPool size: Since more hashing power means more blocks being discovered, the possible payout increases with pool size. Because awards are distributed among more recipients, the payments are, however, also smaller. On the other hand, bigger payouts occur less frequently in smaller groups.\n\nSecurity and Reliability: A mining group that miners can rely on that won\u2019t take users\u2019 money or get hacked may be what they\u2019re looking for. Joining pools with a lengthy history could help to lower these dangers.\n\nRequired equipment investment: You\u2019ll also need to supply the pool with electricity. And mining costs more and more money. When Bitcoin was first developed, the computer computing power needed for Bitcoin mining could be handled by a typical notebook computer\u2019s CPU. But the computations have gotten trickier over time. Currently, mining is primarily only possible with sophisticated ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) devices that were made especially for mining Bitcoin.\n\nIs Cryptocurrency Mining in 2023:\n\nThe second-largest participant in the cryptocurrency market is Ethereum. Unfortunately, mining on the Ethereum network is no longer feasible.\n\nThis is due to the implementation of \u201cEthereum 2.0,\u201d which altered Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-work consensus method to proof-of-stake. As a result, mining is no longer used by the network. The only people who will be able to invest their tokens and become \u201cvalidators\u201d are those who possess significant amounts of ETH. The possibilities of receiving the upcoming block rewards are distributed among validators, with those who have pledged the most ETH having the best chances.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM): Features, Purpose And Benefits - ClearTax",
        "content": "The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a computation engine which functions as a decentralised computer with abundant applications that can be implemented. It is the central framework in the Ethereum blockchain. The EVM is one entity upheld by numerous connected computers that perform instructions in large numbers. Every instruction comprises an operator and its operands.\n\nWhat is the EVM?\n\nThe Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a dynamic and isolated virtual stack implanted entirely throughout the Ethereum node. It is responsible for implementing contract bytecode. After writing them in complex languages, like Solidity, contracts are compiled to EVM bytecode. Many programming languages like C++, Java, JavaScript, Ruby, and Python execute Ethereum Virtual Machines efficiently.\n\nFeatures of EVM\n\nThe following are the essential features of the Ethereum Virtual Machine. They are:\n\nEVM acts as a virtual machine and the foundation of the total operating system of Ethereum.\n\nThere are two types of accounts for Ethereum under the EVM. They are Contract Accounts and Externally Owned Accounts (EOA).\n\nThe EVM arranges numerous additional utilities to the blockchain so users can enjoy hassle-free running on the system.\n\nAll nodes of Ethereum perform on EVM to keep consensus throughout the blockchain.\n\nEVM enables a special code to run on Ethereum, known as smart contracts.\n\nThe code inside EVM is entirely inaccessible to the system, network, or other areas.\n\nIt is a part of the Ethereum network that focuses on executing transactions alongside smart contract deployment. In the meantime, smart contracts keep contract accounts in smart wallets.\n\nWhat is the purpose of the EVM?\n\nThe main power of EVM is to decide the comprehensive state of Ethereum for every block in a blockchain. Ethereum is quite similar to other blockchain-based networks. It has its native cryptocurrency (Ether) and uses a distributed ledger that includes autonomous computers (nodes) for recording, synchronising and running transactions in particular electronic ledgers.\n\nHowever, Ethereum retains some special functions due to its smart contract capability. In other words, the state of Ethereum is a huge database that records every Ether (ETH) account and balance.\n\nHow is gas related to the performance of EVM?\n\nAny transaction on Ethereum symbolises an Ether (ETH) transaction. Transactions require fees. When it comes to Ethereum, it denotes its fees as gas, which fuels decentralised applications.\n\nIn case of high networking activity, gas fees increase. However, if the execution fails, you can stay sure of getting the pre-paid amount. An execution will end soon if it runs out of gas.\n\nBenefits of EVM\n\nThere are certain benefits of the Ethereum Virtual Machine. They are:\n\nAnyone can create their decentralised application via EVM as it has no involvement of security obstacles.\n\nNowadays, NFTs or Non-Fungible Tokens, are gaining a lot of fame in cryptocurrency. With adequate knowledge about these financial securities, you can create digital art and sell it on a decentralised market using EVMs.\n\nDrawbacks of EVM\n\nUnlike advantages, there are some disadvantages of the Ethereum virtual machine. Let\u2019s see them too:\n\nIf the owners of these services discontinue using Ethereum, the nodes will stop doing any function, thereby crumbling the entire network.\n\nUsing an EVM requires certain technical proficiency. Hence, it is limited to those who do not know to code. Only a few applications have Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) that only enable some selected individuals to gain the advantage of NFTs.\n\nEthereum is also called a \u2018global/world computer\u2019 as all Ethereum network nodes successfully run the EVM and implement similar instructions. It makes all other nodes reach a consensus about the system's state."

        "content": "Cryptocurrency has been gaining prominence for several years now, both within the financial community and beyond. It\u2019s not a straightforward market to breach successfully, and knowing when to invest or what to invest in is tricky in itself. The traditional giants, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), have been solid investments for many years, but the recent Silvergate Bank crisis has shown vulnerability. Sometimes, there is a potential for profits in new lesser-known cryptos, and one such coin is SignUp Token which presents people with an unmissable opportunity before it goes live.\n\nSignUp Token Launches Onto The Market Through Email Registration\n\nMost of the time, when crypto prepares to launch into the market, it does so through the usual avenues, be it presales or an ICO. This is a fine setting for many cryptos to assess the kind of impact they are likely to have on the market, but other ways ought to be explored. SignUp Token is a brilliant example of that.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t need a presale or any kind of prepayment. Instead, all it pushes for is one million email sign-ups. What are the potential benefits for someone who signs up for this? Once SignUp Token reaches one million, it enters the crypto exchanges, and those who have registered their emails will be the first to know, allowing them to engage with the crypto with significant advantages with strong potential for huge profits.\n\nWe\u2019ve all skipped past the endless streams of marketing emails, but this is not an email you want to miss out on. SignUp Token could be the new exciting crypto in 2023, and it\u2019s offering everyone an unmissable opportunity to buy its tokens at an advantage when it finally enters the crypto market. Don\u2019t spurn the golden chance to be one of the one million who register their emails.\n\nNo presale. Nothing to pay for whilst it\u2019s yet to debut. All you need to do to put yourself in the position of eventually acquiring a potentially lucrative coin is register your email. That sounds too good an opportunity to pass up.\n\nSilvergate Troubles Cause Slump In Bitcoin Price\n\nThe Silvergate Bank has been providing a payment network to many cryptos for many years. But recently, it sunk into a crisis authored in part by the FTX crisis that saw Silvergate lose 60% of its deposits in one quarter when customers departed with around $8.1bn. This prompted a loss of confidence in Silvergate and saw many cryptos either distance themselves or entirely sever ties.\n\nThe effect on Bitcoin was clear. Its price went down by 4.5% as it fell from $23,500 to $22,259 whilst losing the not-so-small matter of \u00a320bn from its market cap.\n\nThis underlines that, like a lot of other digital currencies, Bitcoin isn\u2019t immune to experiencing blowbacks from external events. But it\u2019s worth pointing out that Bitcoin is resilient to volatile trends within the market and has consistently stayed ahead of the competition. Its price has definitely been shaken by the Silvergate Bank crisis, but it is a coin built on tenacity, and that is why many investors persistently place their faith in it.\n\nEthereum Has Resilience To Recover From Silvergate Crisis\n\nBitcoin wasn\u2019t the only major coin to be affected by what happened at Silvergate. The market\u2019s second-largest coin, Ethereum (ETH), was also affected by the crisis as its price fell by 4.6% while its market cap dropped to just over $193 billion.\n\nBut just as this shouldn\u2019t put anyone off from investing in Bitcoin, it has to be emphasised that Ethereum is one of the most resilient crypto platforms that investors love for a good reason. Why is this? It\u2019s because price falls and bearish market moods are not uncommon. The crypto market regularly encounters turbulence, but what is striking about Ethereum is its capacity to remain one of the biggest coins despite this. Its prominence has grown within the market due to the growing use of DeFi platforms and decentralised applications, with many developers using Ethereum\u2019s platforms to build their applications.\n\nIts utility and resilience make it one of the most coveted coins in the market for a reason.\n\nTo conclude, SignUp Token is utilising cost-free for everyone to get on board with its new token. It doesn\u2019t cost you anything to register your email, and you get the significant advantage of knowing when it will debut on the market before everyone else.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in what it\u2019s offering, have a look below!\n\nSignUp Token Website: https://signuptoken.com/\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

However, Bitcoin showed resilience. The crypto industry is facing fierce challenges in the short term and macro uncertainty fueling it slightly from time to time. But cryptocurrencies have also shown noticeable decoupling for some medium time frame.\"\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

        "title": "Crypto Experts Name Ethereum The Queen Of Digital Currency But Let's Talk About Its Security - Harlem World Magazine",
        "content": "The last few years have shown that the jurisdiction of digital currencies knows no limit as several sectors welcomed cryptocurrencies and the blockchain into operations.\n\nInvesting in digital currencies with a history of beating bear markets and secure networks is crucial for organisations seeking ways to maintain exposure and competitiveness in the market. Ethereum and Bitcoin are the most well-known digital currencies that fit the bill. Those looking for a platform where to buy Ethereum or Bitcoin can use Binance because it provides information about cryptocurrencies\u2019 evolution and helps them figure out when the ideal moment to invest in a coin is.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum have been on the crypto market for more than two cycles, enabling investors to earn high returns on investments in bull markets. People considering investing in cryptocurrency at the moment most likely think about buying one of the two largest digital currencies by market cap. However, considering the high price of Bitcoin, many turn to Ethereum. Ethereum is also a proven bear market beater because it spiked in value in the next bull market. A lot has changed for the most popular altcoin since the last bear market, most notably the Merge that allowed it to switch to a proof-of-stake consensus. This eco-friendly consensus allows the blockchain to save 99.95% more energy. Considering the present global focus on energy efficiency, ETH ensured its longevity and survival in the sector. But this feature isn\u2019t enough to convince investors to add it to their portfolios.\n\nIs Ethereum secure?\n\nThe potential of a cryptocurrency like Ethereum doesn\u2019t count for much if it lacks advanced security features. So, the question is, how secure is the decentralised network that is Ethereum?\n\nAccording to experts, Ethereum is more secure than most innovative blockchain solutions. Still, if you use an exchange or decentralised app that lacks proper security, your data and finances can get compromised.\n\nSign-Up for our Newsletter * Select list(s) to subscribe to Harlem World Magazine Example: Yes, I would like to receive emails from Harlem World Magazine.

Ethereum is a blockchain, like all the other cryptocurrencies available on the market. However, its functionality is different from the other digital currencies because it was created to enable the execution of smart contracts. So if you want to find out if Ethereum is secure, you need to find answers to more specific questions like Is the Ethereum blockchain secure? Are smart contracts secure? Can the Ethereum network be hacked?\n\nUnfortunately, people lacking cryptocurrency knowledge will look at a hack resulting from an issue with smart contracts and conclude the entire Ethereum blockchain is unsafe. This is a bad interference because you cannot say that the entire Internet is unsecure only because cybercriminals can use it to send scam emails.\n\nWhy do some believe Ethereum lacks security?\n\nThe matters of security have become more complicated since Layer 2 networks have increased in popularity because they add a new dimension to the Ethereum network and bring their own security concerns. Layer 2 ecosystems are different from the Ethereum blockchain because they\u2019re meant to remove some of the computational strain the main blockchain features and boost its scalability.\n\nTo understand if Ethereum is secure, it\u2019s best to focus on its infrastructure as a blockchain and its smart contracts \u2013 even if the Layer 2 networks have a huge impact on its security processes.\n\nBlockchain hacks don\u2019t have much to do with Ethereum\u2019s security\n\nMost of the high-profile hacks and security issues the news reported aren\u2019t the result of a vulnerability in the Ethereum blockchain. They\u2019re connected with the infrastructure of smart contracts because blockchain as technology in itself is one of the most reliable solutions known.\n\nBlockchain (whether we talk about Ethereum or bitcoin) has been created to prevent anyone from seizing control over the ecosystem or adding counterfeit blocks to the ecosystem. Ethereum miners receive economic incentives \u2013 minted ether, transactions fees \u2013 for mined blocks, which encourages them to act in the blockchain\u2019s best interest instead of trying to manipulate it.\n\nThe proof-of-stake consensus is expected to boost Ethereum\u2019s security\n\nEveryone knows that Ethereum completed the Merge, meaning that it transitioned from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake consensus. The previous mining model encouraged miners to solve complex mathematical problems to create new blocks to add to the blockchain. But the new model requires validators to take turns on the ecosystem to propose and validate blocks. They receive incentives according to the number of coins the node is staking.\n\nEthereum supporters state that the switch can increase Ethereum\u2019s security. For someone to take control over a proof-of-stake blockchain, they need to control 51% of the computing power. But for someone to control a proof-of-stake blockchain, they need to control over 51% of the total number of coin stakes. Therefore, holding this amount of ETH is more expensive than controlling 51% of computing power.\n\nStatistics show that a 1-hour attack on Ethereum using the proof-of-work consensus would cost $282,539. Ethereum\u2019s current market cap is over $38 billion, so someone would need around $20 billion to control 51% of ETH. An attack in the present conditions would cost millions.\n\nSmart contracts\u2019 flexibility could harm Ethereum\u2019s security\n\nWhen it comes to digital currencies, there\u2019s a trade-off between decentralisation and security because the more decentralised a system is, the higher the risk of a security breach. Smart contracts are such a trade-off example. Solidity \u2013 the programming languages of the blockchain were created with flexibility in mind. Ethereum enables developers to design virtually any kind of token or DApp they want. This is one of the reasons why Ethereum hosts some of the most prominent projects in the sector but has also experienced several security breaches over the years.\n\nThe programming language\u2019s flexibility shouldn\u2019t be blamed for the blockchain\u2019s vulnerability, but its semantics because they make it challenging for some programmers to master. It\u2019s hard for some developers to learn programming languages because while they look similar to JavaScript, they behave differently.\n\nGiven the presented info, we can conclude that Ethereum is a secure blockchain, but its users\u2019 choices can make them vulnerable to breaches."

        "title": "CFTC Chairman Says Ethereum Is A Commodity - Bitcoinik",
        "content": "The latest statement passed by Rostin Benham over the nature of Ethereum (ETH), created a new controversy among US lawmakers.\n\nIn the United States (US), there are two dominant financial market regulatory bodies. These are the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC agency regulates the crypto market with more dominance over the CFTC agency. The CFTC agency regulates derivatives markets, including futures, options, and swaps. The SEC agency ensures the creation of fair markets, corporate disclosure, protecting Investors, and enforcing the law.\n\nOn 8 March 2023, Before the Senate Agriculture Committee, the CFTC chair Rostin Benham said that he believes Ethereum is security and should be listed on CFTC exchanges.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made the argument that Ethereum is a commodity\u2026it\u2019s been listed on CFTC exchanges for quite some time,\u201d Benham said.\n\nAccording to Benham, his opinion on the nature of Ethereum will provide a basic support for the CFTC agency to regulate the derivatives markets trading ETH & also underlying products.\n\nFurther on the stablecoins, Benham said that Stablecoins should also be a commodity in his opinion despite the comprehensive dedicated regulatory framework on the stablecoin companies.\n\n\u201cI agree \u2026 that stablecoins are and should be \u2026 regulated financial instruments. Notwithstanding a regulatory framework around stablecoin, they\u2019re going to be commodities in my view,\u201d the CFTC chair said.\n\nJust a few weeks ago, SEC chairman Gary Gensler stated that all cryptocurrencies are securities, except Bitcoin. For that statement, Gensler faced huge criticism from the crypto proponents.\n\nHowever many experts said that we should not focus on the statement passed by the SEC chairman because it was his personal opinion on the nature of cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn the present time, the SEC agency fighting against the San Francisco headquartered Fintech company Ripple over the nature of the XRP token, as a priority case in its to do list. In Dec 2020, the SEC initiated the case against Ripple executives & Ripple labs over the sale of more than $1.3 billion worth of unregistered securities sale.\n\nRead also: Despite several crypto companies\u2019 fallout, people trust centralized crypto custody services"

        "title": "Gasless Layer 1 Blockchains: Can They Beat Their Gas-Paying Competitors? - Crypto News Flash",
        "content": "As blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies continue to garner widespread popularity and adoption, the persistent fluctuation and spike of gas fees on layer 1 blockchains like Ethereum have become worrisome to developers and users.\n\nHowever, with numerous existing blockchain projects, the terms \u201cLayer 1\u201d and \u201cgas fees\u201d can be confusing if you lack some background knowledge or context. So, in this piece, we discuss Layer 1 blockchains and their gas fees.\n\nWhat is a Layer 1 Blockchain?\n\nLayer 1 blockchains or base layer chains or mainnets are standalone blockchain protocols. That is, they are not built on any other blockchain network and provide the foundational layer for a blockchain ecosystem. Therefore they are responsible for managing the blockchain\u2019s basic functions like consensus, mining, and transaction processing.\n\nThese blockchains are decentralized, secure, and immutable and often feature a native token that rewards validators or miners that maintain the ecosystem. Layer 1 blockchains also support smart contracts, DeFi, and dApps, while providing a secure and transparent approach to storing and exchanging data. Examples include Ethereum, Cardano, Avalanche, Solana, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), etc.\n\nHowever, transactions on these blockchains often incur gas fees, which have become a hot topic in the blockchain space over time.\n\nLayer 1 Gas Fees Explained\n\nGas fee is the amount paid to process a transaction on a blockchain network. Layer 1 gas fees are transaction costs associated with processing transactions on the mainnet of a blockchain ecosystem.\n\nThey are measured in the blockchain\u2019s native currency. For example, gas fees on the Ethereum blockchain are paid in Ether (ETH) and are used to reward validators for processing and validating transactions.\n\nGas fees are calculated based on the transaction\u2019s complexity. The more complex a transaction is, the more gas it requires, summing up to a higher fee. Other factors affecting the fluctuation of gas fees on Layer 1 blockchains include demand for transactions, network congestion, and current gas fee. Gas fees increase with higher demand and congestion and reduce with lower demand. Below is a comparison of the leading Layer 1 blockchains and their current gas fees:\n\nEthereum\n\nEthereum is the leading blockchain network in terms of smart contract functionality. However, its popularity has increased traffic on the blockchain network, leading to notoriously high gas fees, which most users have criticized. Even after its switch from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus to a proof-of-stake (PoS) model, gas fees on the blockchain continue to spike.\n\nAt the time of writing, the average cost to execute a simple transaction on Ethereum ranges between 80-100 Gwei. However, during periods of high congestion, the cost of gas on Ethereum can easily exceed 500 Gwei.\n\nBinance Smart Chain (BSC)\n\nBSC is a Layer 1 blockchain solution that leverages its PoS model to provide faster and cheaper transactions than Ethereum. The blockchain is also popular due to its smart contract functionality.\n\nBSC offers lower gas fees and enhanced throughput, making it appealing to developers and users. At the time of writing, the average gas fee on BSC is between 5 Gwei and 10 Gwei per transaction. However, BSC is criticized because it is more centralized than Ethereum. The blockchain is controlled by Binance, the largest centralized cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nExploring Gasless, More Innovative Layer 1 Solutions\n\nGasless layer 1 blockchains are innovative solutions that do not charge users gas fees to process transactions. While relatively new and not widely adopted, this blockchain model is gradually gaining traction.\n\nFor example, established blockchains like Solana and Avalanche are already implementing gasless transactions to solve the scalability challenges older blockchain solutions encounter. However, they are not alone, as newer Layer 1 blockchains like ReserveBlock and Metatime have already adopted a gasless approach.\n\nReserveBlock\n\nReserveBlock is an open-source, decentralized, autonomous, and peer-to-peer (P2P) layer 1 blockchain governed by validators through on-chain voting. ReserveBlock uses a liquid Proof of Assurance (PoA) consensus to democratize mining without the burdens and frictions associated with the PoW or Proof of Stake PoS consensus models. The network is gasless and has no lockups or holding periods. In addition, the development team has also announced that the project will be listed on MEXC on 10 March 2023.\n\nConclusion\n\nDifferent Layer 1 blockchains have different gas fees. While Ethereum\u2019s gas fees are the highest because of its popularity and network congestion, Avalanche, BSC, aims to offer lower gas fees and faster throughputs.\n\nUsers should avoid using networks during high congestion to significantly lower gas fees. They can also use a gas fee estimator to determine optimal transaction fees. In addition, developers can optimize smart contracts to use resources efficiently, reducing gas fees.\n\nHowever, gasless Layer 1 blockchains offer users a user-friendly, convenient, and cost-effective experience. With these solutions, users do not have to worry about incurring extra transaction fees when transacting on the blockchain. But, being in their earliest stages, these gasless blockchains may have security challenges.\n\nAs with any Layer 1 blockchain, weighing their pros and cons before using them for transactions or applications is critical.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.
