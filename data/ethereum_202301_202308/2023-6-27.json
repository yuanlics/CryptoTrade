        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nEthereum blockchain was created to address the limitations of Bitcoin and provide a platform for developers to build decentralized applications using smart contracts.\n\nA hard fork in 2016 resulted in the creation of two separate Ethereum networks called Ethereum (the current version) and Ethereum Classic.\n\nIt transitioned from a proof of work (PoW) to a proof of stake (PoS) consensus mechanism in 2022 to address energy consumption concerns and improve scalability.\n\nEthereum blockchain offers versatility and cost efficiency through its support for smart contracts, enabling innovation and reducing transaction costs.\n\nIn 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto introduced a groundbreaking alternative to fiat currency using cryptography to form a sound medium of exchange, called Bitcoin, which became the first cryptocurrency that offered a decentralized alternative to centralized traditional currencies.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s creation opened the door to a new era of financial freedom and innovation. The potential of blockchain technology was swiftly realized, explored, and admired by numerous individuals. As a result, developers and cryptography enthusiasts began to contemplate whether blockchain had more untapped potential.\n\nWhen he was merely nineteen years old, Vitalik Buterin, one of the founders of the Ethereum blockchain, embarked on an audacious new venture with a mission to push the boundaries of Bitcoin\u2019s capabilities.\n\nBitcoin, due to its limited design, lacked the versatility to support various functionalities, prompting Vitalik to conceive Ethereum. The latter aimed to establish a platform where developers could construct decentralized applications using smart contracts.\n\nTo realize this vision, a team of individuals such as Gavin Wood (creator of Polkadot and Kusama), Charles Hoskinson (creator of the Cardano blockchain), and Joseph Lubin (founder of ConsenSys), among others, worked assiduously to bring Ethereum to fruition.\n\nLaunched in 2015, Ethereum was initially built on a proof of work (PoW) consensus mechanism, much like its predecessor, Bitcoin. However, the network was designed to be more than just a cryptocurrency exchange platform and switched to proof of stake (PoS) consensus mechanism in 2022. As Ethereum\u2019s story continues to unfold, its community eagerly awaits the many innovations and developments that lie ahead.\n\nWhat Is The Ethereum Blockchain\n\nAs of Q2 2023, Ethereum blockchain holds the second spot on CoinMarketCap as the largest cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of $220 billion. The project offers a total and leading technology with a vision to change the world in a variety of interesting and debatable ways.\n\nEthereum is an attempt at a decentralized blockchain platform that offers unique features centered around the provision of smart contracts, decentralized finance (DeFi), and decentralized applications (dApps).\n\nA smart contract can be likened to a digital vending machine. When you insert the precise amount of coins into the machine and select your desired beverage, you\u2019re essentially entering into a smart contract with the vending machine.\n\nThis is because the vending machine acknowledges your payment, identifies the specific drink you\u2019ve chosen, and fulfills its end of the deal by dispensing the beverage. Fundamentally, a smart contract functions on the same principle as a vending machine: it is straightforward and reliable.\n\nSmart contracts serve as the foundation of Ethereum\u2019s vision, enabling the development of DeFi and dApps on its platform. These self-executing contracts have terms of the agreement directly written into code and are immutable once deployed on the Ethereum network. This means once the contract is entered it cannot be changed.\n\nEther (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum, powers these smart contracts and is used as a fuel for transactions and computational services on the network.\n\nHistory Of The Ethereum Blockchain\n\nEthereum, like Bitcoin, has a rich history, and has faced many challenges, such as its infamous DAO attack in 2016. The decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) was a blockchain-based venture capital fund that utilized smart contracts to allow investors to fund projects and receive returns on their investments. However, the smart contract code contained a flaw that enabled the attacker to drain a significant amount of ETH from the DAO\u2019s funds into a child DAO.\n\nThe DAO attack ultimately led to a hard fork of the Ethereum network, which involved rolling back the blockchain to a previous state to undo the damage caused by the attack. This fork resulted in the creation of two separate Ethereum networks, the current Ethereum blockchain (resulting forked blockchain) and Ethereum Classic (the original version of the Ethereum blockchain).\n\nIt is important to note that Ethereum Classic still uses the PoW consensus method, whereas Ethereum moved to a PoS consensus mechanism, commonly known as the Merge upgrade. The decision to switch to a PoS method is driven by the environmental concerns surrounding the PoW mining method.\n\nPrior to the planned Merge, a hard fork of the Ethereum network known as ETHW was created, still employing the PoW consensus mechanism. This resulted in a victory for ETH miners. Chandler Guo, a Chinese miner who opposed the PoS consensus method, launched the PoW-based Ethereum blockchain.\n\nToken Standards On The Ethereum Blockchain\n\nTechnical Alert! \u2013 Ethereum holds different ERC tokens (Ethereum Request for Comment) that are akin to different types of digital items or assets created on the Ethereum platform. Ethereum token standards are guidelines that dictate how new tokens should be created on the Ethereum blockchain. Here\u2019s A brief on these token standards:\n\nERC-20 tokens: These tokens are fungible and can be exchanged with one another, signifying that each token inherently possesses the same value as the others.\n\nERC-721 tokens: Act as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), these unique digital assets are perfectly suited for representing digital art, collectibles, and in-game items, effectively showcasing their irreplaceable nature. There is only one Mona Lisa painting and like a painting, ERC-721 tokens are unique in nature that only one exists of its type. One of the earliest and most famous examples of an NFT is CryptoKitties, a blockchain-based game where users can buy, sell, and breed virtual cats with unique traits and characteristics.\n\nERC-1155 tokens: Is often viewed as a hybrid of both the ERC-20 and ERC-721 token standard. This means that it allows for the creation of both fungible and non-fungible tokens, useful for developers creating unique and interchangeable items.\n\nBy offering a comprehensive suite of solutions, Ethereum strives to decentralize the internet, creating a network of computers that combine into a powerful decentralized supercomputer, enabling transparent and secure transactions without intermediaries such as banks or escrow services.\n\nWhereby this means a neutral or impartial third party whose role is to retain funds, assets, or documents until all pre-established terms are fulfilled, documented in a contract, ensuring that the agreement between the involved parties is honored.\n\nHow Does Ethereum Blockchain Work?\n\nEthereum is more than just a cryptocurrency because of the many features it can provide its network users. At its origin, Ethereum\u2019s PoW consensus mechanism relied on miners to secure the network and validate transactions; this gave it a highly decentralized image.\n\nAs mentioned, Ethereum has migrated away from PoW to PoS. The reasoning behind this shift includes issues related to high energy consumption and centralization as stated by the media. BUT by sheer coincidence or not it also helped the Ethereum community scale, as this would not be possible on a PoW system like Bitcoin when operating smart contracts.\n\nHere\u2019s an overview of Ethereum\u2019s PoS consensus mechanism in six steps:\n\nValidators: PoS uses validators instead of miners. Validators are users who hold a certain amount of Ether and choose to stake it in the network. Recently Ethereum\u2019s \u201cShanghai hard fork\u201d, has been completed. This update allows users who staked their ETH for securing and validating transactions on the blockchain to withdraw their funds. Block proposals: Validators take turns proposing and validating blocks on the Ethereum blockchain. When it\u2019s a validator\u2019s turn to propose a block, they create a block with transactions and broadcast it to the network. Block validation: Other validators then validate the proposed block, checking to make sure that the transactions are valid and that the proposed block adheres to the network\u2019s rules. Validators can either vote to accept or reject the proposed block. They essentially check what the Block proposal is following the rules of the Ethereum network. Rewards and penalties: Validators who participate in block proposals and validation are rewarded with ETH. However, validators who behave maliciously, such as by proposing invalid blocks or trying to double-spend, are penalized by having their staked ETH slashed. Randomness: Ethereum PoS uses a randomness function to select validators who get to propose and validate blocks. The more ETH a validator has staked, the more likely they are to be chosen. This concept might give Ethereum\u2019s lead developers significant control over the consensus mechanism, potentially leading to authoritarian decisions in the future. Finality: Once a block is accepted by the network and added to the blockchain, it is considered final. This means that transactions on the block cannot be reversed, which is an important property for decentralized applications.\n\nAlthough Ethereum and its smart contracts are designed to be immutable, there are situations where contracts may need to be reversed due to errors or mistakes, including human error during the programming phase or incorrect data inputs. This has raised concerns about the immutability of smart contracts and sparked debates in the community.\n\nBitcoin vs Ethereum\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are the most well-known cryptocurrencies, yet they hold notable differences in their underlying objectives and architectural design. The following points highlight some of these key differences::\n\nEthereum Wallets\n\nEthereum is a decentralized network of computers that work together to execute code or smart contracts. To interact with these contracts, users need Ethereum wallets , which are software or hardware tools that hold private keys and provide public addresses for sending and receiving Ether, the native cryptocurrency used on the Ethereum network.\n\nThere are two types of Ethereum wallets: full nodes and light nodes. Full nodes are also known as \u201cfull client\u201d wallets and hold the entire blockchain history and verify transactions, while light nodes rely on third-party full nodes to get information when needed. They are often referred to as \u201clightweight\u201d or \u201cthin client\u201d wallets and are typically faster to sync and use less storage space.\n\nHardware wallets are the physical devices that store a user\u2019s private keys offline. They are the most secure way to store Ether; however, unlike smart contract-powered wallets, hardware wallets can only send and receive Ether and ERC-20 tokens. Some examples include Ledger Nano and Trezor.\n\nSoftware wallets are digital wallets that run on a computer (e.g, desktop wallets like Exodus and web wallets like MetaMask ) or mobile device (e.g., MyEtherWallet ) that stores the private keys for accessing cryptocurrencies online.\n\nAdditionally, there are paper wallets, which are simply a printed copy of your private and public keys, which are then stored offline. While paper wallets are considered one of the most secure options, they are not as convenient for frequent transactions and require careful handling to avoid loss or theft.\n\nPopular Ethereum dApps\n\ndApps, or decentralized applications are software programs that run on the Ethereum blockchain. They are designed to be decentralized which means they operate on a distributed network of computers rather than being controlled by a central authority.\n\ndApps can be used for a variety of purposes, including creating marketplaces, managing digital assets, and executing complex financial transactions through the integration of smart contracts.\n\nPopular dApps On Ethereum\n\nUniswap\n\nUniswap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to trade cryptocurrencies without the need for intermediaries. It uses an automated market-making (AMM) system and enables users to trade any ERC-20 token pair, earn rewards, and provide liquidity to the platform.\n\nAMMs use a mathematical algorithm to determine the price of assets based on the ratio of the available tokens in a liquidity pool. Instead of relying on order books like centralized exchanges, AMMs automatically adjust the price based on the amount of assets being traded, providing liquidity to the platform and enabling decentralized trading without the need for intermediaries.\n\nAave Protocol\n\nThe Aave protocol which enables users to borrow and lend from a selection of over 30 Ethereum-based assets. Offering flexibility to choose between stable and variable interest rates, based on their preferences and market conditions. Whereby users can also obtain flash loans. In addition to traditional assets, Aave also offers pools for real-world assets such as real estate. The platform\u2019s governance token, AAVE, allows users to participate in voting on Aave Improvement Proposals (AIPs).\n\nOpenSea\n\nOpenSea is a peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplace for buying, selling, and discovering non-fungible tokens, including digital art, gaming items, collectibles, and other unique digital assets, using cryptocurrency.\n\nBenefits Of Ethereum\n\nEthereum is a blockchain-based decentralized platform that has several benefits compared to traditional centralized systems. These include:\n\nVersatility: Ethereum supports various functions like smart contracts, DApps, and DAOs, enabling innovation and collaboration across industries.\n\nCost and time efficiency: Smart contracts automate complex transactions, eliminating intermediaries and reducing expenses for businesses and individuals.\n\nEnhanced performance: PoS system increases scalability, security, and energy efficiency, elevating the platform\u2019s potential.\n\nContinuous improvement: Developers actively work on updating Ethereum\u2019s functionality and security, ensuring its competitiveness in the blockchain landscape.\n\nDisadvantages Of Ethereum\n\nEthereum, like any other technology, has its share of disadvantages including:.\n\nRising transaction costs: As Ethereum\u2019s popularity grows, transaction fees increase, potentially limiting access for small businesses and individual users.\n\nEther volatility: The unpredictable price of Ether can pose challenges for day traders and long-term investors.\n\nScalability concerns: Ethereum must continuously adapt to accommodate the increasing demand for decentralized applications and smart contracts.\n\nOngoing development: Ethereum developers face the challenge of finding effective solutions to improve network performance and accessibility.\n\nThe Future Of Ethereum\n\nSince Ethereum\u2019s inception in 2015, questions have been asked about the future evolution of the protocol, particularly in addressing significant challenges such as scaling. Phase one known as the The Merge took place on September 19, 2022, and was an essential part of the development of Ethereum as it transitioned away from PoW to PoS consensus. By making this leap, the Ethereum Foundation is actively envisioning the state of Ethereum a decade from now.\n\nEthereum\u2019s development is undergoing a complex and lengthy transition to become a more robust, secure, and powerful version of its former self, ultimately enhancing its capabilities and potential impact to deliver scalability. Ehereum\u2019s development roadmap, outlined by Vitalik Buterin, consists of five key phases that begin with the Merge.\n\nThe second phase, called the Surge, aims to enhance Ethereum\u2019s scalability through sharding, allowing it to process more data and become more cost-effective. The Verge phase involves the adoption of Layer 2 solutions, such as Optimism and zkRollups, to compete with traditional financial systems in terms of transaction throughput and efficiency.\n\nThe Purge phase involves cleaning up Ethereum\u2019s chain state to improve efficiency and reduce storage requirements, making it more accessible for individuals to run nodes. The final phase, the Splurge, focuses on improving the user experience for developers, attracting more innovative applications and solutions to the Ethereum platform.\n\nThe future of Ethereum is rich with innovation, development and promise. These advancements, whilst challenging, aim to address some of the network\u2019s current limitations and transform Ethereum into a more scalable, efficient, and user-friendly platform for developers and users alike. As Ethereum continues to innovate, it will likely remain a dominant force in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space over the next decade.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nEthereum is a decentralized blockchain platform that enables the creation of smart contracts and decentralized applications.\n\nWhat is a smart contract and how does it function on the Ethereum network?\n\nA smart contract is a self-executing agreement with the terms directly written into code. On the Ethereum network, these contracts are immutable, meaning once deployed they cannot be changed.\n\nWhy did Ethereum switch from proof of work to proof of stake, and how does it work?\n\nEthereum switched to proof of stake to address environmental concerns and scalability issues associated with proof of work. In proof of stake consensus mechanism, validators, who hold and stake Ether, propose and validate blocks. Rewards are given for participation, while penalties are imposed for malicious behavior.\n\nWhat are the examples of popular dApps on Ethereum?\n\ndApps, or decentralized applications, are software programs that operate on the Ethereum blockchain. They are autonomous and operate on a network of computers, which prevents central control. Examples of popular Ethereum DApps include Uniswap, a decentralized exchange; Aave protocol, a lending platform; and OpenSea, a peer-to-peer marketplace for non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nWhat are some advantages and disadvantages of Ethereum?\n\nAdvantages of Ethereum include its versatility, cost and time efficiency, enhanced performance due to its PoS consensus mechanism, and ongoing improvement. Some disadvantages include rising transaction costs, Ether volatility, scalability concerns, and the challenges posed by continuous development."

        "title": "Ethereum price won't see $2K anytime soon, market data suggests - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The price of Ether (ETH) faced strong resistance at $1,920 after a 17.5% rally between June 15 and June 22. Several factors contributed to the limited upside, including worsening macroeconomic conditions, the regulatory cryptocurrency environment and weaker demand for decentralized applications (DApps) on the Ethereum network.\n\nETH price faces macroeconomic headwinds\n\nOn June 26, a federal judge denied a motion from Binance that could have stopped the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) from issuing public statements related to the case.\n\nIn addition, in its mid-year outlook, HSBC Asset Management\u2019s report warned of an economic downturn in the U.S. in the fourth quarter, followed by a \u201cyear of contraction and a European recession in 2024\u201d. The report also noted that \u201ccorporate defaults have started to creep up.\u201d\n\nFinally, International Monetary Fund chief economist Gita Gopinath told CNBC on June 27 that central bankers should \u201ccontinue tightening\u201d by keeping interest rates high for longer than expected.\n\nEthereum network demand, gas fees drop\n\nUsage of DApps on the Ethereum network failed to gain momentum as gas fees dropped 60%. Notably, the seven-day average transaction cost dropped to $3.7 on June 26, down from $9 four weeks prior.\n\nDApp active addresses also declined by 27% in the same period.\n\n30-day Ethereum DApp activity. Source: DappRadar\n\nA large chunk of the decline was concentrated on Uniswap and MetaMask Swap, while most nonfungible token (NFT) marketplaces saw a surge in their unique active wallets (UAW).\n\nDespite Uniswap NFT Aggregator\u2019s lackluster performance, the sector faced a decent influx of users on OpenSea, Blur, Manifold, LooksRare and Unick.\n\nMore concerningly, however, is that the total value locked (TVL) \u2014 measuring the deposits locked in Ethereum smart contracts \u2014 reached its lowest level since August 2020. The indicator declined by 6.9% between April 28 and June 28 to 13.9 million ETH, according to DefiLlama.\n\nETH price rally not supported by derivatives markets\n\nSo how are professional traders positioned for the next ETH price move? Let\u2019s look at Ether futures to gauge the odds of ETH/USD breaking above the $1,920 resistance.\n\nETH quarterly futures are the preferred instruments of whales and arbitrage desks. However, these fixed-month contracts usually trade at a slight premium to spot markets, as they demand an additional fee to postpone settlement.\n\nAs a result, in healthy markets, ETH futures contracts should trade at a 5\u201310% annualized premium, a situation known as contango.\n\nEther two-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nAccording to the futures premium \u2014 known as the basis indicator \u2014 professional traders have been avoiding leveraged longs (bullish bets). Despite the modest improvement to 3%, the metric remains far from the neutral 5% threshold.\n\nTo exclude externalities that might have solely impacted the Ether futures, one should analyze the ETH options markets. The 25% delta skew indicator compares similar call (buy) and put (sell) options, and will turn positive when fear is prevalent because the protective put option premium is higher than the call options.\n\nEther 30-day 25% skew. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe skew indicator will move above 8% if traders fear an Ether price crash. On the other hand, generalized excitement reflects a negative 8% skew.\n\nAs displayed above, the delta skew has been flirting with moderate optimism since June 22 but has been unable to sustain it for long. Presently, the negative 2% metric displays a balanced demand for options.\n\nResistance below $2,000 remains formidable\n\nJudging by the ETH derivatives metrics, and declining TVL and DApps use, bears are better positioned to defend the $1,920 resistance. Moreover, the worsening macroeconomic conditions and cryptocurrency regulatory news confirm the moderate pessimism for risk-on assets, including Ether.\n\nRelated: 3 reasons why Ethereum\u2019s market cap dominance is on the rise\n\nThat does not necessarily mean that Ether is bound to retest $1,750, but it certainly presents an enormous hurdle for ETH bulls after failing to break the $1,920 level on three occasions between June 21 and June 25.\n\nConsequently, at least for the short term, bears have better odds of successfully defending this important price level.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "Ethereum price is slowly moving lower from the $1,920 resistance against the US Dollar. ETH could extend its decline toward the $1,790 support.\n\nEthereum is still struggling to surpass the $1,920 resistance.\n\nThe price is trading below $1,900 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $1,885 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could decline further toward the $1,790 support in the coming sessions.\n\nEthereum Price Stuck In A Range\n\nEthereum\u2019s price attempted another upside break above the key $1,920 resistance zone. ETH failed to gain bullish momentum for a close above the $1,920 level, similar to Bitcoin.\n\nA high is formed near $1,912 and the price is now moving lower. There was a break below the $1,900 level. The price declined below the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent increase from the $1,838 low to the $1,912 high. Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $1,885 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nEther is now trading below $1,900 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. It is now testing the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the recent increase from the $1,838 low to the $1,912 high.\n\nIf Ethereum stays above $1,850, it could attempt another increase. Immediate resistance is near the $1,880 level or the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The next major resistance is near the $1,900 level.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe main barrier is still near the $1,920 and $1,930 levels. A close above the $1,930 zone could start a steady increase and send the price further higher. The next resistance sits near $2,000, above which the price could rise toward the $2,050 level. Any more gains could send Ether toward the $2,120 resistance.\n\nMore Losses in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,900 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,850 level.\n\nThe next major support is near the $1,840 level. If there is a move below $1,840, the price could accelerate lower toward $1,790. Any more losses may perhaps send the price toward the $1,750 support.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,840\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,900\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThough the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is waging legal war across the crypto space, Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin isn\u2019t breaking a sweat.\n\nWhen asked about regulators potentially treating Ether (ETH) like a security, the Consensys CEO explained during a Tuesday interview with CNBC that the regulatory verdict on Ethereum is already in.\n\n\u201cThe SEC has spoken,\u201d he said, referring to former SEC commissioner Bill Hinman\u2019s 2018 speech on crypto securities and Ethereum.\n\n\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNew documents have revealed that Hinman received multiple warnings from colleagues that the speech could confuse markets into thinking that the SEC had already deemed the asset a non-security.\n\n\n\nA security is a financial instrument often (but not always) associated with some kind of investment contract. A commodity, by contrast, is a basic or natural good, like gold, wheat, or cattle.\n\n\u201cThe CFTC has spoken very crisply a number of times that they consider Ether like a commodity,\u201d added Lubin.\n\nWhile Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman Rostin Benham agrees that many cryptocurrencies are securities, he also thinks the three top assets\u2014including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum, and Tether (USDT)\u2014belong under his agency\u2019s jurisdiction as commodities.\n\nSEC Chairman Gary Gensler, by contrast, has only publicly deemed Bitcoin as such.\n\n\n\nOn the topic of Ether, Gensler has kept a tight lip. Some videos from his time as an MIT professor suggest he once thought it was a security, while others indicate he believed it had graduated from a security into a commodity by 2018.\n\nMembers of Congress are drafting legislation to clear up this issue, including Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand, and have voiced agreement with the CFTC that Ether is a commodity alongside Bitcoin.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a forgone conclusion at this point,\u201d said Lubin. \u201cThere may be a regulator or two in the United States that can\u2019t bring himself to utter the fact that Ether is not a security, but I don\u2019t know why that\u2019s the case.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe SEC sued Binance and Coinbase earlier this month alleging that over a dozen assets listed on their platform were securities, including Paxos-issued stablecoin BUSD.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "title": "Why Did Citadel-Backed EDX List Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash? - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Bitcoin Cash, a spin-off from the oldest digital asset, has struggled to find a market since launching in 2017. But it\u2019s been on a roll this month: since the start of June, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is up 98%, jumping from $113 to $224.\n\nThe slightly obscure digital asset\u2014one of many cryptocurrency \u201cforks\u201d\u2014is following Bitcoin, like many other coins and tokens which have surged in price since the biggest digital asset experienced a run. But BCH is doing by far the best.\n\nWhy? The coin is one of the lucky four chosen for EDX Markets, a new crypto exchange backed by major Wall Street players Charles Schwab, Citadel Securities, and Fidelity Digital Assets.\n\nEDX, which launched last week, decided to let its traders\u2014institutional investors only\u2014start off with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash.\n\nThe reason is simple: regulatory clarity.\n\n\u201cThese specific cryptocurrencies are generally perceived as commodities by regulatory bodies, which significantly mitigates potential legal challenges,\u201d Sei Labs co-founder Jeff Feng told Decrypt.\n\nYouwei Yang, Chief Economist at BTCM, added that the four assets are \u201cwidely regarded as digital commodities, making them relatively safe\u201d from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission because they are made with electricity\u2014a commodity.\n\nIn perhaps its toughest regulatory crackdown yet, the SEC has gone after a number of major crypto brands for allegedly flogging unregistered securities. Earlier this month, it went after Coinbase for allegedly offering and selling unregistered securities via its staking service. It also targeted Binance, the world\u2019s biggest exchange, with a massive lawsuit for allegedly \u201coperating as a fking [sic] unlicensed securities exchange in the U.S.A. bro,\u201d according to the SEC.\n\nIn February, it hit Kraken with a $30 million fine for allegedly failing to register the offer and sale of its crypto asset staking-as-a-service program.\n\nEvery Crypto Project Must Reckon With the SEC's Howey Test\n\nStory continues\n\nThese regulatory enforcements are all because SEC Chairman Gary Gensler thinks\u2014and has said for years\u2014that most cryptocurrencies are unregistered securities.\n\nBut he has made it clear that Bitcoin is a commodity. He has been less clear on Ethereum, but the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CTFC) has said the asset is a commodity.\n\nAnd Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin are both Bitcoin forks\u2014new cryptocurrencies that emerged from the asset\u2019s original code\u2014meaning they are likely to have the same status in the eyes of regulators.\n\nGreg Moritz, Co-Founder at the crypto hedge fund AltTab Capital, said that \u201cnone have been listed by the SEC as unregistered securities,\u201d adding that all four assets are established and have history, \u201ckey factors in the decision-making process of EDX\u2019s backers.\u201d\n\nEDX Markets CEO Jamil Nazarali also said that he felt \u201cvery comfortable\u201d that the four assets weren\u2019t securities.\n\nFor now, these four \u201cold school\u201d cryptocurrencies will give \u201cold school\u201d investors a taste of the crypto world. But things could change, Feng noted. \u201cAs regulations evolve and the understanding of different cryptocurrencies becomes more nuanced, we could anticipate exchanges like EDX broadening their offerings,\u201d he added."

        "title": "Introduction to Solidity: Build an Ethereum smart contract - TheServerSide.com",
        "content": "Since its introduction in 2014 the Solidity programming language has become the de facto standard to write smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain network. Solidity is so popular that numerous blockchain networks support it, including Avalanche, Polygon and Binance Smart Chain.\n\nIn this article I'll cover the basics of writing a simple smart contract in Solidity that's a variation of an introductory Hello World program. The contract example might seem trivial, but it demonstrates some very important details that any developer must understand to program in Solidity.\n\nHow to compile and deploy a smart contract using an IDE Solidity is a compiled language that uses a compilation model similar to Java. In this model, Solidity source code is compiled into bytecode. That bytecode is stored on the blockchain and is processed by an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) hosted by one of the many computer nodes on the blockchain network. Figure 1 illustrates the process, similar to how a JVM processes Java bytecode. Fig. 1. The smart contract process. Source code is compiled into bytecode, stored on the blockchain, processed by a VM and hosted on a node on the blockchain network. The usual way to create a Solidity smart contract is to use an IDE such as Visual Studio Code or Remix. The VS Code IDE supports Solidity through an extension plugin; the Remix IDE, as shown in Fig. 2, is intended for use primarily as an online IDE and supports Solidity out of the box. Fig. 2. The Remix IDE lets developers create, compile and deploy smart contracts to testing and production blockchains. Remix also tightly integrates with blockchain technology. Developers can create, compile and deploy a smart contract to an internal blockchain emulator, a test blockchain on the network called a testnet or a production blockchain typically called a mainnet. For developers just starting out with Solidity programming, using Remix is the easiest way to go as it's an all-in-one way to create smart contracts.\n\nThe structure of a Solidity smart contract Developers typically create Solidity smart contract source code as a .sol file. The structure of a Solidity smart contract is similar to class in object-oriented programming. In OOP, a class is the basic organizational unit to group functions and data members; the analogical equivalent in Solidity is a contract. Fig. 3 shows a simple smart contract that exposes a function named getMessage() that returns a message when called. The sections below describe the details of the smart contract. Fig. 3. A Hello World smart contract created with Solidity. (1) Declare the compiler version; (2) declare this is a smart contract; (3) assign the value Hello, World!; (4) declare the getMessage() function and its properties. As mentioned previously, Solidity is a compiled programming language. The Solidity compiler has evolved over the years to accommodate numerous compiler versions today. As such, a Solidity smart contract must declare the compiler version the source code supports. This declaration is the first statement in a smart contract and is defined using the pragma keyword as shown in callout 1, Fig. 3. In this example, the pragma statement indicates the developer is using a Solidity compiler version of 0.8.9.0 or later. The code for the actual smart contract follows after this statement. A developer next declares a smart contract using the contract keyword in callout 2, Fig. 3. In the example above, the smart contract is named BasicContract. All smart contract code is placed between the curly brackets of BasicContract. As mentioned at the start of the article, Solidity is very similar to OOP languages such as Java or C#. One of these similarities is that Solidity supports a constructor to implement initialization behavior in a smart contract. The constructor in callout 3, Fig. 3 assigns the value Hello, World! to the variable named phrase. This behavior runs when the smart contract first deploys to the targeted blockchain network. Another similarity to OOP is that Solidity supports private and public scope. Private scope means that variables and functions declared as private are only visible from within the smart contract. Variables and functions declared as public are accessible from outside the smart contract. In the BasicContract code shown in Fig. 3, the variable named phrase is declared at Line 6. The variable is of type string and has a private scope, which means it is only viable from within the smart contract. However, the function named getMessage() in callout 4, Fig. 3 is public. This means the function can be called from outside the smart contract. For those of you that have programmed in Java or C#, this is pretty standard stuff. But the internal code of the getMessage() function contains keywords such as memory, view and bytes that reveal special aspects of Solidity programming. Let's take another look at the getMessage() function in an isolated manner.\n\nAnatomy of a Solidity function Fig. 4 shows the Solidity getMessage() function in isolation. The function returns a string as declared by (string memory) at Line 12. The keyword memory means the return value is stored in memory only. Nothing is stored on the underlying computer that supports the smart contract. Fig. 4. The getMessage() function converts a byte array to a string and returns the string. Also, notice that the getMessage() function gains public scope and that the function signature uses the keyword view. The keyword view, which is particular to Solidity, means the state of the contract is unchanging -- in other words, the function is read-only. No new data is added to the smart contract, and values for variables outside the function are unchanged. For example, Fig. 5 shows an erroneous use of view in Solidity code. Notice that the keyword view is used in the signature of the add() function at Line 22, yet the add() function changes the state of the variable named c declared at Line 20 which is outside the function. Using the keyword view enables the Remix IDE to throw a design-time error because the state of the contract is changed. Fig. 5. An example of Solidity code that causes a change in the contract state and thus violates the view keyword. In addition to programming techniques typically seen in higher-level languages such as Java and JavaScript, Solidity has many features usually associated with low-level languages such as C and C++. This is particularly evident with string manipulation. Languages such as JavaScript and Java automatically concatenate strings together when required without having to do low-level memory manipulation. Such string manipulation in Solidity is a bit more complex. For example, at Line 13 in Figure 4 above, to concatenate two strings together in Solidity one must convert the strings into two byte arrays combined using the abi.encodePacked() function to create a third array named concatenated. The resulting string is the value returned by the getMessage() function. The abi library, which is built into Solidity, provides functions to encode and decode data according to the ABI specification. The ABI specification describes a set of functions commonly used in smart contract programming in a language-agnostic manner; string concatenation is one such function. There are other libraries one can import into the smart contract that simplify string manipulation. However, using Solidity out of the box to combine strings takes a low-level approach to working with strings. We'll discuss importing libraries into Solidity in depth in future articles.\n\nUnderstanding gas fees in a Solidity function In addition to providing low-level programming capabilities, there is something else that is special about Solidity programming in particular and smart contract programming in general. To run a smart contract on a blockchain incurs fees that must be paid in the cryptocurrency native to the given blockchain. For example, if you run a Solidity smart contract on the Ethereum network, you will incur fees that must be paid in the Ether (ETH) cryptocurrency. Run a Solidity program in the Hedera network and you'll incur fees that must be paid in HBAR. There are other tandems of blockchains and cryptocurrencies to consider as well. These fees are charged because of the nature of the relationship between smart contracts and associated blockchain network. These days, the cost of computing in terms of the actual work done is not that much of a concern to many developers. Storage is cheap, memory is cheap and the cost of CPU cycles is infinitesimal. However, every bit of work a smart contract does and every resource it uses matters. Blockchain networks are, by definition, a consortium of tens and up to thousands of independently owned, autonomous machines that act in concert according to well-known algorithms. The owners of those machines want to be paid for the resources a smart contract uses. To deploy a Solidity smart contract onto a production blockchain, such as Ethereum's mainnet, there's a fee whenever resources such as memory and CPU cycles are used to validate a transaction. For example, there's a fee when the smart contract is deployed, and another one when a smart contract's function is called. Any fee incurred to validate a transaction is called a gas fee. Gas fee calculation depends on the blockchain upon which the smart contract is deployed. The details of gas fee optimization are a bit beyond the scope of this article; we'll cover them in a later one. For now, the important thing to understand is that the smart contract you deploy onto a production blockchain will cost you money as it runs. Also, you must hold enough of the blockchain's cryptocurrency to pay for the transaction fees your smart contract incurs. When you run a smart contract, there is no free lunch. Such is the nature of decentralized computing."

        "title": "Bitcoin recedes as illicit actors look to Tron, Ethereum, and Binance Smart Chain as blockchain wars evolve - Fortune",
        "content": "Proof of State is the Wednesday edition of Fortune Crypto where Leo Schwartz delivers insider insights on policy and regulation.\n\nThe myth of crypto as an untraceable haven for cybercriminals has long been busted, even if Bitcoin still carries the reputation as a dark web currency used to buy drugs and hire hit men. If anything, blockchain\u2019s immutable records provide better opportunities for insight into illicit activity than plain old cash, creating a golden age for law enforcement investigations thanks to the rise of analytics firms like Chainalysis and TRM Labs.\n\nA new report from TRM Labs adds another wrinkle to the Whac-A-Mole game between illicit actors and law enforcement, as its global head of policy, Ari Redbord, a former Department of Justice prosecutor and U.S. Treasury undersecretary, put it. Cybercriminals are also aware of the tracing reality of crypto and have acted accordingly. As the report notes, Bitcoin has receded dramatically, accounting for 97% of total illicit crypto volume in 2016 and just 19% in 2022. \u201cWe lived in a world again, just a few years ago, where really all you needed was to track and trace the flow of funds on Bitcoin,\u201d Redbord said. \u201cTracing certainly has changed.\u201d\n\nThe report lays out an arms race between cybercriminals and global law enforcement, where illicit actors are using new attempts to evade detection, from privacy coins like Monero and Zcash to mixers like Tornado Cash, and regulators are close on their tail. According to TRM Labs, illicit actors have mostly turned to Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain for hacks, with 68% and 19% of overall volume, respectively, and have almost exclusively turned to Tron for terrorist financing, which represents 92% of overall volume. \u201cReally, over the last few years, we\u2019ve seen a shift to digital battlefields, where wars are fought on blockchains,\u201d Redbord said.\n\nDespite the ever-evolving methods of illicit actors, Redbord maintained that law enforcement\u2014and especially regulators, including the Treasury Department\u2014are mostly winning the battle. While hacks are still happening at a fast clip, a priority has been closing off-ramps into fiat currency for state actors like North Korea, with the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control controversially sanctioning crypto addresses and mixers for the first time last year.\n\nThe growing popularity of cybercriminals turning to Tether on Tron\u2014a confluence of two notoriously unregulated crypto tools\u2014provides another challenge. As a stablecoin, Tether is particularly appealing because of its peg to the U.S. dollar. Tron has the advantage of lower transaction fees than other blockchains like Ethereum, along with the perception of existing outside the watchful eyes of regulators.\n\n\u201cWe have seen Russian cybercriminals, drug cartels, and even North Korean state actors look to Tron, where there is an ecosystem of noncompliant crypto businesses ready to convert funds,\u201d Redbord said, adding that there has been a 240% increase in the use of Tether on Tron over the past year for terrorist financing.\n\nWhile TRM Labs is able to provide tracing capacities on Tron, the shift still demonstrates the ongoing risks that offshore crypto venues pose to regulators. Last week, the Department of Justice announced a new cyber section within its national security division. Even if Congress is dragging its feet on crypto, the rest of the government isn\u2019t waiting around.\n\nLeo Schwartz\n\nleo.schwartz@fortune.com\n\n@leomschwartz\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nA Nevada regulator said that crypto custodian Prime Trust had a \u201cshortfall of customer funds\u201d and placed the firm into receivership.

That would bring the amount of ETH needed to natively stake to 2,040 ETH as opposed to the current 32 ETH.\n\nWhile some have claimed that the proposal would not be in the interest of the Ethereum network, it would probably be in the interest of pooled staking solutions such as Lido \u2013 which have seen significantly increasing interest both after and in the run up to Ethereum\u2019s transition to Proof of Stake.\n\n(About Ethereum)\n\nEthereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain platform that was first introduced in 2015. It is built on the idea of smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts that automatically enforce the rules and terms of an agreement between parties. The platform allows developers to build and deploy decentralized applications (dApps) that can run on the Ethereum network. The native cryptocurrency of the platform is called Ether (ETH) and it is used to pay for transactions, gas fees, and as a store of value. Ethereum is known for its programmable, versatile and secure smart contracts, which have enabled the development of a wide range of innovative dApps, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and more."

        "content": "In a recent CNBC interview, Consensys founder Joseph Lubin made a bold statement affirming that Ethereum (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, should be classified as a commodity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLubin referenced past statements by regulatory bodies, including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), as supportive evidence for his stance. Despite this, Gary Gensler, the chairman of the SEC, has not yet explicitly acknowledged Ether as a commodity, even though he has recognized Bitcoin as such.\n\nIn the interview, Lubin highlighted former SEC official Bill Hinman's speech in 2018, which he described as having effectively declared Ether not a security.\n\nThe Ethereum co-founder pointed out that 18 of Hinman's colleagues collaborated on the speech, indicating a consensus within the SEC at the time. However, he admitted there might still be a few regulators who have yet to concede that Ether is not a security, although he did not see it as a significant issue.\n\nLubin also reflected on the progress within the cryptocurrency industry over the past year. He pointed to successful developments and launches in 2022, and emphasized that the initiative to \"clean up the CeFi rot\" has been incredibly valuable for the industry. CeFi, or centralized finance, has faced numerous criticisms in the past for not aligning with the decentralized ethos of cryptocurrencies.\n\nLubin's statements are compelling, but they have no effect on the official classifications of Ether. A formal recognition from Gensler and the SEC, classifying Ether as a commodity, is yet to come."

        "content": "Qadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nStory Highlights The Ripple-SEC legal battle sparks global interest over the impact of Bill Hinman's Ethereum stance.\n\nTwo scenarios emerge: Exempting Ethereum could extend to Ripple's XRP, or lack of notice may absolve XRP from penalties.\n\nSpeculation arises about financial influence on Hinman's leniency towards Ethereum\n\nThe ongoing legal clash between Ripple Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has garnered widespread attention within the global crypto community. Social media platforms have become hotbeds of discussion, particularly regarding the potential implications of former SEC director Bill Hinman\u2019s stance on Ethereum (ETH) in relation to the Ripple case.\n\nHere\u2019s what the latest dialogue was all about.\n\nRipple Case Mired in Intrigue and Speculation\n\nA blockchain specialist going by the moniker \u2018Mr. Huber\u2019 responded to a tweet questioning the relevance of Hinman\u2019s viewpoint on Ethereum to the evidence stacked against Ripple. Mr. Huber outlined two potential scenarios.\n\nScenario 1: If Judge Analisa Torres concludes that Hinman legally exempted Ethereum from being classified as a security, then it\u2019s likely that the same logic would be applied to Ripple\u2019s XRP. Intriguingly, Hinman\u2019s Ethereum analysis did not factor in the scale or transparency of the holdings, which could mean XRP was not marketed as security and thus incurs no penalties.\n\nIf Judge Analisa Torres concludes that Hinman legally exempted Ethereum from being classified as a security, then it\u2019s likely that the same logic would be applied to Ripple\u2019s XRP. Intriguingly, Hinman\u2019s Ethereum analysis did not factor in the scale or transparency of the holdings, which could mean XRP was not marketed as security and thus incurs no penalties. Scenario 2: The second scenario considers that if Judge Torres deems that Hinman\u2019s exclusion of Ethereum as a security was unlawful, yet a rational individual could have believed that XRP would be governed by similar regulations based on Hinman\u2019s public stance, XRP might have been sold as a security, but without proper notice, leading again to no penalties.\n\nAlso Read: Ripple News: XRP Price Might Surge More Than 20% If This Scenario Plays Out\n\nControversy Surrounding Hinman\u2019s Role\n\nAttorney Bill Morgan has introduced a provocative theory regarding the relationship between Hinman and Ethereum. Morgan suggests that Hinman may have been influenced financially by the Ethereum Foundation or an associated entity, prompting him to adopt a lenient approach towards Ethereum. According to Morgan, this could explain why Ethereum was seemingly given a free pass in the ongoing regulatory scrutiny faced by cryptocurrency.\n\nRead More About This: Ripple Vs SEC: Hinman Papers Exposed \u2013 Why Did The SEC Exempt Ethereum From Regulatory Action?\n\nAs speculations continue to swirl, all eyes are now on the Ripple-SEC saga, with crypto-enthusiasts across the globe eager to see how Hinman\u2019s perspective on Ethereum might influence the final verdict for XRP."

        "title": "The Top 10 Biggest Holders of Ethereum, and it May Surprise You - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, not as much publicity is given to the largest holders of ETH\n\nBiggest ETH holders are not individuals but mostly protocols, companies or purely unidentified accounts\n\nAt a time when more individuals are learning about cryptos, investments in Ethereum continue to draw attention\n\nEthereum has grown to be one of the most widely used cryptocurrencies since its release in 2015 but its biggest holders are not always publicly announced. One of the most valuable digital assets on the planet, it is a decentralized platform that enables developers to create and deploy distributed apps. Who, holds the most Ethereum, or better said \u2013 WHAT holds the most Ethereum?\n\nThe Biggest ETH Holders Are Not Individuals\n\nThere were 236.48 million Ethereum holders as of June 27, with the top 10 holders holding 31.49%, according to CoinCarp . A year ago, this number stood at 199.31 million, representing an 18.38% increase.\n\nHowever, owners of Ethereum are not only hard to find but also hard to track down. Since many holders will have many addresses, the Ethereum wallet address cannot be used to represent a single individual.\n\nBut when it comes to Ethereum, the biggest ETH holders don\u2019t get as much attention. Who possesses the most may be easily seen by using an Ethereum block explorer like EtherScan .\n\nAs it can be seen, the largest holdings are frequently companies rather than individuals, but there are undoubtedly some ETH whales, just like there are Bitcoin whales.\n\nSince there is no universal method to identify the owners of Ethereum addresses, there are no public records of \u201cEthereum millionaires.\u201d However, there are businesses that specialize in locating persons using addresses. It has been claimed that some well-known members of the Ethereum community, including Vitalik Buterin and Joseph Lubin, have amassed riches as a result of their work on the project. They are frequently called \u201cEthereum whales.\u201d They can influence market mood thanks to their huge wallets.\n\nThey are hopeful about the future of peer-to-peer payments as well as the longer-term application of Ethereum for computing power. Ethereum appeals to many because of its unparalleled versatility.\n\nThe majority of the biggest Ethereum holders are obviously the exchanges, but there are some individuals and protocols holding a lot as well.\n\nTop Ethereum Holders\n\n1) Beacon Chain Contract: ~18 million ETH\n\nThe Beacon Chain contract was the one employed by Ethereum during the transition from proof of work to proof of stake, which was successfully completed in the fall of 2022 with the Merge phase.\n\nOnce the transition to proof of stake was complete, Ethereum owners had the option of staking their cryptocurrency to this address in order to get rewards. The ETH of many large exchanges, including Coinbase and Binance, was pooled to be staked to this contract, which is still being carried out. With more than 18 million ETH in the contract, it is the biggest ETH holder.\n\n2) Binance: ~4.4 million ETH\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise that one of the largest holders of ETH is also the largest exchange in the world based on trading volume.\n\nHowever, it might come as a surprise to learn that, if you sum up only three of the primary Binance Ethereum addresses, they really control more over 4 million ETH, making them the second-largest ETH holder. The largest amount of Ethereum is unquestionably held by that exchange. Along with their Binance-Peg Tokens address, there are Binance 7, 8, and 14 addresses, which are exchange wallets utilized for various exchange services.\n\nWhen users of the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) bridge their ETH to the BSC, the ETH is held here. It is kept at this Peg address until the ETH is transferred back to Ethereum from the BSC. Address 7, 8, and the peg address are all top 10 holders individually, while Binance 14 is 19th.\n\n3) Wrapped ETH Contract: ~3.7 million ETH\n\nWETH wrapped ETH is another well-liked contract. Since ETH by itself is not an ERC-20 token, using it with DeFi programs like Uniswap is challenging, so the developers developed a method to \u201cwrap\u201d ETH in an ERC-20 token. This makes it compatible with a wide range of apps. It is only more useful; its cost is the same as that of normal ETH. With more than 3.7 million ETH, the WETH contract is the second-largest single address for ETH.\n\n4) Kraken: ~1.7 million ETH\n\nAnother significant ETH holder is Kraken, which ranks fourth with more than 1.7 million and was recently charged by the SEC for its ETH and several other staking possibilities. Even though Kraken is one of the most popular exchanges in terms of trading volume, it appears more plausible that it serves as some form of storage as most exchanges would split up holdings between wallets if they were \u201chot.\u201d\n\n5) Unknown Fund: ~1.6 million ETH\n\nThe sole description of the fifth-largest Ethereum holder is \u201cFund\u201d, with no other details. This fund\u2019s nature, purpose, and controller are all unknown. It it be the largest Ethereum whale ever or just a temporary account for an exchange.\n\n6) Arbitrum Bridge: ~1 million ETH\n\nOne of the L2s previously mentioned is Arbitrum, and its bridge contract holds more than 1 million ETH. The bridge is now the seventh-largest holder of ETH as a result. This number may increase over time as Arbitrum gains popularity as a less expensive alternative to using Ethereum\u2019s primary layer.\n\n7) Bitfinex: ~1 million ETH\n\nThree of the top 20 addresses on Bitfinex, another major exchange by trading volume, have more than one million ETH. Along with one multi-sig wallet, which is probably their cold storage wallet, there are two exchange wallets that are probably used for trading and exchange functions.\n\n8) Lido DAO: ~423,000 ETH\n\nOne of the most well-liked sites for smaller holders of ETH to stake it is the Lido Finance platform. Therefore, it should come as no surprise that this contract holds over 432k ETH, making it the tenth largest holder of the cryptocurrency. As individuals increase or decrease their stake, this number will change.\n\n9) Gemini: ~409,000 ETH\n\nSame as being amongst the biggest Bitcoin holders, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss and their exchange Gemini are presumed to hold a lot of Ethereum as well. According to Etherscan, Gemini currently holds around 409,000 Ethereum. Recently, the exchange formally announced the launch of Gemini Staking Pro in the UK. The service enables organizations and wealthy people to join the Ethereum network as validators by locking up a minimum of 32 ETH, which is equal to almost $60,000 at the time of writing.\n\n10) Vitalik Buterin: ~240,000 ETH\n\nIn October 2018, Buterin disclosed his wallet address on Twitter . He added that he \u201cnever personally held more than ~0.9% of all ETH, and that his net worth never came close to $1 billion.\n\nAlong with Gavin Wood (Polkadot) and Charles Hoskinson (Cardano), Buterin is one of the biggest Ethereum holders. He has multiple ETH addresses, with his VB 3 address being the biggest.\n\nAccording to EtherScan , Buterin sent 320,000 ETH from his primary VB wallet just under two years ago, and he currently possesses over 240,000 ETH at this address. This amounts to well over $400 million USD in ETH, making Buterin one of the biggest Ethereum owners. There are many millionaires in the Ethereum community, but it\u2019s challenging to outbid the network\u2019s founder.\n\nBONUS: FTX Hacker Among 50 Largest ETH Holders\n\nIn November last year, the hacker who took advantage of the now-defunct FTX exchange last week amassed a sizeable fortune, elevating them to the title of \u201cEthereum whale.\u201d\n\nJust one day after the troubled FTX exchange filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, more than $663 million in various crypto assets were stolen from its wallets, of which $477 million was converted into ETH. FTX is also thought to have moved $186 million worth of more than a hundred different tokens into secure storage.\n\nThe FTX wallet drainer was the 27th largest ETH holder after the hack but dropped by 10 positions after dumping 50,000 ETH onto new address."

        "content": "A leading analytics firm says that over a billion dollars worth of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have been taken off crypto exchanges amid a resurgence in buying activity.\n\nIn a new report, IntoTheBlock reveals that the two leading cryptocurrencies witnessed exchange net outflows to the tune of $1.4 billion last week.\n\nExchange netflows is a metric that calculates the total flows of an asset going in and out of exchanges.\n\nAccording to IntoTheBlock, the surge in net outflows last week could largely be attributed to BlackRock\u2019s filing for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). The analytics firm also says that large entities have re-entered the crypto markets following news of the asset management giant\u2019s foray into the digital asset space.\n\n\u201cLooking on-chain, we can see that large players appear to have come back following the prospects of a Bitcoin spot ETF and greater TradFi (traditional finance) participation.\n\nTransactions over $1 million reach a yearly high \u2013 whale transactions climbed over the past week.\u201d\n\nLooking at the activity of crypto whales, IntoTheBlock says that entities that control at least 0.1% of Bitcoin\u2019s supply are in heavy accumulation mode.\n\n\u201cLarge holders\u2019 inflows also reach yearly highs. The amount of Bitcoin added to addresses owning 0.1% or more of the supply climbed by the highest so far in 2023.\n\nNot only are large transactions climbing, whales appear to be accumulating. Comparing this with CEX (centralized exchange) netflows, we can confirm that the entities accumulating are not exchange-related as their netflows were negative while large holders\u2019 were highly positive.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $30,459 while ETH is worth $1,889.\n\nYou can read the full report here.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin disclosed his least favorite aspects of the cryptocurrency industry in a recent Twitter AMA session.\n\nResponding to a question by crypto enthusiast David Hoffman, Buterin expressed his disappointment in those who perceive the main innovation of cryptocurrencies to be merely tokenization.\n\nHe further identified several secondary concerns, including massive capital misallocation, people compromising their principles, unrealistic purist beliefs and unnecessary conflicts within the industry.\n\nHarmony with Bitcoiners?\n\nButerin's comments highlight a tension within the crypto community. The tokenization aspect has opened avenues for new economic models and democratized access to financial instruments, but it appears Buterin believes that viewing it as the main innovation undermines the broader potential of the technology. Blockchain technology, the foundation of cryptocurrencies, offers potential solutions in trust, transparency and decentralization, areas that extend far beyond token creation and management.\n\nDuring the Q&A session, Buterin also suggested ways to create harmony between Ethereum and Bitcoin proponents. He stressed the importance of collaboration to support freedom and privacy tools outside the blockchain. These tools could include end-to-end messaging without phone number requirements, internet anonymity, secure operating systems like graphene and qubes, open hardware and open VR.\n\nMoving to Mars?\n\nAdditionally, Buterin exhibited interest in the potential of human settlement on Mars, responding to a question about the possibility of relocating should Ethereum's transactions per second (TPS) hit 60 million. He noted his decision would depend on the quality of life, jurisdictional properties and culture present on Martian settlements. While only a lighthearted hypothetical, it signals Buterin's broader perspective on the intersection of technology, society and future human endeavors."

        "title": "Bitcoin\u2019s Booming and Black Rock Files for ETF. What Does This Mean For Ethereum & Altcoins like Caged Beasts? - Coin Rivet",
        "content": "Buy and sell Bitcoin the easy way Start your crypto portfolio today! Get started\n\nAs the bull market gains momentum and Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price continues to surge, the spotlight is shining on altcoins and their potential to follow in Bitcoin\u2019s footsteps. Following unveiling the private Bitcoin Trust in August last year, BlackRock\u2019s (BLK) iShares lodged with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) yesterday to launch a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nWith Bitcoin\u2019s price skyrocketing by 4.5% in the last 24-hr, the highest since April, investors are becoming more optimistic about the likelihood of BlackRock and other institutional players investing in digital assets. What could this mean for Bitcoin? Will Ethereum (ETH) follow in the footsteps of Bitcoin, and how much of it affect other altcoins such as Caged Beasts (BEASTS)? Let\u2019s discuss and learn all about it.\n\nBlack Rock Bitcoin ETF: The Gateway to Mainstream Adoption\n\nThe Black Rock Bitcoin ETF has attracted significant interest within the financial realm as an exchange-traded fund that focuses exclusively on Bitcoin. By investing in this ETF, individuals can benefit from Bitcoin\u2019s price fluctuations without possessing the actual cryptocurrency, meaning the risk is less. This ETF effectively connects conventional finance with cryptocurrencies, appealing to institutional investors and those desiring a regulated investment option.\n\nComparing Black Rock Bitcoin ETF with direct cryptocurrency ownership has various benefits. First off, it offers simplicity and accessibility that attracts a broader spectrum of investors. Some security issues with traditional Bitcoin exchanges are reduced when trading on licensed exchanges. Additionally, the ETF structure promotes liquidity and transparency, attracting institutional investors who have previously hesitated to enter the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe significance of the Black Rock Bitcoin ETF lies in its potential to accelerate the adoption of Bitcoin among mainstream investors. Introducing a regulated investment vehicle tied to Bitcoin reduces barriers to entry and establishes a sense of trust and legitimacy in the market. This development could lead to increased institutional participation, which may contribute to the long-term stability and growth of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nEthereum: The Catalyst for Altcoin Season\n\nThe efficiency and adaptability of Ethereum render it a desirable investment prospect. As the foundation of countless DApps and digital initiatives, Ethereum has become a dominant force in the cryptocurrency industry. Thanks to its robust infrastructure and vibrant developer community, the Ethereum platform is constantly improving and innovating. Ethereum is likely to be an accurate store of value, and its staking functionality makes it possible to earn passive revenue.\n\nWhile Bitcoin\u2019s price movements often dominate headlines, Ethereum has the potential to act as a catalyst for altcoin surges. After a 2-day short struggle with altcoins such as Cardano and Chainlink, they have returned to their position. As the second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum\u2019s price movements often influence the overall sentiment and performance of the altcoin market. Ethereum can create a domino effect, driving up the value of other altcoins. This presents investors with opportunities to capitalize on the growth potential of various altcoins.\n\nCaged Beasts: The Altcoin You Need\n\nIn the realm of altcoins, meme coins have gained considerable attention due to their unique appeal and community-driven nature. Caged Beasts is an emerging meme coin that has captured the imagination of crypto enthusiasts worldwide. With a focus on community engagement and utility, Caged Beasts aim to stand out in a crowded market and establish itself as a force to be reckoned with.\n\nTheir referral bonus provides an additional 20% on Tether (USDT) tokens, increasing the potential for passive income generation. And owing to a novel referral program, early investors are able to go on an exhilarating journey with these additional advantages. Caged Beasts have piqued people\u2019s interest with their attractive staking incentives and alluring memes by creating a thriving ecosystem and encouraging a sense of belonging among investors. Given its numerous positive elements, Caged Beasts have the ability to transform how meme currencies are used.\n\nBlack Rock Bitcoin ETF\u2019s emergence as a regulated investment vehicle for Bitcoin paves the way for mainstream adoption and opens doors for institutional investors. Ethereum\u2019s position as a leading blockchain platform and influence on altcoin performance highlights its significance in the crypto market. Meanwhile, Caged Beasts represent meme coins\u2019 creative and community-driven nature with utility, appealing to investors seeking unique and engaging opportunities.\n\nCaged Beasts Website: https://cagedbeasts.com\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/CAGED_BEASTS\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/CAGEDBEASTS\n\nDisclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the author should not be considered as financial advice.

        "title": "Introduction to ERC-20 Tokens - Chainalysis Blog",
        "content": "A transformative aspect of public blockchains is their openness, allowing anyone to participate in and influence the activities of an ecosystem. Arguably, no blockchain or cryptocurrency embodies this more than Ethereum. Over the years, Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts have encouraged rapid token creation and collaboration \u2014 fueling its transformation into the second largest blockchain network by market capitalization. But Ethereum wasn\u2019t always this robust. Initially, without standardized token creation and exchange methods, not all tokens were compatible with all of Ethereum\u2019s decentralized applications. Users would therefore have to find complicated means of converting their tokens between apps.\n\nDeveloper Fabian Vogelsteller proposed a solution to these challenges. In 2015, he submitted an idea called \u201cEthereum Request for Comments 20\u201d (ERC) on the Ethereum Github page, marking the 20th comment on the forum. In it, he described what is now known as the ERC-20 standard, or a technical guideline for smart contracts that power tokens created on Ethereum. ERC-20 was approved and implemented in 2017. Today, many tokens built on Ethereum operate within the ERC-20 standard, including Uniswap\u2019s UNI, Circle\u2019s USD Coin (USDC), and Aave\u2019s AAVE.\n\nKeep reading to learn more about:\n\nWhat is the ERC-20 token standard?\n\nThe ERC-20 standard (also known as EIP-20) details technical guidelines that all Ethereum-based fungible tokens should follow. Tokens built from the ERC-20 standard can be traded with all other tokens on Ethereum and used with diverse products and services, including virtually all dApps built on the Ethereum blockchain, without the need for specialized conversion.\n\nAdvantages and benefits of ERC-20 tokens\n\nThe ERC-20 standard is one of the major drivers of Ethereum\u2019s decentralized applications because it provides the basic framework on top of which participants can innovate and interact with one another. First, it helps simplify the tasks of developers by streamlining token creation. Developers do not have to start their code from scratch or worry that their tokens might be incompatible with other tokens or dApps on the Ethereum blockchain. For this reason, the ERC-20 standard was a significant catalyst for the initial coin offering (ICO) boom between 2017 and 2018, enabling Ethereum participants to build virtually anything they wanted.\n\nERC-20 tokens also help boost liquidity. Before 2017, when Ethereum users could not necessarily use tokens across all dApps, trading was not as accessible. The ERC-20 standard incentivizes active participation within any application by removing conversion barriers, and fueling Ethereum ecosystem productivity and growth.\n\nIn the below image, we see how ERC-20 tokens work with various third-party crypto wallets and other contracts, such as a liquidity pool or decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol. Metamask and etherscan.io are very different products, yet both are compatible with ERC-20s due to the underlying, standardized framework.\n\nSource: Ethereum.org\n\nThe ERC-20 standard offers predictive benefits, too. In an ecosystem where token creation is standardized, participants are better able to anticipate how any token will function once publicly accessible. This may help Ethereum users make informed transaction decisions and positively influence aspiring token creators.\n\nRisks and challenges of ERC-20 tokens\n\nUnfortunately, the ease with which Ethereum participants can create ERC-20 tokens has the potential to enable bad actors. This low barrier to entry means that scammers, for instance, can easily create their own tokens, and may be one reason we\u2019ve seen so many pump and dump token launches in recent years.\n\nCreating an ERC-20 token\n\nDue to the standard code provided by ERC-20, creating Ethereum tokens is generally intuitive. The Ethereum developer community details six functions and two events that developers must include in their smart contract code during the early stages of token creation. There are also three optional criteria for additional token customization.\n\nFunctions:\n\ntotalSupply : The total number of tokens circulating\n\nbalanceOf : The balance of the token creator\u2019s account\n\nallowance : Allows a third-party account to retrieve tokens from the owner\u2019s account if granted permission. Remaining tokens are returned to the owner\u2019s account.\n\ntransfer : Refers to the automatic transfer of tokens between addresses\n\napprove : Determines the amount of tokens a third-party can withdraw from an account\n\ntransferFrom : Allows the token owner to send tokens to a recipient\n\nEvents:\n\ntransfer : Triggers when a transfer is complete\n\napproval : Logs a completed transaction\n\nOptional criteria:\n\nToken name (i.e. Uniswap)\n\nToken symbol : The ticker that represents the token (i.e. UNI)\n\nDecimal points : The number of decimals displayed for users who hold the token in their wallets\n\nAfter incorporating this code, many developers deploy tokens using the Ethereum testnet to confirm smart contract accuracy. If successful, this process can be repeated with real tokens.\n\nThe Ethereum network provides detailed, step-by-step documentation on how to create tokens with the ERC-20 standard and why it boosts network compatibility. Other developer communities such as Alchemy and Moralis offer similar walkthroughs with existing code for public use.\n\nERC-20 token use cases and growth\n\nTokens powered by the ERC-20 standard can represent many different digital assets \u2014 both digital currencies and those based on real-world assets. Common types of ERC-20s include governance tokens, rewards tokens, stablecoins, and memecoins. For instance, Axie Infinity uses ERC-20 tokens called Axie Infinity Shards for governance. Additionally, Uniswap allowed investors to use ERC-20-based tokens in a 2023 NFT offering.\n\nBelow are the top 15 ERC-20 tokens by market capitalization, showcasing diverse products and services that use the ERC-20 standard.\n\nThe growth of tokens like those shown above is a big reason why we\u2019ve seen a large increase in ERC-20 token transaction volume over the last few years, particularly between 2020 and 2021. Check out the graph below, which shows total ERC-20 token inflows to services since 2017.\n\nAs of May 2023, all-time inflows are more than $27 trillion.\n\nERC-20 standards and variations\n\nERC-20 has inspired other technical standards on Ethereum for additional functionality:\n\nERC-721 helps developers create non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nERC-1400 provides a unified framework for developing securities tokens.\n\nERC-223 allows for transaction fees to be paid in the same token as the one being used, rather than paying fees in ETH.\n\nERC-777 provides enhancements to ERC-20 through hooks, which enable the sending of tokens and the notification of contracts in one transaction. However, it is more susceptible to cyber-attacks and difficult to implement, which is why most Ethereum developers still prefer the ERC-20 standard.\n\nEthereum\u2019s driving force\n\nBy employing the ERC-20 standard, Ethereum users are able to participate in transformative business opportunities, methods of value transfer, and innovative projects without substantial obstacles. These technical guidelines for Ethereum token creation dramatically boosted both the success of the developer community and participation in the blockchain industry as a whole.\n\nChainalysis supports ERC-20 tokens across its compliance and investigation product suite, including Chainalysis KYT and Chainalysis Reactor.

        "content": "Majority of the top crypto tokens were trading mixed during the early Asian session on Tuesday amid the mixed global cues. Traders across the globe were waiting for the key economic data for the inflation cues, while the current optimism is fueled by the ETF buzz.\n\n\n\nBitcoin was holding its gains as the largest crypto token added another per cent to hold above the $30,000 mark. However, its largest peer, Ethereum, was trading lower as it retreated marginally and remained below the $1,900 level. However, price action in the altcoins was mixed.\n\n\n\nCrypto markets have experienced a slight pick-up in price action.The crypto fear and greed index has climbed 4 points to remain in the greed zone. Bitcoin has been consolidating around $30,000 which can be considered as a pullback after such a big move. $31,500 has been a historic price and quite a significant one, said Shubham Hudda, Senior Manager, CoinSwitch Markets Desk.\n\n\n\n\"While BTC dominance is also consolidating around its two-year high of 51.7 per cent, some altcoins have also started rallying. This includes Bitcoin Cash which has registered gains of over 100 per cent in the last seven days. It could be attributed to the institutional interest it has amassed after getting listed on Fidelity, Schwab, and Citadel-backed EDX Markets recently,\" he added.\n\n\n\nTop crypto tokens were trading mixed on Tuesday. Among the gainers, Tron rose more than 2 per cent, while Litecoin advanced over a per cent. Tonkin and BNB added a per cent each. On the downside, Solana tumbled more than 2 per cent, while Cardano also shed about 2 per cent. Polkadot declined more than a per cent.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading quite higher, rising to $1.18 trillion-mark as it advanced slightly, less than a per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes gained more than 9 per cent to $36.71 billion.\n\n\n\nBitcoin opened the week above $30,000, as investor optimism continued to build following the approval of the first leveraged Bitcoin futures ETF in the United States. The SEC's approval of the Volatility Shares 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF last week was a major milestone for the crypto industry, said CoinDCX Research Team.\n\n\n\n\"It is being seen as a sign that the regulator is becoming more open to the idea of Bitcoin ETFs. The oldest Bitcoin ETF in the United States saw an uptick in weekly capital inflows as institutional investors seemingly had their interest revived by BlackRock's application for a spot Bitcoin fund,\" it said.\n\n\n\nImage: Crypto-chart-price\n\n\n\nTech View by WazirX Trade Desk\n\nClover Finance(CLV), also known as Clover, functions as a blockchain operating system that offers a comprehensive and user-friendly blockchain infrastructure.

Developed by Tom Lehman, the co-founder of Genius.com, the project is termed Ethscriptions, coined like inscriptions in Bitcoin because of the shared similarities.\n\nEthscriptions allow for non-financial data to be written on the Ethereum network so far as it is under 96 kilobytes. It currently only allows for image-based NFTs, but developers say it will be expanded in the future. Lehman noted that Ethscriptions utilize \u201ccall data\u201d which is data derived within a call to a smart contract making it cheaper and more decentralized than others.\n\n\u201cIt guarantees global uniqueness of the content of all valid Ethscriptions. it\u2019s skating to where the puck is going in an L2 world,\u201d he added.\n\nThe launch has already sparked significant interest in major players in the Ethereum network. Within hours of its launch, over 10,000 inscriptions were recorded. The figure grew to over 30,000 over the weekend, with its debut project, \u201cEthereum Punks\u201d being claimed in a few hours.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLehman hailed the project as a success, claiming that its high adoption almost led to a temporary crash of the official Ethscription site.\n\nCommunity backs innovation\n\nModelled along the lines of Bitcoin Ordinals, the developers Ethscriptions hope to achieve the same results as the community moved in unison, at least for now. BTC Ordinals was launched with huge dissenting views, with many calling it an \u201cattack\u201d against the normal use of the network.\n\nThese views got louder when the blockchain was congested due to the high inscription volume recorded in May. For Ethscriptions, most users focus on the positives calling for more innovation and adoption. Adam McBride, an NFT enthusiast, capped off the community\u2019s sentiment with his views.\n\n\u201cThe exciting thing for me about Ethscriptions, similar to Ordinals, is that developers are playing around again with blockchain technology. It\u2019s this experimentation that drives innovation and adoption,\u201d he stated.\n\nDespite this, McBride also noted that technology has existed on the network for years with few artists deploying it, noting that this would be the first time it gets massive publicity."

        "content": "Sys Labs, the developer behind the Syscoin blockchain, which aims to combine Ethereum-style programmability with Bitcoin\u2019s security, has launched a \u201clayer 2\u201d network called Rollux for cheaper and faster transactions.\n\nLike the main Syscoin blockchain, the Rollux network is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine or EVM, the software that executes smart contracts on Ethereum. The project gets its security from Bitcoin miners via a process known as merged mining that originally was presented by Bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto in 2010.\n\nJust as layer 2 networks or \u201crollups\u201d atop the Ethereum blockchain allow for faster transactions, the Rollux network can process 700 transactions per second assuming basic transfer, versus three to five per second on the base Syscoin layer, according to Sys Labs CEO Jagdeep Sidhu.\n\n\u201cMerged mining is a way to provide another system to open the doors to scale into a rollup,\u201d Sidhu said in an interview. He said the project has been in the works for eight years.\n\nRollups like Optimism, Arbitrum and zkSync have profilerated atop Ethereum, notorious for its sometimes exorbitant fees, as a means of avoiding congestion. Bitcoin (BTC) is the original and largest blockchain and is considered the most secure, but lacks Ethereum\u2019s programmability via smart contracts.\n\nSidhu said a deal has been struck to store data on Filecoin via Lighthouse Storage."

        "content": "In the ever-evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies, it is crucial to critically assess the fundamentals of the most prominent digital assets. Bitcoin and Ethereum have long dominated the market, but they are no longer alone in their quest for supremacy. Ripple, BNB (Binance Coin), Gala, and the emerging CONG token have all captured the attention of investors worldwide. In this comprehensive review, we delve into the essential aspects of these tokens, with a particular focus on the CONG token\u2019s enormous potential.\n\nBy examining their fundamentals, we aim to shed light on whether the CONG token could one day rival the influence of Bitcoin and Ethereum in the crypto space. Having raising more than USD 8 million and reaching over 10,000 holders, the project is now on its CONG token presale stage 8.\n\nCONG Token: Unleashing Enormous Potential\n\nAmidst the array of digital assets, the CONG token emerges as a promising contender, poised to disrupt the crypto space. Developed by The Conglomerate Capital, the CONG token boasts enormous fundamentals that have the potential to elevate it to the status of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Here are the key factors that make the CONG token a compelling investment opportunity:\n\nSolid Foundation and Robust Ecosystem\n\nThe CONG token is built upon a solid foundation, backed by The Conglomerate Capital, a visionary force in the blockchain industry. The project encompasses a robust ecosystem that supports decentralized finance (DeFi), decentralized governance, and a range of utility applications. This foundation sets the stage for the CONG token\u2019s potential growth and adoption.\n\nBUY CONG TOKEN NOW\n\nStaking Platform\n\nThe recently launched staking platform already counts with more than 4000 investors on it. There are options to stake under the locked or flexible methods with different APYs and lockup periods. Investors can earn up to 59% APY plus compound.\n\nCutting-Edge Technology and Innovation\n\nThe CONG token leverages cutting-edge blockchain technology to provide a secure, efficient, and scalable platform. The Conglomerate Capital\u2019s commitment to staying at the forefront of technological advancements ensures that the CONG token remains adaptable to the ever-changing market landscape. This focus on innovation positions the CONG token as a forward-thinking project in the crypto space.\n\nStrategic Partnerships and Collaborations\n\nRecognizing the power of strategic alliances, The Conglomerate Capital actively seeks partnerships with established organizations. These collaborations strengthen the CONG token\u2019s ecosystem, enhance its adoption potential, and open doors to wider opportunities. By fostering a network of key players in the industry, the CONG token aims to solidify its position and drive long-term success.\n\nThe Road Ahead: CONG Token\u2019s Journey to Prominence\n\nWhile Bitcoin and Ethereum have established themselves as leaders, the CONG token presents a unique value proposition that differentiates it from its competitors. Although it is challenging to predict the future with certainty, the CONG token possesses several key characteristics that could contribute to its eventual prominence.\n\nVisionary Leadership and Expertise\n\nBehind the CONG token is a team of experienced professionals, driven by a shared vision to revolutionize the crypto space. The Conglomerate Capital\u2019s leadership brings a wealth of knowledge and expertise, positioning the CONG token for sustained growth and innovation. With their guidance, the CONG token has the potential to carve its own path in the industry.\n\nGrowing Community and Investor Interest\n\nA strong and engaged community is crucial for the success of any cryptocurrency project. The CONG token has been steadily gaining traction, attracting a growing community of supporters and investors. As more people recognize the CONG token\u2019s enormous fundamentals, investor interest is expected to surge, contributing to its potential for long-term success.\n\n1. Market Dynamics and Adoption Potential\n\nThe CONG token\u2019s fundamentals, combined with the dynamic nature of the crypto market, create an environment ripe for growth and adoption. As blockchain technology continues to evolve and gain mainstream acceptance, the CONG token\u2019s utility and innovative features position it to capture a significant share of the market. Its adoption potential could result in substantial price appreciation over time.\n\n2. Bitcoin: The Trailblazer\n\nAs the original cryptocurrency, Bitcoin needs no introduction. Its remarkable rise to prominence has paved the way for the entire crypto industry. Bitcoin boasts a decentralized system, immutable blockchain, and limited supply, making it a store of value and a digital alternative to traditional currencies. Its widespread adoption and recognition have solidified its position as the most influential cryptocurrency in the market.\n\n3. Ethereum: The Pioneer of Smart Contracts\n\nEthereum revolutionized the crypto landscape by introducing smart contracts, allowing developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) on its blockchain. Ethereum\u2019s native token, Ether (ETH), serves as the fuel powering the network. The Ethereum platform enables the creation of diverse blockchain-based projects, including decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and more. Its expansive ecosystem and active developer community have propelled Ethereum to the forefront of innovation.\n\n4. Ripple: Facilitating Global Payments\n\nRipple stands out for its focus on transforming cross-border payments. Unlike most cryptocurrencies, Ripple\u2019s primary goal is not to be a decentralized alternative to traditional currencies but rather to facilitate fast and cost-effective international transactions. Ripple\u2019s native token, XRP, serves as a bridge currency, facilitating the seamless transfer of value across borders. With its partnerships with financial institutions, Ripple aims to disrupt the traditional banking system and streamline global remittances.\n\n5. BNB: Powering the Binance Ecosystem\n\nBinance Coin (BNB) serves as the native cryptocurrency of the Binance exchange, one of the largest and most influential crypto trading platforms worldwide. BNB offers various utilities within the Binance ecosystem, including reduced trading fees, participation in token sales, and more. BNB\u2019s value proposition lies in its close integration with the Binance exchange and the benefits it provides to users of the platform.\n\n6. Gala: Building the Blockchain Gaming Industry\n\nGala is a blockchain platform dedicated to revolutionizing the gaming industry through the power of decentralized technologies. It aims to empower gamers, developers, and content creators by creating an open and transparent gaming ecosystem. The Gala token serves as the currency for in-game purchases and rewards, facilitating a seamless and secure gaming experience.\n\nIn conclusion, the crypto space is a battleground of fundamentals, with Bitcoin and Ethereum leading the way. However, the emergence of the CONG token introduces a fresh contender with enormous potential. Backed by The Conglomerate Capital, the CONG token embodies solid fundamentals, cutting-edge technology, strategic partnerships, and a dedicated team. While it is impossible to predict the future with certainty, the CONG token\u2019s vision and the market dynamics make it a compelling investment opportunity for those seeking to participate in the presale and potentially benefit from its future growth. Investors are encouraged to conduct thorough research and make informed decisions based on their individual investment goals and risk tolerance.\n\nBUY CONG TOKEN NOW\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

Additionally, the funds will be used to develop an in-game marketplace for its other title NFL Rivals, which recently hit over 1 million downloads.\n\nRelated: Casual gamers a \u2018critical\u2019 audience for blockchain games: GameFi execs\n\n\u201cNitro Nation World Tour will be the third game in our portfolio and is slated to be launched within the next few months. We have multiple games still in development that we have yet to announce,\u201d Linden commented.\n\nMythical recently announced the migration of the Mythical Chain from the Ethereum blockchain to the Polkadot ecosystem, saying Ethereum\u2019s slow transaction speeds and high transaction costs led to the decision. \u201cWhat this move really comes down to is that Ethereum simply is no longer optimal or ideal, given the growing needs of our platform. [...] We needed a blockchain partner that is prepared to scale with us,\u201d the Mythical CEO explained.\n\nWith $29 million in sales over the past 30 days, Mythical is one of the top blockchains by NFT sale volume. The new fund is an extension of prior capital raises, including $225 million secured in two rounds in 2021.\n\nMagazine: Here\u2019s how Ethereum\u2019s ZK-rollups can become interoperable"

        "title": "Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Prediction - Is Ethereum and Collateral Network Worth A DCA? - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Shiba Inu (SHIB) investors are starting to lose confidence in the project after several setbacks in 2023. These setbacks have caused Shiba Inu\u2019s value to fall to its lowest value since 2021, with thousands of investors selling their holdings.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) and Collateral Network (COLT) are quickly becoming fan favorites, with many choosing a dollar cost averaging (DCA) strategy to build their portfolios.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nEthereum\u2019s Shanghai Success Halted By The SEC Announcement\n\nEthereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade was a huge success. It pushed Ethereum\u2019s value to over $2000 and triggered a huge influx in the number of investors staking their Ethereum holdings.\n\nIts most notable feature was the new ability for stakers to withdraw assets from the Ethereum Beacon Chain. This new option has resulted in an additional 2.96 million ETH being staked in May, a sign of how popular Ethereum has become.\n\nHowever, Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) price has declined by 7.59% in the past ten days following the SEC lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase. At the time of writing, Ethereum was down to $1,672.89.\n\nNonetheless, investors remain bullish about Ethereum. Ethereum\u2019s daily trading volume is consistently hitting over $7 billion, and the amount of Ethereum being staked is the highest it\u2019s been in 2023.\n\nShiba Inu Hits A Two Year Low\n\nShiba Inu\u2019s price fell to its lowest level since 2021 this week, declining to $0.00000543 following new SEC lawsuits. This marks a monthly decline of 23.00%, with Shiba Inu trading at $0.00000675 at the time of writing.\n\nGiven that Shiba Inu has failed to give back to its audience several times in 2023, price predictions are now turning bearish. Just one month before its crash, Shibarium, Shiba Inu\u2019s new layer 2 scalability platform, was delayed once again, causing frustration throughout the community.\n\nAlthough holders are looking to salvage Shiba Inu by burning tokens, its value continues to decline. Consequently, Shiba Inu\u2019s daily trading volume has dropped below $65 million and many holders are choosing to sell.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nCollateral Network Presale Is Expected To Rise By 3500%\n\nThe Collateral Network presale is one of the fastest growing in the market. Having already increased in value by 68%, momentum is continuing to build with hundreds of new investors buying into the project daily.\n\nCollateral Network is a DeFi asset-backed lending marketplace designed for assets such as supercars, real estate, and other premium assets. The project has been doxxed and KYC audited, and Collateral Network tokens also have locked liquidity for 33 years.\n\nThe aim of Collateral Network is to replace many of the outdated systems in the crowdlending market. To begin, Collateral Network values assets using AI and mints them as fractionalized NFTs. NFT fractions are then sold to investors who loan cryptocurrency to fund the loan and are rewarded with a fixed interest rate.\n\nBefore the end of its presale, Collateral Network\u2019s native token is expected to increase 35x, the current price of the token is a bargain $0.0241 and represents a 141% increase for early buyers.\n\nHolders will be granted a number of bonuses and enjoy several additional price increases once COLT tokens are listed on major exchanges, making COLT one of the most in-demand presale tokens in the market.\n\nFind out more about the Collateral Network presale here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.collateralnetwork.io/\n\nPresale: https://presale.collateralnetwork.io/register\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/collateralnwk\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Collateralnwk\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Ethereum Based Meme Coin Raises Close To $6 Million. Investors Can\u2019t Afford To Miss Out On DigiToads Presale - Punch Newspapers",
        "content": "With more than 94% of TOADS already sold during its ongoing presale, this is the time for investors to go all in and bag this exploding meme coin at lower rates before it sells out.\n\nAs the crypto market continues to struggle, some undervalued assets have defied the prevailing downtrend despite being overshadowed by the best crypto assets. Amidst such purchases going up in a struggling market, TOADS continues to lead with exciting features that leverage Ethereum\u2019s De-Fi and web-3 infrastructure and an ongoing presale making TOADS available at low rates with the best ICO.\n\nEver since this meme coin project stepped into the market, DigiToads has emerged as beacons of hope for worried investors despite the general slowdown in the crypto market, capturing their attention and winning their investments. Let\u2019s go ahead and explore why investors should add TOADS to their crypto portfolios during the ongoing presale.\n\nWhy is TOADS the Golden Ticket to a Promising Financial Future?\n\nAs a newcomer in the meme realm, DigiToads\u2019s ecosystem is more robust than other meme coins, which rely solely on their communities and major new events to drive price growth. That is primarily what makes DigiToads stand strong in a fluctuating market, adding to its recognition and demand.\n\nDigiToads uses a pay-to-earn (P2E) gaming model called \u201cToad-Cade,\u201d players earn virtual toad pets and compete for exciting prizes. The owners of these pets get the satisfaction of training their toads for battle against other competitors. Users can improve their chances of success in TOADS by purchasing supplemental items to better care for and train their digital toad pets.\n\nAdditionally, DigiToads enables investors and Swamp residents to stake NFTs for passive income. DigiToads is a top NFT project in the cryptocurrency market because it consistently rewards Toad NFT holders based on how long they keep their assets locked up. Extra rewards are provided to these users as 2% of all TOADS transactions are placed in a dedicated staking pool just for them.\n\nAdding more to the benefits this Ethereum-based meme coin\u2019s investors can explore is its monthly trading competitions. Calling out all the trading enthusiasts, DigiToads offers winners of the monthly trading competition a Platinum TOAD. The Platinum Toad grants users a vote in platform management and access to one-twelfth of the platform\u2019s treasury. Furthermore, being crypto for beginners, DigiToads not only offers a platform for trading experts to trade and win but it also allows learners in the trading world to benefit from this project through Toad School. Toad School opens doors to different trading strategies for novice traders through courses from the best players in the trading industry. Holders of 3 or more DigiToads NFT can enter this school and explore endless possibilities of becoming top trading players.\n\nAs a meme coin project changing how the meme world is interpreted with its endless use cases, DigiToads has made its native token, TOADS, accessible at a low rate of 0.047 USD. This token drives all the functions in the DigiToads ecosystem, \u2018The Swamp.\u2019 As the project has made it to the top ICO list by selling out more than 94% of its native token, TOADS, and raising over $5.7M in funds, DigiToads is already showing huge signs of successful growth in the short and long run.\n\nConclusion:\n\nLarge-scale cryptocurrency projects boast an abundance of enticing benefits and unprecedented fanfare. However, not every project stands up to the hype and benefits it promises to introduce to its investors. While some projects offer limited features, others make fake promises with no solid roadmap or approach to benefit their holders.\n\nUnlike such projects, DigiToads is gaining recognition and early success for all the right reasons. From having a clear and detailed roadmap to approaching all the substantial aspects of the crypto world, DigiToads not only connects with different crypto communities but also opens doors for them to grow and seek profits in their respective communities. With so much on the plate, this is the right time for investors to add this Ethereum-based meme coin to their portfolio before its price surges.\n\nVisit DigiToads Presale\n\nMint DigiToads NFTs Here\n\nBuy DigiToads NFTs on OpenSea\n\nJoin the community"

        "title": "Hedera vs. Ethereum: Find the Right Chain for the Right Job - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "What you will learn\n\nUnlike Ethereum, Hedera is natively Maximal Extractable Value (MEV)-resistant. This ensures that DEXs and other decentralized finance applications and marketplaces are fairer to users.\n\nHedera, but not Ethereum, offers asynchronous Byzantine fault tolerance, which affords fair transaction ordering, consensus timestamps, and leaderless node operation.\n\nA single Hedera transaction requires only 0.02 watt-hours per transaction but 30 watt-hours on the Ethereum network.\n\nHedera transactions settle with finality in 3-5 seconds, while it can take up to 15 minutes on Ethereum.\n\nDecentralized applications rely on cryptographic and distributed ledger technology for trusted digital transactions, but the technology can come in varied forms. Hedera and Ethereum are two very different types of distributed ledgers that enable developers to build and deploy smart contracts to create immutable and transparent economies, while improving business processes. Ethereum, one of the leading blockchain-based ledgers, is very well known. Hedera is smaller, but is quickly carving out its place in the web3 space.\n\nWhen you weigh Hedera vs Ethereum, your first point of comparison is the former\u2019s directed acyclic graph (DAG) technology, hashgraph, with the latter\u2019s blockchain format. Understanding DAG-based ledgers is essential to understanding the difference between the two networks.\n\nIt also helps to understand what it means to be asynchronous Byzantine fault tolerant (ABFT). ABFT is an essential measurement of whether a ledger is safe against attackers, and Hedera is one of the only public aBFT layer 1 networks in the broader web3 market.\n\nThis article will examine those issues and more as it compares Hedera and Ethereum and their roles in a decentralized economy.\n\nAn overview of Hedera and Hashgraph Consensus\n\nThe Hedera network was launched in 2018 to overcome five major obstacles faced by distributed ledger technologies (DLTs): performance, security, governance, stability, and regulatory compliance. Hedera believed the most compelling DLT use cases required consensus latency measured in seconds. Per Hedera\u2019s whitepaper, it was also essential that \u201ca general-purpose public ledger be governed by representatives from a broad range of market and geographic sectors.\u201d\n\nFrom the get-go, Hedera aimed to be governed by up to 39 leading global organizations, with no single entity having control and no small group having undue influence. Today, the Hedera governing body is led by 28 of the world\u2019s leading organizations, including IBM, Dell, Chainlink, Ubisoft, Google, LG, and Boeing.\n\nCouncil members vote on proposals and codebase changes that are submitted by Hedera\u2019s developer ecosystem through the Hedera Improvement Proposals (HIPs) program. This program ensures that changes to Hedera\u2019s codebase, standards, and ecosystems are driven directly by folks building web3 applications and engaging the network daily.\n\nHedera optimizes its network speeds using a DAG-based architecture. Directed acyclic graphs have vertices and edges that never form a closed loop. When used in a DLT, the distributed node network resembles a graph more closely than a blockchain. For example, Hedera\u2019s gossip-about-gossip protocol lets each node communicate with all others in the network, sharing new information. When one node learns new information, it passes it to a randomly-selected node. Each of the two nodes then selects another random node to share the information with, and those nodes do the same. This graph-based architecture lets nodes pass data throughout the network at unprecedented speeds. Uniquely, gossip-about-gossip also shares how every node on the network has previously voted on transactions when coming to consensus; because every node knows what the others know, this reduces the network\u2019s overall bandwidth and compute consumption when coming to consensus.\n\nHedera\u2019s speeds are further enhanced by its robust mirror network. Mirror nodes function as read-only nodes that contain a verifiable history of all transactions on the network exposed across various network explorers and data APIs. Mirror nodes efficiently pass historical transaction information to users and dApps without impacting the main network, leaving it free to handle transaction processing.\n\nHashgraph consensus\n\nHedera\u2019s hashgraph consensus algorithm is a core element of its operation and success. Hashgraph improves upon blockchain technology in numerous ways. Blockchains can be represented as a single chain of blocks, with new blocks falling in line as the chain grows. If two blocks are created simultaneously, the network must choose one chain and discard the other. Hedera hashgraph comes to consensus on every transaction individually, weaving newly-created transactions back into the ledger and ordering them fairly.\n\nBlockchains must artificially slow down their growth to ensure blocks aren\u2019t added faster than they can be validated. In contrast, there is no negative impact when the hashgraph\u2019s data structure grows quickly.\n\nIts hashgraph algorithm makes Hedera one of the only ABFT distributed ledgers, meaning honest nodes are guaranteed to agree on consensus and the ordering of transactions, even if malicious nodes exist. No distributed ledger network can ensure consensus if more than one third of the nodes are compromised, but ABFT networks are guaranteed to come to consensus if one third or fewer of the nodes are compromised.\n\nAdditionally, with Hedera\u2019s proof-of-stake, there is no bonding or slashing for validators or stakers \u2014 this is because of hashgraph\u2019s aBFT property and lack of a blockchain mempool. Because validators are literally unable to behave nefariously by re-ordering transactions, there is no need for these punitive measures seen on other networks.\n\nConsensus service\n\nHedera is the only layer 1 public network to offer developers a tool to create decentralized logs of immutable and timestamped events for mission-critical web2 and permissionless web3 applications. These applications include tracking products in a supply chain, logging sensitive user access information, building DAO tooling, creating an asset bridge, and more.\n\nEnabled by low, fixed fees, scalable transactions, and native consensus timestamps, the Hedera Consensus Service (HCS) acts as a \u201cdecentralized Kafka,\u201d delivering multi-party trust and verifiability for streaming data at web scale.\n\nCryptocurrency\n\nThe Hedera platform is known for its low, fixed fees, scalable throughput of 10,000 transactions per second, and robust security. Transactions on Hedera are paid for using its native token, HBAR cryptocurrency. Payments on Hedera can be performed using institutionally-backed stablecoins, such as USDC, or your own cryptocurrency.\n\nThe Hedera Token Service allows any entity to configure, mint, and manage fungible and non-fungible tokens using just a few lines of code. These tokens map to Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 and 721 standards for interoperability, and the Hedera developer community is always staying up-to-date on the latest standards for Hedera to support via its Hedera Improvement Proposals (HIPs) program.\n\nThe token service is integrated with the Hedera Smart Contract service for enhanced flexibility. Hedera also offers numerous compliance configurations to reduce regulatory burdens, such as optional KYC flags for accounts and token associations. This can prevent spam airdrops by requiring an account to associate a token before successfully receiving it in their account.\n\nSmart contracts\n\nThe Hedera network makes it easy for developers to create and deploy smart contracts using the EVM, as they can configure them using Solidity or port existing Solidity code in just a few minutes. The Hedera Smart Contract service is compatible with the most ubiquitous libraries, tooling, and development environments supported by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This means Ethereum developers can easily start building on Hedera using the tools they\u2019re most familiar with, such as HardHat, Truffle, Foundry, web3JS and ethersJS. In addition, developers and retail users can use MetaMask with the Hedera network to test their dApps or connect into Hedera\u2019s thriving permissionless DeFi, ReFi, and NFT ecosystems.\n\nOverview of Ethereum\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain initially employed a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism. PoW consensus relies on miners competing to solve intricate mathematical problems to gain the right to add new blocks to the blockchain. Miners were incentivized to participate with ETH rewards.\n\nPoW consensus mechanisms were controversial due to the vast computing power needed to reach consensus and the energy it burned. According to Ethereum\u2019s website, their PoW energy requirements were comparable to the nation of Uzbekistan, with a carbon emission equivalent to that of Azerbaijan.\n\nEthereum began transitioning from PoW to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism in 2022. Validators in a PoS system stake ETH to participate in the network. Per Ethereum, this change cut their annual energy consumption from 78 TWh to 0.0026 TWh (2,600,000 KWh).\n\nThe overall structure of Ethereum is made up of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and the Ethereum World State. The EVM, a decentralized computer running on every node in the Ethereum network, is responsible for executing smart contracts. The Ethereum World State is a database containing all data on the Ethereum network, such as account balances, transaction history, and smart contract code. The Ethereum World State isn\u2019t stored on the blockchain. It is stored using a Merkle Patricia tree (trie), a data structure with \u201cchild nodes\u201d that branch off of \u201cparent nodes.\u201d\n\nEthereum consensus mechanism\n\nEthereum uses the Gasper consensus mechanism, a collection of technologies that secure Ethereum\u2019s PoS blockchain. Gasper combines Casper the Friendly Finality Gadget (Casper-FFG) and the LMD-GHOST fork choice algorithm.\n\nCasper-FFG is a PoS-based partial consensus mechanism that helps the Ethereum network handle network latency or deliberate attacks. In a blockchain, each parent block should link to a single child block. However, if multiple child blocks branch off one parent block, Casper would choose which child block acts as the next link in the canonical chain.\n\nThe LMD-GHOST fork choice algorithm helps the Ethereum network handle forks. When a fork occurs, the LMD-GHOST algorithm chooses the side with more support from validators rather than the side with a longer chain.\n\nGasper helps Ethereum achieve consensus to validate transactions as long as two-thirds of the nodes are honest. Per the Ethereum website: \u201cIn Gasper, there is an additional line of defense against a liveness failure, known as the \u2018inactivity leak.\u2019 This mechanism activates when the chain has failed to finalize for more than four epochs. The validators that are not actively attesting to the majority chain have their stake gradually drained away until the majority regains two-thirds of the total stake, ensuring that liveness failures are only temporary.\u201d\n\nCryptocurrency\n\nETH is the Ethereum network\u2019s native cryptocurrency. Ethereum also has multiple token standards for creating new tokens on the Ethereum network. For example, the ERC-721 standard is used to create NFTs, while the ERC-20 standard is used to create cryptocurrencies and other fungible tokens.\n\nSmart contracts\n\nEthereum was the first blockchain to introduce smart contract technology. Developers can use smart contract coding languages, such as Solidity or Vyper, to deploy automatically-executing smart contracts on the Ethereum network.\n\nComparison of Hedera and Ethereum\n\nNow that you know how Ethereum and Hedera work, let\u2019s compare these peer-to-peer networks.\n\nCost\n\nEthereum transactions require gas fees to cover the computational effort needed to create new blocks. Each block has a base fee that increases exponentially based on the size of the previous block. For transactions to be validated, the gas fee must be equal to or greater than the base fee. This model makes Ethereum fees relatively predictable, but they still vary from day to day.\n\nHedera\u2019s fee structure is decided by its governing council with input from ecosystem stakeholders and is represented in USD but paid in HBAR. Hedera\u2019s low transaction fees comprise a service, network, and node fee. You can use Hedera\u2019s fee calculator to estimate the amount you\u2019ll owe for a particular type of transaction. The calculator lets you choose a Hedera service, such as the cryptocurrency or smart contract service, the configurations you\u2019ll be using, and the number of transactions and signatures.\n\nSustainability\n\nDistributed ledger technology requires energy to process transactions, execute contracts, and run decentralization applications. The required energy depends on the computational effort needed for the task. The Hedera network is carbon-negative, meaning Hedera removes more carbon from the environment than it generates.\n\nThe UCL Centre for Blockchain Technologies determined that a single Hedera transaction requires only 0.02 watt-hours. Comparatively, the Ethereum network requires 30 watt-hours (0.03 kilowatt-hours) per transaction.\n\nPerformance\n\nIn its simplest terms, a network\u2019s performance boils down to how many transactions it can handle per second and how quickly they are finalized. Hedera transactions settle with finality in 3-5 seconds, and its native services reliably scale to 10,000 transactions per second (TPS) and beyond. The Ethereum network handles between 27-30 TPS, and finality can take up to 15 minutes.\n\nEase of use\n\nFor the average user, ease of use will be based on the dApps and marketplaces interacting with a given network. This is influenced by how easy it is for developers to use the network. Native Hedera Token Service allows for the creation of ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens interpreted as smart contracts (EVM addresses) created in just a few lines of code. In addition, royalties are configured in just a few lines of code and are at the protocol level, meaning all marketplaces, wallets, and SDKs have to abide by those royalty fees. Hedera offers developers the ability to use familiar libraries, tools, and development environments, such as HardHat, Truffle, Foundry, web3JS, and ethersJS, to build, test, and deploy their smart contract applications on the network.\n\nThe Ethereum network lets developers use Solidity, Vyper, or a range of other common EVM coding languages. This makes it easy for developers to get started with Ethereum.\n\nHedera vs. Ethereum use cases\n\nHedera and Ethereum differ in numerous ways. Hedera\u2019s speed, security, compliance tools, and scalability give it an edge in many industries. However, Ethereum\u2019s popularity makes it better suited for certain applications.\n\nHedera\u2019s speed and security make it ideal for tracking goods and materials through a supply chain. Its low fees make it well-suited for real-time payments, and its compliance tools make it perfect for financial services. Additionally, Hedera is more suitable for government applications because it is secure, affordable, and scalable. Here\u2019s a look at some Hedera use cases.\n\nHedera use cases\n\nNFTs\n\nHedera offers low, fixed fees, native royalties, scalable transactions, and a carbon-negative footprint, making it a robust best network for NFT applications and projects. Royalties are enforced at the protocol level, and you can incorporate NFT royalty fees with just a few lines of code and ensure payment to creators for all secondary sales. Immutable royalties on Hedera are paid by the NFT recipient and can optionally include a fallback fee.\n\nMore than 600,000 NFTs have been minted on the Hedera mainnet and more than 1.1 million NFT transfers have been performed. Hedera\u2019s NFT ecosystem has thousands of fast-growing projects, including the Dead Pixels Ghost Club, Hangry Barboons, and Koala Hash Klub.\n\nHedera and its robust NFT ecosystem offers all the tools developers need to create an NFT marketplace, project, financial application, or ecosystem tool. You can buy, sell, mint, and bid on NFTs using marketplaces and launchpads built on Hedera. And Hedera\u2019s permissionless application ecosystem is a great place to create or import a Hedera account for free, buy HBAR and USDC using a bank card, manage tokens and NFTs, and achieve other goals.\n\nDecentralized Finance\n\nUnlike Ethereum, Hedera is natively Maximal Extractable Value (MEV)-resistant. This ensures that DEXs and other decentralized finance applications and marketplaces are fairer to users.\n\nHedera doesn\u2019t use a mempool to hold transactions prior to their processing and there\u2019s no bribing of nodes. Transactions are guaranteed to be ordered fairly, so there\u2019s no threat of frontrunning. Also, Hedera can process up to 15 million gas per second, the same as what Ethereum aims to achieve in an entire block.\n\nDevelopers can build and deploy EVM-based smart contracts using the most popular languages, including Solidity and Vyper, to create DeFi applications and protocols on Hedera.\n\nSustainability\n\nIn an environmental impact study by UCL comparing different distributed ledger networks, Hedera was proven to be the most sustainable network. With Hedera\u2019s low energy network and with world class governance, developers can build, deploy, or access solutions for fast-growing sustainability ecosystem.\n\nTYMLEZ, a pioneer in the development and delivery of carbon reporting and guarantee-of-origin solutions, was built on the Hedera network. TYMLEZ provides companies across the globe with world-class solutions designed to empower them in their decarbonisation journeys.\n\nAnd the Hedera Guardian is an open-source platform that leverages the Hedera public distributed ledger network to enable digital-first sustainability policies and enables dMRV (Digital Measurement, Reporting, and Verification) requirements-based tokenization implementation. The Hedera Guardian provides auditable, traceable, and reproducible records that document the emission process and lifecycle of carbon credits, which reduces fraud in the ESG market.\n\nDecentralized Logging\n\nHedera is the only layer 1 public network that offers developers a tool to create decentralized logs of immutable and timestamped events for mission-critical web2 and permissionless web3 applications. You can, to name just a few of the many possibilities, track products in a supply chain, log sensitive user access information, build DAO tooling, and create an asset bridge.\n\nWith its low, fixed fees, scalable transactions, and native consensus timestamps, the Hedera Consensus Service (HCS) acts as a \u2018decentralized Kafka\u2019, delivering multi-party trust for streaming data at web scale.\n\nPayments\n\nOn Hedera, you can make scalable, real-time, and affordable payments in HBARs, supported stablecoins, or your own cryptocurrency. Hedera enables token issuers to define account-level KYC verification and freeze, token supply management, transfer, and more.\n\nHedera is a USDC-compatible platform and has more than $250 million in USDC liquidity.\n\nHedera is working on a global scale to streamline payments. To expedite cross-border transactions, Shinhan Bank, the leading bank in South Korea, and Standard Bank, the largest bank in Africa, united in a proof-of-concept Stablecoin on Hedera. And Banxa, an international financial technology platform, became in 2022 the first retail platform to support USDC on Hedera.\n\nDecentralized Identity\n\nOn Hedera, developers can build decentralized identity right into their applications. Hedera is a member of W3C and has registered a DID Method to the W3C Credentials Community Group\u2019s Decentralized Identifier (DID) registry.\n\nThe Hedera Consensus Service, using the open DID specification developed by the W3C DID working group, offers developers building on Hedera the ability to manage credentials through their lifecycle in a secure, standards-based and privacy respecting manner.\n\nAmong the organizations taking advantage of Hedera\u2019s performance and efficiency are:\n\nEarth ID, a decentralized identity platform\n\nServiceNow, a digital platform for digital workflow\n\nMeeco, a cloud-based platform for data/identity management and reporting.\n\nHedera, Ethereum, and the future\n\nHedera and Ethereum are two of the leading DLTs for decentralized applications and ecosystems, driven by smart contract innovation and development. Hedera\u2019s DAG architecture and aBFT consensus mechanism make it particularly adept at handling high-throughput transactions, processing fair and secure decentralized finance applications, and meeting regulatory compliance needs. Its low, predictable fees and carbon-negative operations make it an attractive choice for many developers.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum\u2019s popularity and robust developer community make it a popular choice based on the size of its existing ecosystems. It isn\u2019t as fast or affordable as Hedera, but its transition to a PoS consensus algorithm has made it more energy-efficient than it once was. Choosing whether to use the Hedera or Ethereum network may depend on your intended use case. However, you can easily build new or transfer existing smart contracts from Ethereum to Hedera if you\u2019ve decided to make the switch."

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin, one of the co-founders of Ethereum, revealed his disfavor for certain aspects of the cryptocurrency sector during a recent Twitter Ask Me Anything (AMA) session.\n\nWhen asked by crypto enthusiast David Hoffman, Buterin conveyed his dissatisfaction with individuals who solely perceive tokenization as the primary breakthrough in cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhile acknowledging that tokenization has facilitated the emergence of fresh economic models and democratized the accessibility to financial instruments, Buterin seems to argue that such a narrow perspective undermines the wider scope of the technology\u2019s potential.\n\nCan we truly appreciate the profound impact of cryptocurrencies if we limit their significance to just tokenization?\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThe Broader Potential Of Cryptocurrencies: Vitalik Buterin\u2019s Insight\n\nOn Twitter, Buterin expressed his disappointment in those who solely view tokenization as the primary innovation within the realm of cryptocurrencies. This revelation raises important questions about the broader potential and transformative power of this technology.\n\nAs always, people who think that the main innovation of crypto is to put tokens into things. \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) June 28, 2023\n\nUndoubtedly, the advent of tokenization has revolutionized the landscape of economic models and democratized access to financial instruments. By converting real-world assets into digital tokens, tokenization has enabled fractional ownership, increased liquidity, and fostered new avenues for investment. It has empowered individuals worldwide to participate in financial activities that were once exclusive to a privileged few.\n\nHowever, the Ethereum architect contends that restricting the significance of cryptocurrencies to tokenization alone would be an oversight that undermines the technology\u2019s true potential. While tokenization has undeniably been a game-changer, it represents just one facet of the broader transformative capabilities that cryptocurrencies bring to the table.\n\nEthereum: Vitalik Buterin\u2019s Secondary Concerns\n\nAlongside his reservations about the limited perception of tokenization, Buterin highlighted additional challenges that warrant attention.\n\nThe Ethereum co-founder also expressed worry over the massive capital misallocation occurring within the cryptocurrency sector. With increased investment and growth, there is a risk of funds being allocated to projects lacking genuine innovation or long-term viability, hampering overall progress.\n\nI feel like there\u2019s lots of #2s: * Massive capital misallocation\n\n* People who easily violate their principles (cough cough fake-libertarians\u2026)\n\n* On the other side, totally unrealistic purist beliefs (\u201c12 word seed phrases are good enough for anyone!\u201d)\n\n* Unnecessary conflict \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) June 28, 2023\n\nIn addition, Buterin noted the potential compromise of principles within the industry. As it gains mainstream attention, individuals may prioritize short-term gains over upholding core principles such as decentralization and transparency, thereby undermining the essence of cryptocurrencies.\n\nHe also cautioned against unrealistic purist beliefs that disregard the complexities and practical challenges faced by the industry. While ideals are essential, they must be balanced with real-world implementation to navigate the industry\u2019s complexities effectively.\n\nEthereum price currently at $1,853 on the ETHUSD daily chart at TradingView.com\n\nLastly, unnecessary conflicts within the cryptocurrency space were a concern for Buterin. While differing perspectives are natural, fostering constructive dialogue and collaboration is vital for the industry\u2019s advancement and collective growth.\n\nButerin\u2019s insights shed light on the challenges that must be addressed to ensure Ethereum and the industry\u2019s sustainable evolution. By tackling issues such as capital misallocation, compromised principles, unrealistic beliefs, and unnecessary conflicts, the cryptocurrency industry can overcome obstacles and pave the way for future growth and innovation.\n\nFeatured image from Security.org"

        "content": "Defunct crypto lender Celsius Network has proposed a joint reorganization plan to resolve its outstanding claims and interests under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.\n\nAs part of this plan, Celsius has requested court approval to convert all altcoin holdings, except those designated for Withhold or Custody accounts, to Bitcoin and Ethereum. According to the filing, the conversion will be done using commercially reasonable efforts to maximize value. If the plan is approved, Celsius will begin converting the altcoins on July 1.\n\nCelsius Customers Alert\n\nFor several reasons, celsius\u2019 move to convert all altcoins to Bitcoin and Ethereum is strategic. Firstly, it allows the company to streamline operations by focusing on the two most popular and valuable cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis will simplify the management of Celsius\u2019 cryptocurrency holdings and potentially reduce costs associated with holding and managing a diverse range of altcoins.\n\nSecondly, Bitcoin and Ethereum are widely accepted and traded in the cryptocurrency markets, making them more liquid than most altcoins. By holding Bitcoin and Ethereum, Celsius can easily buy and sell these cryptocurrencies as needed without worrying about other altcoins\u2019 liquidity.\n\nHowever, David Adler, lawyer and representative of Celsius customers, has raised concerns over the company\u2019s proposed reorganization plan. In a statement, Adler claimed that the plan violates consumer lending laws at both the state and federal levels.\n\nAdler\u2019s objection primarily focuses on treating Retail Borrow Claims, which the Debtors have elected to treat through the Set Off Treatment.\n\nAdler argues that although the Debtors are demanding repayment of the loans, they have no intention of performing their contractual obligations by returning the collateral to the borrowers. According to Adler, this is a clear violation of consumer lending laws.\n\nIn addition to this objection, Adler also criticized Celsius for failing to communicate with the borrower group for six to seven weeks. He believes that further exclusivity extensions are not warranted and that Celsius needs to demonstrate \u201ccause\u201d to justify an extension.\n\nThe Celsius Network Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors has already approved the plan, but opposing parties can submit written objections to the court electronically. These objections will be heard during the June 28 hearing, and opposing parties must submit their objections by June 26 and appear in court to have their claims assessed by the court.\n\nOverall, the defunct crypto lender\u2019s proposed plan of reorganization is facing opposition from some parties, including a group of Celsius customers represented by David Adler. It remains to be seen how the court will rule on these objections and their impact on the network\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView.com"

        "content": "Azuki launches a new Elementals collection of its own, consisting of 20,000 NFTs on Ethereum, the sale of which will begin today.\n\nAzuki and the new 20,000 NFT collection on Ethereum: Elementals\n\nAzuki, the NFT project that has quickly become one of the most popular on the PFP (profile images) scene, has launched its new collection: Elementals.\n\nIt consists of as many as 20,000 Ethereum-based NFTs scheduled to be sold today via Dutch auction, with a starting price of 2 ETH per NFT, the equivalent of more than $3,750 each.\n\nThe Azuki Elementals sale opens on Tuesday, June 27 at 9:00 AM PT. \u2070Elementals will be available to reveal immediately after sale ends.\n\n\n\nFull details below. \ud83e\uddf5 pic.twitter.com/hKBwzIUE58 \u2014 Azuki (@Azuki) June 25, 2023\n\nThe idea of Chiru Labs, the Web3 startup behind Azuki, is precisely to expand the original anime-themed project with additional profile pictures (PFPs) through Elementals.\n\nTo that end, owners of the previous 10,000 NFT Azuki collection have already received one of the Elementals, leaving half of the supply for public sale.\n\nAzuki and the new 20,000 NFT collection on Ethereum: the art has not yet been revealed\n\nWhat is special about this NFT sale is that for those who received the Elementals via airdrop, the art has not yet been revealed. Not only that, what we know is that the NFT Elementals will consist of randomized attributes of varying rarity.\n\nThe collection will contain four levels of Elementals that will be randomly distributed during both the pre-sale and public sale.\n\n\u2726 9:00 AM PT \u2013 Azuki Presale\n\n\u2726 9:10 AM PT \u2013 BEANZ Presale\n\n\u2726 9:20 AM PT \u2013 Public Salehttps://t.co/IVvxoWcm3k pic.twitter.com/vKlwgsvN9n \u2014 Azuki (@Azuki) June 25, 2023\n\nIn addition to that, from what the tweet suggests, the same owners of Azuki NFTs (the previous collection), will have a preferential presale for ten minutes to participate in the Dutch auction of Elementals.\n\nOwners of Beanz NFTs, a collection derived from Azuki, will also have an additional 10 minutes later to grab Elementals NFT.\n\nAnd finally, the public sale will be on at 9:20 AM (PST). The Dutch auction will see the initial price drop every 5 minutes, until stocks run out.\n\nBlockchain ranking in the Non-Fungible Token sector\n\nRecently, it was analyzed how among the blockchains that facilitate NFT transactions, Ethereum continues to be the leader, accounting for a substantial portion of the sales volume.\n\nJust like Azuki, the majority of popular NFT collections continue to use the smart contract blockchain par excellence.\n\nSo much so that in the past week, ETH-based NFT sales increased by 18.11% in seven days, while Bitcoin (BTC)-based NFT sales also saw an increase but only by 10.84%.\n\nBesides Ethereum and Bitcoin, Solana, BNB Chain and Mythos blockchains also seem to be gaining ground, remaining in the top five blockchains for weekly NFT sales."

        "title": "ZkSync vs Ethereum: Revolutionizing Blockchain Transactions - www.crowdwisdom.live",
        "content": "ZkSync vs Ethereum: Revolutionizing Blockchain Transactions\n\nDigital currencies like Ethereum have transformed how we think about money and online transactions. Yet, as more people have begun to use Ethereum, the system has started to creak under pressure, leading to slower transaction times and higher fees. That\u2019s where solutions like ZkSync come in \u2013 it\u2019s like a high-speed lane designed to help Ethereum handle more activity smoothly. This blog post will shed light on the differences between ZkSync and Ethereum and how BlockWallet, a user-friendly digital wallet, can make your experience even better. You don\u2019t need to be an expert \u2013 just bring your curiosity, and we\u2019ll walk through this exciting landscape together.\n\nEthereum in a Nutshell\n\nIf you were to picture Ethereum as a real-world parallel, imagine it as a bustling town fair, the kind where everyone is invited to set up their own unique stalls. In digital terms, these stalls represent \u2018decentralized applications\u2019 (dApps). These applications span a variety of services and industries \u2013 from fun games to financial services, and even digital artwork markets.\n\nJust like any public space, Ethereum operates on a set of rules, and these rules are enforced by smart contracts. A smart contract is like an impartial judge, ensuring everyone follows the agreed-upon terms. If two people bet on a soccer game, for example, the smart contract would hold their funds and then distribute them to the winner after the match. No one can cheat or change the terms halfway, keeping the system fair and reliable.\n\nHowever, as Ethereum\u2019s popularity has surged, it\u2019s like more and more people flocking to the fair. This has led to crowding (or \u2018network congestion\u2019 in tech terms), which slows down transactions and increases the \u2018admission fee\u2019 for faster access. This congestion and high cost represent some of the key challenges Ethereum faces today, which solutions like ZkSync aim to address.\n\nZkSync: The Speed Lane for Ethereum\n\nImagine a bustling amusement park with lines of people waiting for each ride. Now imagine there\u2019s a speed lane that allows people to bypass these lines and enjoy their rides faster. That\u2019s similar to what ZkSync does for Ethereum.\n\nZkSync operates on top of the Ethereum network and is designed to solve the network\u2019s issues of slow transaction times and high costs. It uses a technique called \u2018zkRollup\u2019 to bundle many transactions together and process them all at once. Imagine it as a bus full of people entering the speed lane \u2013 they all get to bypass the queue (faster transaction times), and because the cost of the fast lane is shared, each person pays less than if they had to pay individually (lower transaction fees).\n\nImportantly, ZkSync doesn\u2019t compromise on security. All transactions processed via ZkSync are still validated and secured by the underlying Ethereum network. So, while you\u2019re enjoying the speed lane, you can also rest assured that your transactions are safe.\n\nZkSync vs Ethereum: A Comparative Analysis\n\nTo fully grasp the value of ZkSync, it\u2019s useful to compare it directly with Ethereum, looking at key aspects like transaction speed, fees, security, and more.\n\nTransaction Speed & Scalability\n\nEthereum can process a limited number of transactions per second, which can lead to congestion and slower transactions when the network is busy. ZkSync, on the other hand, can handle many more transactions per second thanks to \u2018zkRollup\u2019, a technique that bundles multiple transactions together. It\u2019s like comparing a single-lane road (Ethereum) to a multi-lane expressway (ZkSync); both can get you to your destination, but the expressway can handle more traffic at a faster pace.\n\nTransaction Fees\n\nEthereum\u2019s transaction fees, known as \u2018gas fees\u2019, can rise when the network is congested. In contrast, ZkSync offers lower transaction fees that remain consistent, regardless of network traffic. Think of Ethereum\u2019s fees as a taxi meter that increases in heavy traffic, while ZkSync\u2019s fees are more like a bus ticket with a fixed, affordable price.\n\nSecurity\n\nBoth Ethereum and ZkSync prioritize transaction security. While transactions on Ethereum are secured by its robust security model, ZkSync operates on top of Ethereum and inherits the same level of security. It\u2019s as if ZkSync is a secure vault within Ethereum\u2019s already secure vault.\n\nFinality\n\nOn Ethereum, it can take some time for a transaction to be fully confirmed or to achieve \u2018finality\u2019, whereas ZkSync generally offers faster confirmations and a smoother transaction experience.\n\nSmart Contracts\n\nEthereum supports complex smart contracts, and at the time of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, ZkSync was rolling out its own support for smart contracts. Please check for the latest updates on this feature.\n\nIn conclusion, while Ethereum has been instrumental in the development of decentralized applications, ZkSync addresses some of Ethereum\u2019s limitations, offering a more scalable, efficient, and cost-effective solution for many users.\n\nWhy ZkSync Matters for the Crypto Community and Beyond\n\nIn the ever-evolving world of digital currencies, ZkSync\u2019s importance stretches far beyond just the crypto community. Here\u2019s why:\n\nFor the Crypto Community\n\nScalability: With the rising popularity of cryptocurrencies and decentralized applications, networks are dealing with increased traffic. ZkSync\u2019s ability to handle a much larger volume of transactions per second than Ethereum can alleviate network congestion, making the user experience smoother and more efficient.\n\nCost-Effectiveness: Crypto users, particularly those who make frequent transactions, will appreciate ZkSync\u2019s consistent and generally lower transaction fees, which can make a significant difference to the cost of transactions over time.\n\nSecurity: Security is paramount in the world of cryptocurrencies, and ZkSync provides a layer of security by utilizing the secure foundation of Ethereum for validating transactions.\n\nBeyond the Crypto Community\n\nAdoption: The improved user experience \u2013 faster transactions, lower costs, and robust security \u2013 can encourage more people and businesses to adopt blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, helping to bring this technology into the mainstream.\n\nSustainability: By processing multiple transactions together, ZkSync uses less energy per transaction compared to individual transactions on Ethereum. This makes it a more environmentally friendly choice, an increasingly important consideration in today\u2019s world.\n\nInnovation: The continued development and improvement of Layer 2 solutions like ZkSync can stimulate further innovation in the blockchain industry, potentially leading to new applications and use cases that we can\u2019t even imagine today.\n\nIn summary, ZkSync is more than just a solution for Ethereum\u2019s scalability issues. It has the potential to reshape the landscape of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, paving the way for wider adoption, greater sustainability, and ongoing innovation.\n\nBlockWallet: Embracing the Future with ZkSync Support\n\nWhile ZkSync\u2019s potential remains untapped by many digital wallets, BlockWallet leads the way by extending support to both ZkSync and Ethereum transactions. This forward-thinking approach ensures flexibility for users and puts BlockWallet at the forefront of the industry. Paired with its uncompromising commitment to robust security, BlockWallet provides a dependable haven for your digital assets.\n\nFurther setting BlockWallet apart is its emphasis on user experience. The design is intuitive and user-friendly, simplifying interactions within the crypto world. If you\u2019re seeking a trusted ZkSync wallet, BlockWallet delivers an effortless blend of seamless transactions, secure storage, and a streamlined interface."
