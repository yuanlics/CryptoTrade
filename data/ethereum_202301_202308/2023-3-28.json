        "title": "The Role of Enterprise Ethereum: Applications, Benefits, and Challenges - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "Enterprise Ethereum is a blockchain network created primarily for enterprises. It is built on the Ethereum blockchain, which is well-known for its adaptability and scalability. This article will look into Enterprise Ethereum's position in business, including its applications, benefits, and challenges.\n\nWhat Is Enterprise Ethereum?\n\nEnterprise Ethereum is a blockchain technology intended specifically for enterprises. It is built on the Ethereum blockchain, a decentralized platform that allows for the development of smart contracts and decentralized apps. (DApps). Enterprise Ethereum is a private blockchain, which means that only authorized users may access it.\n\nEnterprise Ethereum Applications\n\nEnterprise Ethereum has several business applications. Among the most important applications are:\n\nSupply Chain Administration\n\nSupply chain management is a fundamental use of Enterprise Ethereum. It can be used to trace the flow of commodities, validate product authenticity, and streamline supply chain operations. Many supply chain management procedures, such as checking the legitimacy of items and completing payments, can be automated using smart contracts.\n\nKeep Reading Will Blockchain Technology Mark a Turning Point in Fraud Prevention?\n\nIdentity Administration\n\nIdentity management is another Enterprise Ethereum application. It can be used to manage and verify identities securely, lowering the risk of identity theft and fraud. Smart contracts can be used to maintain identification information and give authorized users secure access.\n\nEthereum can be utilized in financial services as well. It can be used to simplify payment procedures, lower transaction costs, and improve transparency. Smart contracts can be used to automate numerous financial services procedures, such as payment execution and contract management.\n\nAdvantages of Enterprise Ethereum\n\nEnterprise Ethereum provides various advantages to enterprises. Among the many advantages are:\n\nIncreased Enterprise Efficiency\n\nBy automating many of the processes involved in company operations, Ethereum can assist to boost efficiency. Smart contracts can be used to automate operations like confirming the legitimacy of items, making payments, and monitoring contracts.\n\nThis can help to reduce the amount of time and resources needed to complete transactions, hence enhancing efficiency and production.\n\nIncreased Security\n\nEnterprise Ethereum provides greater security than typical commercial platforms. Transactions are safe and tamper-proof due to the usage of blockchain technology. Smart contracts are also intended to be tamper-proof, which means they cannot be changed after they have been executed.\n\nAs a result, Enterprise Ethereum offers a safe and dependable means to execute transactions.\n\nEnterprise Cost Savings\n\nBy eliminating the need for intermediaries, such as banks or attorneys, Ethereum can assist to minimize transaction costs. Smart contracts can be used to perform transactions without the involvement of middlemen, lowering transaction costs and enhancing profitability.\n\nEnterprise Ethereum's Challenges\n\nWhile Enterprise Ethereum has many advantages for organizations, it has certain drawbacks. Among the major challenges are:\n\nTechnical Difficulty\n\nEnterprise Ethereum is a difficult technology that must be used with technical skills. To use Enterprise Ethereum efficiently, businesses must have a solid understanding of blockchain technology and smart contracts. This may necessitate substantial investment in training and development.\n\nLegacy System Integration\n\nIt can be difficult to integrate Enterprise Ethereum with legacy systems. Businesses must verify that their existing systems are Enterprise Ethereum compliant, which may necessitate significant investment in technical infrastructure.\n\nCompliance with Regulations\n\nEnterprise Ethereum adoption may also generate regulatory compliance concerns. Businesses must ensure that their activities are in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, which can be complicated and time-consuming.\n\nNew avenues for business\n\nOne of the key benefits of Enterprise Ethereum is its ability to enable new forms of collaboration and cooperation between businesses.\n\nSmart contracts\n\nSmart contracts, a key feature of Enterprise Ethereum, are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between parties being directly written into code. This means that once the conditions specified in the contract are met, the contract automatically executes without the need for intermediaries or third parties. Smart contracts can automate many aspects of inter-business transactions, such as payment processing, supply chain management, and legal operations.\n\nOne of the main benefits of smart contracts in Enterprise Ethereum is that they can reduce friction and improve efficiency in business-to-business interactions. By automating processes and removing intermediaries, businesses can reduce costs, eliminate errors, and streamline their operations. This can significantly reduce the time and effort required for these tasks, allowing businesses to focus on their core activities.\n\nSmart contracts in Enterprise Ethereum can also enable more seamless collaboration between businesses. For example, in supply chain management, smart contracts can automate the process of verifying the authenticity and quality of goods, reducing the risk of fraud and enabling faster and more secure transactions. Additionally, smart contracts can automate the process of dispute resolution, reducing the time and effort required to resolve disputes between parties.\n\nDecentralized Applications\n\nAnother way that Enterprise Ethereum can enable new forms of collaboration is through the use of decentralized applications (dApps). dApps are software applications that run on the Ethereum blockchain, enabling secure and transparent transactions between parties. They can be used for a variety of purposes, such as decentralized finance (DeFi), supply chain management, and identity verification.\n\nBy using dApps built on Enterprise Ethereum, businesses can collaborate and cooperate in new ways. For example, in DeFi, businesses can participate in decentralized lending and borrowing, enabling faster and more secure transactions than traditional banking systems. In supply chain management, businesses can collaborate to improve efficiency and transparency in the supply chain, reducing costs and improving customer satisfaction.\n\nConclusion\n\nEnterprise Ethereum provides various benefits to enterprises, including higher productivity, improved security, and lower costs. However, it does provide several obstacles, including technical complexity, interaction with older systems, and regulatory compliance.\n\nOverall, Enterprise Ethereum can assist firms in streamlining operations, lowering expenses, and increasing profitability. However, before incorporating Enterprise Ethereum into their processes, organizations must carefully assess the opportunities and problems it presents.\n\nEnterprise Ethereum, with careful planning and execution, has the ability to alter the way organizations function and communicate with one another, enabling secure and transparent transactions without the need for middlemen.\n\nAs Enterprise Ethereum evolves and matures, we should expect to see even more inventive corporate use cases and applications. Businesses will be able to streamline processes, decrease costs, and boost efficiency by utilizing smart contracts and decentralized applications, while also improving security and transparency.\n\nOverall, Enterprise Ethereum plays an important and expanding role in business. While there are some challenges to overcome, the benefits of using Enterprise Ethereum are significant, and it is becoming a more popular choice for businesses looking to streamline operations and improve efficiency.\n\nWe should anticipate seeing many more fascinating advancements in the application of Enterprise Ethereum in business as the technology evolves and matures."

        "title": "Ethereum's Shanghai Upgrade - Security & Market Impact - Milk Road",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nEthereum\u2019s Shanghai Upgrade is scheduled for April 12th.\n\nIt will enable withdrawals of staked ETH for the first time since staking went live in December 2020.\n\nPost-Shanghai, ~$33B worth of staked ETH could theoretically be withdrawn and sold. But the chances of a Shanghai-induced ETH sell-off are slim.\n\nShanghai should result in more ETH being staked over the coming months.\n\nShanghai: The Finishing Touch of \u201cThe Merge\u201d\n\nThus far, Ethereum\u2019s transition from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) has been marked by two main events:\n\nDecember 2020: The launch of the PoS Beacon Chain and ETH staking.\n\nThe launch of the PoS Beacon Chain and ETH staking. September 2022: \u201dThe Merge\u201d of the legacy PoW Chain with the PoS Beacon Chain.\n\nWith these upgrades in the rearview, the heavy lifting to get Ethereum off PoW and onto PoS is done. But there is still some clean-up to do.\n\nEnter Shanghai.\n\nShanghai will enable Ethereum stakers to withdraw their staked ETH (some of which have been locked up since December 2020) for the first time.\n\nWhat You Need to Know\n\nRelative to \u201cThe Merge,\u201d Shanghai is a minor technical upgrade. But from a price perspective, it could be a big deal: ~$33B worth of ETH (17.6M ETH) is currently staked. Post-Shanghai, theoretically, all of it could be withdrawn and sold.\n\nSounds scary, right?\n\nNot that scary, though \u2026 Here\u2019s why.\n\nOf the total 120.5M ETH in circulation, ~85% are not staked (gray bar), ~14% are staked deposits earning rewards (blue bar), and ~1% are staked rewards generated since the launch of the Beacon Chain (yellow bar).\n\nOur view is that the blue bar (staked deposits) has a low probability of withdrawal post-Shanghai, while the yellow bar (staked rewards) has a high probability of withdrawal post-Shanghai. To explain why, we\u2019ll use a simple analogy.\n\nWhat are Staked ETH Deposits and Rewards?\n\nConsider a landlord that owns and rents out a beach house. The house has been generating steady rental income for over 2 years. But the landlord hasn\u2019t been able to sell it since December 2020.\n\nThink of this landlord as an ETH staker and their beach house as their staked ETH deposits.\n\nNow imagine there is a big mailbox out in front of the landlord\u2019s office. It\u2019s chock full o\u2019 rent checks. But the mailbox has been locked up since December 2020, so the rent checks are sitting inside collecting dust.\n\nThink of these rent checks as staked ETH rewards.\n\nNow imagine that on April 12th, the landlord can finally sell the house. And that same day, they finally get a key to that mailbox.\n\nIt would make a whole lot of sense for the landlord to get those checks out of the mailbox. After all, they have been sitting there collecting dust.\n\nBut what about the beach house? Even though it could be sold, it probably wouldn\u2019t make sense for the landlord to sell it. It is still likely to appreciate in value (who doesn\u2019t love the beach?), and it will continue to generate rental income for years to come.\n\nPost-Shanghai, we think a similar dynamic will play out as it relates to staked ETH withdrawals. Most stakers will withdraw their staked ETH rewards (i.e., get those rent checks out of the mailbox) but hold onto their staked ETH deposits (i.e., keep the beach house).\n\nCould it really be that simple? Pretty much. But let\u2019s crunch some numbers.\n\nQuantifying The Market Impact of Shanghai\n\nHow much staked ETH could (realistically) be withdrawn and sold post-Shanghai?\n\nUnder conservative assumptions (50% to 70% of rewards are withdrawn and sold, 0.0% to 7.5% of deposits are withdrawn and sold), Shanghai could induce ~$130M to ~$500M of daily ETH sales the week after the upgrade.\n\nThat is not a drop in the bucket. But it\u2019s also not the end of the world, considering ETH volumes. On a YTD basis, daily ETH spot volume has averaged $10.8B. Shanghai-induced sales of ~$130M to ~$500M would represent 1.2% to 4.5% of daily spot volume.\n\nPotentially a needle mover. But definitely not a big one.\n\nConsider that the bear case. Here are the more bullish considerations:\n\nEarly stakers knew they wouldn\u2019t be able to withdraw when they staked. They staked anyway. Chances are their diamond hands won\u2019t become paper hands anytime soon \u2013 especially since it\u2019s a bad time to sell. ETH is still ~65% below its all-time high.\n\nLiquid staking protocols, which account for ~33% of all staked ETH, have already absorbed a big chunk of the demand to \u201cunlock\u201d staked ETH. Also, the largest liquid staking protocol, Lido, isn\u2019t enabling withdrawals until mid-May \u2013 further reducing the chances of a near-term sell-off.\n\nEnabling withdrawals \u201cde-risks\u201d staking \u2013 it puts an end to long and indefinite lockups. This should result in more ETH, not less, being staked post-Shanghai.\n\nShanghai\u2019s Impact on Ethereum\u2019s Security\n\nOnly ~15% of ETH is currently staked. Most other layer-1 networks have staking rates in the 40% to 70% range. So, Ethereum\u2019s 15% is low.\n\nWith withdrawals enabled, seeing this number double to ~30% is not at all outside the realm of possibility. That would increase the dollar value of ETH being staked from ~$30B to ~$60B \u2013 a positive for the security of the network.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAny ETH sell pressure induced by Shanghai should be minor.

Source: Ethereum.org\n\nWhile the hard fork will allow for partial and full withdrawals, several mechanisms are set in place to ensure a flood of Ether doesn\u2019t disrupt the market.\n\nThere are now 17.81 million Ether staked on the Beacon Chain. At a current price of $1,776, this means $31.6 billion can be incrementally unlocked over time.\n\nStaked Ether added to the Beacon Chain since it launched in December 2020. Source: Beaconcha.in.\n\nWhile the Ethereum Foundation described the last testnet run on Goerli as \u201csmooth,\u201d there was a notable delay in activation time due to many validators not updating their client software.\n\nHowever, Beiko is confident it won\u2019t be an issue this time, as Ethereum validators will be economically incentivized to make the update for the mainnet.\n\nEthereum\u2019s key hard forks\n\nBecause of EIP-4895, Shapella is considered the most significant hard fork on Ethereum since Paris \u2014 the Merge \u2014 changed the network consensus mechanism from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake on Sept 15.\n\nPrior to that, London introduced EIP-1559 in August 2021, which introduced a base fee that users must pay instead of the old price auction method. While the validators still receive a block reward and tip, the base fee is burned, which is intended to make Ether deflationary over time.\n\nRelated: Ethereum\u2019s Shapella transition is \u2018on the horizon\u2019\n\nBerlin optimized gas costs for some EVM actions in April 2021, while Beacon Chain Genesis marked the first block that was produced on the proof-of-stake chain on Dec. 1, 2020.\n\nFinally in December 2019, Istanbul served to improve denial-of-service attack resilience and make layer-2 scaling solutions based on SNARKs and STARKs more performant.\n\nIf you want to watch as the upgrade happens, you can join @ethStaker, @EthCatHerders, myself and others during the Shapella watch party here https://t.co/ZHWQfMemZc \u2014 timbeiko.eth \u2600\ufe0f (@TimBeiko) March 28, 2023\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation also announced last week that it doubled rewards for any bugs found in the Shapella code.

According to the latest data, this should happen at blockchain epoch 194,048, which corresponds to the date of April 12. The event will take place in accordance with the exchange's rules, a list of which has been announced by Binance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThus, seven minutes before the approximate upgrade date, at 10:20 p.m. UTC, Binance will suspend withdrawals of both ETH and other tokens from the ERC-20 network. Trading in these tokens, however, will not be suspended. Further reopening of deposits and withdrawals of ERC-20 cryptocurrencies will be done without any notice. Of particular importance is Binance's increase in the minimum unlock count of deposits on the Ethereum network from the current 12 blocks to 64.\n\nEthereum, Shanghai and Capella\n\nThe Shapella upgrade is a merger of two events, Shanghai and Capella. Both involve the release of Ethereum (ETH) from its staking, the only difference being the layers. Thus, Shanghai is responsible for the execution layer (EL) and Capella for the consensus layer (CL). As Shapella approaches, the Ethereum Foundation has doubled the bug bounty, to $500,000.\n\nIt is known that the upgrade will release an estimated 2.9 million ETH. However, exactly how many tokens will come out of the staking and what will happen to those millions next is a big question."

Discover SCENE\n\nThe Shanghai and Capella upgrades, named Shapella, will activate around 6: 30 pm UTC on April 12, 2023, per the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s latest note.\n\nCrucially, this upgrade will let Ethereum stakers, including individuals and larger staking outfits, freely withdraw their ETH. Currently, that\u2019s not possible.\n\nThe news boosted native tokens for staking projects like Lido DAO (LDO), Frax Shares (FXS), and Rocket Pool (RPL). The gains across these tokens surpassed Ethereum\u2019s 5.5% rise over the last day, with LDO rising by 18.6%, RPL by 13.3%, and the FXS token by 20.4%, per CoinGecko.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEach of these protocols lets users deposit as much or as little Ethereum and participate in staking. Depositing directly on the mainnet demands a minimum of 32 ETH to participate. When users deposit into a staking project, they receive a \u201cstaked\u201d version of Ethereum which accrues staking yield and acts as a receipt of their deposit.\n\nOnce withdrawals are enabled, some analysts suggest that this may also reduce the risk of holding those staked versions of ETH, like Lido\u2019s stETH and Frax\u2019s frxETH, as they will finally be redeemable. The reduced risk could encourage more ETH holders to stake with LSD platforms for higher yields.\n\nLido DAO, the largest LSD entity with 31.5% of the total ETH deposits, already conducted withdrawals on the Goerli testnet yesterday.\n\n\ud83c\udf89 Lido V2 is currently being tested on Goerli with the first successful withdrawal already confirmed \ud83c\udf89https://t.co/8NcTklCmjU Here's what to expect from the Goerli V2 Testnet \ud83e\uddf5\ud83d\udc47 \u2014 Lido (@LidoFinance) March 28, 2023\n\nThe newest upgrade comes after Ethereum\u2019s merge event in September 2022, when the blockchain shifted to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis time, the Shapella upgrade will enable ETH withdrawals for various users who staked their Ethereum on the network as early as December 2020.\n\nToday, there are more than 16.3 million Ethereum staked on the network."

        "content": "EigenLabs, which aims to make Ethereum as fast and flexible as centralized networks of servers like Amazon Web Services, announced on Tuesday a $50 million funding round led by Blockchain Capital.\n\nSreeram Kannan, the founder and CEO of EigenLabs as well as an associate professor at the University of Washington, Seattle, declined to provide his company\u2019s implied valuation. Other investors in the round include Coinbase Ventures, Polychain Capital, Electric Capital, Hack VC, and Finality Capital Partners.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest reasons blockchains are not able to support the original vision of, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re going to do social networks and Uber and all these crazy things,\u2019 [is] because infrastructure is not ready for it,\u201d Kannan told Fortune.\n\nHe believes his company\u2019s flagship product, EigenLayer, is a potential solution to blockchain\u2019s infrastructure crisis, joining a flood of other infrastructure-focused startups that have secured hoards of cash during the most recent crypto bear market.\n\n\u201cBy lowering the cost of trust and capital, [EigenLayer] opens up opportunities for entrepreneurs to experiment and build while significantly easing the financial barriers that have hindered innovation in the past,\u201d Bart Stephens, founder and managing partner at Blockchain Capital, said in a statement.\n\nAs opposed to startup founders who immediately jumped from dorm room to boardroom, Kannan hails from academia. During his master\u2019s and doctoral studies, he researched peer-to-peer wireless networks and soon grew interested in blockchain technology. When he landed at the Seattle campus of the University of Washington, he eventually took leave to launch his own startup. And in 2021, he founded EigenLabs.\n\nKannan saw that the performance of Ethereum, a cloud-computing network that is decentralized\u2014or not owned by one tech conglomerate\u2014paled in comparison to the centralized networks of servers run by the likes of Amazon and Google.\n\nSpecifically, when developers on Ethereum run their code on the blockchain, they do not have the choice of which servers, or Ethereum nodes, execute their programs. This creates redundancy, as many servers process the same code.\n\nDevelopers building on top of EigenLayer, Kannan says, will be able to choose which nodes run which parts of an application\u2019s code. This capability allows programmers to create a division of computing labor, a capability long since available to developers using, say, AWS.\n\nTo show the utility of EigenLayer, he and his team are building a \u201cdata availability layer\u201d atop their product, or a faster way to write data onto Ethereum\u2019s blockchain, whose data inscription capabilities, Kannan says, are currently reminiscent of that of computers from the 1990s.\n\nBut this is just one promise of EigenLayer, which Kannan now hopes to build out as he adds employees, funds code audits, and supports developers seeking to build with his product.\n\n\u201cOur focus,\u201d he told Fortune, \u201cwill be exclusively on maximizing the surface of innovation, which is, What new things can you build? Which is going to onboard the next group of application builders, which then onboards the next group of users.\u201d"

        "content": "Ethereum prices remain below $2,000 months after the network initiated EIP-1559, trackers on March 28 reveal.\n\nEthereum Prices Trending Below $2,000\n\nETH, the native currency of Ethereum, is currently trading at $1,717, stable on the last day and week but retracing from recent highs of around $1,850.\n\nThe network has burnt over 3 million ETH from gas fees since the activation of Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559 in August 2021, a move that gradually makes the coin deflationary. However, despite this, the coin has been unable to break above $2,000 since May 2022.\n\nEIP-1559 was an intervention by the developer community to reduce the supply of ETH and it was a new way for Ethereum to calculate process transaction fees, effectively adjusting the fee market and making gas more predictable. Earlier, Ethereum used an auction system where miners prioritized transactions tagged with high fees.\n\nIn EIP-1559, the team agreed to introduce a base fee and a \u201ctip\u201d for every gas fee paid in a transaction. The base fee is what everyone transacting on Ethereum must pay. Notably, this fee will be adjustable depending on network demand and would be burned.\n\nAt the same time, the transactor would give a \u201ctip\u201d to the block validator as an incentive to include their transaction in a block. This fee is optional, and only those who want their transactions to be included in blocks faster can pay.\n\nEthereum Price On March 28 | Source: ETHUSDT On Binance, TradingView\n\nOver 3 Million ETH Burned Since August 2021\n\nFrom August 2021, when Ethereum introduced EIP-1559, the network has burned over 3 million ETH. At the same time, over 69,450 ETH has been destroyed since the Merge, when Ethereum officially transited to a proof of stake system, switching off miners.\n\nConsidering the current pace of ETH burning, the coin has been deflationary by 0.1% annually. Proponents are bullish that ETH will never be inflationary again, a move that could push prices even higher in the months and years ahead.\n\nThe pace of ETH burning depends on network activity. Over the months, especially during the 2022 bear run, ETH and token prices crashed, as DeFi and NFT activities also fell. The total value locked (TVL) in DeFi remains less than half the peaks of 2021, while NFT trading is subdued even with the recovery of asset prices in Q1 2023.\n\nTrackers on March 28 indicate that ETH transfers contribute to the bulk of coins destroyed since EIP-1559. From August 2021, users transferring ETH between addresses have contributed to 266,217.50 ETH being destroyed.\n\nMeanwhile, because of NFTs, primarily through OpenSea, 230,050 ETH have been burned, with 152,369 ETH destroyed from Uniswap\u2019s trading activities.\n\nFeature Image From Canva, Chart From TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Anthony Di Iorio, the billionaire co-founder of $50 billion blockchain network Ethereum and cryptocurrency wallet Jaxx, said that Chinese blockchain projects such as Qtum and VeChain will succeed.\n\n\u201cThe biggest stake for me is in Qtum and VeChain right now, the two Chinese projects. There\u2019s much more opportunity in newer ones if you can identify them,\u201d Iorio said.\n\nChina\u2019s Poor Cryptocurrency Trading Regulations Don\u2019t Matter\n\nVeChain, the Ethereum-based Internet of Things blockchain protocol in China, has attracted well-respected developers, venture capital firms, and large-scale institutions throughout the past six months.\n\nMost recently, the VeChain team disclosed that PwC, one of the Big Four auditors, have acquired a stake in the project, and announced a partnership with multi-billion dollar logistics giant DB Schenker to use the blockchain in processing sensitive information.\n\n\u201cBy collaborating with third-party logistics providers in China, DB Schenker can offer extensive and seamless logistics solutions across China for any industry and trade. However, the immense potential of such a comprehensive logistics network is challenged by the complexity of measuring the performance and service quality of their business partners,\u201d the VeChain foundation said.\n\nBuilding blockchain protocols in itself is difficult and technologically challenging, as blockchain building essentially is solving unprecedented cryptographic problems with dire consequences. A simple error in a smart contract could result in large-scale security breaches and loss of funds.\n\nBuilding a blockchain protocol and convincing conglomerates, institutions, and businesses to utilize it to secure data rather than more efficient database technologies is even more difficult, because developers need to convince businesses to overcome the trade-off between decentralization and flexibility to use blockchain technology in the right way.\n\nThe blockchain is not database technology; it cannot process an unlimited number of transactions and information, and in its current form, it can barely process hundreds of transactions per second. Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin emphasized that it is possible to reach a million transactions per second on the Ethereum blockchain with Sharding and Plasma enabled, but the industry is still several years behind.\n\nAs such, for blockchain projects, it is of utmost importance to secure partners like VeChain\u2019s partnership with PwC and DB Schenker to build, solve, and investigate together on various methods that could be utilized to commercialize the blockchain at a large scale.\n\nIorio said that investors should also look for emerging projects that are capable of leading wide adoption of the blockchain, similar to the works of Qtum and VeChain, both of which are based in China.\n\nIn September 2017, the Chinese authorities effectively banned cryptocurrency trading but has not banned cryptocurrency businesses and blockchain projects. In fact, the latest multi-billion dollar funding of blockchain startups by the Chinese government reaffirmed its support for blockchain technology.\n\nGood to Get Reaffirmation That Ethereum is Not a Security\n\nDuring an interview with Bloomberg, Iorio added that while the creators of Ethereum including himself, Buterin, and Charles Hoskinson were comfortable with the regulatory nature of Ethereum and its non-security characteristics, it was \u201cgreat\u201d to get reaffirmation from the US government that it is not a security.\n\nIf the US SEC had categorized Ethereum as a security, it would have had shut down the entire industry in the US in an instant, forcing companies to move out of the country. The SEC\u2019s clear statement that Ethereum is not a security demonstrated the intent of the agency to see continuous development in the blockchain sector."

Source: TradingView/Mac\n\nThe price trajectory reflects a recurring phenomenon involving the launch of digital tokens with seemingly strong fundamental backing, according to independent market analyst Mac.\n\nFor instance, Solana (SOL), a layer-1 blockchain, rallied 50,000% before undergoing a similar pump, correction, and sideways consolidation phase after its exchange debut in April 2020.\n\nSOL/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView/Mac\n\nArbitrum price could hit $2 by April\n\nFrom a fundamental perspective, Arbitrum has emerged as a strong contender in the Ethereum L2 space in recent months, with several leading DeFi protocols, including GMX, Uniswap, Sushi and Aave, among its users.\n\n\"GMX and Radiant on Arbitrum are two of the fastest-growing protocols in terms of both fundamentals and price appreciation this year,\" noted Dustin Teander, a researcher at analytics firm Messari, adding:\n\n\"Looking at user retention metrics, it\u2019s apparent these protocols have gained above-market traction compared to imported protocols like Uniswap or Aave.\"\n\nOptimism vs. Arbitrum monthly user retention rates. Source: Messari\n\nAs of March 29, the total value locked (TVL) across Arbitrum pools rose to $2.2 billion versus around $981 million three months ago, according to data resource DefiLlama.\n\nRelated: Arbitrum airdrop sells off at listing, but traders remain bullish on ARB\n\nMac noted that Arbitrum\u2019s strong fundamentals could limit ARB\u2019s downside prospects and prompt traders to re-accumulate the token in the coming weeks.\n\nThat may lead to another price run-up, eyeing $2 by April, as illustrated below.\n\nARB/USDT hourly price chart.

        "title": "Ethereum faces bearish divergence with crypto markets under pressure - crypto.news",
        "content": "The crypto markets are selling off in the wake of the U.S. CFTC filing suit against Binance. Technical traders are worried there could be more downside coming.\n\nIn a recent episode of The Crypto World channel, host Josh analyzed the current market conditions for both ethereum (ETH) and bitcoin (BTC), highlighting bearish divergence and resistance challenges.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the key points from his analysis.\n\nJosh reported that ethereum is experiencing a bearish divergence, breaking below its short-term support. He encouraged his audience to stay tuned for further analysis on this trend. Ethereum is currently facing rejection from a resistance range of $1,770 to $1,820.\n\nIf the price continues to decline, support between $1,650 to $1,700 is expected to hold. A break below the short-term support level of $1,730 would signal a bearish turn, leading to further pullback.\n\nBitcoin, on the other hand, is facing rejection from a resistance range of $28,000 to $29,500, indicating a short-term pause or setback from its bullish trend. If the price experiences a further pullback, the support area between $24,000 to $25,200 is expected to provide significant support for the cryptocurrency.\n\nYou might also like: Crypto markets react to Binance\u2019s battle with CFTC\n\nThe bearish divergence is also evident on the bitcoin-to-euro dollar chart, as lower highs are consistently forming in the short term. This is a sign of weakness in the cryptocurrency, which may lead to further declines in the near future.\n\nJosh also noted that the funding rates for all coins across all exchanges are flipping into the negative territory. This negative shift in funding rates encourages traders to short bitcoin. The development indicates a potential change in market sentiment, as traders position themselves for the possibility of a downward price movement.\n\nAs ethereum and bitcoin face resistance and bearish divergences, the host thinks more downside is possible. For ethereum, the support ranges between $1,650 and $1,700, which is a critical level to monitor.\n\nIf ethereum breaks below its short-term support of $1,730, it would signal a bearish trend and could result in further declines. For bitcoin, investors should watch the support area between $24,000 to $25,200. If the cryptocurrency falls below this range, it could face additional selling pressure and continue its downward trend.\n\nJosh\u2019s analysis on The Crypto World channel serves as a reminder that the cryptocurrency market can experience fluctuations and setbacks, even during a bullish trend.\n\nBoth ethereum and bitcoin are currently facing resistance and bearish divergences, which could result in short-term declines. The remarks follow today\u2019s report that crypto analyst The Crypto Lark sees the Wyckoff schematic as a valuable analytical tool, and shares his views on the bitcoin market in a recent YouTube video.\n\nRead more: Binance\u2019s CZ responds to \u2018unexpected\u2019 CFTC accusations\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum have been the top two cryptocurrencies in the market for several years now. However, as the crypto industry continues to evolve, new altcoins are emerging that could offer better profit potential.\n\nRenQ Finance (RENQ) is one such altcoin that experts believe could outperform both Bitcoin and Ethereum in 2023.\n\nHindustan Times - your fastest source for breaking news! Read now.\n\n>>>>> BUY RENQ TOKENS HERE <<<<<\n\nBitcoin vs Ethereum: A Brief Comparison\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are both decentralized, open-source blockchain networks that allow for peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries like banks. Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, launched in 2009 by an unknown person using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Ethereum, on the other hand, was created by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 and launched in 2015.\n\nWhile Bitcoin's primary use case is as a digital currency, Ethereum's blockchain is designed to support smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). Ethereum's native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), is used to pay for transaction fees and computational services on the network.\n\nBitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million coins, while Ethereum does not have a fixed supply but uses a mechanism called \"proof of stake\" to ensure the network's security and stability.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum Price Forecast 2023\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum have had an impressive run over the past few years, with Bitcoin hitting an all-time high of nearly $69,000 in 2021, and Ethereum reaching an all-time high of over $4,300 in May 2021 as well. However, both cryptocurrencies have faced significant price fluctuations in recent months, with Bitcoin now trading at around $27,684 and Ethereum trading at around $1,755 as of writing.\n\nMany experts believe that both Bitcoin and Ethereum will continue to face price volatility in the coming years. Some predict that Bitcoin's price could reach $100,000 by the end of 2023, while others believe that it could fall as low as $10,000. Similarly, Ethereum's price forecasts for 2023 range from a high of $10,000 to a low of $500.\n\nRenQ Finance: The Altcoin with Better Profit Potential\n\nWhile Bitcoin and Ethereum have been the top performers in the cryptocurrency market, RenQ Finance (RENQ) is an altcoin that experts believe has better profit potential in the coming years. RenQ Finance is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that aims to provide institutional-grade liquidity to the DeFi market.\n\n>>>>> BUY RENQ TOKENS HERE <<<<<\n\nOne of the key features of RenQ Finance is its \"smart contract\" technology, which allows users to access liquidity from multiple sources, including centralized exchanges, decentralized exchanges, and lending platforms. This technology ensures that users always get the best price for their trades and allows them to move their assets seamlessly between different platforms.\n\nAnother significant advantage of RenQ Finance is its low transaction fees. Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have high transaction fees due to network congestion, RenQ Finance's fees are minimal, making it a more cost-effective option for users.\n\nExperts predict that RenQ Finance could see significant price growth in the coming years, with some forecasting a price of $1 or more by the end of 2023. The platform's unique features and strong community support make it an attractive investment option for those looking to diversify their portfolio and capitalize on the growing DeFi market.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile Bitcoin and Ethereum have been the top performers in the crypto market for several years, new altcoins like RenQ Finance are emerging that offer better profit potential. RenQ Finance's innovative features, low transaction fees, and strong community support make it a promising investment option for those looking to capitalize on the growing DeFi market.\n\nHowever, as with any investment, it's essential to do your own research and carefully consider the risks before investing in any cryptocurrency.\n\nVisit the links below for more information about RenQ Finance (RENQ):\n\nWebsite: https://renq.io\n\nWhitepaper: https://renq.io/whitepaper.pdf\n\nDisclaimer: This article is a paid publication and does not have journalistic/ editorial involvement of Hindustan Times.

        "content": "ETH\u2019s supply outside of exchanges reached an all-time high.\n\nIncrease in adoption has been challenging since the token was called a commodity.\n\nThe number of Ethereum [ETH] held in self-custody reached its highest for the first time since the cryptocurrency became public in 2015, Santiment disclosed. At the time of writing, this number was 101.18 million, despite experiencing some drawbacks in September 2022.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nWithout fail, the ETH supply on exchanges reached an all-time low, closing at 10.30%. A situation like this implied that holders of the altcoin were confident in its long-term relevance, with a possible positive effect on the price action. However, the same measures reflected the skepticism investors may have towards keeping assets on exchanges.\n\nBreaking down the aftereffects\n\nThe development arose after the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) accused Binance of breaking the country\u2019s financial laws. Before the latest indictment, a number of exchanges were mounted with pressure as regulators seem in lurking mode.\n\nHowever, ETH was not left out of the picture. The SEC seemed resolute in its position to proscribe assets under the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus as securities. But the CFTC had a different opinion about the cryptocurrency, as it called ETH a commodity in a statement made by Chairman Rostin Behnam.\n\nETH\u2019s self-custody ATH might come as a shock, as other cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin [BTC], had recorded high numbers. One undeniable factor that could have impacted the rise was Vitalik Buterin\u2019s response to the FTX issue last November.\n\nAt that time, the Ethereum founder discussed the idea of non-custodial Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) while rooting for users to look in the Decentralized Exchanges\u2019 (DEXs) direction.\n\nDespite the conviction displayed by ETH holders, the project\u2019s network growth took a sharp dump in the last 24 hours. The metric shows the number of new addresses being created daily on a network.\n\nHold in traction, but ETH validators have a task\n\nAt press time, ETH\u2019s network growth was down to 13,800. This implied that new entries were low, and Ethereum\u2019s user traction was struggling. But there was a minute compensation for the blockchain with the state of the active addresses.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nAccording to the on-chain analytic platform, there was a 467,000 rise in active addresses in the last 24 hours. This helped the 30-day performance of the metric to hit 5.95 million. The hike represents an increase in transactions on the Ethereum blockchain by already existing addresses.\n\nMeanwhile, there has been a new update to the Shanghai upgrade as Prysmatic Labs announced a necessary node and validator operation. The core implementation team of the Ethereum PoS noted that failure to do such could lead to a fork in the chain or loss of rewards."

        "content": "It\u2019s no secret that Bitcoin, Ethereum and most other major cryptocurrencies are trading well below their all-time highs. It\u2019s why the phrase \u201ccrypto winter\u201d has become a top discussion among investors.\n\nWhile a bear market has scared away many individual investors and financial institutions, others are now laying the groundwork for the next bull run.\n\nTwo of the world\u2019s largest and most respected financial institutions \u2014 BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity Investments \u2014 recently dove headfirst into the cryptocurrency world. And with a combined $14 trillion in assets under management, it\u2019s something to pay close attention to.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s Larry Fink Excited About The Future\n\nIn his annual letter to shareholders, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink shared his excitement about the future of cryptocurrency and digital assets as a whole.\n\n\u201cAt BlackRock we continue to explore the digital assets ecosystem, especially areas most relevant to our clients such as permissioned blockchains and tokenization of stocks and bonds,\u201d Fink wrote.\n\nLarry Fink on crypto: \"The technology and the opportunities are real. We do need better connectivity, more regulations, more AML. I believe the purpose of crypto will play a big role in the modern world but that being said, we have to make sure it's properly regulated. \u2014 Charles Gasparino (@CGasparino) January 13, 2023\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time BlackRock and Fink have made their intention clear about their involvement in the blockchain and emerging technology space. In 2022, BlackRock partnered with Coinbase to provide its institutional clients with access to Bitcoin. That was a bold move for an investment company with the size and reach of BlackRock, but it\u2019s been a welcome addition.\n\nFidelity Joining The Crypto Revolution\n\nEarlier this month, Fidelity Crypto made its way to the public, allowing tens of millions of its retail customers to buy and sell Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies. Adding to the excitement is the fact that all Bitcoin and Ethereum transactions on the app are commission-free.\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget this: The investment manager filed three U.S. trademark applications at the end of 2022. The applications made mention of crypto trading, metaverse investment services, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and virtual real estate investing. All of these areas are primed for hypergrowth in 2023 and beyond.\n\nWhen companies like BlackRock and Fidelity take a step into the future \u2014 such as going all-in on cryptocurrency and digital assets \u2014 it\u2019s important to take notice. No one knows when the next crypto bull run will arrive, but when it does it\u2019s safe to say that BlackRock and Fidelity will be in a position to take full advantage.\n\nThis article was originally published on Benzinga and appears here with permission."

        "content": "As the crypto market continues to recover from the recent bearish trends, investors are gearing up for the next bull run.\n\nWhile Bitcoin (BTC) remains a popular choice for many investors, there are other cryptocurrencies that are worth considering, such as Ethereum (ETH), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and RenQ Finance (RENQ).\n\n>>>>> BUY RENQ TOKENS HERE <<<<<\n\nIn this article, we'll take a closer look at these three cryptocurrencies and why they could be worth adding to your portfolio.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nEthereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, and it's often considered to be the backbone of the DeFi (decentralized finance) space. The Ethereum network is used to build and host a wide range of decentralized applications (dApps), including many popular DeFi protocols.\n\nOne of the main advantages of Ethereum is its flexibility. The network allows developers to create custom smart contracts and dApps, which can be used for a variety of purposes. Ethereum is also known for its relatively fast transaction speeds and low fees, making it a popular choice for DeFi users.\n\nThe Ethereum network has paved the way for many of today's modern blockchain solutions, such as smart contracts, decentralized applications, DeFi, NFTs, tokens, and gaming. Its infrastructure provides a solid foundation for developers to build upon and is expected to continue to expand as blockchain technology gains wider adoption.\n\nFor these reasons, it is recommended to have Ethereum as a permanent part of your cryptocurrency portfolio.\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB)\n\nShiba Inu is a relatively new cryptocurrency that has gained a lot of attention in recent months. The token was created as a joke, modeled after the popular Dogecoin (DOGE) cryptocurrency, but it has since developed a strong community of supporters.\n\nOne of the main features of Shiba Inu is its burn rate mechanism, which involves a portion of each transaction being burned, effectively reducing the total supply of SHIB tokens. This has led to a significant increase in demand for the token, driving up its price.\n\nAnother factor contributing to the popularity of Shiba Inu is its use in the NFT (non-fungible token) space. Many NFT marketplaces and platforms now accept SHIB as a form of payment, further increasing its utility and demand.\n\n>>>>> BUY RENQ TOKENS HERE <<<<<\n\nRenQ Finance (RENQ)\n\nRenQ Finance is a relatively new DeFi protocol that aims to provide institutional-level liquidity and slippage-free trading for the DeFi community. The protocol utilizes a hybrid infrastructure model, combining on-chain and off-chain elements to provide fast and efficient trading.\n\nOne of the main advantages of RenQ Finance is its comprehensive approach to trading. The protocol offers a wide range of features, including a DeFi wallet, cross-chain swap, governance portal, and high-leverage trading. This all-in-one solution sets RenQ Finance apart from many other DeFi projects, which often focus on a single area of trading or liquidity provision.\n\nRenQ Finance has already achieved several notable milestones, including the launch of its DeFi wallet, cross-chain swap features, and passing the Certik Audit test. The recently released project protocol currently at presale has also attracted significant attention from investors and traders, raising over $3.6 million.\n\nFurthermore, RenQ Finance stands out in the cryptocurrency market due to its innovative approach to decentralized finance (DeFi), combined with its commitment to security and interoperability. These features make RenQ Finance an attractive investment option for investors who prioritize long-term growth and stability in their portfolio.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs the crypto market continues to evolve, it's important for investors to consider a diverse range of cryptocurrencies. Ethereum, Shiba Inu, and RenQ Finance all offer unique features and advantages that could make them worth adding to your portfolio.\n\nOf course, as with any investment, it's important to do your own research and consider your own risk tolerance before making any decisions.\n\nClick Here to Buy RenQ Finance (RENQ) Tokens.\n\nVisit the links below for more information about RenQ Finance (RENQ):\n\nWebsite: https://renq.io\n\nWhitepaper: https://renq.io/whitepaper.pdf\n\nDisclaimer: This article is a paid publication and does not have journalistic/ editorial involvement of Hindustan Times.

        "title": "Arbitrum, Optimism, And Polygon: Which Is The Ultimate Ethereum L2? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) blockchains are heating up in the crypto industry as they provide a very needed service to investors. These L2s make it so transaction on the Ethereum network is very cheap compared to the Layer 1 blockchain.\n\nThere are already a number of L2 blockchains that are now competing for market share on the Ethereum blockchain. Out of these, the top 3 are Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism, all of which have seen tremendous support in the market. In this report, we take a look at these L2s to determine which is the best performer.\n\nLooking At Ethereum Layer 2 Blockchains\n\nThe top 3 Ethereum Layer 2 blockchains are doing quite well and their total value locked (TVL) has grown since their inception. However, there has been a wide gap when it comes to usage, as well as a difference in the TVL on the blockchain.\n\nArbitrum, although the last to gain widespread popularity, has surged ahead of the rest in terms of TVL and usage. The L2 currently boasts the fourth largest TVL in the whole of decentralized finance (DeFi) with over $2.2 billion locked so far.\n\nFor comparison, Polygon is the second-best performing Layer 2 network but it only has around $1.07 billion in TVL, over 50% lower than that of Arbitrum. Furthermore, Optimism is the lowest performer of the three but it is not far behind Polygon with a TVL of $923 million.\n\nWhen it comes to usage, Arbitrum is still way ahead of the rest with a 24-hour volume of $583 million compared to $148 million for Polygon and $38 million for Optimism.\n\nArbitrum volume outpaces all other L2 | Source: DeFiLlama\n\nArbitrum, Optimism, And Polygon Token Performance\n\nWith Arbitrum\u2019s airdrop last week, the top 3 Ethereum Layer 2 blockchains all have tokens now, which means their performances can be compared to one another. Some have done better than others, but the margin remains quite narrow.\n\nOP price performs best of the top 3 ETH L2 | Source: OPUSD on TradingView.com\n\nPresently, the price of Arbitrum (ARB) is sitting at $1.26, rising 10% in the last day, but it is not the only one that has achieved this fear. Optimism (OP) has done even better, surging over 10.39% in the same time period to cross $2.28.\n\nPolygon (MATIC) is the worse performer of the bunch in this regard with 8% gains that have brought its price to $1.14. However, MATIC remains the largest out of the three with a market cap of $10.35 billion compared to $1.6 billion for ARB and $716 million for OP.\n\nFollow Best Owie on Twitter for market insights, updates, and the occasional funny tweet\u2026 Featured image from InvestingCube, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "OpenSea sees a slump in Ethereum and Polygon NFT sales; Details inside - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Ethereum and Polygon-based NFTs on OpenSea gear up to close Q1 at their lowest sales volume yet.\n\nOpenSea\u2019s market share has declined significantly since the year began.\n\nThe Q1 sales figures for Ethereum and Polygon-based non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on OpenSea are on track to register the lowest monthly volume of the year so far, according to data from Dune Analytics.\n\nEthereum-based NFT sales on the marketplace soared to a nine-month high of $643.61 million by the end of February. However, with four days left to end the first quarter of the year, OpenSea has logged $324.30 million in Ethereum-minted NFT sales in March, representing a 50% decline in sales volume from the February high.\n\nFollowing a record-breaking NFT sales volume of $109.12 million in February, sales of Polygon-based NFTs on OpenSea have experienced a sharp decline this month. Over the past 26 days, only $2.5 million in sales volume have been recorded, indicating a staggering 97% drop in sales.\n\nThe steep decline in sales volume of Ethereum and Polygon-based NFTs on OpenSea was attributed to the drop in the count of NFTs sold so far this month.\n\nRegarding Ethereum-minted NFTs on OpenSea, 715,925 NFTs have been sold so far. This represented a 16% decline from the 853,391 total NFTs sold in February and a 37% fall from the 1.13 million total Ethereum-based NFTs sold in January.\n\nRegarding Polygon NFTs on OpenSea, sales have plummeted by 93% this month, with only 35,064 NFTs sold compared to the 565,964 NFTs sold last month, and a 98% decline from the 1,514,895 NFTs sold in January.\n\nOpenSea\u2019s dominance has dwindled severely\n\nData from DappRadar revealed a steep decline in key growth metrics for leading NFT marketplace OpenSea since the year began.\n\nFor example, the count of unique active wallets that trade on the marketplace has dropped by 98% in the last 90 days. Likewise, the transactions count on OpenSea has witnessed a 99% decline during the same period.\n\nThe decline in OpenSea\u2019s dominance is attributable to the launch of Blur, which has gained significant traction since it became operational in October 2022.\n\nAccording to a recent report from Glassnode, Blur\u2019s market share experienced a notable surge following the airdrop of its token on 14 February.\n\nBefore the distribution of the BLUR token, the NFT marketplace and aggregator held 48% of the NFT transfer volume across the entire market. However, the airdrop led to a significant increase in Blur\u2019s NFT transfer volume, which soared to 78% at its peak.\n\nDuring the last week, Blur accounted for a significant portion of the total NFT sales volume, representing 73.8% of the market share. In contrast, OpenSea held a smaller share of 17%."

        "content": "The crypto analytics provider \u2013 Santiment \u2013 revealed that almost 90% of Ethereum\u2019s supply is currently stored in self-custody addresses. The last time the figure was so high was in 2015, shortly after the protocol\u2019s native token saw the light of day.\n\nThe new data comes at a time when investors seem to have lost some of their faith in centralized exchanges. Withdrawals from Binance soared in the past 24 hours, prompted by the recent clash between the platform and the CFTC.\n\nSantiment\u2019s data showed that only 10.31% of Ethereum\u2019s supply is now held on exchanges, the lowest ratio since the birth of the token.\n\nIt is worth noting that consumers have started moving their holdings en masse to self-custody addresses since September last year.\n\nThe process intensified in November during the FTX meltdown, which undermined the trust in centralized platforms.\n\nIt seems that some investors are rushing to move their possessions from Binance to cold wallets after the US CFTC threatened to sue the exchange for allegedly violating trading regulations.\n\nNansen showed that the company saw $400 million in net outflows over the past 24 hours. Interestingly, data released by Thanefield Capital indicated that investors had withdrawn approximately $850 million from the platform in the 12 hours preceding the indictment.\n\nBinance had to cope with substantial withdrawal requests again at the end of last year when US federal prosecutors hinted they could file money laundering charges against it.\n\nThe firm processed all transactions without registering any problems, while CEO Chanpeng Zhao (CZ) dismissed the accusations as \u201cFUD.\u201d"

        "content": "It\u2019s no secret that Bitcoin, Ethereum and most other major cryptocurrencies are trading well below their all-time highs. It\u2019s why the phrase \u201ccrypto winter\u201d has become a top discussion among investors.\n\nWhile a bear market has scared away many individual investors and financial institutions, others are now laying the groundwork for the next bull run.\n\nDon\u2019t Miss: This Startup Built the World's First AI Marketing Platform That Can Understand Emotion and Some of the Biggest Companies on the Planet Are Already Using It\n\nTwo of the world\u2019s largest and most respected financial institutions \u2014 BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity Investments \u2014 recently dove headfirst into the cryptocurrency world. And with a combined $14 trillion in assets under management, it\u2019s something to pay close attention to.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s Larry Fink Excited About The Future\n\nIn his annual letter to shareholders, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink shared his excitement about the future of cryptocurrency and digital assets as a whole.\n\n\u201cAt BlackRock we continue to explore the digital assets ecosystem, especially areas most relevant to our clients such as permissioned blockchains and tokenization of stocks and bonds,\u201d Fink wrote.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time BlackRock and Fink have made their intention clear about their involvement in the blockchain and emerging technology space. In 2022, BlackRock partnered with Coinbase to provide its institutional clients with access to Bitcoin. That was a bold move for an investment company with the size and reach of BlackRock, but it\u2019s been a welcome addition.\n\nTo stay updated with top startup news & investments, sign up for Benzinga\u2019s Startup Investing & Equity Crowdfunding Newsletter\n\nFidelity Joining The Crypto Revolution\n\nEarlier this month, Fidelity Crypto made its way to the public, allowing tens of millions of its retail customers to buy and sell Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies. Adding to the excitement is the fact that all Bitcoin and Ethereum transactions on the app are commission-free.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget this: The investment manager filed three U.S. trademark applications at the end of 2022. The applications made mention of crypto trading, metaverse investment services, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and virtual real estate investing. All of these areas are primed for hypergrowth in 2023 and beyond.\n\nWhen companies like BlackRock and Fidelity take a step into the future \u2014 such as going all-in on cryptocurrency and digital assets \u2014 it\u2019s important to take notice. No one knows when the next crypto bull run will arrive, but when it does it\u2019s safe to say that BlackRock and Fidelity will be in a position to take full advantage.\n\nBanking Collapses as a Catalyst\n\nThe collapse of various regional banks has created a rebound in blockchain-based assets. While they are still off their all-time highs, they are considerably higher than their 2022 lows. The price of Bitcoin has rallied for several weeks now. Gamestop\u2019s NFT marketplace has seen a volume rebound and retail investors have begun increased funding of startups in the space. For example, Gameflip recently crossed $900,000 raised from retail investors in their current equity crowdfunding raise. While institutions previously might have been skeptical of blockchain-based assets, institutional interest might be rebounding following the lack of stability in the banking system, as institutions look for liquid places to store their cash.\n\nSee more on startups investing from Benzinga.\n\nDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

        "content": "While 2022 was unpleasant to many crypto investors, things seemed to improve again in 2023.\n\nThe bitcoin price has climbed to around $28,000 per bitcoin, up from under $17,000 at the beginning of the year. Price analysis shows bitcoin could be headed for approximately $35,000 per bitcoin.\n\nEthereum\u2019s recent rise is the growing popularity of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.

As a result, it will make it experience impressive growth in the coming years.\n\nCrypto experts forecast that LHINU will skyrocket during 2023 and acquire vastly higher growth in value than DOGE and other popular meme coins.\n\nCurrently, the price of 1 LHINU is 0.000095$. However, investors are recommended to act right now to get LHINU tokens since the price will rocket before the end of the presale.\n\n>>>Buy Love Hate Inu Now!<<<\n\nFight Out (FGHT)\n\nFight Out is the number one Play-2-Earn fitness app that gamifies the fitness lifestyle.

To get this offer, buyers must acquire up to $50,000 worth of FGHT and hold on to it for at least 36 months.\n\nMembers of Fight Out can gain financial benefits by completing fitness-related activities and exercises.\n\nThe platform provides a soulbound NFT avatar free to mint at account creation. They are linked to a member and cannot be sold.

        "content": "The crypto world is showing mixed reactions to the Fed\u2019s rate hike. While most currencies have taken a hit, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have climbed back from slumps and are pushing ahead. New crypto Dogetti (DETI) is attracting investor attention with its unique features and focus on DeFi ecosystems.\n\nEthereum is pushing the crucial $1800 resistance level.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is pushing the $1800 resistance level, and there is optimism in the market that if ETH manages to break past the resistance mark, it will reach the $2000 mark soon. The token\u2019s price has risen by almost 2% in the past 24 hours. Various factors contribute to Ethereum testing resistance levels, the foremost reason being ETH\u2019s transition into a Proof-of-Stake coin. Ethereum\u2019s growth as a favoured platform for DeFi applications is another factor adding to the rally in ETH prices.\n\nLong-term prospects of ETH are bright as the popularity of DeFi applications rises. Also, the volatility in the banking sector can also add growth to Ethereum, with the view that it is a more stable option than the former. Short-term volatility aside, the long-term investment credentials of Ethereum remain strong.\n\nBitcoin moves past rate hike blues.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) looks to cement its status as a safe haven investment option as the traditional financial system stares at banking failures. News of bank collapses and the general bad health of banks have contributed to a rally in Bitcoin prices. But the Fed\u2019s rate hikes have put the rally on hold, and Bitcoin prices took a beating yesterday. But BTC prices have shown resilience and have climbed back to the $28k levels today.\n\nThe latest price rally of Bitcoin is a testament that it has shrugged off stress from the Fed\u2019s latest round of rate hikes. In the background of the banking crisis, the premier crypto is resembling safer asset classes like gold and is displaying upward momentum. Investors decision to back Bitcoin may lie in its decentralised architecture with no single power centre. This feature differentiates it from fiat currencies, with powerful central banks controlling them. The growing popularity of decentralised finance will strengthen the case for favouring Bitcoin. Thus, Bitcoin could see a resurgence as the banking crisis unfolds. Nevertheless, its long-term prospects look strong on the back of the rise of DeFi.\n\nDogetti Eyes Top Doge Spot\n\nDogetti (DETI) is the newest entrant to the crypto world, and its stated goal is to be the top dog of the meme coin space. Dogetti is a community focussed token that plans to create generational wealth for its community. The token is themed around a DOGE mafia and calls itself the Dogetti family. The token is unique with its focus on decentralisation and community ownership. The Dogetti family\u2019s plans to create generational wealth for its members hinge on its plans to develop a comprehensive ecosystem that has NFTs and DeFi projects playing a central role.\n\nDogetti stands apart from its peers with its flagship feature, the buy-back protocol. The buy-back protocol allows community members to earn a 2% reflection on all transactions. The protocol would allow the members of the Dogetti family to have a steady stream of income.\n\nNFTs play a crucial role in Dogetti\u2019s plans for community engagement. The network would allow holders to have their versions of virtual pet Dogetti. NFTs on the network will give holders access to events and content. Another great feature of the Dogetti family is the DogettiDAO which will make decision-making on the network democratic and decentralised.

        "content": "The 2021 crypto bull run was an incredible time for investors all around! Whether you were knee-deep in crypto or just a newbie that decided to take a bet on crypto. Chances are that if you got in early, around the start of 2021, you saw some tremendous gains!\n\nDuring this previous bull run cycle, in November 2021, Bitcoin (BTC) reached a staggering peak of over 65,000 USD, which felt unbelievable for many \u2013 and many altcoins made even bigger gains than Bitcoin\u2026 Many would come to realise that although Bitcoin works as a store of value, the DeFi (decentralised finance) altcoins are where you can see the biggest gains in a short amount of time!\n\nIn this article, we will be going through our top three altcoin picks in preparation for the next bull run: Dogetti (DETI), Cardano (ADA) and Ethereum (ETH). We\u2019ll also be discussing the volatility that comes along with altcoins and what you can do to hedge against losses.\n\nDogetti: The Top Dogs Rise To Fame Equals Gains\n\nDogetti (DETI) is the latest and greatest meme token, taking the crypto world by the horns! Dogetti aims to be the top dog in the world of dog-themed cryptos such as Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), and with an incredibly rapid growing community (a.k.a family), this could happen sooner than you may think!\n\nAs a DeFi token, Dogetti has great tokenomics \u2013 with 6% of each transaction going to various charities, holder benefits, and liquidity/burn wallets, among other purposes! Since it is community-run, everyone in the family has a stake in the coin\u2019s success.\n\nDon\u2019t pass up this chance to participate in the craziness and join one of the most rapidly-expanding crypto projects! You can also receive a 50% bonus on your order by using the brand-new promotion code DON50!\n\nCardano Could See Big Gains Coming Its Way\n\nCharles Hoskinson founded the decentralised, open-source Cardano (ADA) blockchain platform in 2017. It promises to offer a more sustainable and safe way to manage digital assets. The goal of the initiative, which is to develop a more fair and open financial system, is one that many ADA users are deeply committed to!\n\nThe platform differs from other cryptocurrencies thanks to its distinctive features, including its proof-of-stake consensus method and its emphasis on academic research. Cardano has the potential to be a significant player in the blockchain and digital asset industries with a committed community and a solid staff at its back.\n\nThe devoted Cardano community is made up of a diverse group of programmers, entrepreneurs, investors, and supporters. All of them are motivated by the project\u2019s potential to transform conventional finance and usher in a better future for everyone. With this level of importance that Cardano holds in crypto, we can imagine big gains coming for Cardano when altcoin season kicks in!\n\nEthereum \u2013 The Biggest Altcoin On The Blockchain\n\nIf Bitcoin (BTC) serves as the digital gold in the world of crypto, then Ethereum (ETH), the second largest crypto is the digital silver \u2013 and that is not to be undervalued!\n\nIn the Ethereum network, decentralised apps (DApps) can be created and deployed by developers. Users also have more control over their data than they have with conventional banking organisations or platforms.\n\nWith Ethereum 2.0 around the corner, which is a major upgrade that will bring millions more to crypto, Ethereum is surely one to invest in for altseason!\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nAs altcoin season heats up, investors should consider Dogetti (DETI), Cardano (ADA), and Ethereum (ETH) for potential gains. Dogetti is a rapidly growing meme token with strong tokenomics and a dedicated community. Cardano is a unique blockchain platform with a commitment to creating a more fair and open financial system. Ethereum is the second-largest crypto with the potential for massive gains thanks to the upcoming Ethereum 2.0 upgrade.\n\nHowever, you should also be aware of the volatility that comes with altcoins and consider hedging against potential losses by diversifying your portfolio. Don\u2019t miss out on the potential gains of altcoin season with these top picks!\n\nDogetti (DETI)\n\nPresale: https://dogetti.io/how-to-buy\n\nWebsite: https://dogetti.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/Dogetti\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_Dogetti_\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) is on the cusp of a significant breakout, with the digital asset recently showing remarkable strength, reclaiming a crucial support level between $1,700 and $1,780.\n\nNotably, during this critical level\u2019s reclaiming process, an impressive 1.41 million addresses bought 6.48 million ETH, indicating a growing interest in the asset. Furthermore, this support level\u2019s successful reclaiming marks an important milestone for ETH, as it has provided a crucial base and cleared the path for further upside potential.\n\nIndeed, crypto trading analyst Ali Martinez highlighted on March 29, using IntoTheBlock\u2019s In/Out of the money around price chart, that \u201cgiven the lack of significant resistance ahead, it is entirely reasonable to expect further upside,\u201d based on information for ETH addresses that bought between $1,533 and $2,077.\n\nEthereum price resistance levels. Source: IntoTheBlock\u2019s\n\nIn summary, the current market trends suggest that ETH is primed for a significant surge in value. As Martinez noted, with a solid base established and no considerable resistance ahead, the asset\u2019s upward trajectory is \u2018poised to break out.\u2019\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nCurrently, Ethereum is changing hands at $1,818, up 5.21% in the last 24 hours and 1.47% across the previous week, with a total market capitalization of $222 billion.\n\nEthereum 1-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nMeanwhile, the one-day gauges at the finance analytics platform TradingView indicate a bullish sentiment for ETH, considering that their summary is in the \u2018strong buy\u2019 area at 17 \u2013 the result of moving averages suggesting a \u2018strong buy\u2019 at 14 and oscillators pointing to a \u2018buy\u2019 at 3.\n\nEthereum 1-day price gauges. Source: TradingView\n\nFinally, it\u2019s worth mentioning that the Shapella network upgrade will be activated on the Ethereum mainnet on April 12, following an official consensus reached by core developers, according to a blog post by the Ethereum Foundation on Tuesday, March 28.\n\nThe EIP-4895 standard will be added to the Ethereum network after the whole of the Shapella update has been implemented. This EIP will make it possible, for the first first time, to withdraw ether that has been staked. In addition, Shapella has made various modifications to its network to reduce the transaction costs associated with certain activities.\n\nInvestors will be hoping that this has further bullish implications for the price of ETH as more than 90% of holders take their Ethereum off exchanges.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "title": "Ethereum Supply On Exchanges Plunges To New All-Time Lows - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Ethereum supply on exchanges has continued to go down recently and has now touched a value of 10.3%, effectively a new all-time low.\n\nJust 10.3% Of The Total Ethereum Supply Is Now Being Kept On Exchanges\n\nAccording to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the current ETH supply on exchanges is the lowest since the week the cryptocurrency was introduced almost eight years ago.\n\nThe \u201csupply on exchanges\u201d is an indicator that measures the percentage of the total Ethereum supply that\u2019s currently being stored in the wallets of all centralized exchanges.\n\nWhen the value of this metric goes down, it means some coins are being taken out of these platforms right now. Such a trend, when prolonged, may prove to be bullish for the asset\u2019s price as it can be a sign that accumulation is going on in the market.\n\nOn the other hand, the metric\u2019s value trending up implies investors are depositing their ETH to exchanges currently. As one of the main reasons why holders transfer to these platforms is for selling-related purposes, this kind of trend can have a bearish effect on the value of the asset.\n\nNow, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Ethereum supply on exchanges over the last several years:\n\nThe value of the metric seems to have been going down in recent days | Source: Santiment on Twitter\n\nAs displayed in the above graph, the Ethereum supply on exchanges had been on a constant downtrend since the start of the bull run of this cycle, until the middle of the bear market in 2022.\n\nThe indicator observed some growth during this period, suggesting that investors were depositing to these platforms then. This may have been a sign of capitulation, as holders who bought during the bull run tend to exit out of the asset when bear markets set in.\n\nThis uptrend that was building up, however, broke off around the time of the collapse of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX. The reason behind this was that, after seeing what went down with FTX, investors became more aware than ever of the risks of keeping their coins in central custody.\n\nSo, a large number of holders made withdrawals from such platforms to keep their Ethereum inside their personal wallets. Because of this movement, the supply on exchanges saw a sharp plunge.\n\nInterestingly, as the rally has taken place this year, the metric still hasn\u2019t reversed its trend and has rather kept on going down. Normally, deposits may be expected during periods with bullish trends as some holders would want to realize their profits.\n\nThe fact that the indicator has only continued the downtrend suggests that there is enough demand for withdrawing the asset that any deposits being made are getting outweighed.\n\nFollowing the latest downtrend in the indicator, the percentage of the Ethereum supply on exchanges has dropped to just 10.3%. Santiment believes that this shows high confidence from the HODLers of the asset.\n\nETH Price\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $1,700, down 1% in the last week.\n\nLooks like the the asset has been consolidating recently | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Jievani Weerasinghe on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, Santiment.net"

        "title": "ETH struggles to break out of $1,800 ahead of the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade \u2013 Will this increase buying pressure? - Crypto News Flash",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) has witnessed some selling pressure over the weekend as it struggles to hold past $1,800. On the downside, $1680 is crucial support for the crypto.\n\nOver the last week, Ethereum whale addresses have been buying a good quantity of ETH ahead of the Shanghai upgrade.\n\nAfter a strong move to $1,800 last week, the world\u2019s second-largest crypto Ethereum (ETH) has struggled to keep up with the rise and hold this level. Over the weekend, ETH faced some selling pressure. As of press time, Ethereum (ETH) is trading 1.88% down at a price of $1,756 with a market cap of $214 billion.\n\nMore or less, Ethereum seems to have entered a kind of consolidation just ahead of the Shanghai upgrade scheduled next month in April. On the technical chart, $1680 represents the top of a symmetrical triangle dating back to September 2021.\n\nAs the ETH price has already moved past this, it would serve as strong support for the altcoin going ahead. Thus, it will be important for the bulls to defend the $1680 level thereby preventing any further fall in the ETH price.\n\nAnother reason behind the selling pressure on Ethereum is the recent report by Bank of America that predicts that there will be a drop in ETH usage if the speed of the Ethereum network doesn\u2019t pick up soon.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain underwent the Merge upgrade last year in mid-September 2022 to improve the network scalability and performance. However, the analyst at Bank of America states that the speed of the Ethereum blockchain hasn\u2019t increased considerably and is due for an upgrade if it wants to retain its position among the top two cryptocurrencies by market cap.\n\nEthereum Whales Back In Action\n\nAlthough the ETH price has come under some selling pressure, on-chain data shows that the Ethereum whales have been scooping up large supplies of ETH recently as the Shanghai upgrade draws closer. The Shanghai upgrade is important since it would unlock all the staked ETH allowing users to withdraw their coins from staking at their discretion.\n\nAs per the data from Santiment, Ethereum wallet addresses holding between 1,000 and more than 10,000 ETH as well the wallet addresses holding between 1 million to 10 million ETH tokens have been adding the ETH cryptocurrency to their kitty consistently over the past week. This clearly shows that the large wallet addresses are majorly bullish on the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.\n\nIn addition to the Ethereum whales, the retail players have also been accumulating ETH consistently. The total number of Ethereum addresses with at least 0.01 ETH has now shot up to 23.3 million with the address count hitting an eight-month high as per the data on Glassnode.\n\nAt the same time, the total value locked (TVL) in the ETH 2.0 deposit contract has also touched a new all-time high above 17 million ETH. This is a bull-case scenario for ETH.\n\nAlthough, ETH has made strong advancements this year, it has struggled to keep pace with the Bitcoin gains.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

By having Alchemy Pay helping users to pay with crypto via Binance Pay, we are bringing cutting-edge payment options to Europeans.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, the Russian subsidiary of the highly popular Burger King restaurant conducted the first cryptocurrency test by issuing WhooperCoin tokens on the Waves network, which were made available to consumers at every purchase.\n\nAlthough the project never took off, other BK branches started to accept Bitcoin payments, such as in the Netherlands, Germany, Venezuela, Brazil, and more. Nowadays, one can buy Whoppers with Bitcoin through debit cards.\n\nBitcoin also gained more utility, thanks to the crypto-based rewards program.\n\nCrypto Reward Schemes Boosted Bitcoin\u2019s Use Cases\n\nThese are becoming increasingly popular within the restaurant industry as brands look for new and innovative ways to engage with consumers and build their technological cred.\n\nIn 2021, Burger King US partnered with Robinhood to give away free cryptocurrency to its customers.\n\nA year ago, popular burger chain Shake Shack launched a new Bitcoin-based rewards program in an effort to attract younger consumers and test the potential for long-term adoption.\n\nAs reported by TronWeekly, Shake Shack begin offering rewards of up to 15% in the form of Bitcoin for all payments made via Cash Card, a debit card available through Cash App."
