        "content": "Ethereum traded above $2,000 for the first time since May 2022 after the successful Shappella upgrade.\n\nAccording to CryptoSlate\u2019s data, ETH rose more than 6% in the last 24 hours to trade as high as $2,007. The digital asset has since retraced to $2,001 at the time of writing.\n\nDuring the period, Ether outperformed Bitcoin\u2019s price performance which only rose by less than 1%.\n\nCoinglass data showed that ETH\u2019s positive performance liquidated almost $40 million in short positions within the last 24 hours.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin and Ethereum are up over 81% and 60% year-to-date, respectively.\n\nThe success of the Shappela upgrade mostly influenced ETH\u2019s positive price movement. The Shappella upgrade is the first major Ethereum network update since the Merge and will enable validators to withdraw their staked ETH.\n\nWhile some analysts predicted that the unlock would place more selling pressure on ETH, the asset\u2019s current performance showed that their fears were unfounded.\n\nData from Token Unlocks showed validators had withdrawn over 130,000 Ethereum at the time of press. The data further shows that roughly $1.8 billion worth of ETH is pending withdrawals.\n\nLiquid staking tokens rally\n\nLiquid staking tokens have risen by roughly 3% in the last 24 hours, according to CryptoSlate\u2019s data.\n\nExcept for Rocket Pool (RPL), the other cryptocurrencies in the sector gained all recorded gains during the reporting period.\n\nAccording to the data, StakeWise (SWISE) gained 6.62%, while Frax Share\u2019s FXS rose by roughly 3%.\n\nOther protocols like Lido (LDO), ANKR, pStake Finance (PSTAKE), and Stafi (FIS) posted gains of less than 1%, respectively. Overall, the market cap of the crypto tokens in this sector sits at $3.97 billion as of press time.\n\nIn the last 24 hours, DeFillama data shows that the total value of assets locked (TVL) on the top liquid staking protocols rose by an average of 4%. According to the data, over 8 million ETH tokens \u2014 worth $16.03 billion \u2014 are staked through these platforms.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Bitcoin and ether are crypto\u2019s blue chips. And much like tech giants Apple and Microsoft, they\u2019ve attracted distinct and loyal communities, leading to a natural rivalry.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) are also increasingly correlated. In fact, they\u2019re moving more in tandem than ever before.\n\nBut BTC is still the market leader. It commands almost half of the entire crypto capitalization, its dominance now at one-year highs. That\u2019s still less than the 2018-2019 bear market, when bitcoin dominance was as high as 71%.\n\nETH meanwhile makes up nearly 20%, more than double what it was when the market bottomed last cycle. Comparing returns since Apr. 2018 shows bitcoin outstripping ether for most of that interim \u2014- until May 2021.\n\nBitcoin was just coming down from reaching $60,000 for the first time, while ether was correcting after attempting to break $4,000. At that point, bitcoin had returned around 550% since the first inning of the previous bear market, going from $7,900 to nearly $51,000. Ether had just eclipsed bitcoin, having jumped more than 700%.\n\nBitcoin and ether are practically even over the past five years\n\nEther would hold onto that lead for practically the entire bull market and then some. Bitcoin has gained ground though, thanks to a falling ETH-to-BTC ratio (down 13.5% over the past year).\n\nBTC is now a whisker away from topping ETH over the past five years \u2014 the former returning 279% to the latter\u2019s 289%.\n\nSimple charts like these suffer from a certain amount of time bias (the five-year returns may look completely different in another three months).\n\nStill, Bob Ras, co-founder of tokenized securities startup Sologenic, explained that the narrative has shifted somewhat when it comes to Bitcoin and Ethereum since the 2021 bull run.\n\n\u201cThere was so much strength behind the Ethereum ecosystem because of all the utility enabled by DeFi, NFTs, ENS and other applications,\u201d Ras told Blockworks.\n\n\u201cDuring the bull run, there were a lot more users around who were toying with various digital asset applications, and so it made sense for Ethereum to have been the key driver of growth.\u201d\n\nThe three-year chart tells a different story: ETH has dominated BTC over the past three years (1,085% to 327%)\n\nBitcoin has performed less bad than ether\n\nThe macro situation has changed since the 2018 bull market, capped off by the recent US banking crisis.\n\nRas noted that the Federal Reserve will have to pivot away from its tightening policy soon, which could inject more liquidity into the market to prevent a credit crunch.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is now rivaling gold and other stores of value when it comes to hedging against these likely forthcoming liquidity injections, which will ultimately contribute to the debasement of the dollar and other fiat currencies,\u201d Ras said.\n\n\u201cBTC is the hardened, reliable asset right now. The narrative could shift again, of course, but it seems likely that the ETH/BTC ratio could trend downwards for some time \u2014 perhaps until the next bull market fully kicks in.\u201d\n\nZooming in to just the past year shows where those \u2018gains\u2019 have been made\n\nBTC has outperformed ETH easily since April 2022, weeks before Terra would depeg, causing chaos for crypto. BTC is down almost 26% while ETH has fallen 37%.\n\nAlthough, it would be more accurate to say bitcoin has performed \u201cless bad,\u201d considering neither have boosted portfolios over the past year.\n\nZooming out to encompass all-time returns however, bitcoin blows ether out of the water.\n\nBitcoin has returned a pearl-clutching 4-billion percent since its earliest recorded price in late 2009 ($0.00076392).\n\nEther has \u201conly\u201d risen 66,544% since it first launched in 2015.

        "title": "Ethereum Shanghai upgrade prompts Ether withdrawals, but no stampede for exits - Forkast News",
        "content": "Holders of Ether, the native token of the US$231 billion Ethereum blockchain, started withdrawing the cryptocurrency after the so-called Shanghai upgrade was completed in the early morning of Thursday in Asia, but the price of Ether held up and analysts said the withdrawn amounts were in line with expectations.\n\nThe main feature of the upgrade is the capability for users known as validators to withdraw their staked Ether, or tokens deposited to support the operations of the Ethereum blockchain, the world\u2019s second-biggest, in return for a passive income, usually in the form of more tokens.\n\nAs of noon in Hong Kong, over 53,320 Ether (US$102 million) had been withdrawn, with another 558,4420 held by 268,820 validators awaiting withdrawal, according to data from Token Unlocks. The data tracker estimates withdrawals may reach 105,680 Ether in the next 12 hours. About 3,000 Ether were staked in the network post-upgrade.\n\nEther was changing hands at US$1,916 around Thursday noon in Hong Kong, up 2.5% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. The cryptocurrency has risen about 60% so far this year.\n\n\u201cThe withdrawal amount we are seeing is something we [and the community] expected given that these stakers had committed their funds without a certain timeline for withdrawal,\u201d Jonathon Miller, managing director of cryptocurrency exchange Kraken Australia, told Forkast in an emailed comment on Thursday. Some large movements and volatility were expected, he said.\n\nCharlie McGlynn, head of decentralized finance trading at XREX, a Taipei-based fiat-crypto exchange, echoed those views. \u201cAll things considered, there is far from a massive rush to exit as many surmised would take place,\u201d he told Forkast on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThis is a strong derisking event as users can now feel at ease to stake and unstake,\u201d McGlynn said. \u201cNew staking deposits can be expected to increase in the coming days and weeks.\u201d\n\nWith around 18 million Ether \u2013 worth about US$34.5 billion and about 15% of the total supply \u2013 staked into the network, according to Etherscan, concerns emerged that holders could rush to sell Ether to lock in profits, which would drive prices lower. According to Coin Metrics estimates cited in a Tuesday Bloomberg report, users may withdraw 1.2 million Ether in the five days after the upgrade.\n\nHowever, Guilhem Chaumont, chief executive officer of crypto-financial service Flowdesk, points out that daily system limits on how much staked Ether can be withdrawn could itself prevent a sell off in the token. Only 115,200 withdrawals can be processed per day, according to the Ethereum Foundation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to realize that the withdrawal queue only allows a limited set of requests per day, so while there may be sustained downward pressure on the price, unstaking is not likely to cause a sharp, sudden dip,\u201d he said in an emailed comment earlier this week.\n\nKen Timsit, head of Cronos Labs, the accelerator of the Cronos chain that links the Ethereum and Cosmos blockchains, has cautioned that Ether stakers would monitor withdrawals after the Shanghai upgrade is completed and may potentially overreact if there is significant withdrawal demand.\n\n\u201cOnce short-term volatility has been smoothed out, however, it is likely that the outcome will be neutral given that this upgrade has been priced into Ether value for some time,\u201d Timsit said in an emailed comment earlier this week."

        "content": "Next Major Upgrade Is Expected In Early 2024\n\nBy: Samuel Haig \u2022 Loading...\n\nDeFi News\n\nWith the \u201cShapella\u201d upgrades in the rear-view window, Ethereum\u2019s developers will now prioritize delivering significant improvements to scalability, Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin said in a livestream preceding the highly-anticipated forks.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Shanghai and Capella forks, known as Shapella, went live on Wednesday at epoch 194,048, allowing Ethereum stakers to withdraw their Ether for the first time. The event was the network\u2019s first major upgrade since The Merge transitioned Ethereum to Proof of Stake consensus last September.\n\n\u201cThe Shapella upgrade closes the loop on some things that are part of the PoS transition but did not make it in time for the merge, withdrawals obviously being really important,\u201d Buterin said during an Ethereum Foundation livestream.\u201dThe immediate next focus after this\u2026 is going to be scaling.\u201d\n\nButerin warned that without improved scalability, a spike in on-chain activity could result in Ethereum users having to cough up hundreds of dollars for transaction fees just to transact on-chain, as frequently occurred during the previous bull cycle.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t fix scaling before the next bull run, people are going to be stuck paying $500 transaction fees\u201d\n\n\n\nVitalik Buterin\n\nScaling Ethereum\n\nButerin confirmed that Ethereum\u2019s next hard fork, rumored to take place sometime around the start of 2024, will include EIP-4844, also known as proto-danksharding.\n\nResearchers say EIP-4844 will dramatically improve the scalability of Layer 2 rollups by replacing \u201ccalldata\u201d with data \u201cblobs,\u201d which are less blockspace-intensive for the network to process. Buterin described minimizing transaction data as \u201cthe primary bottleneck\u201d for scaling rollups.\n\nButerin said proto-danksharding could deliver a 10x improvement in scalability, adding that development towards EIP-4844 \u201cis moving forward quickly.\u201d He added that the upgrade paves the way for full sharding.\n\nButerin also praised Ethereum\u2019s Layer 2 teams for their progress over the past 12 months, noting the launch of zkEVMs from Polygon and Matter Labs, and the impressive growth of Arbitrum and Optimism.\n\nRelative Stability\n\nLooking ahead, Buterin said Ethereum is still in the throes of its most disruptive upgrades, predicting the network will enter a period of relative stability once Ethereum\u2019s scalability roadmap is complete.\n\n\u201cAfter this [next] fork is done, and then after scaling is done, we\u2019re in a stage where the hardest and fastest parts of the Ethereum protocol\u2019s transition are essentially over,\u201d Buterin said. \u201cVarious things will need to be done, but those\u2026 things can be safely done at a slower pace.\u201d\n\nWhile speaking at a conference in Paris on July 21, 2022, Buterin said Ethereum\u2019s transition to Proof of Stake would usher in a temporary phase of turbulent changes.\n\n\u201cAt some point, the rate of change of the Ethereum protocol is going to have to [slow down],\u201d Buterin said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that Ethereum ossifies completely, but it does mean that it looks somewhat more like a system that optimizes for safety and predictability, and less like an ecosystem that optimizes for impressing and dazzling people.\u201d"

        "title": "What is the Ethereum Shanghai (Shapella) Upgrade? Everything You Need to Know - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade, also commonly referred to as Shapella (we\u2019ll explain why below), took place on April 12th.\n\nIt was a major upgrade following Ethereum\u2019s transition to Proof-of-Stake (a.k.a The Merge), and it introduced a major mechanic change.\n\nThe upgrade consists of a few Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), although most of the focus is on one particular.\n\nThe EIPs in question are:\n\nEIP-3651 : Warm COINBASE\n\n: Warm COINBASE EIP-3855 : PUSH0 instruction\n\n: PUSH0 instruction EIP-3860 : Limit and meter initcode\n\n: Limit and meter initcode EIP-4895 : Beacon chain push withdrawals as operations\n\n: Beacon chain push withdrawals as operations EIP-6049: Deprecate SELFDESTRUCT\n\nWith that in mind, let\u2019s take a closer look and understand why the Shanghai upgrade is so important.\n\nWhat is the Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade?\n\nEthereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade is arguably one of the most important events in the crypto industry in 2023.\n\nBefore we dive in, did you know that it\u2019s also commonly referred to as the Ethereum Shapella upgrade? The name comes from Shanghai \u2013 the city-host of the Devcon 2 conference, and Capella \u2013 the brightest star in the northern constellation of Auriga.\n\nAs we know from our guide on Ethereum\u2019s Merge (the transition to Proof-of-Stake), the network has two layers \u2013 the execution layer and the consensus layer. The former used to be the main one that Ethereum ran on before The Merge, while the consensus layer was also known as the Beacon Chain.\n\nWith that in mind, the upgrade took part on both layers. Shanghai happened on the execution layer, while Capella \u2013 was on the consensus one. Combining both names gives us \u201cShapella.\u201d However, the Shanghai name remains more prevalent, so for the sake of simplicity, we will use it in the guide going forward.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade introduced a pivotal mechanic in Ethereum\u2019s network, and while there are many EIPs (as seen above), one of them is critical. Namely, this is EIP- 4895.\n\nWhat is EIP-4895 in the Shanghai Upgrade?\n\nWhile it\u2019s currently running on PoS, Ethereum was using the proof-of-work consensus algorithm well before The Merge took place, But the plans to transition were in play for many years when developers created the so-called Beacon Chain.\n\nThe Beacon Chain was (and still is) secured by PoS. To maintain its integrity, allow it to function as intended, and carry out transactions and smart contracts, it needed validators \u2013 just like any other PoS-based blockchains where miners do not exist.\n\nTherefore, those who wanted to partake in the future of the so-called Ethereum 2.0 were able to stake 32 ETH to secure the Beacon chain. The ETH was staked in the Beacon Depositor contract. Validators would then earn interest on their ETH \u2013 a reward for securing the network during this development stage.\n\nThe only catch? Well, they weren\u2019t allowed to unstake their 32 ETH until a later, undetermined date. It\u2019s taken years for the team to successfully deliver The Merge, and now, the Shanghai upgrade, through EIP-4895, finally allowed validators to unlock their ETH.\n\nThis guide is not intended as a technical walkthrough, so if you want to learn more about how the mechanic will become possible, please take a look at the official website page for EIP-4895.\n\nIn essence, the goal was to:\n\nIntroduce a system-level \u201coperation\u201d to support validator withdrawals that are \u201cpushed\u201d from the beacon chain to the EVM. These operations create unconditional balance increases to the specified recipients.\n\nThe Beacon depositor contract, as mentioned above, contained about 18 million ETH, which accounted for roughly 15% of the total circulating supply.\n\nValidators are now free to withdraw, albeit with some considerations, their stake and do whatever they decide with it \u2013 it becomes entirely liquid. That made this particular EIP very important.\n\nHow do ETH Withdrawals Work?\n\nAs mentioned above, there are some considerations when withdrawals were opened. First things first, there are two types of them \u2013 full and partial. Full withdrawals allow validators to exit their stake completely, taking their entire balance of ETH, including the original 32 ETH, as well as any rewards they may have accrued.\n\nPartial withdrawals only allow validators to access the excess (balances over the 32 ETH) needed to run a validator node.\n\nWithin every single block that\u2019s added to the network, 16 validators are able to make partial withdrawals.\n\nIn essence, a total of 1,800 validators can unstake fully.\n\nOther Ethereum Improvement Proposals in the Shanghai Upgrade\n\nThe other proposed improvements were aimed at reducing gas fees during periods of very high network congestion and activity.\n\nEIP-3651 aims to lower the gas costs that are associated with the maximal Extractable Value payments when accessing the COINBASE address. In this particular sense of the word, COINBASE refers to a solution that allows developers to receive new tokens and not the popular US-based exchange.\n\nEIP-3855 is designed to introduce a new instruction that pushes the constant value 0 onto the stack. It\u2019s also aimed at lowering gas costs, but more so for developers. The other proposal, EIP-3860, aims to reduce the fees in other instances, and the same is true for the last EIP-6049 to a certain extent.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Shanghai (Shapella) upgrade is a landmark development for Ethereum on its path to achieving security, decentralization, and scalability.\n\nIt also removes a huge burden on validators and provides a clear outlook on the network state now that validators have the option to freely remove their stake at will."

        "title": "Just How Realistic Is an Ethereum Price Target of $10,000? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH 1.60%) is up 60% for the year, and all eyes are now on the blockchain's pending Shanghai upgrade. This is the first major upgrade to Ethereum since The Merge, and has been highly anticipated for months.\n\nThe Ethereum bulls, of course, think that Shanghai will be a huge win for Ethereum, and are getting ready for a huge rally. Some are even predicting a $10,000 price for Ethereum by 2025. But just how realistic is that target? After all, the record high for Ethereum ($4,891.70) is less than half that level.\n\nWhat happens to Ethereum after Shanghai?\n\nBoth bulls and bears agree that the Shanghai upgrade is pivotal to what happens next with Ethereum. The upgrade is directly related to Ethereum's transformation from a proof-of-work blockchain into a proof-of-stake blockchain last year. As soon as that change took place, Ethereum had to consider the implications for staking, which is the process of locking up crypto on the blockchain in exchange for rewards.\n\nCurrently, the lockup period for Ethereum is indefinite. You can stake your Ethereum and earn rewards, but you cannot unlock it and take it out of the blockchain. The primary purpose of Shanghai is to make it possible to withdraw this staked Ethereum, some of which has been locked up since December 2020.\n\nAccording to the Ethereum bulls, the Shanghai upgrade is going to result in huge new flows of capital coming into the blockchain. That's because Shanghai will de-risk staking on the blockchain and pave the way for more individual investors to get involved. If you look at how much Ethereum has been staked, it is only about 16% of the crypto's entire market cap, compared to levels of 60% to 70% found on other blockchains. So it does make sense that the Ethereum staking ratio will one day align with the percentages found on other proof-of-stake blockchains because investors no longer will face an indeterminate lockup.\n\nHowever, that's over the long term. In the short term, the upgrade could spur a huge retreat from Ethereum as investor who have been locked up take flight. This could lead to a huge price dump. Nearly 1 million Ethereum tokens will be available for immediate unstaking in April, and this means that nearly $2 billion worth of Ethereum could be dumped on the market. That doesn't even take into account what happens to the other 18 million Ethereum tokens (worth an aggregate of $36 billion) that have been staked.\n\nWill Ethereum finally get its promised upgrades?\n\nWhat many investors don't realize is that Ethereum's digital transformation is really only halfway to completion. It did not end with The Merge. Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, originally promised 100,000 transactions per second. And he also promised that Ethereum gas, or user, fees would decline markedly after The Merge, making the blockchain much more attractive. But what's the reality? Ethereum still has a transaction processing speed of less than 50 transactions per second, which is glacially slow. And gas fees are not much improved, either.\n\nSo, it could take until 2025 before Ethereum reaches higher functionality. In November 2022, Buterin published an updated roadmap, and the future development of the blockchain consists of at least five more stages. Given how long it took to implement The Merge, and how many delays there were along the way, this could be a very long process.\n\nUltimately, these delays and accompanying uncertainty could have a negative impact on the price of Ethereum. Investors are going to get tired of waiting, and when people finally realize that Ethereum still relies heavily on Layer 2 scaling solutions by other cryptos even after The Merge, there could be a move to embrace other blockchain solutions that don't come with Ethereum's legacy proof-of-work problems.\n\nWhat is a realistic Ethereum price target?\n\nThat said, I'm still bullish on Ethereum for the long haul. But not so much in the short term. It will take time to deal with the ramifications of Shanghai, especially if there is a short-term price dump. Any price volatility could panic investors if it lasts too long. And it will take time to push through all the really big blockchain innovations that are the keys to Ethereum ultimately boosting its transaction processing rate and lowering its transaction fees.\n\nA more realistic price target, in my opinion, is $3,000. Ethereum last hit this price a year ago in April 2022. Based on today's prices, that represents a gain of more than 50%. If and when Ethereum ever hits that target, that's when investors can have a discussion about a $10,000 price target."

        "content": "The price of ether rallied above $2,000 Thursday for the first time in eight months, after investors put uncertainty surrounding the long-awaited Shanghai upgrade behind them.\n\nEther advanced more than 10% to as high as $2,130.30, its highest level since May 2022. It's on pace for a 13% weekly gain. Bitcoin gained about 3% to reclaim the $30,000, rising as high as $30,928.16, its highest level since June. It's on track to finish the week up more than 9%.\n\nAfter a two-year lock up period, Ethereum staking withdrawals were enabled by the Shanghai upgrade around 6:30 p.m. ET on April 12.\n\nInvestors were optimistic but cautious in the weeks leading up to Shanghai, also known as \"Shapella.\" While many agree the upgrade is good for Ethereum in the long-term \u2013 because it allows more liquidity to ether investors and stakers which could also be a catalyst for a change in institutional participation \u2013 there was more uncertainty around how it would affect the price the week of.\n\nBoth cryptocurrencies jumped in the earlier hours of Thursday morning and got another push higher with the release of the March producer price index.

Source: TradingView\n\nTo recap: The Shanghai hard fork, also known as \u201cShapella,\u201d enables users to withdraw their ETH from Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake smart contract.\n\nAs of 9:00 am UTC on April 13, over 98,000 ETH worth around $194.8 million has left Ethereum\u2019s voting balance reserves since the Shanghai launch a day ago, according to Nansen. In other words, nearly $200 million in potential selling pressure has entered the market.\n\nETH deposits vs. withdrawals. Source: Nansen\n\nBut Ether\u2019s price rise since Shanghai suggests that the market has had no problem absorbing any selling pressure arising from this event so far. It\u2019s also possible that most users have decided to hold onto their ETH staking rewards rather than sell them in anticipation of further gains.\n\nAbout 15% of Ethereum\u2019s total supply in circulation, nearly 120.4 million ETH, is currently staked.\n\nInterestingly, more than 70% of the ETH staked is still underwater compared to current price levels, according to data gathered by Dune Analytics. This reduces the possibility of a sell-off in the near term from Shanghai\u2019s staking withdrawals.\n\nEthereum price risks 10% correction\n\nThe ongoing run-up in the Ethereum market has left ETH/USD slightly overbought, raising the likelihood of a short-term price correction this month.\n\nRelated: When levees break, liquidity flows \u2014 Analyzing Ethereum Shapella and liquidity staking derivatives\n\nNotably, ETH\u2019s daily relative strength index (RSI) is merely two points below its overbought threshold of 70.

        "title": "Ethereum Shanghai Update Goes Live as ETH Price Eyes $2,000 - CoinCodex",
        "content": "The Shanghai update is a hard fork for the Ethereum network that deployed on the mainnet on April 12, 2023. It has unlocked over $34 billion worth of ETH deposited on the Beacon Chain, allowing validators to withdraw their funds.\n\nAs of writing this article, there is $34 billion worth of ETH in the Beacon Deposit Contract (about 15% of Ethereum\u2019s entire circulating supply), which could have massive implications for the price of Ethereum should a large part of the funds be sold.\n\nIn this article, we are going to discuss how the sudden influx of newly released liquidity could impact Ethereum\u2019s price and examine what are the technical aspects of the Shanghai update.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Shanghai update key takeaways:\n\nThe Shanghai update for Ethereum launched on April 12, unlocking staked Ether (ETH) withdrawals from the Beacon Chain.\n\nThe price of Ethereum jumped over 3% in the hours post update, reaching an 8-month high price point of $1,990.\n\nThere is currently over $34 billion worth of Ether staked in the deposit contract, prompting concerns about what could happen to ETH\u2019s price if they find their way on exchanges.\n\nAbout 15,000 validators have already requested their ETH to be withdrawn and are currently in the exit queue. In other words, 480,000 ETH (about $1 billion at current prices) will be withdrawn from the deposit contract in the upcoming days.\n\nIn addition to unlocking staked ETH, the Shanghai upgrade has integrated several other EIPs designed to enhance the performance of the Ethereum network.\n\nIn recent months, Shapella has become the favorite name for the upcoming hard fork among the devs. It is a combination of Shanghai (the name of the upgrade of the execution layer) and Capella (the simultaneous upgrade of the consensus layer).\n\nWhat is the Shanghai update?\n\nThe Shanghai update is a hard fork for Ethereum that has, among other things, unlocked ETH deposited on the Beacon Chain, a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain that launched in late 2020. The Beacon Chain can be thought of as the backbone of the Ethereum network, providing the consensus layer necessary for the Ethereum protocol to operate as a PoS system.\n\nThe ability for validators to withdraw their ETH is just one of the improvements that went live with the Shanghai update \u2013 here\u2019s the entire overview of EIPs (Ethereum Improvement Proposals) that have been implemented as a part of the Shanghai update:\n\nEIP-3651 \u2013 Change the \u201cCOINBASE\u201d address to start as warm at the start of transaction execution to lower the gas cost.\n\n\u2013 Change the \u201cCOINBASE\u201d address to start as warm at the start of transaction execution to lower the gas cost.

EIP-6049 \u2013 Deprecate the use of the \u201cSELFDESTRUCT\u201d command due to a breaking change planned to this feature in the future.\n\nThe implications of staked ETH withdrawals\n\nMore than 18 million ETH (worth over $34 billion at the time of writing) has been deposited in the Ethereum staking contract since its 2020 launch. Source\n\nWith the launch of the Shanghai update, about $34 billion that has been locked on the Beacon Chain over the years has been unlocked. The first Ethereum validators deposited their funds on the Beacon Chain in December 2020, when Ethereum was trading at around $600.\n\nSince Ether is currently trading about 3 times higher, it is not unreasonable to assume that early ETH stakers might be looking to sell their staked funds for a profit. This could introduce massive selling pressure and decrease the price of ETH.\n\nAbout 480,000 ETH, worth close to $1 billion at the current market rates, have been requested for withdrawal on the first day after the mainnet update. Source\n\nIn fact, over 15,000 validators (480,000 ETH in total) have already requested their funds to be unstaked and are currently in the exit queue, according to data from Parsec.\n\nStaked ETH Withdrawal Limit: A maximum of 1350 validators (with 32 ETH per validator) per day will be able to withdraw their staked Ethereum, which amounts to about 0.2% of all staked assets. This should significantly reduce the potential impact of withdrawals on ETH price and ensure a sufficient number of validators is always available to support the network\u2019s uninterrupted operations.\n\nOn the other hand, validators not having their funds locked on the Ethereum blockchain might actually increase the demand for ETH. The reason for this is that many Ethereum holders might find staking Ethereum more attractive post-Shanghai, since their funds won\u2019t get locked and will be freely available for withdrawal.\n\nIn the long run, Shanghai could improve Ethereum\u2019s investment prospects and increase the number of users participating in securing the network by staking their coins. The end result would be a more robust proof of stake consensus and, subsequently, a more secure smart contract platform as a whole.\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between Shanghai, Capella, and Shapella?\n\nFor the longest time, the upgrade meant to bring staked Ethereum withdrawals was referred to as the \u201cShanghai\u201d update. However, in recent months, some other names started to emerge related to the upgrade \u2013 such as \u201cCapella\u201d and \u201cShappella\u201d \u2013 causing some confusion among Ethereum users.\n\nThe Shanghai update has different names depending on where it is implemented \u2013 either the execution or the consensus layer. Here\u2019s how that works:\n\nShanghai is the name of the upgrade on Ethereum\u2019s execution layer.\n\nis the name of the upgrade on Ethereum\u2019s execution layer. Capella is the name of the Shanghai upgrade on the consensus layer.\n\nis the name of the Shanghai upgrade on the consensus layer. Shapella is basically the combination of Shanghai and Capella, meant to describe the upgrade across both the execution and consensus layers.\n\nWhen did the Shanghai update launch?\n\nThe Shanghai update launched on April 12, 2023, at 6:27 PM ET. In terms of blockchain data, the upgrade was deployed on the mainnet at block height 6209536.\n\nInitially, the update was set to launch in March 2023, but the release date back got delayed. It is worth noting that the upgrade has previously been successfully implemented on Ethereum testnets \u2013 on the 28th of February on Sepolia, and on the 14th of March on Goerli.\n\nEthereum Shanghai upgrade price prediction: A bounce back to a new ATH?\n\nEthereum is predicted to nearly double its previous ATH and surpass $9,000 in early 2024.\n\nAccording to our algorithmically generated Ethereum price prediction, the price of Ethereum could see notably positive price activity over the next 12 months and reach as high as $9,400 in April 2024. The road there could be bumpy, however.\n\nThe algorithm predicts the price of ETH to first increase to $2,500 in May, and then drop to $1,050 in the next 3 months. After that, a massive rally could commence that could see Ethereum nearly double its previous all-time high.\n\nThe bottom line: Shanghai update is ushering in a new era for Ethereum\n\nLast year, the historic Merge upgrade saw Ethereum transition to a proof of stake consensus mechanism, reducing the power expenditure of Ethereum by over 99%. This year, the Shanghai update has taken Ethereum a step further, enabling validators to withdraw their ETH, which could turn out to be a major turning point for Ethereum\u2019s price in the long term.\n\nThe Shanghai update has earned Ethereum the top spot on our weekly-updated list of best cryptocurrencies to buy and the number one ranking in our selection of best altcoins to invest in."

        "content": "Ethereum core developers met for their first group call since the activation of the Shanghai-Capella fork on Thursday to prepare for the next phase of the network\u2019s evolution.\n\nTim Beiko, who runs protocol meetings for Ethereum, briefly congratulated the assembled devs before getting down to business.\n\n\u201cGreat work everyone on Shapella \u2014 it worked,\u201d Beiko said.\n\nBut there was one issue of consequence: A bug in the main execution client Prysm, related to MEV-Boost, caused validators to fail to propose blocks \u2014 a crucial part of the normal functioning of the blockchain.\n\nThe Prysm team issued a post-mortem analysis on Friday, identifying the root cause as a missing field during the \u201cunblinding\u201d of the \u201cbuilder blinded block.\u201d\n\nIn the post-Merge Ethereum blockchain, the \u201cbuilder blinded block\u201d is a type of block that has been processed by a tool called the \u201cbuilder\u201d to hide certain information. \u201cUnblinding\u201d this block refers to the process of revealing the hidden information using a cryptographic technique. The missing field \u2014 BlsToExecutionChanges \u2014 was supposed to be populated during this process, but it was not, which caused the issue.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s safe to say that most of the missed blocks were due to this bug,\u201d pseudonymous Prysm developer Potuz told his colleagues on the Thursday call.\n\nThis bug was difficult to detect when Shapella was activated on testnets, like Goerli.\n\nLuckily, a \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d triggered early on, and relayer teams reacted quickly to temporarily disable Prysm support from most relayers, preventing the issue from having a wider impact on network operation.\n\nHowever, the incident highlighted several lessons learned, including the need for more comprehensive testing, and closer collaboration with other teams, such as Flashbots.\n\n\u201cWe should set up a way that all of our coding is oriented towards testing the builder,\u201d Potuz said. \u201cThis is a ridiculous bug that should not have happened at all. There\u2019s many places where this should have been tested, and all of them failed at the same time. This is impressive.\u201d\n\nA retrospective analysis of the Goerli testnet discovered evidence of the bug there, but the effect was not significant enough in the test environment to attract developer attention, the Prysm team explained on the call.\n\nAround 40% of the Ethereum network nodes run Prysm software, but that percentage has been gradually shrinking as the Ethereum community recognized the need for client diversity. Other clients, Lighthouse, Teku, Nimbus and Lodestar picked up the slack to keep the chain running.\n\nWith Shapella safely in the rear view mirror, developers can now turn their full attention to the next major upgrade, known as Cancun-Deneb, or \u201cDencun\u201d for short. Cancun, Mexico, was the site of the Devcon 3 conference, in 2017, and Deneb is a star in constellation Cygnus, the swan and a vertex of the Summer Triangle.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Ethereum has either fully or partially processed nearly 300,000 ETH ($617 million) in staking withdrawals since Shapella went live Wednesday.\n\nAlmost 5,600 validators have completely unstaked their ETH in that time, representing 1% of the network\u2019s entire set.\n\nAn additional 17,500 validators are currently waiting in the withdrawal queue, as of midday ET. The combined stake of those exiting validators represents a minimum of about 563,000 ETH ($1.16 billion).\n\nPost-Shapella, Ethereum caps the number of validator withdrawals per day at 1,800, so the current queue should be cleared in 10 days, although more are expected to join.\n\nRead more: Stakers, Don\u2019t Let the Shanghai Upgrade Centralize Ethereum\n\nThere are still more than 563,000 active Ethereum validators, so the outflows won\u2019t make a dent in the network\u2019s overall security. More relevant is how validator outflows are changing ETH\u2019s liquid supply.\n\nThe total number of ETH staked has fallen 0.76% since Shapella went live, per Blockworks Research, which means 137,600 ETH ($283.3 million) in additional liquid tokens.\n\nCoinGecko reports $16.8 billion in ETH trade over the past 24 hours \u2014 vastly more than what\u2019s been unstaked so far.\n\nAs for the validators that have already completely exited, crypto exchange Kraken is responsible for 41%, according to Rated Network\u2019s explorer.\n\nThose unlocks were potentially inspired by the firm\u2019s SEC settlement from February, which demanded it cease offering staking-as-a-service products, including those related to Ethereum.\n\nThere are fresh ETH deposits flowing into the Beacon Chain\n\nHuobi and self-styled \u201cautomated wealth creation community\u201d PieDAO come in second and third for validator exits, with 23% and 13% of the recent set, respectively.\n\nHowever, fresh validators are coming in. As of midday ET, users have staked close to 162,300 ETH ($333 million) in the Beacon Chain since Shapella, according to Blockworks Research data, equal to as many as around 5,100 new validator nodes.\n\nSome speculated that ETH would tank under selling pressure from newly unstaked validators. The earliest stakers locked their tokens in the Beacon Chain back in November 2020 \u2014 when ETH was worth $700.\n\nETH\u2019s price is now worth triple, currently trading for just under $2,100. ETH went for as much as $4,600 last November, at the peak of the last bull run.\n\nBut, as it turns out, the market has easily absorbed validator liquidations so far, now up 9% since withdrawals were activated.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

This makes these assets critical for creating and maintaining ETH liquidity (as well as part of the validation process). However, actual ETH has generally traded above the price of particular LSDs, in a similar way that you often see price discrepancy between a managed investment trust and its underlying assets (due to increased risk and fees)."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has surged by over 80% in 2023. Ethereum (ETH-USD) is up by more than 65% over the same span after completing its Shanghai upgrade this week. But according to one trader, choosing where to invest shouldn't come down to picking one over the other.\n\n\"Wolf of All Streets\" podcast host Scott Melker describes Bitcoin as \"digital gold\" and Ethereum as more of a technological investment. \"I think you can love one, love both, and it's totally fine,\" Melker says. \"You don't have to really choose. I think they're separate asset classes and should be viewed as such.\"\n\nBe sure to watch Rachelle Akuffo's full interview with Melker here.\n\nKEY VIDEO MOMENTS:\n\n0:13 Melker's take on Ethereum's Shanghai upgrade.\n\n1:20 Melker breaks down the Bitcoin vs. Ethereum debate\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: And I want to talk Ethereum as well, the Shanghai upgrade. Because obviously, we're seeing at least today, Ethereum off to the races here versus Bitcoin. I mean, up about almost 6% on the day. What are your takeaways from that? Obviously, a lot of excitement surrounding this.\n\nSCOTT MELKER: Yeah, there was a bit of a nonsensical narrative that everybody who had staked their Ethereum for the past few years was going to try to withdraw all at once, which you couldn't do anyways, and sell all their Ethereum. But you have to remember that anyone who staked their 30 to Ethereum, which by the way, for most people, was over $60,000. But anyone who staked that 30 to Ethereum had no guarantee they would even be able to withdraw.\n\nThese are the people who are the biggest believers, the maximalists of Ethereum, who really wanted to help secure the network. So now that they're getting the opportunity to withdraw, they're going to continue staking. I think there were more people. And I can speak to this anecdotally from fund managers that I speak to in institutions.\n\nThere are a lot more people who are actually waiting to deposit because they would then know that they would be able to withdraw at some point. So we're actually seeing net inflows over the past 24 hours. It's going back and forth. But there has not been a huge demand for people to withdraw. And there are just as many people putting their money into the contract. I think that this is a huge development for Ethereum. Yet another major step in the right direction for the protocol.\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: And do you think perhaps investors are more bullish on Ethereum given the use cases versus Bitcoin?\n\nSCOTT MELKER: I view them as completely separate assets. I think that the flipping narrative is completely irrelevant. I view Bitcoin as a digital gold, store of value, flight to safety. And we've obviously seen that, especially, with the banking collapses a few months ago, and Bitcoin rise a few weeks ago. With Bitcoin rising from roughly 19,000 to over $30,000, Ethereum is more of a technological investment. It's a internet of value. And I think that we're starting to see that separation in people's minds. So I think you can love one, love both, and it's totally fine. You don't have to really choose. I think that they're separate asset classes and should be viewed as such."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s long-anticipated Shanghai and Capella upgrades were activated on April 12, and the total withdrawals in the first 40 hours following stood at 142,425 Ether (ETH), per Nansen data. This falls in line with previous estimates.\n\nFor a brief moment on April 12, when Shapella was activated, the deposits to ETH staking contracts outpaced withdrawals. However, deposits have slowed down come April 13, while withdrawals are going strong.\n\nETH moved for withdrawals\n\nValidators are required to update their staking software clients with withdrawal credentials changed to 0x01 from 0x00 and point to a valid Ethereum address. Once validators do that, partial withdrawals \u2014i.e., withdrawals of rewards above 32 ETH \u2014 will be processed automatically.\n\nAt the time of writing, 70.1% of validators have changed to 0x01, with 407,851.20, worth over $850 million, set for withdrawal.\n\nAdditionally, 875,325 ETH (worth $1.85 billion) is waiting for full exit. Adding to the amount already processed in the first 40 hours, over 1.42 million ETH will be withdrawn from the staking contract.\n\nETH withdrawals will be rate limited to 1,800 validators per day, translating to a daily withdrawal of 57,600 ETH per day based on 32 ETH per validator. With 875,325 ETH waiting for full exit, it corresponds to potential daily selling pressure of between $120 million.\n\nValidators moving to withdraw their ETH. Source: Nansen\n\nIn the first three days, when partial withdrawals will be processed as well, the total daily withdrawals will be 136,000 ETH and 173,000 ETH per day.\n\nHowever, the above statistics must be taken with a grain of salt because 62.8% are forced withdrawals from the U.S.-based crypto exchange Kraken in response to a $30 million settlement with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission to discontinue staking services.\n\nThere is a chance that a significant portion of Kraken withdrawals will move to decentralized liquid staking platforms like Lido, Frax and Rocket Pool instead of being sold on the market.\n\nBreakdown of ETH waiting for withdrawals by entities. Source: Nansen\n\nInterestingly, Lido accounts for 56.07% of the withdrawals processed so far, which is slightly concerning, as previous estimates suggested that withdrawals from liquid staking derivative platforms like Lido would be minimal.\n\nCurrently, 9.6 million staked ETH is in profit, which will remain most vulnerable to a sell-off. It also remains to be seen if more illiquid stakers will move to withdraw their ETH, as they represent over 34% of the 17.4 million ETH deposited in total.\n\nEther price analysis\n\nTechnically, the ETH/USD pair looks bullish, having broken above the $2,000 resistance level. Buyers will look to target the support and resistance levels around $2,300 and the May 2022 breakdown levels at around $2,900. Short-term support to the downside lies at around $1,725.\n\nETH/USD daily price chart.

Usually, neutral positioning of the perpetual market after a major price surge means that traders are not yet excited with the present rally, which is represented by a spike in positive funding rates. It also allows more upside room for prices.\n\nETH perpetual futures funding rate.

        "content": "The much-awaited Shapella update on Ethereum has gone live, paving the way for new features like the unstaking of Ether (ETH). Community members celebrated with various responses to the newest update to the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nShapella is a term the community uses that blends together \u201cShanghai\u201d and \u201cCapella,\u201d the upgrades that happened simultaneously. The hard fork is an important milestone on Ethereum\u2019s roadmap, leaving a lot of community members excited for the network\u2019s future.\n\nMany members of the community offered their congratulations to the developers of the network. Ethereum Foundation researcher Danny Ryan said that while proof-of-stake (PoS) took some time, the loop was finally complete.\n\nAt the Shapella watch party hosted by the Ethereum Foundation team, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin said that the network is now in a \u201creally good place.\u201d He explained that:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a stage where the hardest and the fastest parts of the Ethereum protocol\u2019s transition are basically over. Very significant things still need to be done, but those can be done at a slower pace.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, crypto singer Jonathan Mann celebrated the new update with another song performance at the Shapella watch party.\n\nCan we make this image a meme? pic.twitter.com/vC2pwKkLXd \u2014 songadaymann.lens (@songadaymann) April 12, 2023\n\nWhile some celebrated the event, others looked forward to the network\u2019s future. Ethereum community member Anthony Sassano reminded the community that the next major feature would be EIP-4844, which aims to enhance the scalability of rollups on Ethereum.\n\nRelated: Ethereum price turns bullish ahead of next week\u2019s Shanghai and Capella upgrades\n\nMeanwhile, blockchain analytics firm Glassnode expects that even though the Shapella update will unlock staked ETH, less than 1% are planning to sell. The analytics company said that only 253 validators had signed up to exit. Apart from this, there are also mechanisms in place to prevent a massive flood of ETH supply from being dumped in the markets at the same time.\n\nOne of the expected effects of the Shapella update is the onboarding of more institutional investors to Ethereum. Freddy Zwanzger, Ethereum ecosystem lead at Blockdaemon, foresees that there may be more interest in ETH staking opportunities from larger investors since there\u2019s a clear withdrawal option in place now.\n\nMagazine: \u2018Account abstraction\u2019 supercharges Ethereum wallets: Dummies guide"

        "content": "Kraken has registered to withdraw 556,272 Ether worth about US$1.17 billion, the largest amount since the Ethereum blockchain\u2019s Shanghai upgrade on Wednesday this week to allow such withdrawals.\n\nKraken accounted for 63.3% of all staked Ether in the queue for withdrawal as of 1:30 p.m. on Friday in Hong Kong, according to data from blockchain data tracker Nansen.\n\nThe withdrawals by Kraken come after the SEC in February fined the exchange US$30 million for failing to register staking programs and forced it to shut down its staking services for U.S. users.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of expected that certain centralized exchanges are initiating withdrawals. That includes Kraken,\u201d Zhuling Chen, chief executive officer of crypto staking service provider RockX, said in an interview on Thursday.\n\nKraken did not respond to two emails from Forkast requesting comment.\n\nThe main feature of Ethereum\u2019s upgrade is allowing users known as validators to withdraw their staked Ether. Such tokens were deposited to support the operations of the Ethereum blockchain, the world\u2019s second-biggest, in return for a passive income, usually in the form of more tokens. As many as 115,200 withdrawals can be processed a day, according to the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nCoinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the U.S., has initiated withdrawal requests of 94,749 Ether, which accounted for 10.8% of the total in the queue, the Nansen data showed. Crypto exchange Huobi has requested withdrawals of 45,072 Ether \u2013 about 5.1% of the total in the queue.\n\n\u201cOther than [centralized exchanges], we have not seen a huge volume of withdrawals,\u201d said Chen. He added that in tandem with the exits, there\u2019s a \u201csteady inflow of staked Ether.\u201d\n\nAbout 107,790 Ether have been staked since the upgrade, while 249,270 Ether have been withdrawn as of 1:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, according to data from Token Unlocks. More than 1 million Ether are in the queue for withdrawal, the data showed.\n\nWith around 18 million Ether (US$34.5 billion) \u2013 or about 15% of the total supply \u2013 staked into the network, according to Etherscan, concerns emerged earlier that holders could rush to withdraw and cash in the token.\n\nBut on-chain data provider CryptoQuant said in a report in February it didn\u2019t expect a flood of Ether sales.\n\n\u201cWe argue that there would be low selling pressure for Ether from staking withdrawals after the Shanghai upgrade,\u201d CryptoQuant said, adding that the majority of the staked Ether was still holding losses compared to Ether prices when it was staked. Ether reached all time highs of more than US$4,600 in November 2021.\n\n\u201cTypically, selling pressure emerges when market participants are sitting on extreme profits, which is not the case right now for the Ether that has been staked,\u201d CryptoQuant said.\n\nThat view seems to be supported in the market. Ether\u2019s price rose 10.54% in the past 24 hours to change hands at US$2,119 and breach the US$2,000 ceiling for the first time since August last year, according to CoinMarketCap data. The token has risen 77% so far this year.\n\nCryptoQuant also pointed out that the currently locked Ether cannot be withdrawn simultaneously, estimating it may take up to a year to withdraw the total value staked in the network.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade is a significant milestone in Ethereum history, as it \u201celiminates the biggest counterparty risk,\u201d Chen said.\n\n\u201cIn the past, you\u2019re basically sending your ETH into a black hole and you\u2019re hoping that [for] indefinite time you can get your ETH back together with the rewards,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now actually this promise has been delivered.\u201d"

The Bitcoin (BTC) rival has seen a 4% increase over the past 24 hours. It is currently trading at $2,004 on the Bitstamp exchange.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImage by tradingview.com\n\nSeveral key factors have contributed to this remarkable rise, renewing investor interest in the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nFirst, the successful launch of Shapella, Ethereum's first major upgrade since The Merge, has played a significant role in the price surge. Shapella enables validators to withdraw their staked Ether (ETH). Notably, the chief altcoin has defied market expectations of increased selling pressure.\n\nSecond, recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) revealed that the Producer Price Index (PPI) for final demand declined by 0.5% in March. This drop in inflation, which surpassed the estimated 0.1% and the previous month's -0.1%, has potentially influenced the ETH rally.\n\nPantheon Macroeconomics, a U.K.-based economic research consultancy, recently predicted that good PPI numbers could prevent another Federal Reserve rate hike, which could potentially bode well for risk assets."

ETH price spiked by 13%, while BTC price jumped by 10%.\n\nCrypto Analyst, Credible Crypto suggested that Ethereum price might take a hit in the short term, while it is safe to with Bitcoin under this phase. It is important to note that when Bitcoin lead, altcoins follow. As the ETH price broke out through the $2.1K level shortly after breaching the crucial $2K level, implies ETH strength.

Cryptos like Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) price are up by 14% and 21%, respectively.\n\nIt is important to note that ETH price jump is quite weak compared to the Bitcoin surge as market participants didn\u2019t buy Ethereum anticipating a drop after the update. Meanwhile, the amount of unstaking turned out to be much less the expected and ETH price registered a surge. ETH price is up by over 5% in the last 24 hours. It is trading at an average price of $2,115, at the press time."

The launch of EOS EVM aims to bridge this gap. The team is planning to do this by combining the resources of the Ethereum community with the performance of the EOS Network offers.\n\nYves La Rose, the founder and CEO of the EOS Network Foundation, said that this was a very important milestone for the network and paves the way for an interoperable future. \u201cEOS EVM is a significant milestone and represents our commitment to a multi-chain future,\u201d La Rose explained.\n\nLa Rose also said that this allows developers to have access to lower fees and faster transactions of the EOS network offers.\n\nRelated: When levees break, liquidity flows \u2014 Analyzing Ethereum Shapella and liquidity staking derivatives\n\nAs the Ethereum network expects more adoption after the most recent Shapella upgrade, projects have been prioritizing the implementation of EVM compatibility within their networks. On April 3, Astar Network launched smart contracts that supported two virtual machines, including EVM and the WebAssembly Virtual Machine. Astar Network founder Sota Watanabe said that this would allow the creation of new multichain applications within their network.\n\nMeanwhile, the beta version of Polygon\u2019s zkEVM, a zero-knowledge rollup scaling solution, was released on March 27. This technology mimics the transaction execution environment of the Ethereum mainnet. According to Polygon, this will allow DApps to scale with higher performance.\n\nMagazine: \u2018Account abstraction\u2019 supercharges Ethereum wallets: Dummies guide"

ETH ballooned to become the world\u2019s largest altcoin cryptocurrency only second to Bitcoin in market cap. During its launch, ETH was trading at $0.42 but quickly jumped to $0.74 before investors got wind of the asset. The relatively new crypto was affordable giving investors ample time and opportunity to accumulate it every month in 2015.\n\nHowever, things turned when it crossed the $2 mark in January 2016 and skyrocketed in price thereafter. Early entrants made millions with ETH by buying low and selling high.

        "content": "New York, NY - (NewMediaWire) - April 14, 2023 - Ethereum-based RIPPLEREUM Coin is proud to announce its listing on the Uniswap exchange on April 17. Uniswap is an Ethereum-based decentralized exchange that supports swaps between Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens. Unlike existing centralized exchanges, decentralized exchanges do not have an order book, and numerous liquidity providers deposit Ethereum or ERC-20 tokens in a 'liquidity pool' to provide transaction liquidity.\n\nGyeongmin Kim, CMO of RIPPLEREUM, said, \"On the RIPPLEREUM platform, users can register various types of cards they have on and off-line 'RIPPLEREM (RPRM) Smart Card', and with one RIPPLEREUM smart card, they can expand and use the app ecosystem.\"\n\nThe ultimate goal of the RIPPLEREUM project is to build a smart card that can be used more conveniently in real life by building a network that enables fast remittance through business modeling of Ripple.\n\nThe RPRM Card Wallet, which will be supported in the future, will be expanded and developed in a hybrid form to enable services such as payment, exchange, remittance, and withdrawal operated and managed under the principle of free market transaction of legal currency and cryptocurrency through the RPRM Payment Platform Gateway.\n\nIn addition, RPRM Payment will first apply closed blockchain-based operation and FIDO security to protect personal information and prevent forgery/falsification of data, and store and manage transaction contents without loss. Through technological advancement, RPRM Payment Platform for all members and consumer-oriented smart card system is established through smart cards based on a new payment platform called RPRM. In addition, we are trying to decentralize by converting to an open block chain, such as introducing a policy voting system, and preparing to issue a service-type card for transportation and living convenience and a multi-function card.\"\n\n\"We are very excited to announce the RIPPLEREUM token to users around the world through the Uniswap Exchange listing on April 17th,\" he said, adding that he is continuously pushing for listing on other cryptocurrency exchanges since the listing on the Uniswap exchange.\n\nStory continues\n\nSocial Links\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Ripplereum_RPRM\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/ripplereum_rprm\n\nMedia Contact\n\nBrand: Ripplereum\n\nContact: Gyeongmin Kim\n\nE-Mail: rprm@ripplereum.io\n\nWebsite: http://ripplereum.io\n\nSOURCE: Ripplereum"

        "content": "Principal Accounts for Less than 5% of Withdrawals a Day After Shapella\n\nBy: Aleksandar Gilbert \u2022 Loading...\n\nDeFi News\n\nStakers are sticking around.\n\nIn the day since Ethereum\u2019s long-awaited \u201cShapella\u201d upgrade, people and entities that have staked Ether have largely withdrawn rewards accrued from their staking, rather than their principal.\n\nMore than 95% of withdrawals \u2014 more than 172,000 Ether \u2014 were staking rewards, according to TokenUnlocks. The remaining 5% was users\u2019 original stake, meaning those users had exited staking entirely and would no longer participate in Ethereum\u2019s consensus mechanism, the method it uses to order and confirm transactions.\n\nETH withdrawals over time. Source: Token Unlocks\n\nEthereum stakers are signaling most will continue participating in the network, even if they\u2019re free to leave. Whether they stick around impacts Ethereum security, which is maintained by ETH deposits, and Eth price, which would come under pressure if all participants rushed to sell their stake.\n\nBut that could change.\n\nKraken Stakers\n\nThere are limits on the amount of Ether that can be withdrawn each day, and users and entities that would like to withdraw their principal have been placed in a queue.\n\nOf the 833,000-plus Ether locked in the queue, almost two-thirds belong to Kraken, according to crypto data provider Nansen. The company bowed to pressure from the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this year and agreed to cease offering its staking product in the U.S.\n\nThe Ether in the queue amounts to more than 4% of the 19.1M Ether eligible for withdrawal, a figure that includes staking rewards.\n\nDeFi Alpha Premium Content DeFi Daily | Weekdays\n\nDeFi Alpha Letter | Weekly\n\nDefiant Podcast Transcript | Weekly\n\nInbox Dump | Saturday\n\nWeekly Recap | Sunday Looking for Alpha? Become a premium member of The Defiant and join our DeFi Alpha community. Start for free\n\nThe Merge\n\nWhen Ethereum underwent an upgrade called \u201cthe Merge\u201d last year, it changed its consensus mechanism, swapping the energy-intensive Proof-of-Work with a Proof-of-Stake blockchain that had been running in parallel since December 2020. Proof-of-Stake requires that users who contribute to Ethereum\u2019s consensus post 32 Ether as collateral, collateral that is seized in the event they misbehave.\n\nBut that collateral, or stake, could only be deposited, not withdrawn \u2014 until the Shapella upgrade went live on Wednesday.\n\nThe effect the upgrade would have on Ethereum and the price of Ether was hotly debated in recent months. On the day after the upgrade, Ether topped $2,000 for the first time since May 2022, just before the collapse of DeFi protocol Terra.\n\nWithdrawals Top Deposits\n\nMeanwhile, withdrawals have topped deposits by a small margin, with the amount of staked Ether falling by about 120,000 Ether, or 0.6%, according to Nansen.\n\nEth deposits vs. withdrawals. Source: Nansen\n\nDespite the recent rally, more than 70% of people who staked Ether are still underwater, according to Hildobby, a pseudonymous data analyst for crypto venture capital firm Dragonfly. That means most staked Ether is worth less today that it was when it was staked.\n\nThe average price of Ether when it was staked is $2,136, according to Nansen.\n\nNevertheless, staking experts believe the benefit of enabling withdrawals will outweigh any sell pressure it might cause in the long-term.\n\n\u201cWhile some believe it\u2019ll lead to an increase in sell pressure, I see it the other way around: [Shapella] will strengthen the confidence market participants have in staking ETH to generate yield,\u201d Daniel Bar, the founder of Bitfwd Capital, previously told The Defiant."

Under the influence of this pattern coin prices usually narrow within two converging trendlines and offer a significant direction rally upon the breakout of the trendlines. Thus, today we will look for the same chart pattern in fellow altcoins and determine the potential growth as they follow one of the market leaders.\n\nBinance Coin(BNB)\n\nSource- Tradingview\n\nadvertisement\n\nFor over a year, the Binance coin price resonated between two converging trendlines showing the formation of a symmetrical triangle pattern. Traders have been actively responding to the pattern setup as evidenced by the coin price bouncing off the support trendline twice and the resistance trendline three times.\n\nBy the press, the BNB price trades at $322 and rechallenges the resistance trendline of the chart pattern. If the weekly candle breach above the downsloping trendline the buyers will obtain significant support to lead the coin price higher.\n\nIn a favorable bullish scenario, the BNB price could rally 80% to reach the $6000 mark.\n\nChainlink (LINK)\n\nSource- Tradingview\n\nOver the past eleven months, the chainlink coin price has wobbled within two horizontal levels $9.4 and $5.4, indicating an evident sideways trend. However, within this consolidation phase, the coin price narrowing within two converging trendlines indicates the formation of a symmetrical triangle.\n\nAs for now, the LINK price trades at $7.756 and retests the overhead resistance trendline of the chart pattern. A potential breakout from the aforementioned trendline with a weekly candle closing above offers an early sign of trend reversal.\n\nThis breakout could assist buyers to escape this consolidation phase and chase the $12 high.\n\nAlso Read: Top Crypto Copy Trading Platforms For 2023\n\nUniswap (UNI)\n\nSource- Tradingview\n\nIn the weekly time frame chart, the UNI/USD pair shows a simple structure of a symmetrical triangle pattern where the prices are getting squeezed with two converging trendlines. With the recent growth in the crypto market, the coin price has recently rebounded from the support trendline indicating a bull cycle with the chart pattern.\n\nCurrently, the UNI price trades at $6.3, and with sustained buyers, the price will rise 10% to challenge the overhead trendline. If the buyers manage to pierce the resistance trendline, the accelerated buying pressure would drive the coin 88% higher to hit the $13 mark."

        "content": "Bitcoin moved higher in the US$30,000 band in Friday morning trading in Asia amid strong gains among the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies. Ethereum led the winners following the blockchain\u2019s Shanghai hard fork this week, jumping almost 10% and breaching the US$2,000 mark for the first time since August 2022. U.S. equities rallied overnight on softer readings in the U.S. producer price index (PPI) and jobless claims, adding to optimism the Federal Reserve could soon end its year-long cycle of raising interest rates to curb inflation.\n\nSee related article: Musk\u2019s Twitter partners with eToro to offer crypto and stocks to users\n\nFast facts\n\nBitcoin rose 2.54% to US$30,769 in the 24 hours to 09:00 a.m. in Hong Kong to post a weekly gain of 9.47%, according to CoinMarketCap data. The leading cryptocurrency has gained 83% so far this year as it seemed to rediscover a role as a hedge against inflation and recession and looks set to test US$31,000 as it moved within a couple of hundred dollars of that ceiling in later morning trading in Asia.\n\nBitcoin also found support after the London Stock Exchange Group plc. on Thursday said it had partnered with GFO-X \u2013 the UK\u2019s first regulated and centrally cleared trading venue for digital asset derivatives \u2013 to provide the country\u2019s first trading and clearing services for Bitcoin index derivatives, according to Reuters on Friday.\n\nEthereum jumped 9.97% to US$2,100, adding 11.66% for the week after the network\u2019s Shanghai upgrade, which allows investors to withdraw their staked Ether for the first time. Etheruem holders have so far withdrawn around 215,000 staked Ether, while another 961,000 withdrawals are pending, according to data from Token Unlocks, which accounts for about 6% of the total staked Ether.\n\nEarlier speculation that the Shanghai upgrade may lead to a flood of selling and depress the price of the token isn\u2019t panning out, Chen Zhuling, co-founder and CEO of crypto staking platform RockX, said in an interview on Thursday. Even if Ether are unstaked, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that people are going to sell them, because they could also use it for other DeFi investments, he said.\n\nDogecoin jumped 6.25% to US$0.0885 to hold a weekly gain of 2.79%, after multi asset trading platform eToro announced on Thursday a partnership with Elon Musk\u2019s Twitter to enable cryptocurrency and stock trading on the world\u2019s leading social media platform.\n\nCardano rose 4.54% to US$0.4264, moving up 11.00% for the week. Cardano Foundation launched the alpha phase of Aiken on Thursday, an open-source smart contract language and toolchain that aims to simplify smart contract developments on the Cardano blockchain, according to the company.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization rose 3.85% in the past 24 hours to US$1.28 trillion. The total trading volume over the last 24 hours edged down 0.05% to US$48.58 billion.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index added 0.82% to 4,017.62 in the 24 hours to 09:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, moving up 0.32% for the week. The index is a proxy measure of the performance of the global NFT market and includes 500 eligible smart contracts on any given day. It is managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nU.S. equities closed higher on Thursday after economic data pointed to a slowdown in inflation. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1.14%, the S&P 500 moved up 1.33%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index rose 1.99%.\n\nU.S. PPI in March rose but at a 2.7% pace, or lower than the expected 3% to mark the smallest increase since January 2021, according to Reuters on Thursday. U.S. weekly jobless claims also pointed to a slowing economy with the figure of 239,000, higher than analysts\u2019 expectation of 235,000, according to a Bloomberg report.\n\nInvestor sentiment also got a lift from an unexpected surge in China exports in March, which jumped 14.8% from last year, well beyond the expectation of a 7% decrease, according to Reuters.\n\nU.S. interest rates are currently between 4.75% to 5%, the highest since June 2006, and analysts at the CME Group now see a 33.5% chance the Fed will not raise interest rates at its next meeting on May 3, while 66.5% predict a 25-basis-point rate hike, down from 70.4% on Thursday.\n\nU.S. stock futures traded mixed as of 9:00 a.m. in Hong Kong. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.09%. The S&P 500 futures gained 0.05%.

        "content": "Ethereum mainnet successfully completed the Shapella upgrade on April 12, meaning that Ethereum validators can finally withdraw their staked Ether on the Beacon Chain.\n\nA total of 126,955.07 ETH were withdrawn by validators at the time of writing. Presently, 248,043 out of the 559,549 active validators, or about 44% of them, have the ability to request a partial or full withdrawal. The majority of withdrawals currently vary between 2.8 to 3.2 ETH (ETH), indicating the majority of the validators are only withdrawing their staking rewards.\n\nTotal staked ETH withdrawal. Source: beaconcha.in\n\nThe average price of staked ETH is $3,149 and it could be another reason why validators are not withdrawing the whole amount. The ETH price is currently trading just under $2,000 with the price acting as key resistance.\n\nStaked ETH data and exchange holdings. Source: Nansen\n\nMajor crypto exchanges have announced their support for the ETH unstaking with several exchanges already processing withdrawal requests. Coinbase, the world\u2019s first publicly listed crypto exchange announced that ETH unstaking is now live on their platform.\n\nThe Shapella Upgrade is complete. Congratulations to the @Ethereum community! ETH unstaking is now enabled on https://t.co/bCG11KNnW0. https://t.co/JcTxAVphGZ \u2014 Coinbase (@coinbase) April 12, 2023\n\nBitGo chief operating officer Chen Fang took to Twitter to announce that the custodian has upgraded to Shapella successfully, and ETH withdrawals are now live on the platform.\n\nKraken, on the other hand, started withdrawing validators for their United States customers on April 11 and began processing withdrawals of ETH after the completion of the Shapella upgrade. The early withdrawal of validators by the exchange is caused by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission action brought against Kraken\u2019s Ethereum staking product back in February.\n\nFor clarity:\n\n\n\nValidators are currently able to exit but the associated 32 ETH stake and consensus layer rewards are not able to be withdrawn (aka moved around) until Shapella goes live in around 12 hours\n\n\n\nWhat Kraken is doing right now is exiting their validators \u2014 sassal.eth (@sassal0x) April 12, 2023\n\nRelated: Upcoming Shapella upgrade fuels liquid staking growth \u2014 AMA with Swell\n\nKraken Australia Managing Director Jonathon Miller told Cointelegraph that even though such a high quantity of ETH unstaking might cause some price volatility it will bring users to the ecosystem in the long run. He explained:\n\n\u201cWhilst this unlocking event may create conditions for an exodus from the staking protocol, the ability to freely stake and unstake (in accordance with bonding periods specified by the protocol) could equally attract many ETH holders. The move to unstaking could see a massive movement of assets into Ethereum staking pools.\u201d\n\nBinance, the leading crypto exchange by trading volume, said it would support the Shappela upgrade and start the withdrawal processing requests starting from April 19. The crypto exchange also added that the withdrawal request could take up to 15 days to process due to processing limitations.\n\n#Binance will support $ETH 2.0 Staking withdrawals starting from April 19, 08:00 UTC.\n\n\n\nDue to the processing limitations on the $ETH network, ETH withdrawal requests may take up to 15 days to several weeks to be fully processed.\n\n\n\nMore details here \u2935\ufe0fhttps://t.co/L3iyon58lo \u2014 Binance (@binance) April 13, 2023\n\nBitfinex, one of the leading crypto exchanges, congratulated the Ethereum community on the successful upgrade and said the ETH withdrawal details will be shared soon.\n\nMagazine: 2023 is a make-or-break year for blockchain gaming: Play-to-own"

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Pending For Withdrawal Rise Rapidly, Uptrend In Jeopardy? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "The long-awaited Shanghai and Capella update of Ethereum officially went live yesterday at 6:30 am EST. The hard fork has gone off without a hitch and is the first major upgrade to the protocol since \u201cThe Merge\u201d on September 15, 2022.\n\nFor the first time in over two years, stakers and validators are able to withdraw their staked ETH from the Beacon Chain. And contrary to some alarming fears, the ETH price has so far failed to plummet.\n\nThe Latest Numbers On Pending Ethereum Withdrawals\n\nAccording to token.unlocks, about two hours after the Ethereum upgrade, about 17,350 ETHs were withdrawn, and 128 ETH were deposited. The number of ETH waiting for withdrawal at that time was around 319,000 ETH (about $563 million).\n\nSince then, however, the number has increased significantly. As of press time, there were 704,416 ETH waiting to be withdrawn, according to data from Nansen. The total number of staked ETH on the Beacon Chain including rewards was 19,227,545 ETH. This means that about 3.6% of all staked ETH are currently waiting to be withdrawn.\n\nThe number of validators waiting for a full exit was 19,621, with the total number being 567,209 validators. The net outflow since the update was activated is -55,438 ETH.\n\nIt is worth noting that the average price of all stakers is $1,973, according to Nansen, which is just above the current price. ETH thus only needs to increase by 3% for the average staker to be in profit.\n\nAccording to on-chain analytics tools, Huobi ranks first with 27.5% of entities waiting to unwind their staked ETH, followed by others (19%), PieDAO (15.7%), Kraken (13.6%), and Heavy Dex Trader 0xa3d (10.1%).\n\nAccording to people familiar with the matter, the large number of ETH withdrawals on Huobi is mainly related to the transfer of new and old shareholders, as reported by Chinese journalist Colin Wu. After the withdrawal is completed, the former owner of Huobi, Li Lin, has to do a handover. \u201cSome ETH may be withdrawn and then deposited again.\u201d\n\nAccording to the official Ethereum website, no transaction fee is required for the withdrawals, as the withdrawals do not compete with the execution level block space. Moreover, the website states that a maximum of 16 withdrawals can be processed in a single block.\n\nThis means that 115,200 withdrawals will be processed by validators in a single day. Subsequently, Ethereum predicts that 400,000 withdrawals will take 3.5 days, 600,000 withdrawals will take 5.2 days, and 800,000 withdrawals will take 7 days.\n\nETH Price Trends Up\n\nThe current data suggests that there is no rush among investors to unstake ETH. Thus, fears about an ETH dump appear to be proving unwarranted. With the current numbers, the initial withdrawals could be fully settled in as little as a week. The impact on the price is likely to be rather marginal.\n\nAccordingly, the ETH price currently looks very bullish. At press time, ETH was trading at $1,921, eyeing a break above $2,000.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "As of February 2023, over 44.15 million unique addresses have a non-zero balance of Bitcoin (BTC). While this may seem impressive, let\u2019s face it \u2014 blockchain technology has come a long way since Bitcoin\u2019s inception in 2009.\n\nBitcoin addresses with a non-zero balance. Source: Glassnode\n\nHowever, as the technology continues to evolve and gain mainstream adoption, scalability remains one of the biggest challenges facing the industry. Bitcoin and Ethereum, two of the largest blockchain networks, are highly decentralized, with thousands of nodes operating on each network (17,553 nodes for Bitcoin and 7,099 nodes for Ethereum as of April 14, 2023).\n\nEthereum mainnet statistics. Source: Ethernodes\n\nWhile this decentralization provides greater security, it also results in slower transaction speeds and scalability issues due to the significant computational resources required to maintain the continuously growing sum of nodes.\n\nHence, the blockchain trilemma, coined by Vitalik Buterin, suggests that blockchains can only have two out of three properties: scalability, security and decentralization. As a result, this fundamental trade-off represents a significant barrier to the widespread adoption of blockchain technology.\n\nThere are two primary strategies that have been introduced to tackle the scalability challenge: layer-1 (L1) and layer-2 (L2) solutions. While L1 solutions seek to optimize the base layer of a blockchain, L2 solutions provide an additional layer on top of the base layer to facilitate faster and more affordable transactions. Needless to say, this has sparked an ongoing battle between the two approaches as each demonstrates unique strengths and weaknesses.\n\nLayer-1 blockchains\n\nLayer-1 blockchains, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, are designed to optimize the foundational layer of a blockchain protocol to increase transaction throughput and reduce fees. Their maximum capacity is often limited by network congestion and other factors, so L1 scaling solutions directly extend the blockchain protocol to improve scalability.\n\nA prominent example of this is the introduction of Ethereum 2.0 and the subsequent development of (dank) sharding. Sharding aims to increase Ethereum\u2019s transaction processing speed and reduce fees by splitting the network into smaller, more manageable shards. Each shard can then process transactions in parallel, significantly increasing the network\u2019s overall speed.\n\nLayer-2 blockchains\n\nLayer-2 blockchains, on the other hand, refer to a network or technology that operates on top of an underlying blockchain protocol with the aim to improve scalability too. The idea behind L2s is to shift transactions from the base layer blockchain to an adjacent system architecture that is able to process the majority of the data and then report back to the base blockchain to finalize the result.\n\nFor instance, Ethereum is a layer-1 network, and a number of layer-2 solutions have been built to improve transaction speeds on the Ethereum network, including Polygon (MATIC), Optimism (OP) and Arbitrum (ARB).\n\nThe battle\n\nUndoubtedly, the scalability battle has come to the forefront with recent developments in L1 and L2 blockchains. While this may be the case, understanding the differences between L1 and L2 blockchain networks is crucial to gain insight and distinguish the primary differences between both layers.\n\nArchitecture\n\nLayer-1 blockchains and layer-2 scaling solutions differ not only in their purpose but also in their fundamental design and architecture. L1 blockchains are designed to be self-sufficient, meaning that all the necessary layers for data availability, consensus, and execution are integrated into a single system. This design is intended to provide the security, decentralization, and immutability, that are the hallmarks of blockchain technology.\n\nIn contrast, layer-2 scaling solutions are designed to enhance the performance of L1 blockchains rather than operate as independent blockchains. Layer-2 scaling solutions use off-chain techniques such as state channels, nested blockchains, rollups and sidechains to process transactions faster and more efficiently. In this way, layer-2 scaling solutions can increase the transaction throughput of L1 blockchains without compromising their security and decentralization.\n\nScalability method\n\nAnother significant difference between L1 and L2 scaling solutions lies in their scalability methods. L1 blockchains depend on various techniques such as consensus mechanism changes, chain forking and sharding to boost their transaction throughput. While these methods can improve transaction speeds, they can also lead to network congestion, security risks and fragmentation. L2 scaling solutions, on the other hand, process transactions off-chain, allowing for increased speed and efficiency while still relying on the primary network for security and decentralization. This approach reduces the risk of network congestion, minimizes fragmentation and enhances the overall performance of the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nNakamoto coefficient \u2014 the main measure of decentralization\n\nThe Nakamoto coefficient is an important metric to consider when evaluating the level of decentralization in a blockchain network. It is crucial to consider the trade-off between scalability and decentralization when measuring up the difference between L1 and L2 solutions.\n\nOften, L1 solutions such as Near protocol (NEAR) or Solana (SOL) have a higher coefficient because they offer a high degree of decentralization due to their reliance on a large number of validators. On the other hand, L2 solutions such as Opside or zkSync could offer improved scalability through the use of off-chain processing, but in turn, would be less decentralized due to their reliance on a smaller set of validators.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nThe ongoing battle between L1 and L2 solutions has its fair share of pros and cons. While L1 blockchains offer superior security and decentralization, they suffer from scalability issues. In contrast, L2 solutions offer scalability and lower fees, but may come at the cost of compromising the security and decentralization of the underlying blockchain.\n\nEvidently, L2 solutions are not a \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d solution to the scalability challenge. They rely on the base layer\u2019s security and decentralization, and if the base is compromised, it could affect the very foundation of the layer-2 solutions in question.\n\nNeedless to say, as blockchain technology continues to mature, the outcome of this showdown will likely determine the path forward for scaling the technology to meet the demands of real-world applications. In the meantime, it is vital for both L1 and L2 solutions to work together to effectively address the scalability challenge.\n\nDigi516 has been a crypto researcher and NFT enthusiast for almost a decade, with experience in educating and managing several crypto communities.

        "title": "3 signs Arbitrum price is poised for a new record high in Q2 - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Arbitrum\u2019s ARB token has emerged as one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies following Ethereum\u2019s long-awaited Shanghai upgrade.\n\nNotably, ARB price gained 4.28% to hit $1.36 on April 13, its highest level in two weeks. This also amounts to 18% gains from its $1.15 low a day prior when the Shanghai upgrade enabled staking withdrawals on Ethereum.\n\nARB/USDT daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nTo summarize, Arbitrum is an Ethereum layer-2 (L2) scaling solution that aims to reduce network transaction congestion and transaction fees. As a result, the market typically perceives Ethereum\u2019s growth as a boon for L2 chains.\n\nHere are three reasons why ARB could continue its bull run in Q2 to retest its record high of $1.60.\n\nMore utility for ARB\n\nArbitrum generated $2.5 million in profits in March 2023 via sequencing, according to Messari.\n\nArbitrum financial performance in 2023. Source: Messari\n\nNotably, sequencer profits represent the difference in fee revenue generated by the L2 chain and the fee expense paid to the base L1 chain \u2014 all calculated in Ethereum\u2019s Ether (ETH) token, not ARB.\n\nThese profits will eventually go to Arbitrum\u2019s community-managed DAO, ArbitrumDAO, as it grows to become more decentralized in the future.\n\nSequencers can create maximal extractable value (MEV) by arranging users\u2019 transaction requests \u2014 a feature missing from Arbitrum.\n\nHowever, ArbitrumDAO may end up monetarizing MEV by auctioning off rights to produce blocks once they launch decentralized sequencing, asserted Kunal Goel, a researcher at Messari. This would open up opportunities for ARB as a staking token.\n\n\u201cThe DAO will likely enforce ARB staking for sequencers to economically align incentives and to allow for slashing in case of any misbehavior, similar to validators in Proof-of-Stake networks,\u201d noted Goel, adding:\n\n\u201cThis will add value to the token as users demand greater security from the protocol.\u201d\n\nCapturing Optimism\u2019s market share\n\nArbitrum has outperformed its top Ethereum L2 rival, Optimism, on almost all the key metrics throughout most of 2022 and 2023.\n\nFor instance, in 2022, Arbitrum generated $22 million in sequencer revenue and $6 million in profits. Meanwhile, Optimism made $18 million and $4 million in sequencer revenue and profits, respectively.\n\nSimilarly, the first quarter of 2023 saw Arbitrum outperforming Optimism\u2019s revenue by $4 million in revenue and $3 million in profits.\n\nArbitrum vs. Optimism key metrics. Source: Messari\n\nArbitrum also had a higher total value locked (TVL) through most of 2022 and 2023, with its dominance increasing further after the ARB airdrop in March.\n\nAs of April 13, Arbitrum's TVL was $2.27 billion compared with Optimism's $930 million.\n\nOptimism versus Arbitrum TVL. Source: Defi Llama\n\n\u201cAt current market prices, ARB trades at a discount to OP across all valuation multiples,\u201d Goel noted.\n\nARB price in descending triangle breakout\n\nThe ongoing run-up in Arbitrum price has broken above what appears to be a continuation pattern.\n\nRelated: ARB price to $2? Ethereum L2 rival Arbitrum will double in April, fractal suggests\n\nDubbed descending triangle, the pattern develops when the price consolidates between a falling trendline resistance and horizontal support. It resolves after the price breaks out of the range, pursuing the direction of its previous trend.\n\nARB entered a similar breakout stage on April 13 after rising above its triangle\u2019s upper trendline with convincing volumes.\n\nARB/USD four-hour price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe ARB/USD pair is now on a run up toward $1.60 in Q2, its best level to date, and up 20% from current price levels. This upside target is measured after adding the maximum distance between the triangle\u2019s trendlines to the breakout point.\n\nConversely, ARB price risks short-term correction due to its overbought relative strength index on the four-hour chart. In this case, the triangle\u2019s upper trendline will be the likely downside target at around $1.20.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Bitcoin and other crypto tokens were trading with big gains on Friday as the moderately paced momentum continued. Crypto market observers expecting post-Shapella selling pressure to send Ether's price plunging slogged through a day of disappointment.\n\n\n\nBitcoin marched towards the $31,000 mark as the largest crypto token was trading 2 per cent higher. Its largest peer, Ethereum, outperformed with a big margin as it soared more than 10 per cent to hit the $2,1000 mark in the last 24 hours.\n\n\n\nETH is trading sharply higher despite some fearing a massive dump after the Shapella upgrade. As expected, liquid staking protocols are in the green. Bitcoin rose to chase the $31,000-mark, The crypto fear and greed index have jumped 7 points to regain the scoring for 68, hinting towards increasing investor confidence, said Parth Chaturvedi, Crypto Ecosystem Lead at CoinSwitch\n\n\n\n\"In other news, Twitter has partnered with eToro to allow users to buy and sell stocks, crypto, and other assets. This could spur retail investments as newer avenues come into play. The development indicates that traditional finance players are increasingly entering the crypto market,\" he said.\n\n\n\nAll top crypto tokens were trading with big gains on Friday. After Ethereum, Dogecoin zoomed 8 per cent, whereas Cardano and Polygon surged 7 per cent each. Polkadot gained 6 per cent, whereas Litecoin was up 5 per cent during the early trading hours.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading sharply higher, around $1.28 trillion, rising as much as 4 per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes gained almost 16 per cent to $53.48 billion.\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, Bitcoin was trading around $30,750, while Ethereum was around $2,100. The Shapell upgrade marked Ethereum's transition from PoW to a PoS consensus mechanism. Some market watchers were unsure of ETH's price response, said Sathvik Vishwanath, Co-Founder & CEO at Unocoin.\n\n\n\n\"The token prices of several liquid staking derivatives rose, including LDO Lido DAO, RPL Rocket Pool and SD Stader. Arbitrum Ethereum Scaling System ARB token was one of the best-performing digital assets of the day. In addition, Uniswap on Thursday announced a mobile wallet app that includes support for Arbitrum,\" he said.\n\nBlockchain app factory, an enterprise blockchain technology solutions provider has entered into a strategic partnership with bitsCrunch, a forensic and AI-powered NFT analytics firm.\n\nThe symbiotic association between the two leading brands will leverage the combined power of their technologies to empower users with forensics and AI-powered real-time analytics. The strategic alliance is aimed at making NFT trading a highly informed decision for users across the globe.\n\n\n\nNote: Price change in last 24 hours\n\n\n\n\n\nTech View By Giottus Crypto Platform\n\nFor the past month, Ethereum (ETH) has been bouncing between the 0.38 fib level at $1,912 and a descending trendline that's been hanging around for over a year. This week, ETH busted through that resistance and skyrocketed past the crucial $2,000 mark.\n\n\n\nWith the $2,000 level acting as solid support and the next fib target of $2,230 in sight, things are looking good for the asset. A continued rally can potentially propel it toward the golden pocket near $2,500 if the trend continues.\n\nETH's 50 and 200-day moving averages (at $1,728 and $1,471, respectively) are a sign that ETH could be overbought. If the bears succeed to drag down ETH below $2,000 again, they should set their sights on the $1,728 mark to follow up, with the ascending trendline being their next hurdle.\n\n\n\nMajor Levels\n\nResistance: $2,230, $2,500, $2,661\n\nSupport: $2,000, $1,912, $1,728\n\n\n\n\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

        "content": "During his recent appearance on Laura Shin's \"Unchained\" podcast, Tim Beiko discussed the impact of Ethereum's Shapella upgrade on the network's decentralization and validator staking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeiko highlighted that the upgrade significantly \"de-risks\" staking for Ethereum since validators can now withdraw their stakes from the Beacon chain.\n\nThis development not only proves that withdrawals are possible but also reduces the commitment validators have to make, allowing them to try staking with more confidence and ease.\n\nBeiko went on to explain how the Shapella upgrade may encourage a reshuffling of staking providers. Validators may choose to move from centralized exchanges to liquid staking projects or try out solo staking since the ease of withdrawal reduces potential risks.\n\nThe upgrade also allows validators to accrue rewards directly on their validators, which were previously inaccessible on the Beacon chain.\n\nFurthermore, Beiko expressed hope that the upgrade would lead to more solo stakers joining the network. With improved guides and support for setting up validators, the Shapella upgrade has made the process more approachable for users who may have been hesitant to stake before.\n\nThe Ethereum network's concept of coordinated penalties also encourages decentralization as the penalties for issues with centralized services, such as AWS, would be greater than if the validators were more distributed.\n\nThe developer believes that the Shapella upgrade has the potential to invite more staking and promote decentralization within the Ethereum network. By enabling withdrawals, reducing commitment and facilitating a shift from centralized exchanges to liquid staking projects and solo staking, the upgrade paves the way for a more secure and decentralized future for Ethereum."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Explaining ETH Drab Performance After The Shapella Upgrade - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The Ethereum Shapella upgrade finally took place last night, April 12. As many had predicted, it turned out to be a non-event, if Ether\u2019s price performance is anything to go by. Minutes after the upgrade, Ethereum was up only 1% with negligible fluctuations as it oscillated around $1,900.\n\nJust a little over 5 hours later, Ether\u2019s price is at $1,917, a mere 0.12% hourly increase and 2.65% up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nShapella Hard Fork Officially Goes Live On The Ethereum Mainnet\n\nThe long-awaited Shanghai/Capella upgrade, christened the ETH staking unlock event, which had been widely advertised since late 2022, was finally executed on the Ethereum mainnet at 10.27 pm UTC on April 12 at epoch number 194,048.\n\nAccording to Ethereum block explorer beaconchai.in, a total of 12,859 Ether were unlocked in 4,333 withdrawals within the first hour of the hard fork. Five hours later, these figures stand at 81,249 ETH tokens which have already been unlocked in over 30,400 transactions.\n\nAs the unlock event drew closer, the crypto community expected the demand for ETH to surge as investors \u201cbought the rumor\u201d with the hopes of turning the upgrade into a \u201csell-the-news\u201d event once it goes live. Others believed that there would be no significant price action from Ethereum referring to the Shapella upgrade as a non-event, and advising investors to focus on other macroeconomic issues.\n\nSHANGHAI UPDATE IS A NON EVENT.\n\n\n\nYOU SHOULD ALL BE FOCUSING ON THE SAUDI UPDATE.\n\n\n\nSAUDIS APEING 20M ON A REGISTRATION PLATE.\n\n\n\nWHAT'S A FEW BILLION IN MARKET BUYS ON ETH AND BTC TO A SAUDI. THEY DONT CARE.\n\n\n\n1M PER BTC ISN'T A MEME ANYMORE, THEYRE MAKING IT A REALITY.\n\n\n\nLAMBO SZN \u2014 Jamma Pelson (@JammaPelson1) April 12, 2023\n\nSince the total stake on the Beacon Chain is still above 18.1 million ETH, there are growing concerns about the potential selling pressure that may arise as the unlocking continues.\n\nSo, why has the Ethereum price ignored this historic event? Here are a couple of reasons.\n\nFirst, the transaction fee on the Ethereum blockchain remains high, staying above $5 for more than one month now. It is important to note that the Shapella upgrade does not fully address this issue. This reduces the possibilities of a positive Ether price action after the hard fork as most decentralized applications (dApps) and projects opt for Layer 2 and rival networks that offer better rates.\n\nIn addition, decentralized exchanges running on the Ethereum network have been experiencing a decline in trading volume which has dropped by 84% from a weekly high of $38.2 billion at the beginning of last month.\n\nAccording to data from DeFiLlama, the DEX volume on Ethereum had plunged over 23% over the last seven days to $5.93 billion. Meanwhile, rival networks recorded an average of 15% drop in volumes on average over the same timeframe, indicating that Ethereum was losing its share of the market.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis \u2013 Can ETH Rally Higher?\n\nEther\u2019s price slid into the four-hour Future Growth Value (FVG), extending from $1,845 to $1,808, triggering an upswing to areas above $1,900. This move will likely propel ETH to its next significant hurdle at the $2,000 psychological level.\n\nJust like Bitcoin, Ethereum\u2019s lack of volatility has slipped the price into a range-bound movement. As long as the $1,845 support level holds, the bulls have nothing to worry about.\n\nETH/USD Four-hour Chart\n\nNote that Ethereum was trading above the major simple moving averages (SMAs), an indication that it enjoyed robust support on the downside. The SMAs were also facing upward, suggesting that the market still favored the upside.\n\nWhile the upward outlook makes logical sense, a reentry into the $11,800 and $1,700 support zone would spell trouble for the Ethereum price. In such a case, ETH could revisit the midpoint at $1,750 or the range low at $1,687.\n\nEven though there are no clear signs of a rally, traders also do not expect any panic selling. This means that unless there is a significant increase in the number of staking unlock requests, Ether\u2019s price could remain near $1,900 for the foreseeable future.\n\nIn the mean time, the Shapella upgrade remains a non-event.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "By Elizabeth Howcroft\n\nLONDON (Reuters) -Cryptocurrency investors are facing delays to withdraw funds deposited on the Ethereum blockchain after its major software upgrade, highlighting persistent headaches for Ethereum which aims to have the technology widely used for instant payments.\n\nThe software upgrade, known as \"Shapella,\" was set to unlock more than $30 billion worth of ether, the second-biggest cryptocurrency, which investors had deposited on the Ethereum blockchain in return for interest.\n\nEther rose above $2,000 for the first time since August 2022 on Thursday.\n\nUntil Wednesday's upgrade, investors could not withdraw funds they had deposited via this method, known as \"staking\", on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nAs of Thursday, ether worth around $1.4 billion was stuck in a withdrawal queue, blockchain data firm Nansen said.\n\nThe delays are an example of the limits in the transactions that Ethereum can process, highlighting its potential shortcomings as it strives to become a widely-used financial infrastructure.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation, a body that speaks for the network and describes itself as a \"non-profit organisation dedicated to supporting Ethereum\", did not comment.\n\nThe delays are due to limits in the amount of transactions the blockchain can process, Nansen analyst Martin Lee told Reuters via email. It can process approximately 1,800 validator withdrawals, or 57,600 ether worth of exits per day, he said - that's approximately $115 million.\n\nThe limits on validator withdrawals were in place for security reasons, Lee said.\n\n\"In an extreme scenario, if there\u2019s no limits, and a large majority of validators exit, the Ethereum network would be vulnerable to attacks and bad actors,\" he said.\n\nEthereum has grown popular for offshoots of the crypto market such as so-called decentralised finance or NFTs, but it has yet to become used in mainstream payments, finance or commerce.\n\nThe major Binance exchange said users would be able to withdraw their ether from its staking product from April 19, and that it may take \"15 days to several weeks\" to process these transactions.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Due to the processing limitations on the Ethereum network, Binance will set a daily ETH redemption quota for each Binance user,\" Binance said on its website.\n\nNansen's Lee said the backlog will likely take weeks to clear, after which depending on what the average daily \"unstaking\" amount is, it would take just hours or a couple of days.\n\n(Reporting by Elizabeth Howcroft, editing by Tom Wilson and Emelia Sithole-Matarise, Kirsten Donovan)"

        "title": "Ether Jumps Above $2K a Day After Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade - Yahoo Movies UK",
        "content": "Join the most important conversation in crypto and web3! Secure your seat today\n\nEther (ETH) continued its recent strength Thursday afternoon, climbing above $2,000 a day after Ethereum successfully completed the long-anticipated upgrade.\n\nThe second-largest cryptocurrency by market value was recently trading at $2,015, up more than 5% over the past 24 hours.\n\nThe Shapella upgrade, also called the Ethereum Shanghai hard fork, continued the transformation of the Ethereum network from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism that started in September\u2019s Merge upgrade.\n\nIn the weeks leading to Shapella, market observers had diverged over ETH\u2019s price reaction, with some predicting selling pressure would send the price down but others seeing little impact or even an increase in price.\n\nDiogo Monica, president and co-founder of institutional crypto platform Anchorage Digital, told CoinDesk in an interview after the upgrade that investors would be more comfortable locking in ETH, leading to decreased supply. Monica noted that \u201cthere's liquidity on the chain directly.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlus, demand is increasing with every successful upgrade that we have on the Ethereum network, which are two main reasons why the price is not going to drop massively,\u201d he said.\n\nMonica added that validators looking to exit the chain would have to join an exit queue, and that as a result, institutional investors would \u201cstay on the sidelines\u201d from staking \u2013 at least for the moment.\n\n\u201cHow the exit queue behaves\u201d in the next few weeks and whether \u201cwe get to a pattern of liquidity such that we can start being comfortable staking for the people that aren't staking\u201d are questions that institutional investors currently have in mind, along with the next potential next move of EIP-4844, or proto-danksharding, he added.\n\nETH's performance around the Shanghai fork will depend less on \u201ctechnicals\u201d and more on \u201cwhat risk actually does at that time,\u201d according to a report from Coinbase Research prior to the upgrade.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cIf the trading environment sees risk assets selling off, people may decide to un-stake and sell ETH just to de-risk, while institutions may not step in as aggressively on the buy side,\u201d analysts David Duong and Brian Cubellis wrote.\n\nElsewhere in markets\n\nBitcoin (BTC) rose 1.8% for the day to change hands at around $30,375 Thursday afternoon. Among institutional investors, for years the key question has been whether BTC is an uncorrelated asset, according to Mike Belshe, CEO of custody provider BitGo, in an emailed comment.\n\n\u201cWe're now witnessing the proof that indeed, when the Federal Reserve stops manipulating markets with infinite money supply, bitcoin stands alone \u2013 uncorrelated,\u201d Belshe wrote, adding that institutional adoption is \u201cabout to kick into high gear,\u201d despite regulatory headwinds.\n\nBitcoin, Ether, S&P 500, Gold 7-Day Returns (CoinDesk Research)\n\nLiquid staking derivatives' token prices rose on Thursday. Lido DAO\u2019s LDO recently spiked by over 7% in the past 24 hours to around $2.43. Rocket Pool\u2019s RPL was up over 9% to trade at around $46.19, while Stader\u2019s SD was up over 4% to roughly $1.33, according to CoinGecko\u2019s data.\n\nThe Arbitrum Ethereum scaling system's ARB token has also been rallying. ARB is trading up 15% over the last 24 hours at around $1.37 \u2013 making it one of the day\u2019s top-performing digital assets. Earlier Thursday, Uniswap announced a mobile wallet app that includes support for Arbitrum. The CoinDesk Market Index, which measures overall crypto market performance, was up 3% for the day.\n\nEquities edged up Thursday afternoon, a day after mildly promising inflation data. The S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq recently rose by 1.2% and 1.9%, respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) was recently trading up 1%. The two-year Treasury yield was flat to sit at around 3.97%. Gold rose above $2,050, inching toward its record high, as investors continued their recent penchant for assets that hold value.\n\nThe CME FedWatch tool showed that currently 66% of traders see the U.S. Federal Reserve raising interest rates by 25-basis points at the next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) next meeting on May 3.\n\nLyllah Ledesma contributed to this report."

        "content": "ETH demand soars on both the spot and derivatives market after a successful upgrade.\n\nAssessing the prospects of a retracement as some ETH whales take profit.\n\nMore than 24 hours have passed since the Ethereum [ETH] network successfully deployed the Shanghai upgrade. The hype around the upgrade will rapidly die down but what does this mean for ETH?\n\nMajor blockchain networks have historically been characterized by a strong bull run for their native cryptocurrencies. A resurgence of sell pressure tends to follow during or after the upgrade. Will that be the same case for ETH now that the highly anticipated Shanghai upgrade has been launched?\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nInitial responses post the upgrade have been positive, especially from the derivatives market. Glassnode recently revealed that ETH open interest perpetual contracts soared to a two-year high on OKex in the last 24 hours. They were up to a 15-month high on rival exchange ByBit.\n\n? #Ethereum $ETH Open Interest in Perpetual Futures Contracts just reached a 2-year high of $1,126,441,832.21 on #Okex Previous 2-year high of $1,107,993,160.84 was observed on 08 February 2023 View metric:https://t.co/L43VVP6PlY pic.twitter.com/QbEqt6yPlO \u2014 glassnode alerts (@glassnodealerts) April 13, 2023\n\nThe bulk of the open interest flooded into the market between 11 and 13 April. This means the demand started flowing in just before the merge. ETH\u2019s funding rate was at its highest level in the last four week at press time.\n\nStrong demand fuel\u2019s ETH rally above $2,000\n\nThe derivatives demand surge confirmed a clear and strong response from investors. Such an outcome is often characterized by a more price volatility and that has been the case with ETH.\n\nThe derivatives market demand coupled with strong spot performance triggered favored ETH bulls because it finally rocketed above the highly coveted $2,000 price level. ETH exchanged hands at $2009 at press time.\n\nCan ETH bulls maintain the momentum and sustain prices above $2,000? If the outcome will be consistent with historic observations, the latest ETH rally will likely be followed by strong sell pressure. Multiple signals already point towards such an outcome. For example, ETH, at the time of writing, was overbought according to the RSI.\n\nETH exchange flows are the next noteworthy signal courtesy of the recent pivot in flows. It suggested that buying volumes post upgrade might already be slowing down. Despite this, the latest exchange flows revealed that outflows outweighed exchange inflows by a significant margin.\n\nAn opportunity for short sellers?\n\nSome whales are already selling as indicated by ETH\u2019s supply distribution. Addresses in the 10,000 to 100,000 ETH and 1 million to 10 million range offloaded some ETH in the last 24 hours.\n\nMost of the other whale categories were still buying during the same period. The same accumulating whale categories had a larger share of the circulating supply, thus explaining why the price remained bullish.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nShort sellers might also have a solid chance to secure some gains if more whales start taking profits. A shift in the tide in favor of the bears may trigger a cascading effect. This is because ETH\u2019s latest rally was fueled by leverage.\n\nA price pivot will likely trigger leverage liquidations, forcing long traders to sell to cover losses. While a bearish retracement is on the cards, ETH traders should also watch out for an extended upside courtesy of the influx of market confidence."

        "content": "Decentralized exchange Uniswap is seemingly set to launch on the new zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) roll-up solution from scaling solution provider Polygon.\n\nWhile Uniswap (UNI) tokenholders have until April 14 at 9:05 pm UTC to vote on the proposal to launch Uniswap v3 on the zkEVM, the 40 million vote threshold needed for the proposal to pass has already been reached, with over 42.4 million votes recorded in favor of the integration.\n\nAll 191 Ethereum addresses voted in favor of the proposal, with financial modeling platform Gauntlet and Ethereum infrastructure provider ConsenSys leading with over 7 million votes each, according to Tally, a voting dashboard for decentralized finance projects.\n\nTop votes in favor of integrating Uniswap v3 on Polygon zkEVM. Source: Tally\n\nThe author of the proposal, Polygon Business Development Lead Jack Melnick, argued that now is the \u201cright moment\u201d to make Uniswap v3 available on Polygon\u2019s zkEVM because it is \u201cEVM equivalent\u201d \u2014 meaning that there is no need to recompile EVM smart contracts:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s significant value in Uniswap being available on an EVM compatible ZK rollup. Deploying early on zkEVM helps solidify Uniswap\u2019s place as the number one DEX and a thought leader.\u201d\n\nThe integration will also provide validation and fast finality for off-chain transactions, said Melnick.\n\nIn addition, the high level of adoption that Polygon has managed to harness makes integrating on Polygon\u2019s zkEVM a \u201cpriority,\u201d he explained.\n\nAs for what factors will make this deployment a boom or bust, Melnick pointed to several key on-chain metrics:\n\n\u201cA successful zkEVM deployment will, in an organic and sustained manner, grow Uniswap\u2019s Total Addressable Market across TVL, unique interacting wallet, volumes, and integration with partner dApps.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs demand for zk-blockchains and proximity to Ethereum rises, users and builders will increasingly look to zkEVM solutions to build and trade,\u201d he added.\n\nMelnick is confident the integration will pose \u201cminimal risks\u201d at least \u201crelative\u201d to other blockchains because the Polygon zkEVM uses zero-knowledge proofs to inherit Ethereum\u2019s security.\n\nThe Polygon Bridge has been \u201cdisintermediated,\u201d and data will be sourced from \u201creputable\u201d oracle providers, Melnick added, which he expects will only strengthen security at the protocol level.\n\nPolygon\u2019s zkEVM had its official mainnet launch on March 27.\n\nRelated: Uniswap\u2019s first governance vote fails...

        "content": "Non-custodial Liquid Staking Protocol Enters Crowded Sector\n\nBy: Aleksandar Gilbert \u2022 Loading...\n\nDeFi News\n\nA new entrant in the crowded liquid staking industry has grown quickly since its debut last month, buoyed by a simple promise: you can keep your coins.\n\nCrypto locked in Ether.Fi has grown to more than $37M since it began accepting deposits ahead of its launch on Ethereum mainnet on March 4. Like other liquid staking protocols, it attempts to solve a dilemma posed by Ethereum\u2019s security model.\n\n\u201cEther.Fi offers truly decentralized staking,\u201d the company boasts on its website. \u201cThe staker, not the node operator, owns all the keys.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with crypto data company Token Terminal this week, CEO Mike Silagadze said custodial staking \u201cjust seemed like it didn\u2019t meet the risk/reward ratio, where you\u2019re getting your 5% yield, but you\u2019re losing custody of your ETH.\u201d\n\nInstitutional Investors\n\nInstitutional investors are especially wary of taking that risk, Silagadze told The Defiant. He is betting that his non-custodial product will draw institutional money, which has largely sat on the sidelines since Ethereum enabled staking more than two years ago.\n\nEthereum, like other Proof-of-Stake blockchains, relies on users who are willing to lock up, or stake, their ETH in order to validate transactions. While ETH staked directly in the Beacon Chain comes with a modest annual yield, it cannot be used in more lucrative DeFi protocols.\n\nLiquid staking protocols address this dilemma by staking ETH on users\u2019 behalf, batching deposits and handing them off to so-called \u201cnode operators\u201d who run the hardware and software combination required to secure the Ethereum network.\n\nBut liquid staking protocols are custodial services, a potential liability in an industry where people are loathe to relinquish control of their assets. Ether.Fi claims to have built a protocol that should make everyone happy.\n\nNon-custodial Staking\n\nEther.Fi was originally a hedge fund, with plans of staking Ether on customers\u2019 behalf and using DeFi strategies to boost that yield.\n\nDeFi Alpha Premium Content DeFi Daily | Weekdays\n\nDeFi Alpha Letter | Weekly\n\nDefiant Podcast Transcript | Weekly\n\nInbox Dump | Saturday\n\nWeekly Recap | Sunday Looking for Alpha? Become a premium member of The Defiant and join our DeFi Alpha community. Start for free\n\n\u201cIn investigating what options were available for staking, we very quickly reached the conclusion that we weren\u2019t comfortable using any of them, for a number of reasons,\u201d Silagadze told Token Terminal. \u201cOne, they were either fully custodial or semi-custodial.\u201d\n\nThe company pivoted to build the staking service it wished it had at its disposal.\n\nUsers retain custody of their Ether by generating mnemonic withdrawal credentials and validator keys.\n\n\u201cWith other protocols, this key generation is performed on a centralized server by the node operator,\u201d according to Ether.Fi. \u201cVia the ether.fi protocol, the staker then shares an encrypted copy of the validator key with the node operator (required for validation duties).\u201d\n\n\u201cEarly Adopter\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s off to a promising start. As of Friday, more than 14,000 wallets had deposited ETH in the protocol\u2019s \u201cearly adopter\u201d smart contract. And deposits have picked up since Wednesday, when Ethereum\u2019s developers upgraded the blockchain to allow for the withdrawal of staked ETH.\n\nSilagadze told Token Terminal he expected the first $20M to $30M in TVL to come from the institutional investors who had been with the company since its hedge fund days.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t been the case.\n\nOf the $37M, about $1.4M has come from those investors, Silagadze told The Defiant. The remainder has come from retail investors, with average deposits at 0.2 ETH \u2013 stakers can deposit any amount, not the 32 ETH increments required when running a node.\n\n\u201cTo be frank, we were kind of surprised at the uptake,\u201d he said.\n\nFierce Competition\n\nThe company closed a $5M funding round in February. Investors include North Island Ventures, Chapter One, Node Capital, and controversial crypto investor Arthur Hayes.\n\nBut Ether.Fi faces a tough road ahead. The competition is fierce and entrenched. Ether.Fi\u2019s $37M in deposits represents a rounding error in the $19B staking industry. Lido, the industry leader, accounts for almost two-thirds of that figure.\n\nThe company plans on taking a snapshot of its users as of April 30, three days after it debuts on Ethereum mainnet. Early depositors are awarded bonus points that will allow them to get boosted staking rewards \u201cand other benefits\u201d when the protocol moves to mainnet at the end of the month, according to Silagadze.\n\nHowever, he insists no protocol token is in the works, and that the snapshot has nothing to do with a token airdrop.\n\n[ UPDATE: Article updated April 14 @ 7:40pm to correct the amounts of ETH stakers can deposit when using Ether.fi and the fact that deposits aren\u2019t on test net]"

        "title": "Big Eyes Coin, Ethereum, and Bitcoin: Is This the Bull Market Investors Have Been Waiting for? - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "In the last ten years, the finance sector has seen the rise of digital currencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Big Eyes Coin (BIG). This development has had varying effects on the prices of traditional commodities like gold, silver, and other precious metals. It\u2019s evident that the surge in digital assets has influenced the prices of gold and silver and vice versa. In the current year, both the prices of gold and silver and cryptocurrencies have been on the rise, prompting speculation among financial market enthusiasts about a potential bull market.\n\nAnticipating the Big Release of Big Eyes Coin\n\nBig Eyes Coin is a new cryptocurrency project that has attracted a significant following. The project aims to create a platform for artists and collectors to trade and invest in digital art. Big Eyes Coin\u2019s community, known as the Cat Crew, is eagerly anticipating the bull run as gold and silver prices increase along with cryptocurrencies.\n\nWise investors who bought Big Eyes Coin during its early presale stages are celebrating the remarkable increase in its value over time. At stage 1 of the presale, each Big Eyes Coin was worth $0.0001, but as of stage 12, its value has risen to $0.00049, which represents a 390% increase. Investors who wait too long to invest in the token could miss out on opportunities as the price of the coin is set to increase with each presale stage. Therefore, it is crucial to invest early to maximize returns.\n\nMoreover, Big Eyes Coin is offering its bonus code BULLRUN250 for crypto fans and financial market enthusiasts who want to get an extra 250% on their next BIG purchase.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Soaring Price: Should You Consider Investing Now?\n\nBitcoin has a strong relationship with gold and silver, while its relationship with the stock market has weakened. Crypto analysts and financial market experts have observed this phenomenon as news of the banking crisis flooded the internet. BTC welcomed a new rally twice in the middle of March, and its price continues to climb.\n\nThis could be a good opportunity to invest in Bitcoin if investors are willing to hold onto BTC for several years. Token holders can also buy BTC in small sizes to avoid worrying about buying too high. However, investors must still remember that prices may continue to rise over time. As of the time of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at $28,480 and has seen a 1.44% increase in the last seven days.\n\nEthereum Breaks Through Resistance Level Barrier\n\nThe crypto market has seen a positive trend with Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, breaking the $1,900 resistance level for the first time in seven months. The cryptocurrency is currently trading above $1,910, which is an encouraging sign for Ethereum investors. ETH was last valued at this price on August 16th, 2022, during a crypto market downturn. This occurred as the United States Federal Reserve raised the Federal Funds rate in an attempt to combat inflation.\n\nIs a Bull Market Approaching? Consider Your Investment Opportunities Now\n\nThe bull market presents an exciting opportunity for investors looking to capitalize on the rising prices of crypto coins and positive market sentiment. This is the best time to invest in crypto as the upward trend is likely to continue. As the price of Ethereum continues to rise, it is expected to reach the next stop of $2,000. The upcoming Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, which aims to improve the network\u2019s scalability, security, and energy efficiency, is expected to make Ethereum even more appealing to investors and developers.\n\nLooking for the next crypto to enhance your portfolio?

        "title": "A Beginner\u2019s Guide to EIP-5725: Transferable Vesting NFTs - Ethereum World News",
        "content": "Since the launch of the ERC-721 standard for non-fungible tokens in 2018, the crypto world has seen NFTs evolve in ways that would have been difficult to imagine five years ago. New use cases and capabilities are fundamentally changing the way users interact with not only the NFTs themselves, but also with the projects and companies behind the NFTs.\n\nCore contributors to ApeSwap, a decentralized exchange and bonding protocol, and team members of Paladin, a blockchain security provider, collaborated to develop an extension to the ERC-721 standard that allows for exciting new functionality for NFTs. The EIP-5725: Transferable Vesting NFT standard is the result of careful consideration of what NFTs can and should be, as well as many rounds of real-world testing and iteration.\n\nWhat is EIP-5725?\n\nAn Ethereum Improvement Proposal, or EIP, is a document used to recommend and describe standards for the Ethereum community. There are multiple types of EIPs, but EIP-5725 is a ERC (Ethereum Requests for Comments) proposal, meaning that it affects application-level standards and specifications.\n\nThe EIP that ApeSwap and Paladin have worked together to create is called EIP-5725: Transferable Vesting NFT. This EIP provides an interface for transferable vesting NFTs which release underlying tokens over time.\n\nWhile time locks and vesting are both important mechanisms for controlling the distribution of ERC-20 tokens and have been around since the age of ICOs, the lack of standardization across the industry can be problematic. Without a standardized approach, it can be difficult for investors to understand how a particular token is being distributed and what the implications of that distribution might be.\n\nHow does EIP-5725 work?\n\nEIP-5725 allows for the implementation of a standard API for NFT based contracts to allow two primary functionalities: transferability, and vesting.\n\nProjects that implement EIP-5725 are able to use their NFTs to represent unvested tokens that belong to the holder of the NFT. In other words, this standard allows projects to either integrate with an existing NFT marketplace, or create their own, to be used as a secondary market for vesting tokens.\n\nAlso, using EIP-5725, projects can hold and represent the vested and locked properties of any underlying token (ERC-20 or otherwise) that is emitted to the NFT holder. This standard is an extension of the ERC-721 token that provides basic functionality for creating vesting NFTs, claiming the tokens and reading vesting curve properties.\n\nWhy is EIP-5725 important?\n\nEIP-5725 allows projects to implement several new capabilities to create value for users and projects:\n\nTransferability of vesting tokens: When using EIP-5725, vesting tokens are emitted to the holder of a transferable NFT, meaning that users can buy or sell the NFTs that represent unvested tokens. This secondary market offers users more flexibility around the underlying asset, as they can liquidate or trade it at any time. Custom NFT art capabilities: EIP-5725 also allows projects to create custom NFT art based on a variety of underlying inputs. For example, projects can choose to include a limited edition seal or color scheme on NFTs of particular significance or value, which can then become one of the considerations when valuing the NFT on a secondary market. Novel vesting curves: The vesting curves within EIP-5725 NFTs do not have to be linear \u2014 they are entirely customizable, and can have accelerating or decelerating vesting depending on the use case required by the project. Aggregated, holistic views of vesting tokens and properties: The standard EIP-5725 API enables projects to create holistic dashboards and reporting tools that aggregate the status of their vesting NFTs across entire chains, which can help the project make more informed strategic decisions about future releases and marketing efforts.\n\nHow are projects using EIP-5725 right now?\n\nApeSwap has used the EIP-5725 standard to create a category of products called ApeSwap Bonds. ApeSwap Bonds allow crypto projects to create transferable NFTs that users purchase with liquidity provider tokens. Holders of the NFTs then receive tokens at a discount, which is set by a variety of factors, linearly over the course of a vesting period set by the project.\n\nThis approach is superior to the traditional yield farming model in that the capital that a project puts forth as discounted tokens generates a return in the form of project-owned liquidity, as opposed to rented liquidity where reward tokens spent generate no return for the project.\n\nTo date, ApeSwap has created $1M worth of protocol-owned liquidity for itself and over $1.5M worth of liquidity owned by its partners through the sale of ApeSwap Bonds.\n\nWhy should users educate themselves on EIP-5725?\n\nApeSwap and Paladin are excited to promote the EIP-5725 standard to the crypto community at large to enable users to take advantage of the many opportunities that it creates. Users who are interested should learn more about ApeSwap Bonds in the documentation and stay tuned for new Bonds partners and capabilities launching soon.\n\nIf you have a favorite crypto project that might be a good fit for Bonds, have them reach out to ApeSwap.\n\nAdditionally, users and project contributors are encouraged to add to the ongoing discussion at the Ethereum Magicians forum."

        "title": "Cryptocurrencies to Keep an Eye on in 2023: Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and the Red-Hot Collateral Network ... - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "As we venture further into 2023, three cryptocurrencies are stealing the spotlight: Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and the rapidly rising Collateral Network (COLT), which has surged 40% recently.\n\nCollateral Network (COLT), a crowdlending DeFi platform utilizing AI for asset valuation and algorithmic lending rates, is currently in its second presale stage, offering tokens at $0.014 each.\n\nExperts anticipate a staggering 35x increase in COLT\u2019s price before summer, making it a must-have in the crypto space.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nEthereum (ETH) is approaching $1.9k, up 1.42% in the past week and 28.27 percent in the past month. The highly anticipated Ethereum (ETH) Shanghai-Capella hard fork is scheduled for Wednesday.\n\nThis update will grant access to $31 billion in Ethereum (ETH) staked since December 2020. Despite the long-term favorable outlook for Ethereum (ETH), investors are concerned about the potentially unleashed Ethereum (ETH) sell-off.\n\nWith a market capitalization of $229.06 billion and a 24-hour volume of $10.45 billion, Ethereum (ETH) confronts ambiguity as the upgrade will discharge 18 million Ethereum (ETH), of which only 1.1 million ETH will be promptly withdrawable as staking rewards.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nSolana (SOL)\n\nSolana (SOL) has been on a remarkable ascent, increasing 10.96% in the previous week and 28.96% this month. The high momentum breakout of its long-awaited resistance means Solana (SOL) is approaching a sentiment shift.\n\nA potential retest of the broken trendline could present an entry opportunity for speculators. Solana (SOL) has outperformed the rest of the already bullish market by experiencing a significant price increase.\n\nLaunched by Solana (SOL) Labs in March 2020, Solana (SOL) is a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain network that enables the creation of various decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and non-fungible token (NFT) initiatives.\n\nSolana (SOL) has a market capitalization of $9.16 billion and demonstrates solid performance, attracting the attention of investors seeking to capitalize on the rising prominence of layer-1 networks like Solana (SOL).\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nCollateral Network (COLT)\n\nCollateral Network (COLT) is an decentralized crowdlending network in the decentralized finance (DeFi) industry. This initiative has the potential to shake up the traditional lending business by providing more easily available loans at lower interest rates.\n\nUsers of Collateral Network (COLT) may lend modest sums of money to debtors at a fixed interest rate using asset-backed NFTs which then get fractionalized. In addition, borrowers may use their personal property as collateral for loans without having to sell the items or go through any unnecessary formalities.\n\nFor example, say Jane has a painting worth $80k and needs a short-term loan. She would: send the painting to Collateral Network (COLT), the painting is stored securely, and an NFT representing it is minted, making it 100% asset-backed.\n\nThe NFT is then fractionalized, allowing investors to lend smaller amounts at a fixed interest rate for a set period (fractional lending). The borrower repays the loan and interest. The NFTs are burned, and the painting is retrieved from storage.\n\nAt the second round of the presale, Collateral Network (COLT) tokens may be purchased for $0.014 each. Experts predict a 3500% growth in Collateral Network\u2019s value during the next six months (COLT). Hence, benefit from this alternative currency now, before its price skyrockets.\n\nFind out more about the Collateral Network presale here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.collateralnetwork.io/\n\nPresale: https://app.collateralnetwork.io/register\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/collateralnwk\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Collateralnwk\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Open-source blockchain platform EOS announced the beta launch of its Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) mainnet, designed to enhance interoperability between the network and the Ethereum Blockchain.\n\nThe EOS Network Foundation (ENF) also inked a strategic partnership with market maker and investment firm DWF Labs through an investment deal of $60 million to further the platform\u2019s growth and development.\n\nEOS Unveils EVM Mainnet\n\nAccording to a press release sent to CryptoPotato, the EOS EVM will be deployed on the EOS Network as a smart contract. Written in Solidity, Ethereum\u2019s native programming language, developers will have access to the EVM, and numerous tools, resources, and open-source code libraries will support it.\n\nWith Ethereum\u2019s scalability challenges and slow transaction speed, the EVM is designed to complement the network with its swift operational capability. The EOS virtual machine will bridge the two blockchains, gaining access to Ethereum\u2019s vast resources while implementing its one-second block interval speeds and over 800 swaps per second with low fees.\n\nThrough the EVM, Solidity developers will easily access EOS\u2019s scalable network infrastructure, funding programs, and Ethereum\u2019s resources.\n\nYves La Rose, founder and CEO of the EOS Network Foundation, said:\n\n\u201cOur goal is to create an interoperable future where the gaps between blockchains, developers and end users are bridged. EOS EVM does just that. With EOS EVM, it is now significantly easier for Ethereum developers and end users to take advantage of the low fees, ultra-fast speeds, and reliability of the EOS Network. EOS EVM is a significant milestone and represents our commitment to a multi-chain future.\u201d\n\nEOS Foundation Partners With DWF Labs\n\nFurthermore, through the $60 million strategic partnership, DWF Labs would support the EOS Network in two ways. The investment firm would purchase EOS tokens worth $45 million and pump $15 million into EOS-based businesses and projects.\n\n\u201cOur strategic partnership will enable us to explore new horizons and revolutionize the blockchain ecosystem together, providing developers with the tools and resources they need to bring about a more decentralized and connected future,\u201d said the Managing Partner of DWF Labs, Andrei Grachev.\n\nThe alliance between EOS Network and DWF Labs will channel their resources toward facilitating the growth of the EOS ecosystem, unveiling new potential in the web3 space."

        "content": "The crypto market continues it's gaining spree with the leader Bitcoin reaching near $30,500 levels, and Ethereum picking up by over 6%. There are a host of positives for cryptocurrencies. These would be sharp cooling in US inflation, and also Ether's Shapella upgrade which is set to be released. Globally, the market witnessed strong demand in both value and volume.\n\nAt the time of writing, on CoinMarketCap, the global crypto market traded at $1.25 trillion up by 2.29% over the previous day. The total volumes in cryptocurrencies zoomed nearly 20% to $48.78 billion over the previous day.\n\nThe market's biggest booster is inflation data. The US consumer price index of all items stood at 5% by end of March 2023 --- which is the lowest since May of 2021. It is also better than Street's expectations of 5.2%. However, inflation continues to stay above US Fed's target levels.\n\nBitcoin traded near $30,225 up by nearly a percent. The crypto has touched an intraday high of $30,462.48 --- which is the 7-day high and also a 1-month high. The crypto hit a 3-month high of $30,509.08 earlier.\n\nCoinDCX Research Team earlier said that if March CPI will be lower than previous months, which could potentially benefit Bitcoin if the Federal Reserve decides to pause rate hikes.\n\nFurther, Ethereum which is the second largest cryptocurrency, traded near $1,982 up by 6%.\n\nBoth Bitcoin and Ether have recorded around 8% and 6% jump in 7 days.\n\nOn the latest cryptocurrencies performance, Sumit Gupta, Co-Founder & CEO, CoinDCX said: \u201cThe ETH Shapella upgrade is important on 3 counts: security, improved user experience, and more control. The upgrade involves making changes to two important layers in the network - the execution layer and the consensus layer. One of the most important changes being introduced - EIP-4895 - is a new mechanism that will improve the security of the Ethereum network. The ETH network will now be more efficient and reliable and provide an improved customer experience.\"\n\nGupta added, \"Hopefully this will also inspire other blockchain platforms to make the transition to more sustainable consensus algorithms. This upgrade will enable users to stake, earn ETH rewards distributed automatically, unstake to regain full access to their accounts or restake to start over. Post this upgrade, the investor can expect high transaction speed and lower gas fee.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Parth Chaturvedi, Crypto Ecosystem Lead, CoinSwitch said, \"The much-awaited Shanghai upgrade and the US\u2019s CPI data have hardly impacted Bitcoin and Ethereum prices. Despite the expectation from investors of an aggressive response from markets, BTC continued trading in the $30k zone and went below the mark multiple times in the last 24 hours, while ETH is in the $1.9k zone.\n\nIn alignment with Glassnode\u2019s prediction, Chaturvedi added, \"We don\u2019t see any selling pressure on ETH, which is up ~1% in the past 24 hours, as of around 8 AM today. Around half an hour after the Shanghai upgrade was activated, around 285 withdrawals had been processed for about 5,413 ETH ($10 million worth). In high spirits, investors and blockchain developers have already begun mapping the next steps, i.e., the Verge, Purge, and the Scourge.\"\n\nIn other news, CoinSwitch stated that Argentina has made an official move in crypto by authorising its National Securities Commission (CNV) to launch a bitcoin (BTC) index-based futures contract. Additionally, El Salvador granted its first license for digital asset service providers to BitFinex yesterday. We can expect such moves to positively impact investor sentiment and boost market performance.\n\nInvestor sentiment seems to remain strong, he said.\n\nDisclaimer: The views and recommendations made above are those of individual analysts or broking companies, and not of Mint.

        "title": "DigiToads (TOADS), Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB) Price Projections April 2023 - ZyCrypto",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nAs the crypto market gears up for what appears to be a bullish season, excitement is palpable among traders and enthusiasts alike. Established and new altcoins are gaining traction, driven by their real-world use cases and innovative solutions. After enduring the recent downturn, many traders are reaping modest profits and eagerly anticipating greater returns in forthcoming bull runs.\n\nIn this piece, we will delve into price projections for three of the most buzzworthy cryptocurrencies currently dominating the market: Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), and DigiToads (TOADS).\n\nEthereum Price Outlook\n\nEthereum, one of the most dominant forces in the altcoin market besides Bitcoin, often leads the charge regarding price uptrends. Currently trading at around $1900, its highest level in six months, Ethereum\u2019s performance could significantly impact numerous other altcoins. However, an upcoming upgrade presents potential challenges to Ethereum\u2019s price action.\n\nDevelopers have announced the Shanghai Upgrade, which will make all 16 million staked ETH available for withdrawal. This could lead to considerable sell pressure, potentially dampening ETH\u2019s price growth.\n\nNonetheless, considering the overall bullish trend emerging in the DeFi market, it seems more likely that Ethereum, as the second-largest cryptocurrency, will maintain its upward trajectory, and any temporary bearish effect on Ethereum\u2019s price will ultimately pave the way for explosive gains in the future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRegarding the price predictions, some analysts predict that by the end of 2023, ETH\u2019s price could surpass an average level of $2,519.85, with a minimum expected price of $2,445.51 by the end of the current year. The price of this veteran DeFi project could even reach a maximum level of $2,786.58.\n\nBinance Coin Price Projection\n\nBinance Coin (BNB) has experienced a tumultuous year, with the token\u2019s price dropping from $500 to $245 before recovering to $316. However, the challenges may not be over, as traders have raised concerns about the project\u2019s reserves following the FTX exchange collapse.\n\nThe CFTC\u2019s recent lawsuit also alleged that Binance violated US derivatives laws by offering derivative trading services to US customers without registering with the appropriate market regulators, prioritizing commercial success over regulatory compliance. The Australian government has also cancelled Binance\u2019s license to operate its local branch. These unfavourable situations surrounding the exchange have undoubtedly impacted BNB\u2019s performance.\n\nDespite these challenges, the technical analysis for Binance Coin appears relatively positive, considering the token\u2019s extensive utility and Binance\u2019s position as the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange.\n\nAnalysts predict that by the end of 2023, Binance Coin (BNB) will have a minimum price of $341.52, potentially reaching a maximum price of $406.74. The average trading price is anticipated to hover around $383.99.\n\nDigiToads Price Prediction\n\nDigiToads, an innovative meme coin based on play-to-earn elements, has rapidly gained traction despite being a recent entrant to the market. The presale phase has only been live for a few weeks. Still, this exciting ERC20 token has already raised over $1 million, successfully selling out the first two presale stages, which account for 85 million TOADS tokens in total. One of the main driving forces behind this impressive momentum is the dynamic structure of the presale.\n\nFor More Information on DigiToads, visit the website, join the presale or join the community.\n\nAs the whitepaper indicates, the TOADS price is set to grow ten times progressively. Users have already experienced two price increases, with eight more scheduled before the presale concludes.\n\nThose who infuse now can anticipate up to a 250% price growth when DigiToads goes live, and the price reaches $0.055. To put it in numbers, if you were to invest $1,000 today, your acquisition could potentially grow to $2,500 by the time of the launch, which is practically impossible by any other digital asset currently available on the market.\n\nClosing Notes\n\nObserving its past price performance, hedging power against market volatility, and future price projections is crucial when searching for the best cryptocurrency. TOADS offers excellent growth potential; the best part about it is a guarantee. These price increases are fixed and scheduled, meaning any moment you join the presale, you are already a winner at the launch date.\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article, and views in it do not represent those of, nor should they be attributed to, ZyCrypto.

        "content": "The software that underpins the second-biggest crypto coin ether was upgraded on Wednesday and is online, cryptocurrency exchange Binance said in a tweet.\n\nThe move will give investors access to more than $30 billion (roughly Rs. 2,45,877 crore) of the digital tokens.\n\nKnown as Shapella, the latest upgrade to the Ethereum blockchain since its Merge upgrade will enable investors to redeem an offshoot of ether tokens that they have deposited in return for interest on the blockchain network over the past three years.\n\nSuch so-called \"staked ether\" tokens currently account for about 15 percent of all ether tokens, according to data firm Dune Analytics, and are worth some $31 billion.\n\n\"The Shanghai/Shapella Upgrade is complete. Deposits & withdrawals for ETH, OP, ARB and ERC-20 tokens via the Ethereum, Optimism, and Arbitrum networks are now back online,\" Binance said in a tweet.\n\nThe changes will likely lead to heightened volatility for ether, investors have predicted.\n\nSome believe that widespread redemptions could lead to a wave of selling, in turn weighing on the price of ether, whose market value of about $230 billion is topped only by bitcoin.\n\n\"The release of this previously unrealised investment may lead to significant downward price pressure if it is immediately liquidated,\" Deutsche Bank analysts said in a note.\n\nIn its last significant upgrade, Ethereum in September drastically reduced its energy usage - a move proponents said would give Ethereum an advantage as it seeks to surpass bitcoin.\n\nBut ether has continued to lag its larger rival, gaining just under 60 percent this year versus a more than 80 percent jump for bitcoin.\n\nAfter trillions of dollars were wiped from the crypto market in a bruising 2022, the sector has rallied in 2023 on expectations that central bank interest rate hikes are slowing.\n\nEthereum has grown popular in so-called decentralised finance applications, which offer financial services while avoiding traditional industry gatekeepers such as banks.\n\nIt remains, however, little used in mainstream commerce or finance.\n\n\u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2023\n\n(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)\n\nAffiliate links may be automatically generated - see our ethics statement for details."

        "content": "By Guest Writer \u2022 Published: 13 Apr 2023 \u2022 15:00\n\nAs cryptocurrency evolves, many investors and traders closely monitor the potential for high returns. Two of the most prominent cryptocurrencies in the market, Ethereum (ETH) and Conflux (CFX) have seen significant growth in recent years, and many are curious about what the future holds for them. In this article, we\u2019ll explore the Collateral Network (COLT), a project that aims to unite these two platforms and discuss how it may provide investors with a potential 35x return in the coming years.\n\nConflux (CFX)\n\nAccording to CryptoPredictions.com, Conflux (CFX) is predicted to start in April 2023 at $0.43460598428125 and finish the month at $0.4312193485653. During April, the maximum forecasted CFX price is $0.54986459497704, and the minimum price is $0.37390792458439.\n\nAnother prediction by ambcrypto.com suggests that Conflux\u2019s price for April 2023 should range between $0.043 to $0.05, and the average price of CFX should be around $0.046.\n\nCoinCodex predicts that the price of Conflux Network will decrease by -1.51% over the next month and reach $0.323603 by April 24, 2023.\n\nThe expected price range for Conflux is $0.3584222366319 to $0.41092858638443 for May 2023. The highest and lowest predicted CFX prices for May are $0.52709152445868 and $0.3584222366319, respectively.\n\nIt is anticipated that Conflux will begin trading in June 2023 at $0.40271001465674 and end the month at $0.51986842733983. The highest and lowest predicted CFX prices for June are $0.53017742292786 and $0.36052064759095, respectively.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nThe minimum price of Ethereum in 2023 will be $1,988.01, according to a technical analysis of anticipated price changes. The highest point that the price of ETH can go to is $2,434.86. The anticipated average market price is $2,063.30.\n\nAfter researching Ethereum prices in 2023, experts in the field are prepared to share their projected trading for June 2023: $1,745.26. The ETH price ranges between $1,669.96 and $1,906.12, respectively.\n\nThe price of Ethereum will trade at an average amount of $1,888.40 in the middle of fall 2023. According to cryptocurrency experts, the price of ETH in September 2023 may range between $1,813.10 alongside $2,141.10.\n\nThe most recent information indicates that Ethereum\u2019s price is currently $1,774.36 and is currently rated No. 2 in the whole crypto market. With a capitalisation of 122,373,866 ETH, Ethereum has a $217,135,815,125.30 circulation quantity.\n\nAt the time of writing, the cryptocurrency\u2019s current value has grown by $63.70 over the last day. Ethereum has been in a strong upward trajectory over the past week, rising by 1.31%. Recently, Ethereum has demonstrated very powerful potential, so now might be a good time to jump in and make an investment.\n\nCollateral Network (COLT)\n\nCollateral Network (COLT) is a blockchain-based platform that allows users to mint Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) against physical assets like property, rare pieces of art, etc. The NFTs are then fractionalized to allow the community to fund the loans.\n\nIt is designed to simplify the crowd-lending process, providing borrowers with access to loans from cryptocurrency investors, who can generate a passive income with their capital by funding the loan via the NFT fractions.\n\nImagine how difficult it would be to go through the protracted, complicated process of getting a loan from a conventional bank. Collateral Network (COLT), a peer-to-peer lending system that seamlessly links lenders and borrowers in the Web3 space, was created to address this issue.\n\nCollateral Network (COLT) stands out for its innovative use of tangible assets as lending collateral. Imagine Alex possesses a priceless $50,000 rare watch and requires a loan for home renovations. On the Collateral Network (COLT) system, Alex can mint the watch as an NFT and fractionalize it to enable decentralised peer-to-peer lending.\n\nThe native token of Collateral Network, COLT, provides owners with various advantages, including lower interest rates, trading costs, staking rewards, governance rights, and more.\n\nThe Collateral Network (COLT) presale offers a special investment opportunity because it aims to transform the conventional lending industry. Experts anticipate that this ground-breaking cryptocurrency, which is currently trading at $0.014, up 40% from its initial price of $0.01, will rise to 3500% during the ongoing presale, demonstrating the enormous future possibilities of Collateral Network. Impressively, presale buyers enjoy a 40% deposit bonus, further showing the immense potential of Collateral Network (COLT)\u2019s presale.\n\nRead more about the COLT presale here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.collateralnetwork.io/\n\nPresale: https://app.collateralnetwork.io/register\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/collateralnwk\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Collateralnwk\n\nSponsored\n\nWARNING: The investment in crypto assets is not regulated, it may not be suitable for retail investors and the total amount invested could be lost\n\nAVISO IMPORTANTE: La inversi\u00f3n en criptoactivos no est\u00e1 regulada, puede no ser adecuada para inversores minoristas y perderse la totalidad del importe invertido"

        "content": "South African crypto exchanges are optimistic about this week\u2019s upgrade of Ethereum (ETH), the world\u2019s second most popular digital currency after Bitcoin.\n\nThis, after the software that underpins the second-biggest crypto coin was upgraded on Wednesday in a process called the \u201cMerge\u201d.\n\nThe Ethereum Merge is the joining of Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake Beacon Chain with the Ethereum Mainnet to transition the Ethereum blockchain off the legacy proof-of-work system.\n\nThe event gives Ethereum investors access to more than $30 billion (R543 billion) of the digital tokens.\n\nWhile some of the exchanges ITWeb spoke to say they are seeing an uptick in Ethereum trading on their platforms since the upgrade, some say it\u2019s still too early to tell, and they are taking a cautious approach to the development.\n\nProof-of-stake switch\n\nChristo de Wit, Luno country manager for South Africa, says the Shanghai upgrade, as the latest upgrade is known, was the most anticipated Ethereum upgrade since the Merge last year, also known as the Paris upgrade, when the network completed its switch from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake.\n\nDe Wit explains that Shanghai will allow stakers, also referred to as validators, to unstake funds that have been locked since work started on this switch in December 2020.\n\n\u201cAhead of the upgrade, analysts were looking at how many stakers would withdraw their Ethereum. Specifically, how many of these stakers would withdraw their rewards earned versus how many withdraw rewards and the base amount staked.\n\n\u201cWith uncertainty around locked coins no longer an issue, they also wondered how many new investors would stake Ethereum,\u201d he says.\n\nDavid Porter, GM of AltCoinTrader, says up until now, \u201cvalidators on the Ethereum network weren\u2019t able to withdraw their staked Ethereum, of which a minimum of 32 ETH was required in order to run your own validator\u201d.\n\nAccording to Porter, this is not an insignificant amount of capital to have tied up and equates to over R1 million at today\u2019s prices.\n\n\u201cWith the latest upgrade, users can now \u2018unstake\u2019 their ETH for the first time since December 2020.\u201d\n\nSays Farzam Ehsani, CEO and co-founder of VALR: \u201cThe funds that were staked to ensure the integrity of the blockchain which were previously locked up are now available to be withdrawn and certain other optimisations to the network were included in the upgrade.\u201d\n\nCrypto confidence\n\nAsked about the local market\u2019s reaction to the Merge, De Wit says the Shanghai upgrade was triggered on 12 April at 22:27 UTC, which was just after midnight in South Africa.\n\n\u201cAt this stage it is too early to definitively comment on the reaction of South African investors. In anticipation of the upgrade, there was a lot of excitement in the crypto community, as the upgrade would conclude the Ethereum blockchain\u2019s migration to a full proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.\u201d\n\nWhile it\u2019s too early to tell, De Wit points out that according to beaconcha.in, roughly half an hour after the Shanghai upgrade was activated, about $10 million worth of ETH had been processed.\n\n\u201cWe have seen that the price of Ethereum has remained stable and risen slightly in the immediate period after the upgrade, which could signal confidence in the network and the upgrade.\u201d\n\nPorter says AltCoinTrader is seeing a small uptick in the volumes of Ethereum traded on its platform since the event. Like investors elsewhere, local crypto investors have been cautiously optimistic about this upgrade, he notes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously an important milestone on the Ethereum roadmap, but there was a fear that unlocking 18 million ETH for withdrawal (about 16% of the total supply) may lead to some sell-side pressures on the market.\n\n\u201cHowever, this fear appears to have been largely unfounded. Personally, I think that investors know the value and, of course, the potential future value of their ETH and are not simply rushing to unstake their ETH now that they can.\n\n\u201cWe think this may just be borne from the positive market sentiment generally and perhaps the sense that \u2018another successful Ethereum upgrade\u2019 has been completed. In short, I don\u2019t think the upgrade itself has led to increased trading volumes.\u201d\n\nLikewise, Ehsani says VALR has seen an increase in ETH transactions.\n\n\u201cSouth African and global investors have received the news of the successful upgrade in a very positive light. Ethereum is trading 9% higher in the last 24 hours at the time of my response.\u201d"

        "content": "Arbitrum has emerged as a fresh and promising addition to the Ethereum blockchain, offering a revolutionary approach to transacting on the network. Serving as a Layer-2 scaling solution, Arbitrum utilizes an innovative technique called optimistic rollups, which drastically enhances the speed, scalability, and cost-effectiveness of Ethereum transactions.\n\nIf you have experienced Ethereum 1.0 as being sluggish, cumbersome, and costly, then Arbitrum may be the solution you have been searching for! This piece will examine the Arbitrum ecosystem, detailing its origins, attributes, advantages, and impact on the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector.\n\nWho Founded Arbitrum?\n\nOff-Chain Labs, a New York-based development firm established by three former Princeton University researchers \u2013 Ed Felten, Steven Goldfeder, and Harry Kalodner, is responsible for creating Arbitrum, a Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum. The team brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to the table, thanks to their expertise in computer science and blockchain, and their academic and research backgrounds.\n\nEd Felten, who holds a computer science professorship at Princeton, is the Chief Scientist and co-founder of Off-Chain Labs. Steven Goldfeder, a computer scientist, serves as the CEO and co-founder, while Harry Kalodner is the co-founder and CTO of Off-Chain Labs.\n\nArbitrum\u2019s Distinctive Characteristics\n\nArbitrum\u2019s optimistic roll-up approach is unique for multiple reasons, notably, its capacity to deliver rapid and effective smart contract execution. Being completely compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), it enables Ethereum developers to utilize their existing tools and smart contracts without requiring any alterations.\n\nMoreover, the system is decentralized and secure and does not rely on centralized operators to sequence transactions. In addition, the platform offers versatility by allowing developers to deploy programs written in commonly-used programming languages.\n\nArbitrum\u2019s Native Cryptocurrency\n\nArbitrum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, ARB, was launched on March 23, 2023, with 12.75% of the total token supply distributed among eligible recipients and DAOs. The ERC-20 token is primarily used for paying transaction fees and accessing other services on the Arbitrum Network. By holding ARB tokens, users have the power to participate in network governance by voting on proposals that impact the Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova Chains.\n\nThese proposals include important decisions such as the allocation of bounties and grants, integration of new features, chain upgrades, and the use of funds from the DAO treasury. The total maximum supply of ARB tokens has been set at 10 billion.\n\nA Meme Token With Great Potential: The Promising Future Of Big Eyes Coin\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG) is an ERC-20 token that has caught the attention of the crypto community with its unique approach. Despite being a meme token, Big Eyes Coin aims to offer more than just a cute image. The presale of the token has raised an impressive $32.5 million and is close to reaching its $50 million target.\n\nOne of the primary objectives of Big Eyes Coin is to give back to its community. The token has a focus on charity, offers exciting loot boxes, and hosts NFT clubs. Furthermore, BIG is currently running a promotion that provides a 250% return to those who enter the code \u201cBULLRUN250\u201d after purchasing BIG tokens or loot boxes.\n\nAlthough Big Eyes Coin may appear to be another meme coin, the team behind it is genuinely dedicated to creating a community-centric and charitable experience for its users.\n\nFind out more about Big Eyes Coin (BIG):\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

With time, more networks and cryptocurrencies appeared, threatening to unseat Bitcoin\u2019s runner-up.\n\nIn this context, there are several such digital assets that have stood out as potential \u2018Ethereum killers\u2019 due to the challenge they present to the second-largest crypto asset by market capitalization, as well as their perceived capability to possibly even replace the Ethereum coin as the second most famous asset on the crypto market.\n\nSolana (SOL)\n\nSolana (SOL) has emerged as a strong contender to Ethereum\u2019s domination thanks to its lower gas fees and high transaction rates (although Ethereum is catching up with its network updates), as well as the use of the Proof-of-History (PoH) consensus mechanism with other more conventional algorithms.\n\nAs things stand, Solana is currently changing hands at the price of $24.04, up 1.35% in the last 24 hours, in addition to gaining 14.59% over the previous seven days after it revealed a new solution promising to reduce the cost of on-chain storage. It has also gained 18% on its monthly chart, as well as a whopping 142.31% since the year\u2019s turn, according to data retrieved on April 13.\n\nSolana year-to-date (YTD) price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nPolkadot (DOT)\n\nDescribing itself as a \u2018Layer 0 blockchain,\u2019 Polkadot (DOT) has recently filed a trademark application for the blockchain communication platform \u2018Polkadot Converse\u2019 as well as updating its ecosystem with Kagome 0.9.0, a Polkadot Host implementation written in C++.\n\nIts price at press time stood at $6.42, increasing 2% in the past 24 hours, 0.26% over the previous week, as well as 5.21% on its monthly chart. In terms of its year-to-date (YTD) gains, Polkadot has added 46.73% to its value, as the recent charts demonstrate.\n\nPolkadot year-to-date (YTD) price chart.

On April 6, the team launched its Cortina upgrade on the protocol\u2019s testnet, promising improved Avalanche\u2019s X-Chain support for crypto exchanges and faster development, among other benefits.\n\nCurrently, Avalanche is changing hands at the price of $28.54, which demonstrates a 2.38% climb in the last 24 hours, in addition to increasing its value by 3.03% across the week and 12.59% in the previous month, whereas its gains since January 1 amount to 69.89%.\n\nAvalanche year-to-date (YTD) price chart.

However, those losses are offset by the year-to-date (YTD) gains of 46.69%\n\nPolygon year-to-date (YTD) price chart.

First, it announced a partnership with Google Cloud, and then it unveiled the Mumbai protocol, one of its most significant upgrades to date, promising to push Tezos ahead of its competition.\n\nMeanwhile, the Tezos price chart has been slightly choppy in recent days, at press time trading at the price of $1.11, up 0.53% on the day, despite losing 2.85% in the last seven days. On its monthly chart, however, Tezos has gained 1.30%, adding up to the 2023 increase of 52.54%.\n\nTezos year-to-date (YTD) price chart.

        "content": "Ethereum\u2018s much-anticipated Shanghai upgrade was successfully activated a few hours ago. Triggered around 22:27 UTC and finalized by 22:42 UTC, the upgrade now allows for the withdrawal of staked Ether. Data from beaconcha.in showed that within 30 minutes of the upgrade\u2019s activation, approximately 285 withdrawals, involving around 5,413 ETH valued at $10 million, were processed. As of press time, nearly 783.95k Ethereum tokens worth $150 billion were pending withdrawal.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Shanghai Upgrade goes live, opening the floodgates for withdrawals\n\nOn Thursday, Binance announced that users who staked Ether (ETH) through the exchange could begin redeeming coins with their BETH holdings at a 1:1 ratio starting April 19, 08:00 coordinated universal time (UTC).\n\nHowever, Binance cautioned that once submitted, withdrawal requests cannot be canceled, and the process might initially be slow, taking anywhere from 15 days to several weeks for completion.\n\nUsers will receive the redeemed Ether in their spot wallets, but BETH tokens locked in pending ETH withdrawal requests will not be eligible for staking rewards.

        "title": "ETH Price Prediction - The Ethereum Price Goes Up After Shanghai Update's Success - Inside Bitcoins",
        "content": "Don\u2019t invest unless prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, you shouldn\u2019t expect to be protected if something goes wrong.\n\nJoin Our Telegram channel to stay up to date on breaking news coverage\n\nThe price of ETH surged past $2,000 for the first time since August 2021, experiencing an 11% increase in the last 24 hours following the successful transition of Ethereum\u2019s network to the PoS protocol. Investors are now curious about the future price of ETH, and we have a few predictions of our own.\n\nShanghai Update: ETH\u2019s Price Surges After Successful Transition to PoS Protocol\n\nCryptocurrency enthusiasts were eagerly anticipating the effects of the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade, also known as Shapella, on the price of Ether (ETH). Some analysts predicted that the upgrade would result in a sell-off of ETH once it\u2019s completed, causing its price to plummet.\n\nHowever, the opposite occurred. ETH\u2019s price surged past $2,000 for the first time since last August and continued to rise steadily. It was recently trading over $2,100, up more than 11% over the past 24 hours.\n\nAccording to Ilya Volkov, CEO and co-founder of crypto trading service provider YouHodler, traders had been waiting for the end of the upgrade to start long position accumulation, and neutral news about U.S. inflation, coupled with deferred demand, pushed ETH price up.\n\nIf current macroeconomic conditions remain stable, Volkov believes that ETH will continue its upward trend, even if selling pressure increases in subsequent weeks.\n\nThe Ethereum network has undergone a significant upgrade from the proof-of-work (PoW) protocol to the proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol. The former is known for its energy-intensive usage, while the PoS mechanism is preferred for eco-friendly operation.\n\nThis transition has been the center of attention for many market observers who have been closely monitoring the impact of this change on the network\u2019s performance and the price of its native token, ETH.\n\nDespite initial doubts about the outcome of this transition, it appears that the adoption of the Shapella upgrade has had a positive effect on the overall market sentiment toward Ethereum. This has resulted in a surge in the token\u2019s price, indicating a possible rise in confidence among investors.\n\nMoving to a PoS protocol is beneficial in several ways. It boosts the network\u2019s energy efficiency while also improving its security and scalability, making it more resistant to attacks and able to handle an increasing number of users.\n\nThe Ethereum network is well-positioned now to continue its upward trajectory and remain a leading player in the rapidly evolving blockchain ecosystem with the successful implementation of the Shapella upgrade.\n\nBitcoin also saw a moderate increase, while other major cryptocurrencies experienced significant growth. The token\u2019s performance was up nearly 5%. The overall crypto market cap too crossed the much-awaited 1.2 Trillion mark and is fairly near the 1.3 Trillion mark at the time of writing.\n\nDespite the recent upward trend, the trajectory of ETH deposits into ETH staking contracts since January 2021 suggests that the asset is gaining, not losing, favor. However, as investors who must un-stake ETH begin the process of doing so, this metric will likely flatten over the coming weeks and months. But for those who want to stake, Shapella\u2019s completion signals reduced risk, increased liquidity, and brought an uptick in asset value.\n\nETH Technical Analysis\n\nEthereum\u2019s price has skyrocketed following the Shanghai upgrade. The digital currency has surpassed Bitcoin, experiencing a 7% surge in today\u2019s trading and reaching its highest point since August of last year.\n\nEthereum\u2019s market performance has surpassed the 65.00 resistance level and currently stands at 69.44. However, if the currency falls back into the $1,800 to $1,700 support range, the token could be facing some issues. If that occurs, ETH may return to either the midpoint at $1,750 or the range low at $1,687.\n\nDespite the lack of clear signs of a rally, traders do not expect any panic selling. Unless there is a significant increase in the number of staking unlock requests, Ether\u2019s price could remain near $2,100 for the foreseeable future. However, a reentry into the support zone could cause a downward trend for the cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum was trading above the major simple moving averages (SMAs), indicating robust support on the downside. The SMAs were also facing upward, suggesting that the market still favored the upside. A resistance level of 75.00 appears to be the next hurdle for bulls, and should momentum continue in an upward direction, ETH could move above $2,200 this week.\n\nAlthough the Shapella upgrade may not be garnering attention at the moment, it has promising implications for the future of the Ethereum network. By moving from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS), the network\u2019s energy efficiency, security, and scalability are all enhanced, providing more protection against possible threats and allowing for a larger user base.\n\nETH\u2019s Price Prediction For 2023\n\nEthereum\u2019s recent surge in price following the Shanghai upgrade has been significant, but traders remain cautious about a potential reentry into the support zone. We have a few predictions of our own and here\u2019s where we believe ETH\u2019s price could land in the near future.\n\nThe price of Ethereum (ETH) is expected to continue rising as it breaks through key resistance levels, potentially reaching $3,000. The relative strength index (RSI) for ETH has shot above 70, indicating strong momentum, while its 30-day moving average is rising above the 200-day average, suggesting a breakout rally.\n\nThe successful launch of Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade has also fueled bullish sentiment among investors, despite concerns that it could trigger a sell-off. The upgrade unlocks 16.3 million ETH worth around $30.5 billion, but the amount awaiting withdrawal represents only 5% of the total amount staked and will be gradually released into the market.\n\nThere are estimates from analysts that suggest that with the successful launch of the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade, approximately 60% of Ethereum\u2019s total supply may end up being staked. This could result in a decrease in supply and an increase in demand, which could be advantageous for Ethereum.\n\nIf the value of the token continues to rise, it could reach $3,000 in the middle of this year and may even go up to $4,000 by the start of 2024. Moreover, if there is a new bull market in the following year (which could be more likely due to the next Bitcoin halving), Ethereum might have a chance to break its current record high of $4,878.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "title": "Bull run events and crypto ATH - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "Many technical terms related to crypto markets are used among insiders: two of them, closely related to each other, are bull run and ATH.\n\nThree major bull runs have already occurred in the past, during which the major cryptocurrencies have hit their ATHs.\n\nCrypto bull runs and the reaching of ATHs\n\nFor a long time now, investors and speculators who buy into the financial markets by driving up prices are called bulls.\n\nBy definition, bulls are those investors who think that the market, or a specific asset, is ready to go up in price. In other words, they are those who take a bullish approach at any given time, and therefore buy in the hope of being able to resell at higher prices in the future.\n\nIn contrast, bearish people are called bears.\n\nIt is worth noting that bulls often turn into bears in times of panic, or bears turn into bulls in times of enthusiasm.\n\nWhen a large number of bulls collectively move large amounts of capital to make purchases, this tends to have a positive impact on prices, causing them to rise. In cases where such a dynamic goes on for a long time it is called a bull run.\n\nSo far only three large bull runs lasting several months have occurred in the crypto markets. In all three cases they occurred the year after the one of the three Bitcoin halvings that have occurred to date, and in all three cases they have lasted more or less a year.\n\nThe first crypto bull run and ATH event\n\nBitcoin\u2019s first halving occurred in 2012, when Ethereum did not yet exist. Indeed, the first big bull run, in 2013, specifically involved the price of Bitcoin, which rose in less than twelve months from about $10 to about $1,100.\n\nThe gain was nearly 11,000%, although the speculative bubble subsequently burst and in 2014-2015 the price returned to $150.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s second halving occurred in 2016, which was the year after the creation of Ethereum but the year before the creation of BNB. The second big bull run, in 2017, mainly involved Ethereum, which went from $10 to $1,400 in less than twelve months.\n\nTo be fair, several altcoins already existed in 2017, so much so that some, such as Ripple (now XRP), recorded even bigger jumps. But many of those that made a bang in 2017-2018 later failed to return to those levels, XRP foremost among them.\n\nThe second halving occurred in 2020, with the third big bull run occurring in 2021. In this last big bull run it was mostly altcoins, such as BNB, Dogecoin, or Shiba Inu, that recorded stratospheric performances, far more than Bitcoin or Ethereum.\n\nThe next halving will take place in 2024, in the spring.\n\nThe All-Time-High (ATH)\n\nATH is trivially an acronym for All Time High, meaning literally the highest price of all time.\n\nSpecifically, when it comes to financial markets it refers to a value that is greater than all previous values of the same parameter or price of the same asset.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price hit its ATH on 10 November 2021, obviously in the midst of a bull run, when it briefly exceeded $69,000.\n\nThe ATH of ETH (Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency) was also recorded on 10 November 2021, almost at $4,900.\n\nBNB\u2019s price, on the other hand, touched its absolute all-time highs on 10 May, also in 2021, just below $690.\n\nIt is worth noting that XRP\u2019s ATH remains that of 7 January 2018, namely of the previous big bull run, when it touched $3.4.\n\nThis means that it is not always the case that when a bull run is triggered in the crypto markets that all cryptocurrencies record a new ATH.\n\nTo date, Bitcoin has always registered a new ATH in all big bull runs, as has Ethereum, even though it has had one less.\n\nIndeed, almost all of those cryptocurrencies that were born after the 2017 bull run, but before the 2021 bull run, have had their highest prices recorded precisely in 2021, or at most in early 2022.\n\nIn contrast, among those that had already gone through the 2017 bull run are several that failed to return near the ATH in 2021. Ripple, which is now called XRP, but also Tron, Monero, Stellar, Bitcoin Cash, and so on.\n\nWhen will the next bull run occur\n\nNo one knows when the next big bull run might trigger, but in theory it could start after Bitcoin\u2019s next halving.\n\nIt is worth noting that back in 2020 the halving occurred in the spring, while for example in 2016 it was in the summer. In both cases, however, the bull run started either in December of that year or in January of the following year.\n\nHowever, there is no certainty that Bitcoin\u2019s halving of 2024 will produce a new big bull run in 2025, even though Bitcoin\u2019s four-year cycles to date have always exhibited similar trends capable of affecting the performance of the entire crypto market.\n\nIn addition, there is also no certainty that, in the event of a new big bull run, the prices of major cryptocurrencies will make new ATHs.\n\nFor example, what happened to XRP during the last two bull runs could also happen to DOGE in the future, so there is no guarantee that prices should go up.\n\nIn addition, by now the price of Bitcoin has amply demonstrated that it is influenced by the monetary policies of central banks. In particular the US central bank, so the entire dynamics above may also be significantly affected in the future by decisions made by the Fed."
