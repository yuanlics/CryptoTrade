        "title": "Ethereum relies heavily on Amazon servers. Here's why that's a problem - DLNews",
        "content": "The Ethereum ecosystem relies heavily on cloud computing like that provided by Amazon.\n\nAn overreliance on it could cause millions in losses for those staking Ether and impact usability.\n\nDeFi\u2019s main selling point is its decentralisation \u2014 no bosses, no hierarchies, and accessible to all. No other blockchain offers that promise like Ethereum.\n\nBut an overreliance on cloud computing servers including Amazon threatens that decentralisation \u2014 creating weak points that could render Ethereum unusable if such servers go offline.\n\n\u201cWhat good is it to have a diversity of people running nodes and a geographically distributed network if in the end it\u2019s all running with the same cloud provider?\u201d Sajida Zouarhi, a product manager at Blocknative, an Ethereum data analytics firm, told DL News.\n\nMany companies that provide vital Ethereum infrastructure, such as ConsenSys, rely on virtual servers rented from cloud computing providers like Amazon Web Services.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nAnd a large portion of Ethereum\u2019s execution nodes \u2014 software instances responsible for producing new blocks on the network \u2014 are also hosted virtually on cloud servers.\n\nIf too much Ethereum infrastructure is hosted via one provider or at one data centre, any issues \u2014 such as power outages or other technical issues \u2014 threaten to knock large chunks of the network and the technology built on top of it offline.\n\nIt also gives cloud service providers the power to hamstring the blockchain networks which rely on them.\n\n\u201cEthereum could do better,\u201d StrategicHash, a pseudonymous blockchain researcher, told DL News.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nHe cited data from ethernodes.org, which shows 2,439 of Ethereum\u2019s 6,810 nodes are hosted via AWS \u2014 about 35%. \u201cIdeally we want one service provider to hold a maximum of 25%.\u201d\n\nOf these 2,439 AWS-hosted nodes, around 1,395 are located in a single data centre in Ashburn, Virginia.\n\nNOW READ: LBRY founder \u2018won\u2019t respect\u2019 US after judge sides with SEC against decentralised file-sharing firm\n\nStill, cloud hosting \u2014 in particular through AWS \u2014 is popular. It is often cost-effective for smaller organisations that can\u2019t afford to purchase and maintain hardware themselves.\n\nFor those running Ethereum nodes, cloud services are also seen as more reliable, as the large data centres where they\u2019re hosted have access to more stable electricity and internet connections.\n\nSlashing risk\n\nAn AWS outage is unlikely to bring Ethereum to a standstill \u2014 other nodes hosted elsewhere would continue to process transactions.\n\nHowever, StrategicHash said, an outage could still cause a lot of damage.\n\nHe explained that those staking Ether through nodes hosted on AWS would get slashed due to inactivity, resulting in thousands, if not millions of dollars of losses.\n\nSlashing refers to taking away some Ether from nodes who either act maliciously, or don\u2019t do their job correctly, like being offline when they should be checking transactions.\n\nAn outage would also reduce the number of nodes on Ethereum making the network temporarily more centralised and susceptible to attack.\n\nBut while Ethereum will likely keep chugging along, an overreliance on AWS hosting could still be a big problem for the blockchain\u2019s users.\n\n\u2018An AWS incident can have a vast impact on user-facing applications such as hosted frontends or crypto wallets\u2019 \u2014 Pascal Caversaccio\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not that much afraid of any consensus failures due to cloud hosting but rather on its impact on the user,\u201d Pascal Caversaccio, a blockchain security researcher, told DL News.\n\n\u201cAn AWS incident can have a vast impact on user-facing applications such as hosted frontends or crypto wallets,\u201d Caversaccio said.\n\nHe noted MetaMask, the most popular Ethereum wallet with over 21 million monthly users, relies on software hosted on AWS to submit transactions to Ethereum.\n\nIf the AWS servers where this software is hosted go down, MetaMask effectively stops working.\n\nNOW READ: SEC\u2019s probe of puny BarnBridge DAO augurs deep DeFi crackdown\n\nSuch a situation played out last year when Infura, MetaMask\u2019s default remote procedure call provider, which lets the wallet\u2019s users interact with blockchains, experienced an hours-long outage.\n\nWhile the problem can be fixed by switching from MetaMask\u2019s default RPC to a third-party provider, most users won\u2019t have the technical ability to do so.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to actively educate people what to do in such situations,\u201d Caversaccio said.\n\nNot immune\n\nEven DeFi protocols \u2014 which sell themselves on their ability to process transactions around-the-clock \u2014 are not immune. Some rely on AWS.\n\nIn December 2021, an AWS outage caused decentralised exchange dYdX to stop processing transactions. In a tweet, dYdX said \u201cthere are still some parts of the exchange that rely on centralised services,\u201d mentioning AWS specifically.\n\nBut the data shows Ethereum is becoming less reliant on cloud services. In 2020, over 70% of execution nodes were hosted virtually.\n\nSince then, that number has decreased to around 60% as more chose to run nodes from their homes to make the network more decentralised and resilient.\n\nNOW READ: A 20-year-old Argentinian behind the $200m Euler hack says he\u2019s now in a Paris jail\n\nHowever, despite the move away from cloud hosting, Amazon Web Services has become more dominant, and now accounts for a higher proportion of hosted Ethereum nodes than it did before.\n\nAdditionally, there are other ways to benefit from the perks of remote cloud servers while mitigating some of the risks.\n\n\u201cA possible solution is to encourage hosting on bare metal rather than cloud providers,\u201d StrategicHash said.\n\nBare metal refers to physical computer servers that are used by one tenant only, as opposed to cloud servers which share hardware with several other tenants.\n\n\u201cBare Metal is cheaper, faster and is unlikely to go down all at once,\u201d StrategicHash said.\n\nDo you have a tip or information on how DeFi uses cloud computing or another story?

        "content": "There are several blockchain networks competing for a piece of Ethereum\u2019s smart contract and DeFi market share. Projects like BNB Smart Chain, Cardano, Solana, Tron, Polkadot, and Avalanche are some of the most prominent \u201cEthereum killers\u201d.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is a blockchain protocol that supports decentralized applications and smart contracts. It is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and the most widely used platform for decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nHowever, it also faces some challenges, such as high gas fees, network congestion, scalability issues, and environmental concerns. Therefore, many other blockchain platforms have emerged as potential competitors or alternatives to Ethereum, offering different features and advantages.\n\nIn this article, we are going to examine the most prominent Ethereum competitors and look into pros and cons of 6 crypto projects that are vying to become the next Ethereum.\n\nNative Coin Total Unique Add.

Analyzing the top 6 \u201cEthereum killers\u201d\n\nWhen talking about the \u201cnext Ethereum\u201d, we are referring to cryptocurrency projects that are leveraging blockchain and smart contract technology for developing DeFi and NFT solutions, which is currently the arena Ethereum is dominating thanks to its first mover advantage. In the following sections, we are going to examine six projects with robust feature sets and active communities that could challenge Ethereum\u2019s dominating market share in the future.\n\n1. BNB Smart Chain\n\nBNB Smart Chain (BSC) is a blockchain platform launched by the popular cryptocurrency exchange Binance. Powered by its native token BNB, BSC aims to provide an alternative to the Ethereum network by offering faster and cheaper transactions. It achieves this by using a different consensus mechanism called Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA). BSC's compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) allows developers to easily migrate their dApps from Ethereum to BSC, leveraging its high throughput and low fees.\n\nWhy is BNB Smart Chain considered the next Ethereum?\n\nThanks to a large number of users, familiar features that are heavily inspired by the Ethereum blockchain, and backing by the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, BNB Smart Chain is considered as the top Ethereum killer.\n\n2. Cardano\n\nCardano (ADA) is a blockchain platform that aims to provide a secure and sustainable infrastructure for the development of decentralized applications and smart contracts. Built using a peer-reviewed academic approach, Cardano boasts a high level of security and scalability. It utilizes a unique consensus algorithm called Ouroboros, which ensures that the network remains decentralized while maintaining fast transaction processing.\n\nWhy is Cardano considered the next Ethereum?\n\nCardano is not only one of the most popular crypto projects but also one of the most actively developed blockchains in the space, making it not only one of the top Ethereum killers, but also a potentially good investment overall.\n\n3. Solana\n\nSolana (SOL) is a high-performance blockchain platform designed for decentralized applications and crypto-currencies. It leverages a unique combination of proof-of-stake (PoS) and proof-of-history (PoH) mechanisms to achieve fast transaction speeds and low fees. Solana's scalability and throughput make it an attractive option for developers looking to build complex applications that require high-performance capabilities.\n\nWhy is Solana considered the next Ethereum?\n\nSolana is one of the most energy-efficient and cheapest crypto networks for transferring value. In addition, Solana features a healthy ecosystem of dApps and an active community, despite SOL\u2019s rapid price decrease last year, due to its connection with the now defunct FTX exchange.\n\n4. Tron\n\nTron (TRX) is a blockchain platform that aims to create a decentralized digital entertainment ecosystem. It focuses on providing a decentralized infrastructure for content creators and consumers in the entertainment industry. Tron offers high throughput and low transaction fees, making it suitable for applications such as gaming, social media, and digital content distribution.\n\nWhy is Tron considered the next Ethereum?\n\nOver the years, Tron has emerged as a credible alternative to Ethereum due to the speed of transactions and overlapping features. Also, Tron has looked to expand its offering in recent years, integrating decentralized file-sharing capabilities with the acquisition of BitTorrent (BTT) and launching a decentralized stablecoin USDD.\n\n5. Polkadot\n\nPolkadot (DOT) is a multi-chain platform that enables the transfer of any type of data or asset across different blockchains. It aims to create a decentralized internet where different blockchains can communicate and share information securely. Polkadot's unique architecture allows for interoperability between different chains, facilitating seamless data transfer and enabling developers to leverage the strengths of multiple blockchains simultaneously.\n\nWhy is Polkadot considered the next Ethereum?\n\nPolkadot was conceived by Gavin Wood, a computer scientist and co-founder of Ethereum. Wood launched Polkadot with the intention of enhancing scalability with \u201cparachains\u201d, which enable parallel processing of transactions, allowing Polkadot to handle a larger volume of transactions compared to Ethereum.\n\n6. Avalanche\n\nAvalanche (AVAX) is a highly scalable blockchain platform that prioritizes speed, security, and decentralization. It utilizes a novel consensus protocol called Avalanche, which enables high throughput and fast finality. Avalanche's unique approach to consensus makes it highly resilient to attacks and allows for quick transaction confirmations, making it an attractive choice for developers seeking a scalable and secure blockchain platform.\n\nWhy is Avalanche considered the next Ethereum?\n\nAvalanche\u2019s focus is on overcoming some of the scalability and speed limitations of Ethereum. While the blockchain itself is capable of processing about 150 times the number of transactions as Ethereum, Avalanche has struggled to build a dApp and NFT ecosystem that could challenge Ethereum, at least so far.\n\nWhich are considered \u201cEthereum killer\u201d coins?\n\nIn addition to the blockchain networks described above, like BNB Smart Chain, Cardano, and Polkadot, there are numerous other platforms considered members of the group of Layer 1 networks called Ethereum killers.\n\nSome examples of blockchain platforms that have an overlapping feature set as Ethereum include several smaller market cap projects, including Cosmos, Ethereum Classic, Near Protocol, Tezos, Algorand, and Fantom.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that several Layer 2 solutions that aim to alleviate scalability issues on the Ethereum network, like Arbitrum, Polygon, and Optimism, are also considered by some as Ethereum competitors. However, that categorization would be somewhat nonsensical, as these solutions aim to enhance the operations of the Ethereum blockchain, not replace it.\n\nAre Bitcoin and Ethereum competitors?\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are both cryptocurrencies that use blockchain technology, but they have different purposes and features. Bitcoin is designed as a digital currency and a store of value, while Ethereum is a platform for smart contracts and decentralized applications. Therefore, they are not direct competitors but rather complementary projects that aim to solve different problems using blockchain technology.\n\nHowever, from the perspective of traders and investors, Bitcoin and Ethereum may be seen as competitors as they vie for market share and adoption. Bitcoin is the first and largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, and it has a high level of security, decentralization, and network effects. Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, and it has a high level of innovation, functionality, and scalability. Both cryptocurrencies have their advantages and disadvantages, and their performance may vary depending on market conditions and user demand.\n\nThe bottom line: There are several blockchain platforms vying to become the next Ethereum\n\nEthereum was the first major blockchain platform to build the necessary infrastructure and building blocks to support the creation of decentralized applications, decentralized financial systems, and new tokens, thanks to the ERC-20 token standard. Since its launch in 2015, numerous other networks have tried to overcome Ethereum\u2019s first mover advantage, but to no avail. BSC comes the closest, especially in terms of active users, however, the ecosystem of products and services is considerably smaller on BSC than on Ethereum. Other networks, like Cardano, Solana, and Polkadot, are even further removed, despite their ability to process considerably more transactions and at a lower price than Ethereum\n\nFor more information about whether it is a good idea to buy Ethereum, and what are the pros and cons of investing in Ethereum, you can check the video below."

        "title": "Should You Buy Ethereum While It's Still Below $2,500? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "For the first six months of 2023, Ethereum (ETH 0.55%) was one of the standout performers in the crypto market. Ethereum is now up 55% year to date, and was recently trading at $1,865.\n\nHowever, of late, Ethereum has had difficulty pushing past the $2,000 price level, much as Bitcoin had trouble breaking through the $30,000 mark. Clearly, crypto investors are mixed on what's going to happen next in the financial markets, and there could be some turbulence ahead. So should you buy Ethereum while it's still trading below $2,500? Here's what you need to know.\n\nEthereum as market leader\n\nOne major factor in Ethereum's favor is that it remains the acknowledged market leader in just about every niche of the blockchain and crypto world, from non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to decentralized finance (DeFi), the metaverse, and Web3. In part, this is due to Ethereum's first-mover advantage. Ethereum was first to market with innovations such as smart contracts, and has not let up since then, despite the arrival of many new competitors.\n\nTake, for example, the NFT market. Ethereum created the NFT boom with groundbreaking collections such as the Bored Ape Yacht Club and the CryptoPunks, and these remain among the most valuable NFT collections in the world. All of the top 25 NFT collections are on the Ethereum blockchain. And while Bitcoin has had some recent success with the introduction of Ordinals, Ethereum still remains the top blockchain in terms of NFT sales volume. As a long-term investor, that's exactly what I'm looking for: a best-in-class crypto with a clear competitive advantage and a huge market share edge.\n\nTrack record of tech upgrades\n\nAnother key factor in Ethereum's favor is its strong track record of new technological upgrades. With each new upgrade, Ethereum remains one step ahead of the competition. Last year, for example, Ethereum captured the imagination of investors with The Merge, its long-anticipated transformation from a proof-of-work blockchain to a proof-of-stake blockchain. This was a technological tour de force, with some comparing its difficulty level to that of changing the engine of an airplane mid-flight.\n\nAnd Ethereum shows no signs of letting up on these technological upgrades for its underlying blockchain infrastructure. In April, Ethereum completed the Shapella upgrade, which made Ethereum much more attractive for crypto staking. The next major upgrade, tentatively known as Dencun (a mashup of \"Cancun\" and \"Deneb\"), is coming in the fourth quarter of 2023. This upgrade will further improve Ethereum's storage capacity, scalability, and efficiency. The goal is now 100,000 transactions per second for the Ethereum blockchain, which is far more than what any of its primary competitors can offer.\n\nAt the end of 2022, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin unveiled a comprehensive series of updates and upgrades designed to transform Ethereum into \"Ethereum 2.0.\" While many of these upgrades are incredibly wonky from a technological perspective, all of them are designed to make Ethereum more attractive for both users and developers. This detailed roadmap for future development gives me tremendous confidence that Ethereum is playing the long game here, and is not just reacting instinctively to temporary moves in the crypto market.\n\nImportant caveats\n\nOf course, investing in Ethereum is hardly a slam dunk. First of all, Ethereum has plenty of competitors, all of them vying to become an \"Ethereum killer.\" And that means tremendous competition in areas such as NFTs, DeFi, the metaverse, and Web3. Over time, it is likely that Ethereum's market share in each of these segments will decline.\n\nMoreover, while Ethereum's tech upgrades are impressive, they are also extremely complex, time-consuming, and, at times, frustrating. The Merge, for example, was filled with a series of delays, to the point where some investors questioned whether it was going to happen at all.\n\nAnd, of course, crypto remains a volatile and speculative investment filled with regulatory uncertainty. Any new crypto crackdown by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), for example, could put an immediate halt on Ethereum's growth ambitions.\n\nThat being said, I remain bullish on Ethereum's future prospects. Ethereum has a best-in-class blockchain, a clear competitive advantage, and plenty of diversification, thanks to its prowess across a wide range of blockchain niches. Moreover, Ethereum has planned a series of new tech upgrades that will only make it better over time. All of which leads me to believe that, yes, you should buy Ethereum while it's still below $2,500. Even at that elevated price, Ethereum would still be nearly 50% below its all-time-high, suggesting that there's plenty of upside potential ahead."

The radio is calculated by dividing the price of Ethereum by the price of Bitcoin and offers an intriguing comparison against previous market cycles, especially when assessing performance from the cycle\u2019s all-time high (ATH).\n\nThe 2015 to 2017 cycle saw an outstanding performance from Ethereum, with returns exceeding 60,000% and markedly outperforming Bitcoin. This period marked a significant high point for the Ethereum to Bitcoin ratio.\n\nIn the subsequent cycle from 2017 to 2021, Ethereum continued to perform well, although with a decreased, impressive return high of 1,000%. This cycle hinted at a declining trend in Ethereum\u2019s dominance over Bitcoin.\n\nNow, we find ourselves in a cycle that commenced in November 2021. Ethereum\u2019s performance in this cycle is marginally better than the preceding cycle but is generally viewed as underperforming.\n\nAs we move forward, it\u2019s a point of speculation whether Ethereum will continue this pattern of underperformance in each succeeding cycle or whether it will disrupt the trend. The question arises: will Ethereum throw a \u2018spanner in the works\u2019 of this observed trend? Only time will tell."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s gas fee was below $2 at press time.\n\nEthereum L2s now have a TVL of over $9 billion.\n\nThe exorbitant cost of Ethereum [ETH] gas fees has become synonymous with the network\u2019s identity. Yet, a recent development has brought about a welcome decrease in these expenses.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nEthereum gas fee decreases\n\nSantiment recently shared an insightful update revealing a notable decrease in gas fees. The accompanying chart vividly displayed the fluctuating nature of these fees, illustrating a surge to over $7 around 5 July, followed by a subsequent decline.\n\nBefore this July spike, an even more significant surge occurred in May, with gas fees skyrocketing to nearly $14\u2014an unprecedented high for the network in the current year.\n\nAdditionally, in the last 24 hours, most fees were primarily attributed to wrapped ETH (WETH) and native ETH transactions. These two forms of Ethereum tokens accounted for the largest portion of the fees generated on the network during this period.\n\nAs of this writing, the gas price had settled around $1.93, offering significant relief to Ethereum users. It\u2019s worth noting that the lowest gas price witnessed this year occurred in February, dipping to approximately $1.7.\n\nA drop in transactions?\n\nAccording to data provided by DefiLlama, transactions on the Ethereum network have consistently maintained a steady pace, experiencing no noticeable decline since its inception. While occasional spikes have been depicted on the chart, the overall transaction volume was within the normal range.\n\nAs of this writing, the network boasted an impressive 1 million transactions.\n\nA possible reason for Ethereum\u2019s gas price drop\n\nThe Ethereum network\u2019s congestion and the consequent high gas prices have spurred the development of alternative Layer 2 solutions (L2). These solutions aim to alleviate the strain on the Ethereum mainnet, thereby reducing the fees caused by congestion.\n\nAccording to data provided by L2 Beats, L2s have gained significant traction regarding user adoption and Total Value Locked (TVL). At the time of writing, the TVL of L2s amounted to an impressive $9.51 billion, with Arbitrum and Optimism leading the market share.\n\nThe emergence of additional L2 solutions suggests the potential for lower gas fees on the Ethereum network and faster transaction processing soon.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nTrend of ETH\n\nAs of this writing, ETH has encountered a setback in its attempt to surpass the $1,900 price threshold. Although it briefly surpassed this level in the previous trading period, it experienced a slight decline in its value during the press time trading period.\n\nThe press time trading price hovered around $1,860, reflecting a less than 1% loss. On the Relative Strength Index (RSI), ETH was positioned on the neutral line, signaling a weak bullish trend."

        "content": "Ripple\u2019s XRP has been a topic of massive discussion throughout the past couple of years. It boasts one of the strongest communities, known for its passion for the company, its native cryptocurrency, and the ecosystem.\n\nEthereum, on the other hand, also has one of the largest groups of followers as it spreads across multiple purposes, use cases, and whatnot.\n\nWe decided to pin both against each other in a question to none other than the world\u2019s most popular AI-based chatbot \u2013 ChatGPT.\n\nWe asked if Ripple\u2019s XRP will outperform Ethereum\u2019s ETH in the next 5 years.\n\nIt\u2019s Not That Simple\n\nFirst things first, ChatGPT told us that we shouldn\u2019t expect any predictions on his behalf:\n\nAs an artificial intelligence model, I don\u2019t predict future events, including specific financial or investment outcomes. The performance of cryptocurrencies such as Ripple (XRP) and Ethereum (ETH) is influenced by a wide range of factors.\n\nThis was somewhat expected. It\u2019s also worth noting that it seems that ChatGPT\u2019s knowledge cutoff on this subject is in September 2021, which was quite some time ago.\n\nSo what are the factors it had in mind? They include:\n\nTechnological developments\n\nRegulatory decisions\n\nMarket demand\n\nMacroeconomic factors, and others.\n\nThere\u2019s been a lot going on in the cryptocurrency field since September 2021. In Ethereum\u2019s case, most notably, it was the Merge \u2013 the event that saw the network\u2019s long-awaited transition to a Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm.\n\nBut Wait, There\u2019s More!\n\nIn addition to the above, ChatGPT also said that the broader context is also important when assessing the potential of both cryptocurrencies.\n\nFor example, the regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies can greatly influence their adoption and price. It\u2019s also crucial to consider the broader macroeconomic climate, such as trends in institutional investment and the overall health of the global economy.\n\nETH has so far been the more obvious choice for institutional investors, with regular flows from various companies.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting, though, that there\u2019s a major difference between both cryptocurrencies \u2013 the SEC is calling XRP a security in a flat-out lawsuit that\u2019s been dragged on for a few years already. It\u2019s entirely possible that this is stopping many big investors from participating, as they might be waiting to see what the outcome of the lawsuit will be.\n\nIn conclusion, ChatGPT failed to provide a precise answer but based its arguments on important considerations, some of which have yet to unfold."

        "content": "A forensic researcher has suggested that Chinese investors may well own the vast majority of ether (ETH) in circulation via a raft of agents, LLCs, directors, advisors, and corporate structures.\n\nAs detailed by @BoringSleuth (aka TruthLabs), Ethereum was one of the first coins to distribute its initial supply through a pre-mine. Rather than a Bitcoin-like fair launch \u2014 distributing coins via mining rewards through the public operation of a blockchain \u2014 Ethereum\u2019s co-founders pre-mined the majority of their currency\u2019s supply at genesis.\n\nThe idea of a \u2018pre-mine\u2019 allocated for early investors and project developers was highly controversial when Ethereum held its initial coin offering (ICO) and it remains so today.\n\nWho owns all those early ETH wallets?\n\nEthereum has been famously tight-lipped about the owners of most of its earliest wallets. Although Vitalik Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation happily disclose some of their stash, most co-founders and pre-ICO team members received large allocations into anonymous wallets. To this day, most decline to publicly identify their wallets.\n\nAny sophisticated investor would have found it relatively easy to contribute bitcoin to Ethereum\u2019s ICO through anonymous wallets that allowed them to obfuscate their identities and total holdings. In fact, during the ICO, it was extremely simple to contribute bitcoin via multiple wallets in order to hide one\u2019s total ownership \u2014 as well as circumvent Ethereum\u2019s poorly-enforced ICO contribution limits.\n\nICO thresholds per participant proved unenforceable. Indeed, Nansen\u2019s analysis indicates that just 100 of the 8,800 accounts contributing to Ethereum\u2019s ICO received a staggering 40% of that ETH sold.\n\nDespite all of these limitations, researchers have made substantial progress in deanonymizing wallets and providing probabilistic estimates for the supply distribution of ETH.\n\nChinese mines and pre-mines\n\nIn a previous article, Protos detailed Ethereum\u2019s ties to China, including ex-Alibaba partners, a director who worked on Chinese-language apps, interest from the Bank of China, and a unique translation of the ETH whitepaper into Mandarin. Chinese individuals also had an influence on controversial matters like Ethereum\u2019s rollback of The DAO hack in June 2016.\n\nChristine Kim at Galaxy Digital conducted a detailed analysis of ETH supply distribution in June 2022. According to this research, 60% of Ethereum\u2019s total supply was allocated to users before the network\u2019s official launch while 60 million ETH, or about 50% of the total current supply, was allocated to ICO investors.\n\nRead more: Was FTX funded by Chinese capital flight?\n\nCo-founders allocated another 10% (12 million ETH) to early team members and the ostensibly non-profit Ethereum Foundation.\n\nSince then, recipients of the pre-mined supply have sent 10.3 million ETH to exchanges. This means that just 1.3 million ETH haven\u2019t moved.\n\nBut how does this relate to the issue of potential Chinese ownership? Although it\u2019s impossible to quantify the exact amount owned by Chinese investors, it\u2019s undeniable that throughout Ethereum\u2019s history, Chinese investment has always been a top priority.\n\nCourting Chinese investors\n\nWhile raising money for Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin placed great emphasis on courting Chinese investors. For example, he flew to China for a meeting with a number of them, including Wanxiang Group investment manager Deng Chao. Buterin once served as chief scientist at Wanxiang.\n\nFellow Ethereum Foundation board member Shen Bo apparently told Hashkey Group chairman Xiao Feng that the team worried it might not have enough money to launch the mainnet. The team held at least one all-night meeting about the problem. According to Xiao Feng, that was the moment he suggested contributing $500,000 to Ethereum development under Wanxiang Blockchain Labs\u2019 name.\n\nEvery $1,000 invested into Ethereum\u2019s ICO is now worth over $6 million.\n\nAs described in Laura Shin\u2019s book The Cryptopians, Buterin tolerated and supported former executive director Ming Chan for far longer than his co-founders wanted, even after she\u2019d stirred up drama involving members of the Ethereum Foundation board of directors. His motives for keeping her around for so long were unclear, even with her previous work on online Chinese-language projects.\n\nButerin also showed an obsession with learning the Chinese language, even letting it cut into his social life and work on Ethereum for weeks. By 2016, his mastery of Chinese was good enough for him to write and present a keynote address for the Shanghai Wanxiang Blockchain International Week.\n\nButerin and fellow Ethereum co-founder Anthony Di Iorio also joined the ChinaLedger initiative as advisors in May 2016. Supported by the Internet Securities Commission of the Securities Association of China, ChinaLedger aimed to research the creation of \u2018Internet of Everything\u2019 applications that could support businesses working within the Chinese regulatory environment.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting to note that Ethereum\u2019s early marketing included the concept of a \u2018World Computer\u2019 that developers could use to build nearly any blockchain-based app. Chinese entrepreneurs like Jeff Yang were already working on smart contract templates for Ethereum and Polygon. Yang was quoted as saying that China lacked a \u201creal code dev force\u201d \u2014 hinting at the possibility that, as early as 2017, China recognized that it needed Ethereum\u2019s developers as much as Buterin had needed Chinese investment money in 2015.\n\nBy 2017, Wanxiang had become known as a leading promotor of Ethereum adoption in China \u2014 something it would have been unlikely to do if it didn\u2019t have a significant stake in ETH and Ethereum-based apps.\n\nSome people theorized that Wanxiang was one of several fronts that made it possible for Chinese investors to buy up a majority of the ETH supply without raising suspicion. Again, TruthLabs has theorized that Chinese investors, through their various agents and companies, could control up to two-thirds of the ETH supply.\n\nA Chinese subsidiary funded wallets owned by Vitalik Buterin\n\nTruthLabs also found evidence that Wanxiang and its subsidiary, Fenbushi Capital, set up and funded wallets owned by Buterin.\n\nA quick \ud83e\uddf5showing that Wanxiang, Chinese auto and early Ethereum Investor funded and setup Vitalik Buterins official wallets.\n\n\n\n1/6https://t.co/4uMLLnzguq pic.twitter.com/Ec1cjLOLz2 \u2014 TruthLabs \ud83d\udc84 (@BoringSleuth) January 29, 2023 A Chinese entity funded Vitalik Buterin\u2019s ETH wallets.\n\nFenbushi Capital was founded in 2015, the same year that the Ethereum network launched. Buterin had a part-time position at Fenbushi until 2018 and even after leaving the job, retained a position as an advisor.\n\nAs major (and possibly majority) token holders, Chinese investors, including Wanxiang and HashKey, may still strongly influence ETH\u2019s development. And while much of Ethereum\u2019s blockchain is impossible to deanonymize, Wanxiang\u2019s continued support and Buterin\u2019s pro-China behavior throughout history could certainly lend a degree of credence to this theory.\n\nGot a tip?

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin All Popped on the Ripple Ruling - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "What happened\n\nThe crypto market was on fire on Thursday afternoon after a judge ruled that Ripple (XRP 0.15%) is not a security (in most cases).\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been in a battle against cryptocurrencies this year, but the first case to actually make it to court and nearly to trial is the SEC's suit against Ripple, which was filed in December 2020. There are still questions about how this applies to other tokens and whether the ruling will hold up, but for now, it's a huge win for the industry.\n\nAltcoins are popping the most today, but the big tokens are making nice gains as well. Bitcoin (BTC 0.51%) is up 4.7% in the last 24 hours as of 4 p.m. ET, Ethereum (ETH 0.50%) has risen 7.1%, and Dogecoin (DOGE -0.20%) is up 7%.\n\nSo what\n\nThe judge's ruling concluded that Ripple was a security when it was sold to institutional investors, who they said were speculating on an asset that they would then sell. But it was not a security on the secondary market because a buyer or seller on the secondary market had no way of knowing who was getting their money.\n\nIt's hard to say that this fully clarifies what is and isn't a security in the crypto industry, and it's likely the ruling will be appealed, but for now, the secondary sale of cryptocurrencies appears to be legal. This should help the ongoing trading of existing tokens, and Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin are clear leaders from a market capitalization standpoint.\n\nWhile the secondary trading of cryptocurrencies is legal -- according to this ruling -- the initial sales to institutional investors may not be. That question will go to trial, but that will include hedge funds and venture funds that bought these assets. And it's not even clear how that trial will turn out.\n\nNow what\n\nCrypto investors have been looking for some kind of clarity in the U.S. and clearly jumped on it today. However, this is only a district court ruling, and it's the first of many potential rulings. The SEC continues to go after Coinbase (COIN 0.78%), in particular, and dozens of tokens are involved in that case.\n\nI do think this will push both the courts and lawmakers to act to bring even more clarity to the market. Taking loss after loss in court isn't a good look, and almost everyone in the industry is pushing for clarity about what is and isn't a security in the digital world.\n\nThis clarity could be good for the value of Bitcoin and Dogecoin, which right now are viewed largely as stores of value or speculative assets, which seem to pass regulatory muster, at least in the secondary market. Ethereum may benefit both from secondary trading and clarity over what can be built with NFTs or other blockchain tools.\n\nAt least for today, the crypto market is cheering a judge's ruling, but with the ups and downs we have seen the last few years, the cheering might not last for very long."

        "content": "The much-anticipated Quantum Leap upgrade by layer-2 scaling protocol Starknet was recently deployed on the Ethereum mainnet, allowing for as much as 90 transactions per second (TPS), boosting the network\u2019s speed.\n\nMOARRR TPS DADDY STARKNET MAINNET QUANTUM LEAP 0.12.0\n\n\n\nLIVE ON MAINNET pic.twitter.com/RaI1XKcgy7 \u2014 Starknet (@Starknet) July 12, 2023\n\nIn an announcement sent to Cointelegraph, Uri Kolodny, the co-founder and CEO of StarkWare, said it\u2019s a momentous day for the Ethereum blockchain, as the scaling ceiling has been \u201csmashed.\u201c He explained that \u201chigh TPS is finally a reality on Ethereum mainnet\u201d because of the new update, adding:\n\n\u201cWe said this upgrade would deliver potential TPS of hundreds within Q3, and only hoped from the stress test to check we\u2019re on target. A few dozen TPS at this early point would have left us excited \u2013 but we got more than we bargained for.\u201d\n\nKolodny also highlighted that it managed to achieve a consistent 37 TPS. In addition, the executive also noted that during its peak moments, the tests showed that the transfer transactions per second almost hit 100.\n\nRelated: DeFi borrower uses luxury watch-backed NFT as collateral for a loan\n\nOn July 5, Starknet\u2019s Quantum Leap was deployed in a testnet, recording speeds of up to triple figures. At the time of the testnet deployment, the team announced it was expecting the \u201ctime to inclusion\u201d to be around 15 seconds. This means decentralized applications (DApps) can confirm on-chain transactions in seconds, but the reality exceeded expectations.\n\n\u201cWe were aiming for latency of under 15 seconds, and in the end the vast majority of transactions had a time-to-inclusion of under 10 seconds,\u201d he explained. According to the Starknet team, more throughput and faster inclusion would pave the way for faster DeFi applications. This also means that AAA-rated games will become more realistic within the network.\n\nEli Ben-Sasson, StarkWare co-founder and president, told Cointelegraph that this means the community is basically being given a \u201csupercharged power tool.\u201d With this, they will suddenly be able to build things that weren\u2019t possible until now.\n\nThe executive also highlighted the short-term and long-term effects of the new development. \u201cAlmost overnight, it will make DeFi faster and less clunky, and make on-chain gaming far more seamless. Long term, it will lead to new and creative projects that will transform how we interact with technology and each other,\u201d he explained.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: Web3 Gamer: GTA 6 crypto rumors, Dr Who/Sandbox, Thai tourist NFTs review"

        "content": "Standard Chartered made a bold prediction for Bitcoin by forecasting that the leading cryptocurrency could reach $120,000 in 2024. Bitcoin is currently trading at $30,300 levels and needs to spike approximately 300% to reach $120,000. While doing 4x in price is nothing new in the cryptocurrency markets, achieving the feat in a bear market is challenging. If Bitcoin rallies as predicted by Standard Chartered, leading altcoins might also reach new highs as they move in tandem with BTC. Ethereum would also follow Bitcoin\u2019s path and reach a new all-time high if the forecasts turn true.\n\nAlso Read: Next Cryptocurrency Bull Run Could Begin in 2024, Predicts Analyst\n\nJUST IN: $820 billion Standard Chartered Bank predicts #Bitcoin will reach $120,000 by the end of 2024. \u2014 Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) July 10, 2023\n\nIf Bitcoin Reaches $120,000, What Will Ethereum\u2019s Price Be?\n\nSource: Unsplash\n\nEthereum moves in tandem with Bitcoin and the two cryptocurrencies are the powerhouse of the digital assets market. If the forecast from Standard Chartered plays out, then Ethereum has more chances of rising 300% similar to BTC. Ethereum is currently trading at $1,870 and a 4x from here could take its price to the $7,500 level. That would be a new all-time high for ETH as its previous high stands at $4,878.\n\nAlso Read: BRICS: U.S. Has 65% Chances of Slipping Into a Recession, India Has 0%\n\nHowever, such a price rise for ETH could occur only if BTC reaches $120,000, as predicted by Standard Chartered. Nonetheless, there is no guarantee that both BTC and ETH could reach $120,000 and $7,500, respectively. The cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile and could swing both ways causing losses. It is advised to do thorough research before taking an entry position into Bitcoin and Ethereum at press time.\n\nAlso Read: VeChain: When Will VET Reclaim Its All-Time High of $0.28?\n\nPredictions about Bitcoin climbing above $100,000 is nothing new.

        "content": "Bankruptcy can be expensive, but perhaps less so when the Ethereum blockchain helps cover costs.\n\nJust ask Celsius. After filing for bankruptcy last July, estimates pegged the total compensation of its lawyers at $144 million.\n\nAnd that was before the US agencies sued the company into oblivion \u2014 amounting to a $4.7 billion Federal Trade Commission (FTC) settlement, designated to be repaid to customers.\n\nGood thing for Celsius is it\u2019s been staking ether (ETH) under its control over the past two years, not only earning it staking rewards (currently around 5%, paid in ETH) but additional maximal extractable value (MEV) as well.\n\nBlockworks analyzed blockchain data for known Ethereum addresses tied to Celsius\u2019 estate. Aside from around $114 million in ETH sitting in its addresses, Celsius has:\n\nStaked at least 356,600 ETH ($711 million) staked directly to mainnet.\n\nDeposited another 415,000 ETH ($827 million) with staking provider Figment.\n\nEarned an additional 5,100 ETH ($10 million) direct from MEV bots.\n\nCelsius took a break before staking almost 400,000 ETH last month \u2014 almost a year into bankruptcy\n\nMEV is neutral, but controversial\n\nEthereum validators can run code alongside their clients to communicate with special MEV-boosting relays.\n\nEntities known as \u201cblock builders\u201d maintain those relays. With the help of number-crunching \u201csearchers,\u201d builders present validators with more profitable orders, which add transactions to Ethereum blocks.\n\nGains made by reordering transactions are split between block builders, searchers and validators like Celsius, which began raking in MEV as soon as Ethereum switched to proof-of-stake last September.\n\nThat was only a few months after Celsius entered bankruptcy, shattered by contagion after algorithmic stablecoin Terra and defunct hedge fund firm Three Arrows Capital failed.\n\nCelsius has received nearly 42,000 payments from MEV bots to date, ranging from an eye-popping 72.76 ETH ($144,000) last November to a tiny fraction of an ETH.\n\nMEV tactics include uber-quick arbitrage, front-running and so-called \u201csandwich attacks,\u201d all taking place within the same block. Those tactics have operated in somewhat of a gray area.\n\nSome consider it exploitative, considering profit is milked from mostly unaware Ethereum users. The permissionless nature of the Ethereum ecosystem means no one can really stop it.\n\nFlashbots, one of the primary studios building MEV software, has previously proposed fair market guidelines to help keep MEV boosters in check, and has even released tools that could help protect Ethereum users from being front-run by bots.\n\nAround 80 different MEV builders have sent profits to Celsius\n\nMEV faucet handy for Celsius\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how much of Celsius\u2019 staked ETH belongs to the company itself and what percentage is earmarked for users (now creditors). Celsius has staked ETH as recently as this month.\n\nEither way, the overseers of the bankrupt Celsius\u2019 crypto smartly left its validators open to MEV builders \u2014 signaling willingness to finalize blocks from prolific builders for a cut.\n\nNovaWulf, an asset manager tied to Maryland bitcoin miner TeraWulf, was \u2014 as of April \u2014 set to manage Celsius\u2019 crypto via a new company for five years once users had been paid.\n\nBut that was one month before a consortium of crypto companies, jokingly named Fahrenheit, outbid NovaWulf and others for management of a to-be-formed firm pegged to control Celsius\u2019 assets for the betterment of creditors.\n\nArrington Capital, which makes up part of the consortium, declined to comment on whether it would continue earning MEV once that happens. NovaWulf did not respond to requests for comment. Neither firm was responsible for managing Celsius\u2019 crypto at the time its ETH was staked.\n\nIn any case, with Celsius earning $1 million MEV per month on average right now, it would still take another 11 years to generate enough to pay its previous legal fee projection (at current prices).\n\nAfter that, it would take another 380 years of MEV to pay off its massive FTC fine.\n\nA few bull markets could knock some decades off that number.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

Specifically, talks with Spot BTC ETF issuers have advanced to key technical details, with Reuters indicating that it could signal a shift toward a potential approval.\n\nAlso Read: This is the level to beat as Bitcoin eyes $50,000 next\n\nBitcoin price could overcome $43,860\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is confronting the $43,860 critical support, marking the midline of a weekly supply zone extending from $40,698 to $46,999. A decisive candlestick close above this mean threshold on the weekly timeframe would confirm the continuation of the primary trend, flipping the supply barrier into a bullish breaker and using it as the springboard for a race to the $50,000 psychological level.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains northbound despite BTC being overbought, indicating momentum continues to rise. Meanwhile, the histogram bars of the Awesome Oscillator (AO) remain in positive territory, flashing green to show that bulls are leading the BTC market. These bolster the case to the upside.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-week chart\n\nOn the flipside, if the supply zone holds as a resistance level, Bitcoin price could face a rejection, deflecting south to lose the support offered by the $40,000 psychological level. In a worse case, the fall could extend to the $30,000 psychological level, with a weekly candlestick close below this level invalidating the bullish thesis.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price hits $44,000 as Coinbase CEO speculates BTC could be key to extending Western civilization\n\nEthereum price could climb 7%\n\nEthereum (ETH) price action remains bullish since mid-October, consolidating within an ascending parallel channel.

The ensuing selling pressure could see ETH dwindle to lose the $2,147 support.\n\nEthereum price could then extend a leg down, converting the midline of the April 18 supply zone extending from $2,049 to $2,107 from a resistance area into a support area by breaking and closing below its midline at $2,075. A daily candlestick close below this level would not only invalidate the bullish thesis but also confirm the continuation of the downtrend.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH attempts to flip $2,300 into support"

        "content": "The dynamics of the crypto-verse keep shifting. Although numerous new assets have emerged, Bitcoin [BTC] has maintained its position as the top cryptocurrency in terms of value. While its position remains unchallenged, the network activity of other assets has been gaining momentum and showing signs of strength.\n\nDespite Ethereum [ETH] being significantly lower than Bitcoin in terms of price and market capitalization, the ETH network appears to be significantly more active compared to Bitcoin. This is evident from the spike in daily transactions on the Ethereum network. According to data provided by IntoTheBlock, Ethereum recorded about 944.5K daily transactions over a 30-day period, whereas Bitcoin processed a considerably lower number of transactions at only 507.5K.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum is not the sole network that has surpassed Bitcoin in transaction volume. The Algorand network recorded an impressive 540.9K daily transactions, once again surpassing Bitcoin\u2019s transaction count. This development is surprising considering the recent dip in ALGO\u2019s price. The asset has experienced a decline of more than 10.54% over the past seven days.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin: Rising Outflows & Institutions Is Setting a Bullish Path\n\nAs seen in the above image, Avalanche [AVAX] and Litecoin [LTC] demonstrated significant transaction activity. The Avalanche network successfully handled a cumulative total of 384.4K transactions. Litecoin stood out prominently due to the growing excitement surrounding its upcoming halving event. The crypto network recorded approximately 129.3K transactions. The disparity between Bitcoin, Ethereum, Algorand, and these networks is quite high.\n\nAlso Read: Litecoin Halving \u2018Hype\u2019 Fails to Rally Price Despite High Interest\n\nDogecoin fails to rake in network activity\n\nMeme coins have gained significant popularity within the crypto industry, occasionally even surpassing the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum in terms of public interest. Nonetheless, Dogecoin [DOGE] did not manage to make a notable impact on this occasion. The network of this meme coin registered a modest number of transactions, totaling just 70.1K over the past month. It should be noted that DOGE recorded an uptrend of 6.23% throughout the month.\n\nThese above-seen data highlight the ever-changing nature of the crypto ecosystem. However, the future remains uncertain in terms of how these networks will adapt to the industry.\n\nAlso Read: Dogecoin: Miners Add Millions of DOGE to Reserves, What Now?"

However, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was \u201cstill bullish for now,\u201d according to the analysis.\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nAt press time, Ethereum was changing hands at the price of $1,885.91, which represents a 1.03% gain in the last 24 hours and an increase of 7.81% across the previous 30 days, despite losing 1.9% on its weekly chart, as per the most recent data retrieved by Finbold on July 12.\n\nEthereum 24-hour price chart.

        "content": "Over the past few days, the Ethereum price has remained relatively stable, with minor gains seen on the daily chart. Meanwhile, Bitcoin\u2019s indecisiveness has resulted in slower movement for altcoins.\n\nDespite this, Ethereum has risen on its chart, although the technical outlook suggests low demand and accumulation due to reduced buying strength.\n\nDespite the fall in buying strength, buyers still hold an advantage over sellers in the market. However, if Ethereum fails to move above its immediate resistance, the coin may retrace on its chart, potentially falling below its local support level and activating bearish sentiment.\n\nInvestors are now looking ahead to the release of US CPI data, which analysts predict will significantly impact the market in the coming weeks. The market capitalization of Ethereum has fallen slightly, indicating slow demand for the altcoin.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis: One-Day Chart\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH was priced at $1,870. The daily chart indicated a potential breakout as the price approached the upper boundary of a rectangle pattern. The crucial overhead resistance for Ethereum was identified at $1,880. If the price managed to surpass this level, it could potentially exceed $1,900 and ultimately reach the milestone of $2,000. However, it was essential for ETH to surpass the $1,880 mark in the upcoming trading sessions. On the downside, there was a local support level of $1,820. A dip below this point could lead to a decline towards $1,770. Technical Analysis The inability to break through the $1,900 level had a detrimental impact on investor confidence, resulting in ongoing challenges for Ethereum regarding demand on the daily chart. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) remained positive, although it suggested a relatively low level of demand. Furthermore, Ethereum\u2019s current position below the 20-Simple Moving Average line indicated a decline in buying strength, indicating that buyers were gradually losing control of the price momentum. In addition to the low buying strength, ETH also experienced a decline on capital inflows. This indicated a decline in investor interest, as evidenced by the Chaikin Money Flow indicator. Conversely, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) formed declining red histograms, suggesting a potential breakout in the upcoming trading sessions. The MACD is a useful tool for identifying price momentum and trend changes.

Discover SCENE\n\nBankrupt crypto lender Celsius has accused StakeHound of failing to hand back $150 million worth of various tokens which it had entrusted to the liquid staking platform.\n\nIn a complaint filed as part of Celsius\u2019s ongoing bankruptcy proceedings, lawyers also alleged that StakeHound had violated bankruptcy rules by commencing an arbitration proceeding against the business in Switzerland.\n\nLeveling claims of breach of contract and \u201cwillful misconduct\u201d against StakeHound, the complaint says the firm should be required to turn over Celsius\u2019 property, as well as pay compensatory damages and attorneys\u2019 fees.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt the heart of the case are $120 million worth of Ethereum (ETH), $30 million in Polygon (MATIC), and Polkadot (DOT) tokens worth $300,000, based on recent prices.\n\nStakehound, which discontinued its staking activities in June 2021, offered liquidity to users who wanted to \u201cstake\u201d crypto\u2013a process whereby tokens are pledged to the network and earn rewards in return\u2013by wrapping assets into \u201cstaked tokens\u201d which represent the underlying asset on a 1:1 basis.\n\nWhile their assets were locked up, customers received so-called \u201cstTokens,\u201d which they could present when they wanted to claim their tokens back.\n\nBut Celsius claims that StakeHound refused to return its assets in exchange for the stTokens.\n\nAccording to the filing, StakeHound blamed the loss of the keys associated with 35,000 of Celsius\u2019s ETH tokens for its failure to return the assets.\n\nThe incident was made public in June 2021, with StakeHound blaming the supposed negligence of custody firm Fireblocks.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn action taken in a Swiss court in April this year, StakeHound argued that it had \u201cno obligation\u201d whatsoever to exchange Ethereum for the stTokens it had issued to Celsius.\n\nLaunching that arbitration process violates Section 362 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, according to Celsius\u2019 lawyers. Known as the \u201cautomatic stay,\u201d this provision prevents creditors and other entities from pursuing debts or taking legal action against a company that has filed for bankruptcy.\n\nCelsius was, its lawyers claim, by far StakeHound\u2019s largest customer. Its business is thought to have accounted for more than 90% of the total tokens managed by the platform.\n\nThe Ethereum in question was locked up in anticipation of the blockchain\u2019s long-awaited upgrade, which took place in April this year, unlocking a bumper pool of staked ETH.\n\nHowever, StakeHound has allegedly refused to confirm whether Celsius\u2019s assets became unlocked once the upgrade was completed."

Assuming it passes, Aave v3 users will soon be able to mint GHO against their Ether deposits at an annual interest rate of 1.5%, with users that stake the AAVE token receiving a 30% discount.\n\nAave\u2019s treasury will accrue all interest payments from GHO, and the Aave DAO can change GHO\u2019s interest rate moving forward.\n\n\u201cAfter extensive community discussion, multiple phases of the Aave DAO governance process, and months of testing on Ethereum\u2019s Goerli Testnet, this AIP proposes the introduction of GHO to Ethereum Mainnet,\u201d the proposal reads.\n\nThe AAVE token has outperformed ETH in recent weeks and is up nearly 45% in the past month. Aave is the second-largest DeFi protocol with $5.9B in total value locked (TVL) across eight networks, according to DeFi Llama.\n\nAAVE Price vs ETH\n\nStablecoin Standoff\n\nThe proposal comes as Curve, a stablecoin-focussed DEX and the sixth-ranked DeFi protocol with $3.8B in TVL, is enjoying the success of crvUSD, its own freshly-launched native stablecoin.

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nEthereum Improvement Proposal 1153 is set to change the way Ethereum (ETH) blockchain processes the data. As a more advanced storage function, it will make the second largest blockchain more gas efficient than ever before.\n\nHere's how Ethereum (ETH) becomes more gas efficient with EIP-1153\n\nUniswap v4, a much-anticipated release by the world's most popular DEX Uniswap, will rely on EIP-1153 \"Transient Storage Opcodes,\" the new thread says. Therefore, it will allow traders and liquidity providers to save on gas fees.\n\n1/ EIP-1153 will be a huge step forward for Ethereum and we hope to see in the next hard fork \ud83c\udf34\n\n\n\nAmong other things, it saves gas on transactions \u2014 making it better for all dapps, including v4.\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s dive into it: \u2014 Uniswap Labs \ud83e\udd84 (@Uniswap) July 11, 2023\n\nThe upgrade is designed to change the manner in which the blockchain writes and erases data about transactions happening between accounts. Instead of writing to storage and clearing it before the transaction is over, smart contracts will now be able to leverage \"transient storage,\" a completely new data mechanism. Its activation will take place with the addition of some new opcodes.\n\nTransient storage is a cheaper and more streamlined instrument for data management. It also enables a couple of new use cases for Ethereum (ETH) and EVM ecosystem dApps.\n\nFor instance, in Uniswap v4, all liquidity pools will be held in one smart contract. This will make liquidity logistics between various pools faster and cheaper.\n\nInstead of transferring assets between pools, the system will only change net balances with cross-asset swaps.\n\nEIP-1153 to be activated after Cancun upgrade\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, \"Transient Storage Opcodes\" are among the most anticipated additions to Ethereum's (ETH) network design.\n\nThe Ethereum Cancun upgrade that features major improvements to Ethereum's (ETH) design is expected to be activated in Q4, 2023. Besides EIP-1153, it will include a new \"pay\" opcode, advance memory efficiency, re-camp call instructions and so on.\n\nWith EIP-4844, Ethereum (ETH) fees are expected to drop by 100x, per the estimations of long-term Ethereum (ETH) ecosystem enthusiasts."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin continued to trade flat at roughl$31,700 on Wednesday after the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) published June\u2019s inflation data, reflecting a monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) increase of 0.2%, and a yearly increase of 3.0%.\n\nEthereum also only faced a minor gain of 1.3%, per CoinGecko, and is now trading at nearly $1,900.\n\nThe increase fell just short of economists' estimates as polled by Dow Jones, which expected a 0.3% month-over-month increase, and an annual rise of 3.1%.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, core CPI\u2013which discounts the food and energy sectors due to their known volatility\u2013rose by just 0.2% which is the \u201csmallest 1-month increase in that index since August 2021,\u201d per the BLS.\n\nSince March 2022, the Federal Reserve has rapidly risen its policy interest rate in a mission to bring searing inflation back to its 2% target in the United States, after peaking last June at 9.1%.\n\nSo far, the central bank\u2019s efforts seem to be paying off, with annualized inflation down 1% from last month alone.\n\nSadly for investors, rising interest rates have also contributed to cratering stock and crypto prices throughout the last year, with both major tech and blockchain companies being forced to enact massive layoffs.\n\nAs such, falling inflation is generally taken as bullish for markets, since it means the Fed is closer to ending its hawkish monetary policy.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile the central bank chose to keep its policy rate unchanged last month, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has been hesitant to indicate whether this means rate hikes will pause or resume in the near future.\n\nAccording to the CME FedWatch tool, markets are 91% confident that another 0.25% rate hike is in the cards at the next Federal Open Markets Committee Meeting (FOMC) on July 26.\n\nMarkets are still waiting on June\u2019s Personal Consumption Index (PCI) figures, which track how consumers change their buying habits over time. This is the Fed\u2019s preferred measure of inflation as it\u2019s considered a strong predictor of where inflation is headed in the future. It currently projects this figure at 3.2%.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s non-reaction on Wednesday may be an indication of its current place in its cyclical market cycle.\n\nAs reported by Glassnode on Monday, Bitcoin\u2019s price has reached an \u201cequilibrium point\u201d which often signals an incoming \u201caccumulation phase\u201d during which the asset\u2019s price trades flat for many months to come."

        "title": "Guide to Base - Coinbase",
        "content": "How Base Works\n\nBase is being built on the Bedrock release of the OP (Optimism) Stack which is designed to make Optimism as close & equivalent as possible to Ethereum. The Bedrock release brings maximum compatibility with the existing Ethereum developer experience. The OP Stack is a series of modules across the consensus, execution and settlement layers that work together to form coherent and reliable blockchains. The Bedrock release has streamlined the ability to swap out different components of the OP Stack codebase and add new functionalities & capabilities. This modular architecture allows you to not only modify specific modules but swap them out entirely (for example swapping out Ethereum in favor of Celestia for the data availability layer).\n\nSource : Introducing the OP Stack\n\nThe above diagram from the Optimism Collective highlights how modules can be swapped out across the Consensus, Execution and Settlement Layers. The items highlighted in white are modules that were released as a part of the Bedrock upgrade, whereas the items highlighted in yellow represent WIPs or simply are there to emphasize that you could create your own new module to provide functionality to that particular layer - hence the \u201cPokemon?!\u201d callout.\n\nAs of today, the above diagram notes that the Execution Layer has an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) module . The Ethereum Virtual Machine is a piece of software that executes smart contracts & computes the state of the Ethereum network after each new block is added - more details can be found in this article as it relates to Ethereum specifically . In the case of the modular OP Stack, this is a lightly modified version of the EVM that adds functionality for L2 transactions initiated on the L1 (Ethereum) and adds an additional L1 data fee for each transaction to account for the fee/gas needed to publish this transaction to the L1 (Ethereum).\n\nAdditionally, the diagram references a Governance module in the Settlement Layer, which is a set of tools & processes to manage system configurations, upgrades, and design decisions.\n\nThe Optimistic Rollup\n\nThe OP Stack utilizes an Optimistic Rollup to govern how state commitments are published to the L1 (Ethereum). An optimistic rollup is a way of scaling Ethereum that involves moving computation and state storage off-chain - e.g. off Ethereum. Optimistic rollups, such as Base, execute transactions outside of Ethereum, but post transaction data to the Ethereum mainnet as calldata.\n\nBase combines off-chain transactions together in batches before sending them to Ethereum, which enables the spreading of fixed costs across multiple transactions in each batch - leading to reduced fees for those using Base and other Optimistic rollups.\n\nOptimistic rollups are called \u2018Optimistic\u2019 because they assume off-chain transactions are valid and don\u2019t publish proofs of validity for transaction batches posted on-chain. Optimistic rollups instead rely on a fraud-proving process whereby anyone can challenge a rollup batch during a set time window by computing a fault proof .\n\nInteraction with Ethereum\n\nRollups built using the OP Stack interact with the Layer 1 through a series of smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum network. There are two key components of the optimistic rollup architecture:\n\nOn-chain Contracts: The optimistic rollup utilizes smart contracts running on Ethereum. This includes contracts that: store rollup blocks, monitor state updates on the rollup, and track user deposits.\n\nOff-chain Virtual Machine: Computation and state storage occur on Base and not the Ethereum Virtual Machine. This off-chain virtual machine is where applications live and operate.\n\nSource : Optimistic Rollups\n\nIntroduction to Sequencers\n\nL2s built on the OP Stack, such as Base, have sequencer(s) that post data to the underlying L1 (Ethereum).\n\nA sequencer has the task of accurately executing transactions received.\n\nCore sequencer tasks\n\nProvides transaction confirmations and state updates\n\nConstructs and executes L2 blocks\n\nSubmits user transactions to the L1 (Ethereum)\n\nSource : Rollup Protocol\n\nBase blocks are produced every two seconds, regardless of whether they are empty (no transactions), filled up to the block gas limit with transactions, or somewhere in the middle.\n\nTransactions Get to the Sequencer in Two Ways\n\nTransactions submitted on the L1 (which are called deposits in the OP Stack) are included in the chain in the appropriate L2 block. Every L2 block is identified by the \u2018Epoch\u2019, which is the L1 (Ethereum) block to which it corresponds. The first block of the epoch includes all the deposits that happened in the L1 block to which it corresponds. If a sequencer attempts to ignore a legitimate L1 transaction it ends up with a state that is inconsistent with the verifiers, just as if the sequencer attempted to fake the state through another mechanism. This provides L2s built using the OP Stack with Ethereum level censorship resistance. Transactions submitted directly to the sequencer on the L2.\n\nSource : Rollup Protocol\n\nThe Requirements for the Processing of a Rollup Transaction\n\nThe transaction needs to be written to L1 (Ethereum). This role is normally performed by op-batcher, but any user can send an L1 transaction to submit an L2 transaction (known as \"forced inclusion\"), in which case op-batcher is bypassed. The transaction needs to be executed to modify the state (by op-geth). Periodically, op-proposer writes a commitment of the post-transaction state to L1. Note that op-proposer does not need to write an L1 commitment after each L2 block; instead it happens at a consistent period measured in L1 blocks.\n\nSource : Transaction Flow\n\nCompression & Posting to the L1 (Ethereum)\n\nThe batcher combines sequencer batches into channels. When a channel is full, it is posted to the L1 either as a stand alone transaction or as a batch of multiple transactions.\n\nSource : Transaction Flow\n\nBridging Assets\n\nBase is designed to allow users to send arbitrary messages between smart contracts on the L2 (Base) and L1 (Ethereum), making it feasible to transfer digital assets, including ERC20 tokens, between the two layers. Base uses a smart contract bridge to allow users to deposit digital assets from Ethereum to Base and also to allow withdrawals from Base back to Ethereum.\n\nMoving from the L1 to the L2\n\nIn the OP Stack, transactions going from the L1 (Ethereum) to the L2 (Base) are called deposits, regardless of whether or not they involve assets. Deposit transactions become part of the canonical blockchain in the first L2 block of the \u201cepoch\u201d that corresponds to the L1 block where the deposits occurred. The L2 block will usually be created a few minutes after the corresponding L1 block.\n\nMoving from the L2 to the L1\n\nIn the OP Stack, transactions going from the L2 (Base) to the L1 (Ethereum) are called withdrawals, regardless of whether or not they involve assets. These transactions have three stages:"

        "content": "Tron\u2019s active addresses surpassed that of Ethereum, Solana, and other blockchains.\n\nSolana and the Justin Sun-led project had a more comparable performance than Ethereum.\n\nAccording to Nansen, Tron [TRX] outpaced several blockchains, including Solana [SOL] and Ethereum [ETH], in terms of active addresses in June. The blockchain research firm, in its 12 July tweet, noted that Tron recorded a 42% increase.\n\nRead Tron\u2019s [TRX] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nActive addresses on Ethereum increased to 5.8 million while Solana decreased by a whopping 45%. All the while, other chains, including BNB Chain and the Polygon [MATIC] network, fell slightly.\n\nJune active addresses by chain: TRON: 17.1M (+42%)\n\nBNB: 11.9M (-4%)\n\nEthereum: 5.8M (+23%)\n\nSolana: 5.2M (-45%)\n\nPolygon: 4.6M (-3.5%)\n\nArbitrum: 2.4M (-14%)\n\nOptimism: 1.2M (+17%)\n\nAvalanche: 1.1M (+21%)\n\nFantom: 623K (-26%)\n\nCelo: 320K (+53%)\n\nRonin: 102K (-13%) pic.twitter.com/eavqALuY2H \u2014 Nansen ? (@nansen_ai) July 12, 2023\n\nTypically, active addresses serve as a good indicator of daily users over a particular blockchain. Sometimes, an increase in the metric could be a bullish signal, as Tron displayed a relatively good performance in the month.\n\nBut did Tron outclass these other blockchains in every aspect?\n\nSolana matches Tron\u2019s developments as ETH takes\u2026\n\nWell, in terms of development activity, Tron began rising on 29 June. And as of 1 July, the development activity was as high as 5.1. The development activity shows the level of dedicated code commits of public GitHub repositories attached to a blockchain.\n\nSo, when it increases, it implies that there is a substantial commitment to polishing the network involved. During the first week of June, Solana\u2019s development activity soared above Tron\u2019s.\n\nHowever, in the last week of the month, the metric attached to both blockchains had a similar trend.\n\nOn Ethereum\u2019s part, development activity soared and dumped at different intervals. However, the metric did not match up to the highest level that Solana and Tron reached at any point all through the previous month.\n\nConcerning social dominance, Tron could not reach the peak it hit in May. And according to on-chain analytics platform Santiment, social dominance had fallen to 0.244% at press time.\n\nSolana had a similar trend within the same period. But like Tron, social dominance fell at the time of writing. Ethereum dominated Solana and Tron in this aspect, taking .60% of the total share.\n\nThe above analysis revealed that Ethereum got more hype than both Tron and Solana. Also, this metric showed that discussion related to the second-largest blockchain was much more when compared with the other two.\n\nNo victor, no vanquished here\n\nAnother area where Tron excelled is with NFTs. Although the total trade volume had subsided at press time, the blockchain volume hit as high as 18.21 million on 28 June.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s SOL\u2019s market cap in TRX terms\n\nThe hike suggests that collections created via the Tron network attracted a good level of traders\u2019 interest. Similarly, Solana also hit highs in NFT trades count on 14 and 27 June.\n\nFor Ethereum, the NFT volume wasn\u2019t as impressive as it was in June. And at the time of writing, the number of unique addresses which bought NFTs worth $100,000 or more decreased."

        "content": "After a strong rally in the second half of June 2023, the Bitcoin (BTC) price has been consolidating for a while around the $30,500 level. As we can see in the below image, BTC has been consolidating throughout July around these levels showing signs of compression. This shows that there\u2019s a possibility of an imminent breakout going ahead.\n\nOn-chain data further support that the breakout could be in the upward direction going ahead. Crypto analytics firm Santiment points out the net realized profit loss vs price for BTC and ETH.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIt notes that after three weeks of prices fluctuating, both Bitcoin and Ethereum are experiencing slight losses compared to their previous values. Average traders are moving their assets at small losses. When the Net Realized Profit/Loss (NRPL) indicator is negative in relation to the price, there is a greater chance of positive price movement in the future.\n\nOther good signs for Bitcoin have been the growing whale accumulation over the last three weeks as BTC enters price consolidation. On the other hand, the exchange reserves have also been falling.\n\nJust Like Bitcoin, Ethereum Shows Strength\n\nLast week, Ethereum (ETH) experience some greater price volatility with its price taking a dive under $1,850. However, it has recovered since then and has moved closer to the $1,900 level.\n\nIt is worth noting that Ethereum has strong support in the price range of $1,800 to $1,870. Within this range, a total of 3.4 million addresses have bought 11.2 million ETH.\n\nOn the other hand, there is a significant resistance level between $2,040 and $2,100. In this range, 1 million addresses had previously purchased 27 million ETH, explains popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez.\n\nCurrently, there\u2019s a tight battle between the ETH bulls and bears, but technical indicators show a possibility of a breakout to $2,050. Any further movements in the BTC and ETH prices could provide a major push to the broader crypto market."

        "content": "Ethereum layer-2 ecosystem is heating up with the space seeing yet another entry by ConsenSys, an already established player in the industry. ConsenSys, the firm behind MetaMask, announced the launch of its layer-2 network \u2013 Linea \u2013 to the main Ethereum blockchain this week. It will soon begin onboarding partners as well.\n\nThe new layer-2 scaling solution is a zkEVM rollup network leveraging zero-knowledge proofs while making it an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) equivalent.\n\nConsenSys\u2019s zkEVM Rollup Network \u2013 Linea\n\nConsenSys is the latest company to ride the growing trend of zkEVM with its new offering Linea that has already witnessed a successful testnet phase with 5.5 million unique wallets conducting more than 46 million transactions. According to the company, Linea has emerged as one of the largest and fastest-growing projects in Goerli.\n\nBefore hitting the mainnet at ETHCC, Linea will begin onboarding its launch partners starting this week.\n\n\u201cLinea combines the power of zero-knowledge proofs with full Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) equivalence, allowing builders to create scalable decentralized applications (dapps) or migrate existing ones without the hassle of changing code or rewriting smart contracts.\u201d\n\nAs per ConsenSys\u2019s announcement, the alpha release provides faster throughput while lowering the transaction fees up to 15x lower than Ethereum layer-1. The firm also said that the release will allow deeper integrations with its crypto wallet MetaMask.\n\nLinea will be made available to users next week once partners have had an opportunity to onboard their dApps and infrastructure. The company also confirmed that the network uses Ether as its native currency, which is bridged directly from the Ethereum Mainnet. It urged users to remain cautious about fraudulent advertisements of an existing or imminent Linea token sale or drop.\n\nzkEVM Popularity\n\nA zkEVM is an EMV-compatible rollup that is secured by zero-knowledge proofs. By pooling in ZKPs with EVM compatibility, zkEVMs offer the security and privacy-preserving features of zk-Rollups while simultaneously enhancing Ethereum interoperability by protecting EVM compatibility. Such a system helps zkEVMs to be interoperable with smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) used on Ethereum.\n\nThe first zkEVM to be publicly available was zkSync\u2019s solution called \u2018zkSync Era,\u2019 which went live to much fanfare in March. Days later, Polygon announced the final mainnet for its zkEVM product and added subsequent optimizations a month later."

Among the top five, Ethereum (ETH) is followed by Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Binance Coin (BNB), and Aptos (APT). However, ETH is the only crypto project with a \u201cAA\u201d grade.\n\nSource: CCData\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot On-Chain Staking Enabled on Crypto.com\n\nWhile Ethereum (ETH) scored above 25 on all three measures, Bitcoin (BTC) scored a 7 on its environmental metric. The asset got a final grade of \u201cB,\u201d with a total score of 58. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) got a total score of 79.\n\nSource: CCData\n\nAccording to the report, Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) move to a proof-of-stake consensus method, which drastically reduced its energy needs, is what led the project to the top spot. Meanwhile, BTC\u2019s proof-of-work consensus method is notorious for its heavy energy usage.\n\nWill ESG scores play a role in the institutional adoption of Bitcoin and Ethereum?\n\nSource: Forbes\n\nThe role of ESG scores is becoming increasingly important for financial institutions. According to PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), ESG-related assets could touch $33.9 trillion by 2026. This would represent 1/5th of all investments worldwide. In the US, ESG-related assets are expected to reach $10.5 trillion by 2026.\n\nAccording to PwC\u2019s report, 78% of surveyed investors said they \u201cwould pay higher fees for ESG funds.\u201d Meanwhile, 52% of investors \u201care willing to build ESG into performance-related fees.\u201d\n\nThe report highlighted that there are conflicts between asset managers\u2019 fiduciary obligations to maximize financial returns for clients and ESG concerns. However, three-quarters of investors now view ESG as a component of those obligations.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin: This Could Be Investors\u2019 \u2018Golden Chance\u2019 to Buy BTC\n\nGoing by the aforementioned data, it is possible that institutions take the ESG score into consideration before buying an asset. In that regard, Bitcoin (BTC) adoption could see a slump among financial giants, while Ethereum (ETH) might not face such issues."

The Ethereum blockchain is a decentralized platform that enables the creation and execution of smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with predefined rules and conditions. These smart contracts power the functionality and behavior of Ethereum tokens.\n\nEthereum tokens can represent a wide range of digital and physical assets, such as cryptocurrencies, utility tokens, security tokens, and even real-world assets like real estate or commodities. They are created using Ethereum\u2019s token standards, particularly the ERC-20 and ERC-721 standards.\n\nThe ERC-20 standard is the most common and widely adopted token standard on the Ethereum blockchain. It defines a set of rules and functions that a token contract must implement to be considered ERC-20 compliant. These functions include the ability to transfer tokens, check token balances, and approve token allowances for other addresses. ERC-20 tokens are fungible, meaning each token is identical and interchangeable with other tokens of the same type. Examples of ERC-20 tokens include popular cryptocurrencies like Ether (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), and Chainlink (LINK).\n\nOn the other hand, the ERC-721 standard is used for non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Unlike ERC-20 tokens, NFTs are unique and cannot be exchanged on a one-to-one basis. Each NFT has distinct properties and metadata, making them ideal for representing ownership of unique digital assets like digital art, collectibles, virtual real estate, and more. The ERC-721 standard provides functions for token ownership, transfer, and metadata retrieval.\n\nCreating an Ethereum token typically involves deploying a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. The smart contract defines the token\u2019s properties, such as its name, symbol, decimal places, and total supply. It also implements the necessary functions for token transfers, balance checks, and other functionalities specific to the token\u2019s use case.\n\nOnce a token is deployed, it can be traded and exchanged on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Uniswap or centralized exchanges (CEXs) that support Ethereum-based tokens. Additionally, tokens can be stored in Ethereum-compatible wallets, such as MetaMask or MyEtherWallet, which provide users with control over their token balances and enable them to interact with decentralized applications (dApps) built on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nEthereum tokens have gained significant popularity due to the versatility and flexibility provided by the Ethereum blockchain. They have enabled the creation of new economic models, fundraising mechanisms (Initial Coin Offerings or ICOs), decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, and innovative digital experiences through NFTs. The Ethereum ecosystem continues to evolve, with ongoing upgrades like Ethereum 2.0 aiming to improve scalability, security, and sustainability, further enhancing the capabilities and potential of Ethereum tokens.\n\nAlso read: Top 10 Impact Of Ethereum On NFT And The Art World\n\nImportance of Ethereum Tokens for the Economy\n\nEthereum tokens play a crucial role in the economy by enabling new forms of value transfer, economic models, and financial innovation. Here are several key aspects highlighting the importance of Ethereum tokens for the economy:\n\n1. Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Ethereum tokens are the backbone of the burgeoning decentralized finance sector. DeFi applications leverage smart contracts and Ethereum tokens to create decentralized versions of traditional financial instruments, such as lending, borrowing, decentralized exchanges, stablecoins, yield farming, and more. These applications provide individuals with greater access to financial services, remove intermediaries, and promote financial inclusion.\n\n2. Tokenization of Assets: Ethereum tokens enable the tokenization of real-world assets, such as real estate, art, commodities, and intellectual property. By representing these assets as tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, their ownership and transfer become more efficient, transparent, and accessible. Tokenization also enables fractional ownership, allowing smaller investors to participate in traditionally high-entry markets. This innovation unlocks liquidity and expands investment opportunities.\n\n3. Fundraising and Crowdfunding: Ethereum tokens have revolutionized fundraising models through Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and Initial Exchange Offerings (IEOs). Projects can issue utility tokens to raise capital directly from the public, eliminating the need for traditional intermediaries. This democratization of fundraising enables innovative projects to access capital globally and empowers investors of various sizes to participate in early-stage investments.\n\n4. Incentive Mechanisms: Ethereum tokens can be used to incentivize desired behaviors within decentralized applications and ecosystems. Tokens can be awarded for participation, content creation, contribution to governance, or other activities that contribute to the growth and sustainability of the network. This incentivization fosters active community engagement, rewards early adopters, and aligns stakeholders\u2019 interests.\n\n5. Programmability and Smart Contracts: Ethereum tokens can be programmed with smart contracts, enabling them to have dynamic functionalities and capabilities beyond simple value transfer. Smart contracts can automate complex business logic, enforce rules, and create unique token ecosystems. For example, tokens can implement staking mechanisms, dividend distributions, voting rights, or even execute complex decentralized applications.\n\n6. Liquidity and Exchangeability: Ethereum tokens are tradable on various decentralized and centralized exchanges, providing liquidity and market access for token holders. Liquidity is vital for the efficient functioning of markets, enabling users to buy, sell, or exchange tokens easily. The ability to trade tokens globally and around the clock promotes economic activity, price discovery, and investment opportunities.\n\n7. Open and Permissionless Innovation: Ethereum tokens facilitate open and permissionless innovation, allowing developers from around the world to build applications and services on top of the Ethereum blockchain. The ease of creating tokens and interacting with the Ethereum network encourages experimentation, fosters entrepreneurship, and drives technological advancements in various industries.\n\nThe importance of Ethereum tokens for the economy is continually growing as the ecosystem expands and matures. The combination of decentralized finance, asset tokenization, fundraising mechanisms, programmability, liquidity, and open innovation creates new economic possibilities, promotes financial inclusion, and empowers individuals to participate in a more equitable and accessible global economy.\n\nTop 10 Ethereum Tokens with the Most Promising Potential\n\nEthereum is a decentralized open-source blockchain system that features its own cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH). ETH is used to pay for gas, which is required to power the execution of smart contracts and other decentralized applications (dApps) on the Ethereum network. The Ethereum ecosystem is home to a wide variety of tokens, each with its own unique purpose and potential. Here are 10 of the most promising Ethereum tokens to watch in 2023: Chainlink (LINK) is a decentralized oracle network that provides secure, reliable, and tamper-proof data to smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. LINK tokens are used to pay for data feeds and computations on the Chainlink network. Uniswap (UNI) is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that allows users to swap ERC-20 tokens without the need for a centralized intermediary. UNI tokens are used to govern the Uniswap protocol and participate in its decision-making process. Aave (AAVE) is a decentralized lending protocol that allows users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies with interest. AAVE tokens are used to govern the Aave protocol and participate in its decision-making process. SushiSwap (SUSHI) is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that is similar to Uniswap. SUSHI tokens are used to govern the SushiSwap protocol and participate in its decision-making process. MakerDAO (MKR) is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that issues the Dai stablecoin. MKR tokens are used to govern the MakerDAO protocol and participate in its decision-making process. Compound (COMP) is a decentralized lending protocol that is similar to Aave. COMP tokens are used to govern the Compound protocol and participate in its decision-making process. Synthetix (SNX) is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that allows users to mint synthetic assets, which are tokens that track the price of real-world assets such as stocks, commodities, and currencies. SNX tokens are used to secure the Synthetix network and participate in its governance. The Sandbox (SAND) is a blockchain-based virtual world where users can create, build, and monetize their own experiences. SAND tokens are used to purchase in-game assets and participate in the governance of the Sandbox metaverse. Decentraland (MANA) is another blockchain-based virtual world where users can own and customize their own plots of land. MANA tokens are used to purchase in-game assets and participate in the governance of the Decentraland metaverse. Enjin Coin (ENJ) is a gaming token that allows users to create and manage in-game items on the Ethereum blockchain. ENJ tokens are used to back the value of in-game items, ensuring that they have real-world value. These are just a few of the many Ethereum tokens with promising potential in 2023. The Ethereum ecosystem is constantly evolving, and new and innovative tokens are being launched all the time. It is important to do your own research before investing in any cryptocurrency, and to remember that the crypto market is volatile and prices can fluctuate wildly. However, if you are looking for Ethereum tokens with the potential to deliver high returns, the tokens listed above are worth considering. News came out that the Brazilian Central Bank is launching a CBDC pilot using an ERC20 token standard with built in abilities to freeze and control transactions. Ethereum Co-Founder Joseph Lubin laid out all these plans last year. If you can't beat them, join them, I guess.\ud83e\udee0 pic.twitter.com/U520bGXhSO \u2014 Sam Callahan (@samcallah) July 12, 2023\n\nRisks associated with Ethereum Tokens\n\nWhile Ethereum tokens offer significant opportunities and benefits, they also come with certain risks. Understanding these risks is crucial for investors, users, and developers involved in the Ethereum ecosystem. Here are some key risks associated with Ethereum tokens:\n\n1. Smart Contract Risks: Ethereum tokens rely on smart contracts, which are software programs that execute predefined rules and conditions. Smart contracts are susceptible to coding errors, vulnerabilities, or exploits that can lead to significant financial losses. Bugs or vulnerabilities in smart contracts can be exploited to drain funds, manipulate token balances, or disrupt token functionalities. It is essential to conduct thorough code audits, security assessments, and testing before deploying or interacting with smart contracts.\n\n2. Regulatory and Legal Risks: The regulatory landscape surrounding Ethereum tokens is evolving and can vary across jurisdictions. Regulatory agencies may impose restrictions, licensing requirements, or enforcement actions that can impact the issuance, trading, or use of Ethereum tokens. Uncertainty in legal frameworks, compliance obligations, and potential changes in regulations pose risks to token projects and participants.\n\n3. Market Volatility: Ethereum tokens, especially cryptocurrencies, are subject to significant price volatility. The value of tokens can experience sharp fluctuations due to market speculation, investor sentiment, regulatory announcements, or macroeconomic factors. Token holders may face substantial losses or gains depending on market conditions, and sudden price movements can impact the liquidity and stability of token markets.\n\n4. Liquidity Risks: While Ethereum tokens offer liquidity through decentralized and centralized exchanges, smaller or less popular tokens may face liquidity challenges. Low trading volumes can result in wider bid-ask spreads, making it difficult to buy or sell tokens at desired prices. Illiquid markets can also be prone to market manipulation and price manipulation schemes.\n\n5. Security Risks: Ethereum tokens are stored in wallets, which can be vulnerable to hacking, phishing attacks, or other security breaches. If an individual\u2019s wallet is compromised, the tokens stored within can be stolen or transferred without authorization. It is essential to follow best security practices, such as using hardware wallets, enabling multi-factor authentication, and being cautious of phishing attempts.\n\n6. Scalability and Network Congestion: Ethereum\u2019s scalability limitations can result in network congestion during periods of high demand. This congestion can lead to delays, higher transaction fees, or even temporary suspension of token transfers. Projects relying heavily on Ethereum\u2019s infrastructure may face challenges in delivering a seamless user experience during times of network congestion.\n\n7. Governance and Consensus Risks: Ethereum tokens that are part of decentralized governance systems rely on consensus mechanisms and community-driven decision-making. However, disputes, disagreements, or concentration of power among token holders or network participants can impact the governance process, potentially leading to contentious hard forks, network splits, or governance gridlocks.\n\n8. Counterparty Risks: Ethereum tokens often involve interactions with third-party platforms, decentralized applications, or service providers. These interactions introduce counterparty risks, including the risk of platform hacks, exit scams, or insolvency of third-party services. Users should exercise caution and conduct due diligence before relying on or transacting with external entities.\n\nIt is important to note that the risks associated with Ethereum tokens are not exclusive to Ethereum but are inherent to the broader blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystem. Participants should evaluate and manage these risks by conducting thorough research, exercising caution, employing best security practices, and diversifying their token holdings. Additionally, staying informed about the evolving regulatory landscape and market conditions is crucial to navigate the risks effectively.\n\nAlso read: How To Secure Ethereum Assets- Top 10 Ways To Avoid Scams And Hacks\n\nFuture of Ethereum Tokens\n\nThe future of Ethereum tokens holds great potential as the Ethereum ecosystem continues to evolve and address key challenges. Here are several aspects that shape the future of Ethereum tokens:\n\n1. Ethereum 2.0: Ethereum is undergoing a significant upgrade known as Ethereum 2.0, which aims to improve scalability, security, and sustainability.

        "title": "Introducing Starknet: The answer to Ethereum's scalability challenge? - OKX",
        "content": "Blockchain technology has revolutionized the way we conduct transactions and store data securely. However, one major challenge that blockchain faces is scalability. As the number of users and transactions on a blockchain network increases, the system becomes slower and more expensive. This scalability challenge has hindered the widespread adoption of blockchain technology in various industries.\n\nMeet Starknet \u2014 a cutting-edge solution that addresses blockchain's scalability challenge. Starknet is a permissionless decentralized validity rollup, also known as a zk-rollup, built on the Ethereum network.\n\nIt serves as a Layer 2 solution, allowing decentralized applications (DApps) to achieve unlimited scalability for their computations while maintaining the composability and security of the Ethereum ecosystem. Starknet leverages the power of STARK (Scalable Transparent Argument of Knowledge) technology, one of the safest and most scalable cryptographic proof systems available.\n\nBy using STARK, Starknet validates transactions and computations without requiring all network nodes to verify each operation. This significantly reduces the computational burden and increases the throughput of the blockchain network.\n\nWith Starknet, developers can build and deploy complex applications with high computational requirements on Ethereum without worrying about scalability limitations. The future looks promising as Starknet plays a crucial role in unlocking the full potential of decentralized applications and bringing blockchain to the mainstream.\n\nWhat is Starknet?\n\nStarknet is an advanced Layer 2 solution designed to scale Ethereum and alleviate network congestion. It achieves this through zk-STARKs, a zero-knowledge proof technology that enhances data security, privacy, and scalability. By implementing Starknet, developers can build and run high-performing smart contracts in a decentralized environment without worrying about expensive transaction fees or compromising the security of their applications.\n\nThe purpose of Starknet is to provide a platform for developing DApps that require high performance and low transaction costs. This makes it particularly suitable for sectors such as decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and gaming (GameFi).\n\nWith its flexibility and advanced features, developers can leverage the Cairo language and take advantage of Starknet's high throughput and customizability to build innovative and customized DApps.\n\nStarkWare, the team behind Starknet, is an Israel-based company focused on building Layer 2 blockchains for Ethereum. In addition to Starknet, StarkWare is also developing another product called StarkEx, geared towards enhancing scalability and efficiency for decentralized exchanges.\n\nThe Starknet ecosystem has experienced significant growth, with a notable increase in total value. This growth can be attributed to the advantages Starknet offers, the innovative projects being developed within the ecosystem, and the challenges it aims to address. As Starknet continues to evolve, it holds the potential to revolutionize the scalability and functionality of Ethereum, driving the adoption of blockchain technology across various industries.\n\nWhat's the technology behind Starknet?\n\nStarknet uses advanced technology called zk-STARKs to achieve scalability as a Layer 2 solution.\n\nSo, what are zk-STARKs? They're a cryptographic innovation developed by StarkWare, and they play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and privacy of computations on blockchains. Zk-STARKs allow blockchains to move complex computations off-chain to a single STARK prover, which generates cryptographic proofs. These proofs are then verified on-chain by a STARK verifier to guarantee the correctness of the computations.\n\nTo make zk-STARKs practical, StarkWare has combined modern algebra with battle-tested hash functions. The organization has made significant breakthroughs in areas like quasi-linear PCPs, interactive oracle proofs (IOPs), and fast algebraic coding protocols like FRI.\n\nThis has made their STARK prover and verifier the fastest in the class, outperforming other cryptographic constructions. Significantly, the tech relies on fewer and safer cryptographic assumptions and is secure against quantum attacks. It's also transparent, meaning it doesn't use risky cryptographic elements during setup and has no hidden vulnerabilities.\n\nStarknet offers a robust platform that enables efficient and cost-effective processing of smart contracts. It achieves this through a combination of different components, each playing a crucial role in the ecosystem.\n\nContract registry\n\nThe contract registry is a record keeper for all the smart contracts deployed on Starknet. It maintains a comprehensive list of these contracts, making accessing and interacting with them easy. It's like a directory that helps you find the suitable contract you want to work with.\n\nZK operator\n\nThe ZK operator is the master of ZK proofs. It generates these proofs for transactions and sends them to the execution manager. Additionally, it manages a special type of data structure called a Merkle tree, which is used to create these proofs. The ZK operator makes sure the proofs are generated accurately and can be trusted.\n\nExecution manager (EM)\n\nThink of the execution manager as the conductor of the Starknet orchestra. It manages the execution of smart contracts and handles transactions. Whenever a transaction occurs, the EM updates the network's state accordingly. It makes sure everything runs smoothly and in harmony.\n\nVerifier\n\nThe verifier is like a detective with a keen eye for authenticity. It validates the ZK (zero-knowledge) proofs created by users. These proofs are essential for preserving the accuracy and integrity of executed contracts. The verifier checks if the inputs to the proof satisfy the contract's conditions, making sure everything is legitimate.\n\nCairo programming language\n\nStarknet was built using the Cairo programming language. This language is optimized explicitly for zk-STARKs, a cryptographic proof system. Cairo empowers developers to write complex and secure smart contracts. It provides a framework that allows developers to test their contracts locally before deploying them to the Starknet network, guaranteeing reliability and efficiency.\n\nProof verifier factory\n\nThe proof verifier factory is like a factory that produces verifiers whenever needed. It's responsible for creating new verifiers and managing their lifecycle. It ensures the system has enough verifiers to handle the validation process efficiently.\n\nStorage\n\nStarknet has a storage layer where smart contracts are stored and data is retrieved. This storage layer is based on a Merkle tree, which is an efficient data structure. It allows for quick and easy access to contract-related information, making interactions with smart contracts faster and smoother.\n\nGateway\n\nThe gateway acts as a bridge between Ethereum and Starknet. It lets users deposit and withdraw funds from Starknet using the Ethereum network. This connection makes it convenient for users to move their assets between the two platforms and benefit from the advantages offered by Starknet.\n\nStarknet achieves scalability through zk-STARKs, a cutting-edge cryptographic technology. Zk-STARKs enable off-chain computations and on-chain verification, ensuring the integrity and privacy of computations on the blockchain. Starknet's underlying technologies, such as Cairo, the STARK prover, and STARK verifiers, have been battle-tested and proven their reliability and efficiency in real-world production environments.\n\nWhat's the relationship between Starknet and Ethereum?\n\nStarknet and Ethereum share a close relationship, with Starknet being a Layer 2 solution built on top of the Ethereum network. This integration brings multiple benefits to both Ethereum users and developers.\n\nEthereum's mainnet currently processes about 30 transactions per second (TPS), which can be limited during times of high congestion. Using the power of StarkWare's STARK-based Layer 2 solution, Starknet significantly enhances Ethereum's scalability. It can potentially reduce gas fees by a factor of 100 to 200, making transactions more affordable and accessible for users.\n\nAdditionally, with the implementation of rollups like Starknet, Ethereum's transaction throughput has the potential to reach 100,000 TPS, according to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin.\n\nFor developers, Starknet provides an efficient platform to build and deploy high-performance DApps. Developers can use Starknet's features, such as its reliance on zk-STARKs for cryptographic proof and its compatibility with the Cairo programming language.\n\nThis enables them to create complex and innovative DApps without compromising security or scalability.

        "content": "Ethereum Price Analysis: Amid the mid-June recovery, the Ethereum price rebounded from the support trendline of the rising channel pattern. Over the past seven months, the price has bounced back several times from this support indicating an active accumulation level for buying. Here\u2019s how this pattern could further influence the ETH price.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin (BTC) Set For $35000, Ethereum (ETH) Above $2000 As US CPI Inflation Falls\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Price Daily Chart\n\nThe $1827 level stands as a strong support to maintain a bullish recovery.\n\nThe rising channel pattern governs the current recovery rally in Ethereum\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $4.85 Billion, indicating a 20% gain.\n\nSource- Tradingview\n\nOver the past four weeks, the Ethereum price has gained 16.4% as it rebounded from the $1624 support.

        "title": "From Ethereum to Consensys: Joseph Lubin's Visionary Journey - Entrepreneur",
        "content": "Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nYou're reading Entrepreneur Middle East, an international franchise of Entrepreneur Media.\n\nFrom robotics and artificial intelligence to the financial services industry, Joseph Lubin's multifaceted background paved the way for his transformation into a leading figure of the Web3 revolution.\n\nLubin, a founding member of Ethereum and founder of Consensys, has always possessed a forward-thinking mindset, which he applied early on in identifying systemic flaws in our global financial institutions. Today, he stands as a torchbearer guiding us into the era of Web3, decentralized systems, and beyond.\n\nOver a decade ago, Lubin observed unsettling patterns within our financial systems, including unprecedented levels of debt in the system that suggested a looming global crisis. As he delved into these concerns, he became aware of the Strauss and Howe generational theory. This theory describes 80-100 year cycles composed of four generations. It paints a picture of cycles of growth and expansion, which eventually meet their downfall due to societal developments that outgrow the once-novel visions. This pattern leads to a societal reset, calling for a fresh vision and a new system- a pattern that seems to echo our present reality.\n\nWhen Lubin encountered Bitcoin in 2011, he saw the dawn of this new era. Satoshi Nakamoto's revolutionary whitepaper introduced a technological innovation, a decentralized database that could fundamentally alter the foundations of trust and authority upon which our society is built. By ensuring that everyone sees the true history of transactions and making it virtually impossible to overturn this history, Bitcoin invented a new higher-powered form of trust: decentralized trust. It shifted the societal trust paradigm from top-down \u2013with authorities working through intermediaries to control all aspects of society\u2013 to bottom-up, where everyone can inspect what happened and when with respect to transactions in the economy, and the only intermediary required is the open global decentralized database.\n\nA few years later, Lubin found himself at the forefront of the Ethereum project. Its whitepaper, penned by Vitalik Buterin, promised a platform where any software developer could contribute to the new economy, removing the need for esoteric specialists. Recognizing this potential, Lubin devoted himself to nurturing Ethereum \u2013the first decentralized blockchain that allowed for smart contracts\u2013 and its ecosystem. This then gave way to the birthing of Consensys, a hub for fostering faster adoption of Ethereum, by incubating projects and exploring the vast potential of the ecosystem.\n\nToday, the fruits of Lubin's work are apparent across diverse corners of the globe. In countries like Zimbabwe, Venezuela, and Argentina, where the monetary systems have been unstable for decades, blockchain technologies offer essential solutions such as value preservation and remittances. However, in Western liberal democracies, the implications run deeper, creating novel ways of looking at industries and offering them the means to evolve rather than just disrupt.\n\nConsider the entertainment industry, where artists can directly connect with their fans through non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized organizations. Here, Web3 technologies promise a future where the majority of the value created isn't pocketed by industry intermediaries, but by the creators themselves. Similar opportunities are unfolding in the advertising sector, as the traditional web cookie used to track and exploit browsers are slowly being \"decommissioned\" by regulators, companies, and users who value privacy, and will be replaced by NFTs and decentralized identities, putting the control back in users' hands.\n\nAccording to Lubin, Web3 brings major foundational gamechangers such as decentralized finance (DeFi). Although DeFis currently the playground of crypto and finance enthusiasts, Lubin envisions a future where the entire finance world is stampeding into this space once regulatory hurdles are overcome. In decentralized finance, the potential for instantaneous, programmable, and high liquidity systems promises unprecedented opportunities. Eventually, much of global finance will be built using decentralized finance technology simply because DeFi will bring much-needed improvements like increased transparency around the formation and enforcement of the rules under which systems operate, and the virtual elimination of counterparty risk when one's counterparty is a smart contract or a protocol rather than a person or company. These are just two of many directions that the world of finance can explore as it begins to understand the profound benefits of this paradigm-shifting disruptive technology.\n\nIn today's rapidly evolving and increasingly dangerous world, a profound existential choice faces humanity. On one hand, we could journey down a path of tyrannical control, where governments manipulate everything, endeavoring to prevent the misuse of cheap and exponentially destructive technology. This path, successful or not, is rife with pitfalls. The other way, a far more hopeful path, embraces progressive decentralization as its organizing principle. Here, we can envision a future based on decentralized organizations and protocols, where transparency is a given, and negative externalities are identified and incorporated into a more holistic system so they can be properly accounted for and ameliorated.\n\nSource: Lucidity Insights\n\nIn natural ecosystems, every waste product serves as the feedstock for some other organism or system. This is how we must design the systems we build and steward going forward, whether they be agricultural, water management, social media/advertising or AI. This vision for the future requires rapid dissemination and robust action to create the next system of the world, and education plays a central role, believes Lubin. Initiatives like Consensys Academy and MetaMask Learn are at the forefront of this movement, striving to mentor the next generation and provide compelling, extensible tutorials. \"We're starting to view our software developers and end-users as two Web 2.0 vintage bookends bounding a growing population of Web3 builders,\" Lubin said, explaining the increasing democratization of technology-enabled participation.\n\nIn this Web3 world, individuals have much more control and influence over the systems that guide their lives because they will be first-class members of those communities, not just customers, and no longer the product of the service provider. Here, the power that currently resides solely with corporations like Meta platforms (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp), TikTok, or Twitter, becomes decentralized, providing end-users and developers more agency, and enabling them to become active builders of, and participants in, communities and ecosystems that affect and improve their lives. The Web3 builder class will eventually grow to encompass the entire global population, as Web3 tools enable direct participation in online communities. As we all rise to the calling to be more active in the systems and communities on which our lives and quality of life depend, we will soon be able to call on our personal artificial intelligence (AI) allies who enable all of us to level up fast, understand any issue that affects us, and participate in the governance and decision-making that tangibly improves our lives.\n\nProperly decentralizing social networks doesn't mean you add NFTs to them or add decentralized asset organization (DAO)-based decentralized governance, or cut moderators in on the profits they generate as a labor of love. These are significant steps towards a decentralized model. In this setup, rather than being reliant on a handful of social network accounts that are controlled and can be revoked by Web 2.0 companies, everyone will establish their own decentralized IDs. These IDs will be used alongside verifiable credentials, in line with World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) standards, as well as NFTs and badges. Collectively, these elements will form the backbone for building and maintaining the identity and reputation of individuals, intelligent entities, organizations, and even things.\n\nThe next generation of social networking will put the user at the center of and in control of their social graph. They will construct and maintain multiple social graphs for different purposes. They will own their identities, and publish their own profiles tailored to different contexts. They will subscribe to other entities' social graphs, and publish content to their own graphs, inviting people to subscribe to them if they are interested. They will own her graphs and select tools from different providers to operate on the content of her graphs, or on the graph structures themselves- perhaps to increase readership or monetization or political influence. They may link their graphs with other graphs in order to share certain content if the owners of those graphs choose to work together to share the relevant content with their subscriber base. They will be in control of their identities and social graphs and there will be many social network tool companies that add value to their feeds while the user remains fully in control.\n\nOur social graphs in the Web3 era will be a profound extension and expression of our identities, interests, and, ultimately, our reputations. They will be a fundamental construct representing who we are. In the Web3 era, we will be the owners and controllers of the core elements of our lives, not manipulated and addicted users, not just consumers and not exploited products of Web 2.0 and traditional economy megacorps that have become producers of as many negative externalities as valuable products and services. The Web 2.0 era served us well and evolved us as a species in important ways. But we desperately need the community-focused and user-centric ethos of Web3 to heal deep schisms and establish healthier collective paths forward. Or Web3 children will look back on the constructs of Web 2.0 society in disbelief and horror that we all outsourced many core aspects of our identities and reputations to soulless, profit-maximizing companies that nearly broke the world.\n\nAligned with this vision, Consensys unveils its evolved brand, aiming to \"inspire and empower the builder within each of us.\" A call to action that encourages individuals to embrace their role in constructing a more decentralized future.

        "content": "Coinbase\u2019s Base mainnet is now \u201copen for builders,\u201d according to a July 13 blog post from the network\u2019s development team. The team is opening the network to builders ahead of its public launch to allow more time for user onboarding. Base also announced that the public launch of the network will occur in August.\n\nSince our testnet launch, we\u2019ve connected with incredible builders and watched their projects thrive on Base.\n\n\n\nNow it\u2019s time to take the next step: Base mainnet is now open for builders.https://t.co/YvlQxquhvY \u2014 Base \ufe0f (@BuildOnBase) July 13, 2023\n\nCoinbase announced the creation of the Base network on Feb. 23. The team claimed that the network would be a layer-2 of Ethereum and would use the OP Stack software used by Optimism. The announcement was celebrated in the Ethereum community, as many users saw it as a \"massive confidence vote\" for Ethereum.\n\nIn the team\u2019s July 13 announcement, it stated that the Base mainnet now has two functioning block explorers and an official RPC node that can be used to read data and transmit transactions. Data from these block explorers shows the network has been running since July 2 and has processed over 1 million transactions.\n\nBase transactions as of July 13. Source: BaseScan block explorer\n\nAn official \u201cOptimismPortal,\u201d or Base bridge contract, has been deployed to Ethereum, blockchain data shows. According to the team, this contract allows developers to transfer Ether (ETH) to the new network to pay gas fees. However, the bridge does not have a web-based user interface (UI), so its functions can only be called via a command-line interface or by running scripts.\n\nThe team stated there will not be a publicly available bridge with a UI during the initial \u201cbuilder\u201d phase, as this feature is being saved for the upcoming public launch, and the team has asked developers to refrain from launching UIs for their own apps until then.\n\nRelated: Optimism network transactions surged 67% following Bedrock upgrade\n\nThe team is allowing builders to mint a \u201cBase is for builders\u201d commemorative nonfungible token (NFT) in honor of the event and is also giving away a \u201cGenesis Builder NFT\u201d to any developer that deploys a contract to the network and fills out a form on the project\u2019s website.\n\nOptimism Labs, creator of the OP Stack, has claimed that Base and Optimism will eventually form a \u201cSuperchain\u201d of multiple networks that share the same security features. The Superchain will likely face competition from zkSync\u2019s \u201cHyperchains,\u201d which are being developed to have many of the same features as the Superchain."

        "title": "Monthly: Themes for Second Half 2023 - Coinbase",
        "content": "The second half of the year promises to be no less eventful, as the regulatory overhang remains a challenge. But there\u2019s also no shortage of endogenous narratives that should drive this asset class as well. Among these, layer-2s remain an important theme in 2H23, although we expect the market to turn its focus to how value accrues to these scaling solutions. Rollups will also be affected by the Cancun (Dencun) Fork, the next major milestone on Ethereum\u2019s upgrade roadmap. Re-staking may also promise to disrupt the industry. Meanwhile, once the Mt.Gox bitcoin disbursements are complete, we expect more attention on the bitcoin halving in 2024.\n\nWhen the rally was interrupted by a US dollar recovery in mid 1Q23, the US regional banking turmoil positioned bitcoin in particular as an alternative to the failures of the traditional financial system. But then regulatory headlines began to derail performance and some market makers pulled liquidity just as global spigots were tightening . Enter the institutions\u2013 relief at the end of 2Q23 came from positive news associated with BlackRock, Fidelity, Charles Schwab and other Wall Street giants announcing new initiatives in the space.\n\nWe believe there were several reasons why crypto markets surprised expectations to the upside in the first half of 2023. Developments in this space at the end of last year left market pundits with almost uniformly negative predictions, while outlooks on the macro environment didn\u2019t appear much rosier. This enabled a short covering rally that was sustained by supportive supply dynamics . That is, demand picked up just when many assets were being locked up in the custody of different government authorities or self-hosted wallets.\n\nSome have argued that even if these ETF proposals are approved in the US, it may not be as transformational for crypto markets as their advocates may think. The argument is that these products already exist in Europe and Canada but haven\u2019t gained significant traction in the years they\u2019ve been around. We think that view is short-sighted, as it focuses on the potential retail demand for these products. In fact, the ETF market in the US is the largest and most developed globally because asset managers and financial advisors tend to use ETFs in portfolios as a means of gaining exposure to a variety of asset classes. Having an available bitcoin spot ETF in the US may facilitate allocations that ultimately translate into significant effects on demand. We may also see institutional investors potentially using an approved bitcoin spot ETF as the underlying for new derivative instruments that could also expand trading volumes.\n\nNote that the timeline for the US SEC\u2019s decision making process has recently been reset due to refilings. For example, the application for BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust was recently refiled on July 3 which means that it may only enter the Federal Register for public commentary on July 17. A final decision could take as much as 240 days (putting a potential deadline sometime in mid-March 2024). See table below.\n\nDevelopments included the launch of a new crypto exchange by a consortium of major financial players \u2013 Fidelity, Charles Schwab and Citadel - mainly targeting Wall Street participants. Separately, asset-management giant BlackRock filed to launch a spot BTC ETF partnering with Nasdaq. Fidelity, WisdomTree, VanEck, ARK Invest and Galaxy/Invesco followed suit, partnering with Cboe. Incidentally, Coinbase supports issuers in a few ways, including as custodian for the underlying BTC. Separately, the Nasdaq and Cboe have also named Coinbase as their surveillance sharing partner in their 19b-4 filings.\n\nThe first half of 2023 ended with a potential game changer for the crypto industry as some of the world\u2019s biggest financial firms announced major initiatives in this space. In the wake of these announcements, BTC rallied above US$30,000 for the first time since April.\n\nThe second half\n\nMt. Gox repayments\n\nLooking ahead, we see several crypto specific themes in 2H23 that could be relevant for markets. One of the most well telegraphed sources of pressure in the months ahead may be the 141,686 BTC that\u2019s due to be distributed to creditors as part of the Mt. Gox rehabilitation plan.\n\nBase, intermediate and early lump sum disbursements are supposed to be paid by October 31 (though the deadline may still be extended). But bitcoin selling could take place before then to raise the cash needed for settlements. The general framework is that the first JPY200k (~US$1440) of each creditor\u2019s claim will be paid in cash followed by a mix of around 70%/30% token vs cash for the remaining balance \u2013 unless a creditor has explicitly requested a different split (e.g. 100% bitcoin or 100% cash). Incidentally, the two largest creditors representing around 20% of all Mt. Gox claims have also elected to be paid in mostly bitcoin.\n\nNote that we do not know the current number of available creditors as an unspecified number have sold their claims to third parties, but as of end-March 2023, there were 42,394 permitted creditors according to the rehabilitation trust. But in 2019, CoinTelegraph indicated there were 24,000 creditors affected by the Mt. Gox hack, and more recently, they reported 10,000 creditors. Taken together, we estimate the potential upper limit of forced bitcoin selling could be around 35k BTC. Currently, the Mt. Gox trustee is sitting on 137,891 BTC, a balance that has remained constant since May 2018.\n\nBitcoin halving\n\nFollowing Mt. Gox, the next most important bitcoin-related event will likely be the \u201crewards halving\u201d in April or May 2024, which we covered in our last monthly report . In our view, the halving will likely have a material impact on the market, though that\u2019s based less on the historical evidence and more on (1) our macro view and (2) how crypto markets have grown since previous halving events. That is, there is sidelined capital and a much bigger market today than there was 3 years ago. That could make a big difference, particularly if central banks start to cut rates in 4Q23 or early 1Q24. In other words, we don\u2019t think it will be the halving alone that will drive stronger bitcoin performance, but more likely a confluence of factors.\n\nChart 2. Rolling regression of global liquidity, US 2y rates and DXY vs bitcoin\n\nEthereum upgrade and blobs\n\nOn Ethereum, the upcoming Cancun (Dencun) Fork promises to support scaling on the network via layer-2 (L2) rollups, potentially increasing throughput and making transactions cheaper. Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844 ( proto-danksharding ) is at the core of this upgrade, which will increase data availability for rollups by creating a new data type called \u201cblobs\u201d (binary large objects).\n\nWhy this is significant is that this change will create new temporary space on blocks dedicated solely to the data that rollups submit to the main Ethereum network. That is, at the moment, rollups reduce transaction fees for users by batching multiple transactions into one transaction that gets stored on-chain indefinitely. With EIP-4844, that data will instead be stored as a blob transaction on the consensus layer for only three weeks, during which time the data can be verified. (It\u2019s cheaper if the data doesn\u2019t sit on the network forever.) The initial limit will be up to four blobs per block. The takeaway is that this will lower the floor for transaction fees on rollups and possibly allow rollup operators to post more data per transaction.\n\nNotably, proto-danksharding is only the prerequisite for full danksharding, which is expected to come later and incorporate data availability sampling, so that the verification of blob data will not require a full download each time. We think a more realistic release date for the Cancun Fork is in 1Q24 rather than 4Q23.\n\nAccount abstraction\n\nMore importantly is what comes next. In our view, this upgrade lays the foundation for account abstraction, which could lead to broader web3 adoption by making the experience more user-friendly. To oversimplify, account abstraction is the means by which the details of user accounts are hidden from the Ethereum protocol by allowing accounts to function like smart contracts. One net benefit of this is that it could allow decentralized applications (dapps) to pay for users\u2019 gas fees or possibly use other non-ETH tokens to pay for gas. When the transaction fees are low enough, we think more dapps may pursue this path, effectively changing the user experience on blockchains and allowing users to focus only on high-level interactions.\n\nL2s and decentralized sequencers\n\nMeanwhile, we think the conversation about L2s themselves will change in 2H23. In the first half of the year, market players were mainly focused on which protocols were dominating market share (as well as speculating over token airdrops to a lesser extent). We think their attention will now turn to figuring out how value will accrue to these scaling solutions and their associated tokens.\n\nChart 3. Monthly L2 gas usage remained high in 2Q23\n\nCurrently, fees on rollups mainly accrue to the sequencers that take transactions in the mempool and order them before submitting them to Ethereum. But most rollups rely on a single, centralized sequencer. An alternative would be to replace this with a network of nodes to order and validate those transactions, such that staking could be employed for validators to earn rewards.\n\nThe idea of shared sequencers also seems to be gaining more traction, whereby independent decentralized networks of sequencers could compete and be utilized by any rollup. Such a proposal could also introduce benefits like cross margining across rollups and minimizing liquidity fragmentation, though at the risk of distorting incentives.\n\nSecurity-as-a-service\n\nTraditionally, we have characterized the business model for layer-1 networks as blockspace-as-a-service. But in our 2023 Crypto Market Outlook , we alluded to the growth of middleware solutions that could introduce a new revenue stream for ETH validators in the form of \u201csecurity-as-a-service.\u201d Effectively, the concept of \u201cre-staking\u201d by EigenLayer is a way for validators to secure new features in Ethereum \u2013 like data availability networks, rollups, bridges, oracles, etc \u2013 or even secure other networks, possibly earning additional rewards in the process. EigenLayer recently launched on Ethereum mainnet in mid-June (phase 1) but has not yet started to support actively validated services.\n\nWhile re-staking allows validators to diversify their revenue sources, providing such security services comes with risk. For example, validators can be slashed by the EigenLayer network for possibly all of their 32 ETH deposits depending on the conditions imposed by a given actively validated service. In the normal course of processing Ethereum transactions, validators are rarely slashed their entire ETH stake. Moreover, the size of the potential earnings is still unknown as it is market-price driven and will depend on the level of demand for these services."

        "title": "Sector Report: Layer-2s - Bitcoin Market Journal",
        "content": "Executive Summary: Layer-2 blockchains were developed to help overcome the weaknesses in scalability seen in Layer-1 blockchains such as Ethereum. Their success has played a vital role in the growth of DeFi, NFTs, and other Web3 solutions on Ethereum. But after the successful completion of its ongoing PoS upgrade, the Ethereum Layer-1 blockchain is expected to become faster and more scalable than ever. What role, if any, will Layer-2 protocols have in the future of Ethereum 2.0? Are they still worth your investment? Find answers to these questions and more as we take a deep dive into the top Layer-2 blockchains.\n\nIndustry Overview\n\nBlockchain developers have to balance three major needs when designing a protocol \u2013 security, decentralization, and scalability. In traditional layer-1 protocols like Ethereum and bitcoin, improved security and decentralization often comes at the cost of scalability. This is commonly referred to as the \u201cBlockchain Trilemma.\u201d\n\nEthereum was the first major blockchain to provide smart contract capabilities. This first-mover advantage allowed it to attract developers and users at a rate that other newer Layer-1 blockchains find almost impossible to emulate.\n\nBut as the number of transactions on the blockchain increased dramatically, the network started experiencing crippling delays. And since the protocol has a bidding system for available block space, this led to astronomically high transaction costs (gas fees).\n\nIn some instances, the gas fees shot up to 500m gwei or around $1600 in current prices. And in those times of peak congestion, a single transaction could take more than 24 hours. For reference, a normal transaction during low traffic only takes a few seconds or minutes.\n\nThe main reason for this congestion is the extremely low rate of transactions per second (TPS) the original Ethereum blockchain could handle \u2013 between 12 to 15 transactions. The number for bitcoin is even lower \u2013 just 5 TPS.\n\nThese older Layer-1 blockchains use a Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism. The system, while excellent at providing security, is severely lacking when it comes to efficiency and scalability.\n\nAs network congestion became a major headache on Ethereum post-2020, Layer-2 blockchains were created to improve transaction speeds and reduce gas fees.\n\nA Layer-2 blockchain is a separate network that is built on top of an existing Layer-1 blockchain. Its main purpose is to remove or reduce the common transaction bottlenecks that prevent a blockchain from growing to accommodate more users and decentralized apps.\n\nDuring heavy network activity, Layer-2 networks take the bulk of transactions away from the mainnet. After processing the transactions, the data is posted back onto the Layer-1 through a connecting bridge.\n\nDifferent Approaches to Layer-2 Blockchains\n\nOver the years, developers have created multiple approaches to implementing Layer-2 solutions. The most adopted Layer-2 solutions in the industry in terms of market cap and TVL use one of the following 3 approaches\n\nPlasma\n\nA Layer-2 protocol using the plasma framework creates multiple \u201cchild chains\u201d connected to the Ethereum mainnet. While it boasts of a high TPS capability, plasma chains are not easy to design. They are more useful in specific use cases like decentralized exchanges, gaming, or token transfers. Polygon is a leading Layer-2 blockchain that deploys plasma chains.\n\nOptimistic Rollups\n\nA rollup is a Layer-2 solution designed to execute hundreds of Layer-1 transactions outside the mainnet. The solution then \u201crolls up\u201d these transactions and compresses them into a single piece of data before posting them back on the mainnet.\n\nOptimistic rollups are a subcategory of rollups that operate under the assumption that all transaction data committed to the mainnet is correct by default. But users can still challenge it on-chain and trigger a dispute resolution process.\n\nBy quickly processing transactions in good faith off-chain, optimistic rollups dramatically increase transaction speeds. But there is a slight delay in confirmation of transactions on the Ethereum mainnet, due to the provision for dispute resolution.\n\nOptimistic rollups are best suited for situations that involve many low-cost transactions. Perhaps not surprisingly, two of the most popular Layer-2 protocols by network activity \u2013 Arbitrum and Optimism, use Optimistic rollups.\n\nZero-Knowledge Rollups (zk-rollups)\n\nInstead of relying on an on-chain dispute resolution model, zk-rollups use cryptography to validate and authenticate transactions. Apart from that, everything else is broadly identical to how optimistic rollups work.\n\nZk-rollups are generally considered to be more efficient in situations that involve complex computations or enhanced security considerations. But they lack the full Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility that you get from optimistic rollups. This hinders interoperability, which is becoming increasingly important in the blockchain ecosystem. Additionally, zero-knowledge rollups and proof systems are complicated to build and deploy, which has limited their usage in real-world cases.\n\nLayer-2 Industry Growth\n\nLayer-2 blockchains played a major role in the rapid evolution and explosion of the DeFi ecosystem between 2020 and 2022. As Ethereum embarked on a multi-year transition into Proof of Stake (PoS), Layer-2 protocols enabled users to avoid high gas fees and network congestion.\n\nDue to its widespread adoption and features, Ethereum remains the industry leader in DeFi growth. According to DeFiLlama, the blockchain accounts for 58.58% of the total value locked into the ecosystem \u2013 valued at nearly $25 billion in Q2 2023.\n\nDuring its peak in Q4 2021, the total DeFi ecosystem was worth north of $174 billion, with close to $110 billion residing on the Ethereum network. This kind of growth would have been impossible without the support of Layer-2 blockchains.\n\nInvestment Thesis\n\nLayer-2 blockchains primarily revolve around Ethereum, the largest and most popular Layer-1 blockchain that supports smart contracts and DeFi apps. That begs the question \u201cWhy not just invest in Ethereum?\u201d\n\nWhile Ethereum is big on security and decentralization, it has a critical weakness in its lack of scalability. Without the ability to scale with demand, the growth and further evolution of Etheruem seems impossible. This is why we\u2019ve seen the growth in the number of L2 solutions looking to tackle Ethereum\u2019s scalability issues.\n\nThis faith has been validated to some extent by the rapid growth we witnessed in the DeFi space after 2020. According to Nansen, the TVL in DeFi grew more than 6,900% between 2020 and 2022. Even after a 76% market correction in 2022, the space still retains billions of dollars in locked capital.\n\nOutside of the cryptocurrency space, blockchain technology has applications in traditional finance and banking. And here, just as much as in crypto, scalability is crucial. Even if the wider crypto-markets fail in the long term, Layer-2 blockchains will still have a major role to play in the future of traditional finance, making them attractive targets for investors looking to capitalize on this growing need.\n\nWhile there are many compelling reasons to invest in Layer-2 projects, significant risks also exist. Chief among them is the possibility that Ethereum fails to succeed long-term. Because the L2s depend on Ethereum that would be a blow to the sector that it might not be able to accept.\n\nUltimately, if you are going to invest in one of these Layer-2 projects, it is important to choose the best. That\u2019s the one with the most growth, the most user traction, and the one most likely to succeed. Because if L2s remain necessary it is likely that eventually it will be a winner-takes-all scenario.\n\nWho\u2019s Investing: Institutional Backing\n\nAll the major layer-2 blockchain projects have received hundreds of millions of dollars in funding from well-known investors in the crypto space.\n\nPolygon\u2019s backers include Sequoia Capital, SoftBank, Galaxy Digital, Tiger Global Management, Alan Howard, Kevin O\u2019Leary, and Makers Fund, to name a few. Together, these entities have poured over $450 million into the project across 8 funding rounds.\n\nArbitrum counts Mark Cuban, Polychain Capital, Ribbit Capital, Redpoint, Pantera Capital, Coinbase Ventures, and Compound VC among its main investors. Total capital inflows into the project exceed $143 million.\n\nIn its Series A funding round, Optimism raised around $25 million from Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Paradigm, and IDEO Colab Ventures. Paradigm and a16z doubled down on their investments in the Series B round, pooling another $150 million into Optimism in 2022.\n\nImmutable raised around $75 million through its Series A and B funding rounds. Major investors included Apex Capital, AirTree Ventures, Alameda Research, and Galaxy Interactive. In another massive funding round in 2022, the firm received $200 million from Temasek, Tencent, ParaFi Capital, and nine other investors.\n\nTop Layer-2 Projects\n\nProject Market Cap Protocols Revenue (Annualized) TVL Avg Daily Active Users Polygon $5.73b 427 $25m $890.31m 389.17k Arbitrum $1.27b 361 $13.24m $2.06b 185.48k Optimism $741m 144 $16.09m $779.44m 77.17k Immutable X $660m NA NA NA NA\n\nPolygon (MATIC)\n\nMarket Cap: $5.73b\n\nNumber of Protocols: 427\n\nToken Price: $0.62\n\nTwitter Followers: 101.45k\n\nPolygon is a Layer-2 ecosystem for Ethereum that was launched in Mumbai, India as the Matic Network in 2017. Originally, the project was a plasma sidechain network. By 2021, it had expanded to include zk-rollups and optimistic rollups and was rebranded as Polygon.\n\nPolygon in its present state includes an eponymous software development kit \u2013 the Polygon SDK. Developers can use it to build any kind of Ethereum-compatible sidechain and decentralized applications.\n\nThe main Layer-2 blockchain at the core of the Polygon network is a PoS sidechain. The native token is called MATIC. The Polygon network has a TPS capacity of 65,000. And the gas fees are extremely low.\n\nDevelopers have access to all major sidechain architecture options on Polygon \u2013 plasma, zk, and optimistic. Although it lags behind other Layer-2 protocols in terms of TVL, Polygon leads the sector in market capitalization at $5.7b.\n\nA high market cap is a marker of wider recognition in the industry and greater support from investors. It shows that the project is in good financial health and has the resources to commit to further development and expansion.\n\nPolygon is way ahead of every other Layer-2 project in this aspect. The nearest contender, Arbitrum, is only one-fifth its size at $1.2b. With a wider focus on diversity, flexibility, and class-leading TPS of 65,000, it still has a long way to go.\n\nArbitrum (ARB)\n\nMarket Cap:$1.27b\n\nNumber of Protocols: 361\n\nToken Price: $1\n\nTwitter Followers: 805.5k\n\nArbitrum is a Layer-2 protocol for Ethereum launched in 2021 by a blockchain startup based in New York. The company, called Offchain Labs, was founded in 2018 and has major investors including Pantera Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, and the now-defunct Alameda Capital.\n\nUnlike Polygon, Arbitrum is only focused on optimistic rollups. Transactions and smart contracts are settled on the Arbitrum sidechain and then reported back to the Ethereum mainnet. The Layer-2 protocol boasts a TPS of 40,000 and absurdly low gas fees.\n\nArbitrum is also fully compatible with all EVM programming languages. The blockchain has gained some traction in the DeFi space in recent years. Major DeFi protocols like SushiSwap and Curve have Arbitrum integrations.\n\nIn 2023, the protocol also airdropped its highly anticipated native token called ARB. Arbitrum is generally considered a stable, mature, and reliable scaling solution for Ethereum. It also leads in terms of TVL among all Layer-2 rollups, with $2.06b or 67.12% of the market.\n\nA higher TVL indicates that more users are actively participating in contracts and transactions using the Layer-2 blockchain. Especially in the early stages of a blockchain, this is a sign of high growth potential.\n\nOptimism (OP)\n\nMarket Cap: $741m\n\nNumber of Protocols: 144\n\nToken Price: $1.16\n\nTwitter Followers: 516k\n\nOptimism is another Layer-2 blockchain solution for Ethereum with its base in New York. The project was first unveiled in 2019 before its eventual launch in late 2021. As its name indicates, Optimism uses optimistic rollups, much like its rival Arbitrum.\n\nThe Layer-2 blockchain is based entirely on Ethereum and offers full EVM compatibility. All Ethereum-based decentralized apps can run seamlessly on Optimism as well. It has a maximum TPS of 2,000 which is on the lower end of the spectrum for Layer-2 transaction speeds.\n\nThe native token on Optimism is called OP. It is based on the ERC-777 standard and functions as the governance token on the blockchain. It can also be bought and sold on all major crypto exchanges.\n\nAlthough it has been around for several years now, Optimism has failed to gain the same level of traction as its direct rivals like Arbitrum. But it still accounts for about 25% of the TVL in rollup chains. Whether it will be able to sustain its market share and grow is still an open question.\n\nImmutable X (IMX)\n\nMarket Cap: 660m\n\nNumber of Protocols: NA\n\nToken Price: $0.63\n\nTwitter Followers: 317.9k\n\nImmutable X is a Layer-2 blockchain project with a dedicated focus on NFTs. It was launched in Australia in 2018. It is one of the first Layer-2 solutions to focus exclusively on NFTs and Web3 gaming. The startup was heavily backed by Coinbase and Alameda Research.\n\nUnlike Optimism and Abritrum, Immutable X relies on the zk-rollup architecture for its Ethereum sidechains. The project uses a proprietary version of the zero-knowledge proof system called ZK-STARK for enhanced security.\n\nImmutable X offers a maximum TPS of 9000, along with near-zero gas fees. The project also claims that all its transactions are 100% carbon neutral. The protocol supports all Ethereum desktop NFT wallets.\n\nThe native token on the protocol is called IMX. It is an ERC-20 token that can be used for paying gas fees and for staking. IMX also pulls double duty as the governance token for the Immutable X DAO.\n\nWith a market cap of $670m, Immutable X is certainly quite well known in the Ethereum NFT circles. But with the crypto market downturn, NFTs and the Web3 gaming model of play-to-earn may be on their way out. Immutable X probably has the weakest prospects of all Layer-2 blockchains featured on this list due to its narrow focus.\n\nInvestor Takeaway\n\nLayer-2 blockchains provided the vital breathing space that Ethereum required during the bad old days of network congestion and high gas fees. After the complete transition to PoS, Ethereum 2.0 is expected to have transaction speeds of up to 100,000 TPS.\n\nHowever, according to the roadmap shared by Vitalik Buterin, that milestone is still several years away. And existing Layer-2 blockchains will continue to play a significant role in the future, even after upgrades bring features like sharding to the mainnet.\n\nAlong with bitcoin, Ethereum is one of the most reliable blockchain investments in terms of longevity and mainstream acceptance. And popular Layer-2 protocols like Arbitrum and Polygon still have a future in the Ethereum ecosystem."

        "title": "ConsenSys Announces Launch Of Linea zkEVM On Ethereum - CryptoDaily",
        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nConsenSys has announced the launch of its layer-2 network Linea, as the Ethereum ecosystem welcomed yet another scaling solution.\n\nLinea incorporates zero-knowledge cryptography and has produced considerable scaling milestones during testing, achieving faster throughput and significantly lower transaction costs compared to the main Ethereum network.\n\nA New Scaling Solution\n\nLinea is ConsenSys\u2019s new layer-2 scaling solution that enables developers to build or migrate decentralized applications (dApps) for Ethereum. The layer-2 network utilizes zero-knowledge proofs and is EVM-compliant, meaning applications on the network can seamlessly interact with the Ethereum blockchain. Zero-knowledge (zk) cryptography helps facilitate greater scalability and improved transaction speeds, thus helping address network congestion and high gas fees on Ethereum. The rollup network implemented by Linea is commonly known as zkEVM, thanks to its compliance with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\n\nA Highly Successful Testing Phase\n\nThe Linea zkEVM has been launched after a lengthy and highly successful testing phase after it was revealed that the ConsenSys team had been working on the rollup for the past four years. The testing phase began when ConsenSys released a public testnet on the 28th of March, enabling the stress-testing of the new layer-2 technology. The testnet phase saw around 5.5 million unique wallets conduct 46 million transactions. ConsenSys noted several improvements when it came to Linea\u2019s performance, transaction costs, and user experience throughout its testing phase.\n\nConsenSys has claimed that the fees on the network will be 15 times lower than those prevailing on the Ethereum main network. The alpha phase began on the 11th of July, with over 100 partners involved. Joseph Lubin, the founder and CEO of ConsenSys, talked about the number of layer-2 Ethereum scaling solutions and protocols and highlighted their importance when it came to driving the development of Web3 functionality and applications.\n\n\u201cWith the Merge to Proof of Stake and the broad traction of the rollup-centric roadmap, Ethereum L2s are set to play a crucial role in making great advances in scalability and usability.\u201d\n\nThe announcement also highlights several decentralized finance (DeFi) applications migrating to Linea to take advantage of its fast finality, security from the Ethereum mainnet, and capital-efficient bridge. The network also offers users low gas fees, high throughput, and low latency, all of which are critical to power blockchain gaming, non-fungible tokens, and social applications. App developers can deploy their projects and applications on Linea\u2019s \u201cAlpha\u201d network as early as Friday. However, general users will have to wait until next week to access the network.\n\nThe launch of the Alpha mainnet will use several safeguards to protect decentralized applications, users, and the network itself. Measures include allowing only launch partners to execute calls over the network for the first week. ConsenSys plans to further open up the network during ETHCC, which is scheduled to take place in France from the 17th of July. It also plans to hold a bug bounty and monitor performance before opening up the network to end users.\n\nConsenSys also announced the launch of its Linea Ecosystem Investment Alliance (EIA). The alliance will see over 30 venture capitalist firms give advisory assistance and lend capital to ecosystem builders. Ethereum layer-2 solutions have become a major talking point in 2023, with Polygon also taking its zkEVM network public in March. Starknet has also highlighted plans to increase the throughput on its network this year. Starknet founder Eli Ben-Sasson is the pioneer behind zk-proofs.\n\nKey Features\n\nLinea has seen the introduction of several features and upgrades with its alpha mainnet phase. These include a dynamic fee mechanism and a new outer-proof system. The alpha mainnet phase also introduces a feature called \u201cbatch conflation.\u201d This feature optimizes the number of layer-2 transactions and blocks that can fit into a layer-1 batch. This allows it to reduce fixed costs typically associated with layer-1 and help provide a cost-effective transaction experience. These upgrades will help Linea offer transaction costs that are far lower than Ethereum\u2019s main layer.\n\nAdditionally, MetaMask will also offer support for Linea soon, allowing users to access the network through the MetaMask Portfolio and Bridge, Swap, and Buy features. The MetaMask integration can be expected in the next few weeks and allow wallet users to interact with decentralized applications and protocols based on Linea.\n\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "content": "A bullish divergence may be forming for both Bitcoin and Ethereum if the data of this on-chain indicator is anything to go by.\n\nBitcoin & Ethereum Net Realized Profit/Loss Has Turned Negative Recently\n\nAccording to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the average trader is moving their BTC and ETH at a slight loss right now. The relevant indicator here is the \u201cNet Realized Profit/Loss\u201d (NRPL), which keeps track of the net amount of profit or loss that the investors are realizing through their selling currently.\n\nThis indicator works by going through the blockchain history of each coin being sold to see what price it was last moved at. If this previous selling price for any coin was less than the current spot price (that it is now being sold at), then that particular coin\u2019s sale is realizing a profit.\n\nSimilarly, in the opposite case, the investor would be harvesting losses with the coin\u2019s movement. As such, the NRPL adds up all such profits and losses and takes their difference.\n\nWhen the metric\u2019s value is positive, it means that the market as a whole is realizing a net amount of profit currently. On the other hand, negative values suggest the average trader is selling at some loss.\n\nNow, here is a chart that shows the trend in the NRPL for both Bitcoin and Ethereum over the last few months:\n\nThe value of the metric seems to have been become negative for both the cryptocurrencies | Source: Santiment on Twitter\n\nAs displayed in the above graph, the NRPL has turned negative for both Bitcoin and Ethereum recently. This means that the investors of the two largest cryptocurrencies in the sector have been selling their coins at a loss on average in this period.\n\nThese losses have only been slight, though, as both of these assets haven\u2019t moved too significantly in this period. Generally, deep capitulation events where holders exit the market at large losses only occur when the price observes an extended drawdown.\n\nHistorically, whenever the indicator has entered into the loss territory, the probability of a price jump has gone up. This is because loss selling can be a sign of weak hands leaving the market and investors with a stronger conviction may be picking up the coins they are selling.\n\nSantiment notes that the current trend of the NRPL for these assets is forming a bullish divergence when compared to the prices. And naturally, this could lead to a rise in the prices of these coins.\n\nHowever, as mentioned before, since the loss-taking is only at a slight level currently, the likelihood of a price increase is also obviously not too high, although it\u2019s still a positive sign for Bitcoin and Ethereum nonetheless.\n\nAn example of this pattern potentially influencing the price may be seen right before the BTC rally above the $30,000 mark, where investors were selling at loss levels similar to now.\n\nBTC Price\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $30,700, up 1% in the last week.\n\nBTC continues to consolidate sideways | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Pierre Borthiry \u2013 Peiobty on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, Santiment.net"

Do not invest unless you are prepared to lose your entire investment. For a full disclaimer, please click here.\n\nIn the world of cryptocurrency, price predictions hold huge weight for investors and enthusiasts alike.\n\nAs we look ahead to the next five years, this article dives into five surprising price predictions for major cryptos, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP.\n\nThese predictions, generated by ChatGPT\u2019s advanced algorithms, offer a unique perspective on the market that could prove both enlightening and thought-provoking.\n\n1. Bitcoin ($BTC)\n\nAs the first (and most well-known) cryptocurrency, Bitcoin continues to dominate the digital currency market.\n\nIntroduced in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto, the Bitcoin network operates in a decentralized manner, which ensures transparency, security, and the immutability of transactions.\n\nWith a limited supply of 21 million $BTC, the coin\u2019s value is driven by various factors, such as market demand, adoption, and regulatory developments.\n\nThe coin has gained significant attention in recent years, with CoinMarketCap highlighting its all-time high of $68,789.63 on November 10, 2021.\n\nDespite the coin\u2019s value decline since then, ChatGPT maintains that $BTC has the potential to recover and achieve new highs in the coming years.\n\nAccording to ChatGPT, Bitcoin\u2019s value could hit $100,000 in the next five years, representing a 228% increase from today\u2019s price.\n\nThis price estimation will be music to the ears of Bitcoin bulls, who have seen the coin struggle to cleanly break the $30,000 resistance level in recent weeks.\n\n2. Ethereum ($ETH)\n\nAnother cryptocurrency that ChatGPT is bullish on in the years ahead is Ethereum.\n\nRenowned for its smart contract capabilities and scalable network, Ethereum has become the go-to blockchain for decentralized application (dApp) developers globally.\n\nDue to this, Ethereum has become the main source of decentralized finance (DeFi) innovation \u2013 prompting other blockchains to follow suit.\n\nThe Ethereum network was even at the heart of the NFT craze, hosting well-known projects like Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and CryptoPunks.\n\nUnfortunately for $ETH bulls, the token\u2019s November 2021 high is now a distant memory \u2013 yet ChatGPT believes the token could post new highs in the next five years.\n\nPer the model\u2019s analysis, Ethereum could hit $10,000 by July 2028, a whopping 429% increase from today\u2019s price.\n\nChatGPT notes that several factors, including the sustained growth of the DeFi sector, could be the key catalysts for this price surge.\n\n3. Wall Street Memes ($WSM)\n\nLastly, Wall Street Memes ($WSM) is a brand-new meme coin inspired by the GameStop saga of 2021, when traders on r/WallStreetBets rallied against the short sellers on Wall Street.\n\nThe recently-launched $WSM token aims to capture the spirit of this movement, empowering investors to challenge the status quo in the crypto market.\n\nWall Street Memes is currently in its presale phase, which means that $WSM isn\u2019t yet available on the open market.\n\nHowever, this hasn\u2019t stopped eager investors from clamoring to buy tokens \u2013 leading to an incredible $14.4 million in funding being raised for the project thus far.\n\nA robust community has also formed around the project, with thousands of traders now participating in the official Telegram community.\n\nAll of these factors play into ChatGPT\u2019s bullish forecast for $WSM, which expects the token to hit $1 by 2028.\n\nConsidering Wall Street Memes\u2019 current presale price is just $0.0316, this would be an enormous return of 3,064% for those who invest today \u2013 and even higher for those who invested during the earlier presale stages.\n\n4. XRP ($XRP)\n\nXRP remains one of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the world, thanks to its \u201cOG status\u201d in the digital currency market.\n\nThis open-source project is designed to facilitate fast, cheap, and secure cross-border payments \u2013 which is still unattainable for most people.\n\nAlthough XRP was one of the first cryptocurrencies to hit the mainstream consciousness, it has displayed remarkable staying power, with CoinGecko reporting that it\u2019s still the world\u2019s sixth-largest token by market cap.\n\nHowever, this hasn\u2019t stopped XRP from becoming embroiled in a legal dispute with the SEC \u2013 a situation that has halted the token\u2019s price momentum in the past two years.\n\nFortunately, ChatGPT believes that XRP\u2019s legal troubles could soon be over, paving the way for sustained price growth.\n\nAccording to the AI model, the XRP price could rocket to $5 by 2028, representing a new all-time high.\n\nChatGPT notes that a future rise in global remittances and the need for real-time transactions could drive demand for XRP in the years ahead.\n\n5. Binance Coin ($BNB)\n\nBinance Coin, as the name suggests, is the native token of the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange by trading volume \u2013 Binance.\n\n$BNB was initially launched in 2017 as an ERC-20 token but has now migrated to the Binance Chain.\n\nThe coin has a variety of use cases within the context of the Binance ecosystem, such as being used to pay for trading/network fees.\n\nHowever, many investors opt to buy and hold $BNB to gain financial exposure to Binance\u2019s growth \u2013 a strategy that has proved fruitful in recent years.\n\nAt the time of writing, the $BNB price continues to be extremely volatile, given the recent lawsuit from the SEC against the Binance exchange.\n\nThe good news is that ChatGPT still predicts enormous growth for $BNB in the years ahead \u2013 forecasting that the coin\u2019s price could hit $1,000 by July 2028.\n\nAlthough this estimation may seem outlandish, it\u2019s worth remembering that the trajectory of exchange-based cryptos can often switch in the blink of an eye, meaning this coin is one to watch going forward."

        "content": "After enduring a turbulent year in 2022, investor sentiment toward cryptocurrencies has taken a positive turn in 2023. With improving economic circumstances, crypto assets are once again attracting investor interest and optimism.\n\nThis trend has been particularly evident in more recent weeks after a series of applications for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) raised hopes that the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency could finally witness mainstream acceptance among institutional investors.\n\nIn line with this, crypto investors have been shifting their holdings from stablecoins into Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), suggesting that market participants are growing hungrier for riskier assets such as cryptocurrencies, crypto expert Ali Martinez noted on July 12.\n\n\u201cCrypto investors are shifting from stablecoins into Bitcoin and Ethereum. A decrease in stablecoin holdings points to a higher risk appetite among investors as they move their capital to BTC and ETH.\u201d \u2013 Martinez said in a tweet.\n\nStablecoin holdings shifting into BTC and ETH. Source: Ali Martinez\n\nIncreased interest and holdings in Bitcoin and Ethereum are likely to have a noteworthy impact on their respective prices highlighted by the aggravated market realized value net position change. As more investors enter the market and acquire these cryptocurrencies, the demand for them will rise, potentially driving up their prices.\n\nAt the same time, Bitcoin fund holdings have also increased significantly recently, particularly after BlackRock applied for a spot BTC ETF in mid-June. Specifically, the number of BTC held by funds jumped to almost 850,000 \u2013 the highest level in 6 months.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nAt the time of writing, the price of Bitcoin was standing at $30,680, up around 0.95% in the past 24 hours.\n\nThe largest cryptocurrency gained more than 18% over the past month amid institutional crypto hype, adding almost $100 billion in market cap over that period.\n\nBTC 1-month price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nYear-to-date, BTC is up around 85%, marking an impressive rebound following a disastrous crypto winter last year.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin\u2019s price momentum oscillator (PMO), a significant technical indicator, has finally turned green after a certain time period, just like it did in 2014/15 prior to a major bull run that led to an all-time high later on.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "Although the cryptocurrency market behemoths Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have been consolidating their gains recently, plenty of cryptocurrency supporters have shared their optimistic prognoses for the industry\u2019s future, including Elon Musk.\n\nAs it happens, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) and Twitter (NYSE: TWTR) CEO was replying to a July 11 post by Twitter user Daniel, a.k.a. growing_daniel, who shared his prediction that, by the end of the decade, all traditional currencies might become digitalized through computer processors or graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nBy 2030 all currencies will be backed entirely by GPUs which five years ago would've sounded like a crypto prediction \u2014 Daniel (@growing_daniel) July 11, 2023\n\nNamely, the author referred to the fact that proof-of-work (PoW) crypto miners use GPUs used to mine digital assets, as well as the growing trend of fiat currency digitalization. In response, the billionaire entrepreneur agreed with the general sentiment, albeit specifying that there should be a change in terminology for the underlying technology as such. As Musk replied:\n\n\u201cWe should probably stop calling them GPUs, but yeah.\u201d\n\nNotably, such powerful statements as above, particularly expressed by influential figures like Musk himself, have been known to influence the general sentiment in the crypto sector, driving upward the price of the relevant digital assets mentioned or the market as a whole.\n\nWith this in mind, Bitcoin and Ethereum, as the industry\u2019s representatives and largest digital assets by market capitalization, could see a significant increase in price, particularly coinciding with other trends and indicators that could assist this bullish move.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum price analysis\n\nAt press time, Bitcoin was trading at $30,728, demonstrating an increase of 1.08% on the day, a 0.12% decline across the previous week, and an 18.56% gain on its monthly chart, as per the latest data retrieved by Finbold on July 12.\n\nBitcoin 24-hour price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nIndeed, the pseudonymous crypto market analyst known as Seth has noted Bitcoin\u2019s earlier chart patterns, specifically those from 2016 and 2019, which suggest that \u201cthe Bitcoin bull market has officially kicked off,\u201d as Finbold reported earlier.\n\nMeanwhile, the price of the Ethereum cryptocurrency stood at $1,889.36, up 1.07% in the last 24 hours, down 2.15% over the past seven days, as well as gaining 8.36% to its value across the previous month, as the recent charts suggest.\n\nEthereum 24-hour price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum, too, has been giving off a bullish vibe, leading crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa to express the belief that it could \u201cgo as high as $3,000 before a pullback,\u201d the strength of which will depend on the wider macro factors, according to the tweet.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "title": "Stader Labs launches high-yield Ethereum staking | - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "Boldly etching its name in the dynamic sphere of blockchain technology, Stader Labs has launched a high-yield Ethereum staking product.\n\nWidening the horizons of staking potential, this innovative offering proposes a lucrative appeal, dwarfing other protocols by boasting the highest yield on Ethereum (ETH) staking. It signifies an evolution in how the digital economy can be accessed and optimized.\n\nLowering the stakes for greater inclusivity\n\nNormally, native Ethereum staking would mandate a hefty lock-up of 32 ETH minimum. However, with the recent foray of Stader Labs into the Ethereum network, this prerequisite takes a nosedive.\n\nThe firm\u2019s new proposition enables network node operators to maintain network operations with a modest 4 ETH, slashing the capital commitment by an impressive 85%.\n\nThe mechanics are straightforward. A node operator pledges a 4 ether bond, in response to which, Stader Labs issues an ETHx token. This token essentially mirrors the full stake.\n\nThe 28 ether gap, therefore, is fulfilled by liquid stakers. This model\u2019s inherent flexibility effectively democratizes participation, enticing a broader demographic of users to the Ethereum staking ecosystem.\n\nStader Labs doesn\u2019t stop at inclusivity; it follows through with profitability. In a bid to sweeten the deal for its users, the company offers a 50% reward boost.\n\nConsequently, the reward rate surges to an impressive figure of over 6%. Node operators, taking advantage of Stader\u2019s service and deploying 8x leverage, can anticipate yields soaring by up to 35% on their staked ETH.\n\nFor comparison, acclaimed staking services like Lido and RocketPool currently hold a combined ether value of $15.5 billion, offering yields between 3% to 4%. Therefore, the strikingly high yields by Stader Labs unquestionably sets it apart from the competition.\n\nDecentralization: The core ethos\n\nWhile higher yields and lower capital requirements undeniably mark a winning formula, another equally significant aspect of Stader Labs\u2019 operations is its commitment to decentralization.\n\nStaking plays an essential role in blockchain network maintenance, akin to the operations of a traditional savings bank. It\u2019s a passive investment strategy that attracts substantial user involvement.\n\nThe issue lies with the prevalent centralization in the existing staking protocols. Stader Labs, however, is stepping up to this challenge.\n\nCurrently, the top three entities stake more than half of the total ETH, with a single predominant liquid staking protocol holding about a 90% market share. This presents a concern for potential power imbalances and monopolistic tendencies.\n\nAs a proactive measure against such centralization, Stader Labs has imposed a self-restriction of a 22% share of all staked ETH. This move ensures a fair distribution of power among Ethereum staking solutions and guards against possible centralization.\n\nIn the words of Amitej Gajjala, CEO at Stader Labs, the intent is to help maintain the pledge of keeping Ethereum decentralized and diversify the Ethereum staking landscape.\n\nBottomline the recent move by Stader Labs to launch a high-yield Ethereum staking product isn\u2019t just about profitability. It\u2019s a statement echoing the essence of blockchain technology \u2013 decentralization and democratization.\n\nIt\u2019s a promise to Ethereum users of a fair, balanced, and rewarding ecosystem. With such a strategy, the future certainly looks bright for both Stader Labs and the Ethereum network."

        "content": "The stellar ecosystem will welcome liquidity and developers from other chains with the help of Allbridge and the $100 million Soroban Adoption Fund\n\nThe Allbridge protocol specializes in integrating EVM with non-EVM blockchains thus improving the general Web3 development.\n\nThe future growth prospects of blockchain technology are undeniably pegged to the ability of different chains to communicate safely and in a scalable manner. The Stellar network clearly understands the importance of opening up to other chains amid the mainstream adoption of Web3 products. Furthermore, the Stellar (XLM) ecosystem is actively developing infrastructure for decentralized applications (Dapps) developers to reach a wider audience.\n\nStellar Network Welcomes Allbridge\n\nAmid increased cryptocurrency adoption by institutional and retail traders, the Stellar ecosystem has stepped up its operations by welcoming the Allbridge solution to its network. According to the announcement, Allbridge has established a new cross-chain bridge to enable a seamless digital asset transfer between the Stellar network and other prominent chains such as Ethereum, Binance Chain, Solana, Celo, and Polygon.\n\nAt Allbridge, we are committed to increasing cross-chain interoperability between diverse blockchain ecosystems.\n\nsaid Andriy Velykyy, co-founder and CEO of Allbridge.\n\nThe latest integration with the Stellar network is the result of our hard work, delivering on the expectations set out by the Bridge Bounty Program. With this new bridge, we are bringing access to the Stellar ecosystem to the countless DeFi users, allowing them to experience Stellar\u2019s expansive ecosystem of dApps and services.\n\nThe announcement was warmly welcomed by the Stellar community including Ultra Stellar, a software engineering company specialized in developing financial solutions for the Stellar network.\n\nBig news: @Allbridge_io introduces cross-chain bridge, unlocking interoperability between Stellar, Ethereum, Solana, Celo, and Polygon for seamless asset transfers. https://t.co/Ht5SPiQvPa \u2014 Stellar (@StellarOrg) July 11, 2023\n\nReportedly, the Ultra Stellar team played a crucial role in the creation of a new cross-chain network with Allbridge. According to Dmitri Gmyza, a team member of the Ultra Stellar network, the leading products including LOBSTR, StellarX, and StellarTerm will have more utility with adoption from other chains.\n\nSimilarly, Tomer Weller, Vice President of Tech Strategy at the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF), reiterated the importance of a new cross-chain network between Allbridge and the Stellar ecosystem.\n\n\u201cWhen we launched the Stellar Bridge Bounty Program, we sought to support the development of cross-chain solutions on the Stellar network. With one powerful innovation, we are expanding the Stellar network\u2019s reach and utility while welcoming more developers and projects from different networks to join the Stellar ecosystem,\u201d Weller noted.\n\nOne of the largest utilities of the Allbridge on Stellar ecosystem will be the stablecoins market, which will help holders bridge assets to and from other chains seamlessly.\n\nMarket Outlook\n\nThe Stellar network is slated to attract more institutional investors and central banks seeking to tap into blockchain technology. Furthermore, the $4.8 billion valued network has the infrastructure in place to adopt CBDCs and mint stablecoins at scale. Additionally, Stellar Network has not been sued by the United States SEC on allegations of selling unregistered offerings and continues to build more DeFi products.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.
