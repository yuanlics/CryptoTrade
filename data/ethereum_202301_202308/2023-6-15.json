        "title": "Ethereum staked ready to flip ETH on crypto exchanges - Blockworks",
        "content": "Ethereum is fast approaching a very particular flippening.\n\nNo, ether (ETH) isn\u2019t about to eclipse bitcoin (BTC) in terms of market cap (at least, not yet).\n\nInstead, the raw number of ETH staked inside the Ethereum blockchain is set to surpass the ether kept on crypto exchanges for the first time ever some time over the next few weeks.\n\nEarlier this week, there was 22.8 million ETH ($39.75 billion) completely staked compared to almost 24.3 million ETH ($42.38 billion) sitting on exchanges, per Nansen data analyzed by Blockworks. Each represents about 20% of ETH\u2019s circulating supply.\n\nThat worked out to be only 6.12% more ETH on exchanges than staked.\n\nAt the end of May, that spread was almost 16%.\n\nAt the start of the year, it was more than 41%.\n\nIt\u2019s not the actual flippening, but it\u2019ll do\n\nOverall, there\u2019s 4.9 million fewer ETH ($8 billion) on crypto exchanges than at the start of the year \u2014 a 17% reduction. And there\u2019s 5.7 million more ETH ($9.4 billion) locked in the Ethereum blockchain over the same period, a jump of one-third.\n\nThe figures suggest the SEC\u2019s persistent mudslinging has spurred Ethereum users to stake their ether rather than keep it on exchanges.\n\nEther stakers lock their tokens in the network to take part in consensus and earn yield, either by running validator nodes themselves or via services such as Lido.\n\nSome crypto exchanges also offer staking-as-a-service products, however the SEC generally considers those to be unregistered securities. Ethereum staking yield is currently about 6% (paid in ETH).\n\nMore ETH staked now than during FTX scandal\n\nGranted, crypto investors by far pulled the most ether throughout the FTX reckoning last November than at any point over the past 30 months.\n\nBack then, net outflows from crypto exchanges averaged nearly 130,500 ETH ($227.1 million) per day, from when FTX went kaput to the end of that month.\n\nNet outflows did surpass 200,000 ETH ($348.3 million) on June 5 \u2014 the same day the SEC sued Binance. A similar number was hit as Coinbase received its own lawsuit the following day. But they\u2019ve since tapered off.\n\nNet ether staked hovered between 69,600 ETH ($121 million) and 112,100 ETH ($195 million) in the days directly around those suits \u2014 roughly two-and-a-half times the daily average throughout the FTX collapse.\n\nIt is unknown whether the exact same ETH that was ripped from crypto exchanges ended up staked in Ethereum. In any case, net ether outflows from exchanges certainly spiked as the recent lawsuits hit newswires. But equal amounts haven\u2019t flowed into the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nFor instance, interest in ETH staking peaked three days before the Binance case was revealed, with net staking inflows of around 397,700 ETH ($692.6 million) on June 2, the highest on record.\n\nNet outflows and net staked have picked up considerably amid the SEC crackdown\n\n\u2018Not your keys,\u2019 but make it yield\n\nStill, it appears general sentiment has shifted more toward decentralized blockchain architecture than centralized platforms susceptible to regulatory persecution.\n\nFor instance, net staking inflows were also really high throughout May after jumping considerably after the Shapella upgrade activated withdrawals in April.\n\nThe May surge also came after Kraken unwound its ether staking-as-a-service program due to SEC threats received in February, and after Coinbase\u2019s own Wells notice over similar services garnered in late March.\n\nCoinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has said his firm wouldn\u2019t unwind its Ethereum staking products in the same way as Kraken.\n\nThe number of ETH staked flipping crypto exchange balances is a reassuring sign that crypto users truly value the benefits of decentralized technology. \u201cNot your keys\u201d and all that.\n\nIt took less than two weeks for the spread between ETH on exchanges and ETH staked to drop from more than 16% to 6%.\n\nIf that trend continues, the staking-exchange flippening should hit by the end of this month.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

ETH could continue to move down if it stays below $1,700 and $1,720.\n\nEthereum is slowly moving higher from the $1,620 support zone.\n\nThe price is trading below $1,700 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,720 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could struggle to recover above the $1,700 and $1,720 resistance levels.\n\nEthereum Price Faces Uphill Task\n\nEthereum\u2019s price remained in a bearish zone below the $1,720 resistance. ETH extended its decline below the $1,660 level, similar to Bitcoin.\n\nThere was a spike below the $1,630 support. The price tested the $1,620 zone. A low is formed near $1,620 and the price is now attempting a recovery wave. There was a move above the $1,640 and $1,650 levels. The bulls pushed the price toward the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,748 swing high to the $1,620 low.\n\nEther is still trading below $1,700 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,720 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nImmediate resistance is near the $1,700 level or the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. It is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,748 swing high to the $1,620 low. The next major resistance is near the $1,720 level and the trend line.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nA proper move above the $1,700 and $1,720 resistance levels might start a steady recovery wave. The next resistance sits near $1,775, above which Ethereum could rise toward the $1,820 level. Any more gains above the $1,820 resistance zone might send the price toward the $1,850 resistance.\n\nFresh Decline in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,700 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,640 level.\n\nThe next major support is near the $1,620 level. If there is a break and close below the $1,620 support, the price could dive toward the $1,550 support. Any more losses may perhaps send the price toward the $1,500 zone.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,620\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,700\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "What happened\n\nSeveral cryptocurrencies and crypto stocks rose today after BlackRock (BLK 0.54%), the largest asset manager in the world, filed to launch a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nSince late afternoon yesterday, the price of Bitcoin traded 4.5% higher as of 3:42 p.m. ET today.

Cryptocurrencies have rallied this year on the belief that the Fed would soon be done with its aggressive rate-hiking.\n\nToday, though, investors seemed to overlook these concerns as BlackRock submitted a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a Bitcoin ETF, which would be the first spot crypto ETF if approved.\n\nDespite the plan's rejections in the past, some experts believe the proposal has a chance because BlackRock wants to enter a \"surveillance-sharing agreement,\" meaning it would share data about trading activity and their customers, in an effort to prevent market manipulation."

        "content": "Ethereum Foundation researcher Michael Neuder has floated a proposal to increase the maximum effective balance of Ethereum validators from the current 32 to 2,048 ETH.\n\nThe change is expected to reduce staking infrastructure complexity for large validators and improve user experience if implemented.\n\nEthereum eyes staking limit increase\n\nThe minimum and maximum effective balances of Ethereum validators have been capped at 32 ETH since the network\u2019s successful transition to the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism last year. However, a new proposal by Ethereum Foundation researcher Michael Neuder aims to increase that number significantly.\n\nThe current 32 ETH cap makes it impossible for validators to earn interest on staked ether beyond that number. The proposed change by Neuder aims to remove this limit and unlock various benefits for validators.\n\nWhile the current 32 ETH has made the Ethereum network more decentralized than ever, boasting 600,000 active validators and counting, the proposed change will enable validators to earn more interest while also reducing infrastructure complexity since they will no longer need to deploy millions of containing 32 ETH nodes, just to increase their yield.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum\u2019s zkSync Era reaches $500m in TVL\n\nAdditionally, the team has clarified that increasing the maximum effective balance to 2,048 will significantly reduce the load on the network\u2019s peer-to-peer layer brought about by the massive volume of messages.\n\nThe team claims the increase will also make the implementation of future Ethereum roadmap upgrades easier, amongst other benefits.\n\nDuring the just concluded Ethereum All Core Developers\u2019 Consensus (ACDC) call #111, the team also discussed other potential tweaks to the network, including changes to validator attestation and aggregation deadlines and more.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "EigenLayer, a highly anticipated \u201crestaking\" protocol for Ethereum, successfully completed the initial guarded stage of its mainnet launch on Wednesday.\n\nUsers can now deposit liquid staking tokens (LSTs) into the protocol, or set up and configure an EigenPod to natively restake ETH. The protocol supports Lido\u2019s stETH, Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH, and Coinbase\u2019s cbETH tokens, with plans to onboard other LSTs in the future.\n\nOnce its rollout is complete, EigenLayer will allow Ethereum stakers to validate third-party services for a yield while simultaneously earning staking rewards for securing the network.\n\n\u201cEigenLayer aims to empower the ecosystem stakeholders and innovate on both the future of shared security, as well as the future of decentralization,\u201d the project said in a blog post.\n\nEigenLayer\u2019s liquid staking pools are currently capped at 3,200 tokens each, with individual deposits limited to 32 tokens per transaction. The creation of new EigenPods will pause once native staking exceeds 9,600 ETH. Withdrawal requests will execute after a seven-day delay.\n\n$32B Market\n\nEigenLayer is seeking to harness Ethereum\u2019s staking ecosystem as a shared security layer, but its success may hinge on its ability to compete with DeFi protocols as a source of additional yield for stakers.\n\nPopular LSTs like stETH and rETH enjoy integrations with a wide range of DeFi protocols, offering holders a variety of strategies for generating yield or accessing liquidity while continuing to accumulate staking rewards.\n\nAlthough Ethereum\u2019s staked capitalization is already $32.5B, only 16% of circulating Ether is staked, suggesting the sector may still have significant room to grow.\n\nRestaking\n\nThe Ethereum network validates code written in its native Solidity programming language that is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), Ethereum\u2019s core smart contract engine.\n\nEigenLayer allows stakers to also opt-in to validate modules containing non-EVM code, also called \u201cActively Validated Services (AVSs),\u201d by harnessing Ethereum\u2019s staking ecosystem as a shared security layer.\n\nStory continues\n\nEigenLayer said the second phase of its launch would introduce \u201cOperators,\u201d which perform validation tasks for AVSs built on the EigenLayer protocol. AVSs will come online later, completing EigenLayer\u2019s mainnet launch.\n\n\u201cRestakers have the flexibility to delegate their staked ETH to Operators or run validation services themselves, effectively becoming an Operator,\u201d EigenLayer said. \u201cRestakers retain agency over their stake and choose which AVSs they opt-in to validate for.\u201d\n\nOperators and restakers face additional penalties if an AVS they secure misbehaves or if they fail to perform validation duties, on top of the regular slashing risks associated with staking.\n\nVitalik Buterin recently warned against protocols seeking to leverage Ethereum\u2019s social consensus mechanism for purposes other than securing the Ethereum network.\n\n\u201cWe should be wary of application-layer projects taking actions that risk increasing the \u2018scope\u2019 of blockchain consensus to anything other than verifying the core Ethereum protocol rules,\u201d Buterin said in a blog post last month.\n\nSreeram Kannan, EigenLayer\u2019s founder, described Vitalik\u2019s critique as an \u201cexcellent analysis,\u201d advocating for restakers to use the protocol for \u201clow-risk\u201d activities.\n\nGovernance\n\nThe protocol\u2019s contracts are upgradeable and pausable. Three multisig governance wallets oversee contract upgrades, pause functionality, and protocol parameter adjustments respectively.\n\nEigenLayer described the setup as a temporary governance solution and said it intends to decentralize in the future. Its multisig signers include Tim Beiko from the Ethereum Foundation, Swapnil Raj from Nethermind, and Ben Rodriguez from Coinbase Cloud.\n\n\u201cThese multisigs represent a rudimentary but working system of transparent initial governance, with appropriate checks and balances,\u201d EigenLayer said.\n\nConsenSys and Sigma Prime audited EigenLayer\u2019s code.

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price has experienced a decline in recent days after being unable to surpass the $2,000 level. However, it is currently testing an important support level, and its response to it is expected to have a significant impact on performance in the coming months.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy: Edris\n\nThe Daily Chart:\n\nOn the daily timeframe, Ethereum\u2019s price has faced rejection from the 50-day moving average at approximately $1,850 and has subsequently declined below $1,800. The price is currently experiencing downward momentum, but it is finding support near the 200-day moving average around $1,600.\n\nThe 200-day moving average is a strong indicator of the overall trend, and if ETH falls below it, it would indicate a continuation of the bearish market sentiment, potentially leading to a drop toward the $1,300 level.\n\nHowever, if the price bounces back from the mentioned moving average and successfully breaks above both the $1,800 level and the 50-day moving average, there is a high likelihood of Ethereum rallying towards the resistance level at $2,300 and potentially even higher.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart:\n\nOn the 4-hour chart, Ethereum\u2019s price has experienced a rapid decline in recent days after being rejected from the $1,900 level and the upper boundary of the large falling wedge pattern.\n\nIt is currently testing the lower trend line of the pattern, which is situated around the $1,600 support level. A breakdown below it would have severe consequences for the price.\n\nHowever, the RSI indicator is suggesting that the market is oversold, which suggests the possibility of a potential pullback, consolidation, or even a bullish reversal from the current area. Yet, the outcome will depend on whether the price is able to hold at the current level or if it breaks down further.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nBy: Edris\n\nEthereum Taker Buy Sell Ratio\n\nEthereum\u2019s price has experienced a bearish trend after failing to surpass the $2,000 level. To gain insights into the reasons behind this behavior, analyzing the sentiment in the futures market can be informative.\n\nThe taker buy-sell ratio metric, depicted in the chart with a 100-day moving average applied, examines whether buyers or sellers are executing their perpetual futures orders more aggressively, meaning entering at the market price instead of setting limit orders.\n\nIt is apparent that when the price approached $2,000, the metric dropped below 1, indicating that short sellers started dominating the market and actively shorting Ethereum. This contributed to the downward pressure on the price. Although the ratio has shown a slight recovery recently, as long as it remains below 1, there is still potential for further downward price movement."

A death cross pattern may come into the picture if losses extend into the weekend, with the 50-day EMA (red) crossing below the 100-day EMA (blue).\n\nTraders considering buying the dip must wait for a confirmed rebound from the short-term support at $1,630, reinforced by the lower ascending trendline. Another buyer congestion holds at $1,600 as the last line of defense to prevent all hell from breaking lose to $1,450.\n\nEthereum DeFi Total Value Locked Dips\n\nEthereum, the time-tested pioneer in the DeFi realm, has experienced a tumultuous journey with regard to its Total Value Locked (TVL). Though it has shown resilience in the face of shifting market tides, Ethereum\u2019s position has faced formidable challenges from rising stars in the space like Optimism (OP), Tron (TRX), Solana (SOL), and Polygon (MATIC) among others.\n\nSince June 2022, Ethereum\u2019s dominance in the DeFi sector has been increasingly contested. Layer-2 solutions like Polygon have seen a considerable surge in TVL, thanks in large part to their ability to provide faster and cheaper transactions.\n\nThis has inevitably impacted Ethereum\u2019s position, prompting a reevaluation of its supremacy in the DeFi landscape. According to the latest data on the DeFi space by DefiLlama, the network\u2019s TVL has since June 15 lost $7.84 billion.\n\nIf the rout continues, the TVL may drop further from the current $24.36 billion, thus fading in comparison to Ethereum\u2019s all-time high of approximately $108 billion in November 2021.\n\nLiquid staking platform Lido accounts for the highest TVL in Ether\u2019s ecosystem at $12.65 billion. MakerDAO comes in second place with less than half of Lido\u2019s at $5.47 billion, while Aave, Curve Finance, and Uniswap fill the rest of the top five positions in that order.\n\nThe extensive crypto winter is the biggest challenge to investors in DeFi. As the market wobbles they are forced to pull their staked holdings to diversify their portfolios. Unfortunately, this situation increases overhead pressure for DeFi protocols like Ethereum.\n\nEthereum price is bound to stay vulnerable until resistance at $1,800 is reclaimed for a continued upswing to $2,000 and beyond.\n\nRelated Articles:"

ETH reacted to the downside below the $1,720 support after the Fed interest rate decision, similar to Bitcoin.\n\nThere was a clear move below the $1,700 and $1,640 support levels. The price declined over 5% and traded close to $1,630. A low is formed near $1,630 and the price is now consolidating losses.

        "title": "3 key Ether price metrics point to growing resistance at the $1,750 level - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ether\u2019s price plunged 7% between June 14 and June 15, reaching its lowest level in three months and impacting investors\u2019 view that the altcoin was en-route to turning $2,000 to support.\n\nIt is worth noting that the $1,620 bottom represents a $196 billion market capitalization for Ether (ETH), which is higher than PetroChina\u2019s $186 billion and not far from chipmaker AMD\u2019s $198 billion.\n\nBeing the 66th largest global tradable asset is no small feat, especially considering that the cryptocurrency is merely eight years old and does not return any kind of direct profit for the project\u2019s maintenance. On the other hand, securities enjoy the benefits of corporate earnings and eventual government subsidies, so perhaps investors should be concerned by the recent price drop in Ether.\n\nEther price pressured, succumbs to regulation and lowered network activity\n\nRegulatory pressure helped to subdue investors\u2019 appetite for Ether as the Securities and Exchange Commission proposed a rule change regarding the definition of an exchange. Paul Grewal, chief legal officer of the Coinbase exchange, has pushed back against the proposed change, claiming that it violates the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nMore concerningly, decentralized application (DApp) usage on the Ethereum network failed to gain momentum despite gas fees plummeting by 75%. The seven-day average transaction cost dropped to $4 on June 14, down from $16 one month prior. Meanwhile, DApp active addresses declined by 18% in the same period.\n\nThe 30-day Ethereum DApp activity. Source: DappRadar\n\nNotice that the decline happened across the board, affecting decentralized finance, nonfungible token marketplaces, gaming and collectibles alike. Curiously, the total value locked (TVL), which measures the deposits locked in Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts, declined by a mere 2% versus mid-May to 14.6 million ETH, according to DefiLlama.\n\nTo analyze the odds of Ether\u2019s price breaking below the $1,650 support, one should check for a reduced ETH futures premium and increased costs for protective put options.\n\nEther quarterly futures are popular among whales and arbitrage desks. However, these fixed-month contracts typically trade at a slight premium to spot markets, indicating that sellers are asking for more money to delay settlement.\n\nAs a result, ETH futures contracts in healthy markets should trade at a 5 to 10% annualized premium \u2014 a situation known as contango, which is not unique to crypto markets.\n\nEther 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nAccording to the futures premium, known as the basis indicator, professional traders have been avoiding leveraged longs (bullish bets). Despite the modest improvement to 2%, the indicator remains far from the neutral 5% threshold.\n\nTo exclude externalities that might have solely impacted the Ether futures, one should analyze the ETH options markets. The 25% delta skew indicator compares similar call (buy) and put (sell) options and will turn positive when fear is prevalent because the protective put option premium is higher than the call options.\n\nEther 30-day 25% skew. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe skew indicator will move above 8% if traders fear an Ether price crash. On the other hand, generalized excitement reflects a negative 8% skew. As displayed above, the delta skew has been signaling fear since June 10 and peaked at 21% on June 15 \u2014 the highest level in three months.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s what happened in crypto today\n\nEther\u2019s price looks poised to drop down to $1,560\n\nInvestors tend to focus solely on short-term price movements and forget that Ether\u2019s price is up 37% year-to-date in 2023. Moreover, by relying too much on Ethereum\u2019s $24 billion in TVL, traders might have missed the signals of weakening demand for DApp use.\n\nFor now, bears have the upper hand considering the ETH derivatives metrics, so a retest of the $1,560 support is the most likely outcome. That does not mean that the 2023 gains are at risk, but until the regulatory FUD \u2014 fear, uncertainty and doubt \u2014 dissipates, bulls will have a hard time moving Ether above the $1,750 resistance.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction: June has been a challenging month for Ethereum holders, as the altcoin has witnessed a sharp decline of nearly 15% in market value over the past two weeks. Amidst this downturn, Ethereum\u2019s price has recently reached a low of $1624.65, finding support at a long-established trendline. This dynamic support has played a crucial role in sustaining an uptrend for ETH price over the past seven months. Now the question arises: Can buyers initiate a new recovery rally from this point?\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Leads, Hedera\u2019s Revenue Surges Nearly 500%: Messari\u2019s Q1\u201923 Report\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Price Daily Chart\n\nA bullish reversal from the ascending trendline could replenish the bullish momentum in ETH\n\nThe 100-and-200-day EMA moving near $1775 and $1700 increases the resistance power of these levels.\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $5.8 Billion, indicating a 37.5% loss.\n\nSource-tradingview\n\nRecent Reversal and Buying Opportunity:\n\nThe falling Ethereum price has found reliable support at the ascending trendline of the daily chart. Historical data reveals that the price has rebounded from this support trendline on three occasions, suggesting active accumulation by buyers during dips.\n\nOn June 15th, the ETH price rebounded from the rising trendline, experiencing a 2.3% surge and reaching a current trading level of $1668. This reversal presents another opportunity for buyers to capitalize on the dip, with a suggested stop loss set at $1625.\n\nShould the coin price maintain sustainability above the trendline, buyers could gradually drive a recovery above the $2140 peak.\n\nCan $ETH Price Revisit the $2140?\n\nA retest of the long-established support trendline holds a high probability of reigniting a bullish momentum, leading to a new recovery phase. However, for traders seeking a safer entry point, waiting for a breakout above a significant resistance level is advisable. A potential breakout beyond the $1775 barrier would offer buyers additional confirmation of a bullish recovery, potentially driving the price toward the previous swing high of $2138.\n\nRelative Strength Index: The RSI slope on the daily timeframe currently slopes below 40%, indicating a high bearish momentum. Traders can wait for a breakout above $1775 to gain a stronger edge in their decision-making process.\n\nExponential Moving Average: t a bearish crossover between the 20-day and 100-day EMAs could further intensify selling pressure in the market."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nPopular decentralized exchange (DEX), Uniswap, launched its fourth version this week, which brings with it a series of new features and customizability. It also brought, however, the wrath of the open source Ethereum community.\n\nThe reason? The license they are using for v4.\n\nLefteris Karapetsas spoke to Decrypt about the controversy. He is an Ethereum developer, and founder of rotki, a portfolio tracker that protects user\u2019s privacy.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cUniswap decided to go with a Business Source License (BSL), continuing what they did with v3\u201d he said, adding that he\u2019s not happy with the decision. Karapetsas added \u201cthe reason is they don\u2019t understand open source and they believe their moat is their code which is wrong.\u201d\n\nReleased as a Business Source License 1.1, this type of license means the code is publicly available and is allowed to be copied, modified or redistributed. It does have a limitation, however. It cannot be used for commercial or production purposes for up to four years, at which point it will convert to a General Purpose License (GPL) in perpetuity.\n\nThere are five licenses that typically come up on truly free open source projects: Permissive, the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) license, the Massachusetts Institute (MIT) license, the Apache license, and Copyleft.\n\nInventor of Total Value Locked (TVL), Scott Lewis pointed out that while Uniswap claims they open sourced v4, it\u2019s actually a 4-year proprietary license. \u201cIf anyone else misrepresented the truth like this they would be torn to shreds,\" he said on Twitter. \"That\u2019s the power of being powerful.\u201d\n\nUniswap Labs\u2019 claim: \u201cwe open sourced v4\u201d\n\nUniswap Labs\u2019 reality: Four Year Proprietary License.

Lead engineer Noah Zinsmeister thinks four years isn\u2019t a very long time, and that [the BSL license] strikes a \u201creasonable balance between incentivizing innovation and giving exclusive rights to the protocol, which has precedents in 'normal' settings as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cBusiness source license is a tax on innovation,\u201d tweeted Gabriel Shapiro, general counsel at Delphi Labs, a Web3 research and development platform. He also pointed out that \u201canyone who's looked at BSL code even once, and then later codes something similar, is at a risk of catching a copyright claim.\u201d\n\nThe licenses used in the space are, according to Shapiro, difficult to navigate. \u201cIt would be hard to find a team of devs who are both capable of coding a new AMM from scratch and have never looked at Uniswap v4 code\u201d he tweeted.\n\nsimply put, it would be hard to find a team of devs who are both capable of coding a new AMM from scratch *and* have never looked Uniswap v4 code this doesn't mean they infringed, but that's not enough--they need to be able to *prove* they did not infringe, which will be hard \u2014 _gabrielShapir0 (@lex_node) June 14, 2023\n\nUniswap\u2019s latest version introduces a new kind of smart contract called \u201chooks,\u201d which allow developers to expand upon already existing liquidity pools. Lead smart contract engineer for the project, Sara Reynolds, told Decrypt the level of innovation that \u201chooks\u201d brings makes it \u201ckind of limitless\u201d in terms of customizability.\n\nMany in the open source community think the marketing language used upon launch is misleading. \u201cYou can\u2019t call something open source when it\u2019s not,\u201d said Lefteris. He was the first to \u201ccall bull\u201d on Uniswap on Twitter after v4 was announced. \u201cPlease use the proper terminology as this is insulting to projects actually building open source software,\u201d he wrote."

        "content": "Ethereum has plunged below $1,700 during the past day. Here\u2019s the on-chain indicator that may have signaled this dip in advance.\n\nEthereum Age Consumed Metric Saw A Spike Before The Price Decline\n\nAccording to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, institutional investors look to have been expecting the move to take place. The indicator of interest here is the \u201cETH age consumed,\u201d which first finds the total number of coins moving on the Ethereum blockchain. Then it multiplies this value by the days these coins had been dormant before their movement.\n\nSo, in this way, the metric keeps track of how many coins are being sold/moved each day and uses their age as a weighting factor. This means that many old coins are moved to the network whenever this indicator\u2019s value is high.\n\nNaturally, low values of the metric, on the other hand, would imply that there aren\u2019t many coins moving on the chain right now or some coins with a low average age are being transferred.\n\nNow, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Ethereum age consumed over the past month:\n\nLooks like the value of the metric has been quite high in recent days | Source: Santiment on Twitter\n\nAs displayed in the above graph, the Ethereum age consumed metric had recently registered a very large spike. This would suggest the potential movement of many dormant coins on the chain during this surge.\n\nGenerally, when such large spikes in the indicator are observed, it\u2019s a sign of selling from the long-term holders (LTHs). The LTH cohort includes all the investors holding onto their coins since more than 155 days ago.\n\nThese holders are the experienced hands in the market who don\u2019t easily sell even when the market is distressed. Because of this reason, their movements can be something to watch out for, as when they do finally sell, it\u2019s usually not a positive sign for the price.\n\nThe chart shows that the LTHs had also shown a large move earlier in the month. Shortly after these investors became active, the cryptocurrency price plunged.\n\nThis time, the spike in the Ethereum age consumed also seems to have preceded a price decline, as the cryptocurrency\u2019s value has now dropped below the $1,700 level.\n\nThis latest price plunge has come after the news that the US Federal Reserve isn\u2019t raising interest rates this time, but more hikes would be coming later in the year to fight inflation.\n\nSantiment suggests that the spike in the age consumed metric before the price decline could imply that the institutions already expected the move, hence why they shifted their coins early.\n\nETH Price\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $1,600, down 11% in the last week.\n\nETH has taken a plunge recently | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from iStock.com, charts from TradingView.com, Santiment.net\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Korean crypto contagion, Bank of China on Ethereum, HK's exchange red carpet: Asia Express - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Hong Kong lays out the red carpet for crypto exchanges\n\nWhile some jurisdictions (cough: America) have adopted a regulation-by-enforcement approach toward crypto, others are doing the opposite. According to a June 15 report from the Financial Times, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is pressuring major financial institutions to accept crypto clients. But it\u2019s not just regulators laying down a red carpet to boost the special administrative region\u2019s Web3 industry. For example, Johnny Ng Kit-Chong, a member of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong, wrote on June 10:\n\n\u201cThere have been a lot of news about international virtual asset exchanges in the past two days. I send forth an invitation to welcome global virtual asset exchanges, including @coinbase, to come to Hong Kong, apply for a compliant exchange, and negotiate a listing plan. I am willing to provide assistance!\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Joseph Chan Ho Lim, Hong Kong\u2019s under-secretary for financial services and the treasury, revealed in an interview that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has conducted public consultations on the launch of stablecoins and is in the process of establishing a regulatory framework by the end of the year. \u201cHong Kong will continue to support the development of the industry in the future and welcomes the industry and talents to come to the SAR,\u201d the politician said.\n\n\n\nThe Hong Kong Web3 Festival gallery hall (Twitter)\n\nOn June 1, Hong Kong Securities Regulatory Commission issued regulations stipulating the requirements for cryptocurrency exchanges to apply for a license to operate in Hong Kong. For regulated trading platforms, a license application must be submitted to the Securities Regulatory Commission within nine months, or before Feb. 29, 2024. If not, their business in Hong Kong must be terminated before May 31, 2024.\n\nBank of China mints debt notes on Ethereum\n\nOn June 12, BOCI, the investment banking subsidiary of Bank of China, revealed the tokenization of 200 million Chinese yuan ($28 million) in digitally structured notes on the Ethereum blockchain. The move is reportedly the first act of a Chinese financial institution tokenizing a security in Hong Kong. The notes are governed by both Hong Kong and Swiss law as per their origination by the Swiss investment bank UBS. Ying Wang, the deputy CEO at BOCI, commented:\n\n\u201cWorking together with UBS, we are driving the simplification of digital asset markets and products, for customers in Asia Pacific through the development of blockchain-based digital structured products. We are encouraged by the evolution of Hong Kong\u2019s digital economy and are committed to promoting the digital transformation.\u201d\n\nPreviously, UBS had issued a $50 million tokenized fixed-rate note in December 2022. Meanwhile, the government of Hong Kong issued an 800 million Hong Kong dollar ($100 million) tokenized green bond on Feb. 16, underwritten by four banks and priced with a yield of 4.05% per annum.\n\nDo Kwon: In and out of jail\n\nOn June 15, The High Court of Montenegro in Podgorica ordered Terraform Labs CEO Do Kwon and chief financial officer Han Chang Joon back to jail pending extradition proceedings to South Korea for charges relating to their role in the $40 billion collapse of the Terra Luna ecosystem.\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, Kwon and Joon were released on 400,000 euros bail each in their ongoing passport fraud case after a Montenegrin Basic Court dismissed an appeal by prosecutors.\n\nTheir brief period out on bail was not a happy time either. During their respite from prison, South Korean prosecutors announced they would apply to freeze Kwon and associates\u2019 $13 million held in Swiss bank accounts. A new hearing on charges of falsifying documents is scheduled for June 16 in the same Basic Court.\n\nDo Kwon faces a long stretch in jail in a number of countries.\n\nAccording to local sources, Kwon and Joon will be detained for a period of six months as the court decides on their extradition case. Kwon and Joon also face extradition to the U.S. on 11 charges relating to fraud, breach of trust, and embezzlement.\n\nAnd if that wasn\u2019t enough, there is yet another legal proceeding against Kwon. On June 16, Kwon will be questioned by the Special State Prosecutor\u2019s Office for a letter he sent from detention to government officials, disclosing his connections with the leader of the Europe Now Movement (PES), Milojko Spaji\u0107.\n\nAccording to the country\u2019s National Security Council, Kwon and Spaji\u0107 have been friends for five years, and last met in Belgrade in December 2022. Investigators claim there is evidence of financing the PES campaign from Kwon\u2019s laptop. If convicted, Kwon not only faces further jail time in Montenegro but could also serve up to 40 years in a South Korean prison, and even more jail time potentially awaits in the U.S.\n\nKorean blockchain firm\u2019s daisy chain contagion\n\nOn June 14, South Korean yield platform Haru Invest filed a criminal complaint against its consignment operator, B&S Holdings, alleging \u201cfraudulently provided management reports containing false information.\u201d\n\nHaru had paused deposits and withdrawals the day before, stating, \u201cWe have discovered through our internal inspection process that certain information provided by a consignment operator was suspected to be false.\u201d Previously, concerned investors took pictures of allegedly empty corporate offices and accused the firm of orchestrating a \u201crug pull,\u201d which Haru says is inaccurate.\n\n\n\nPhoto allegedly showing empty Haru Invest corporate offices after the announcement. (Telegram)\n\nThe move immediately affected South Korean Bitcoin lending firm Delio, which quickly announced the temporary suspension of customer withdrawals \u201cin order to safely protect the assets of customers currently in custody,\u201d citing issues at Haru Invest. Delio is one of the largest such entities in South Korea, holding an estimated $1 billion in Bitcoin, $200 million in Ether and $8.1 billion in other altcoins.\n\nA curious commentary regarding the matter came from Jun Du, the co-founder of cryptocurrency exchange Huobi Global, who wrote:\n\n\u201cWith the detonation of Delio, the thundering of [crypto] lending platforms is basically over.\u201d\n\nHowever, Du warned that contagion related to centralized trading platforms, which started with FTX, is just the beginning. \u201cNot only the newcomers are confused, but also the OGs in the industry. When will the thundering of the black box of centralized crypto entities end?\u201d the former blockchain executive asked, while also expressing his doubts on whether the industry will witness a \u201cslump\u201d or be \u201cushered into a new bull market\u201d after such issues are resolved.\n\nLast year, Huobi co-founders Jun Du and Leon Li reportedly sold 100% of their stake in the exchange to an entity controlled by Chinese blockchain personality and Tron founder Justin Sun. The latter claims that the exchange is now profitable after a period of reorganization, which by the way, included crushing an employee revolt."

        "content": "The legal battle between Ripple and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has taken a new twist as top lawyers accuse former SEC Director William Hinman of being paid to attack XRP in favor of Ethereum (ETH).\n\nFollowing the release of Hinman\u2019s emails and drafts of his June 2018 speech, pro-XRP attorney John Deaton expressed his frustration with the intent of the released documents on a recent live CryptoLaw podcast.\n\nPayments To Disparage XRP In Favor Of Ethereum?\n\nJeremy Hogan, lawyer and cryptocurrency expert, also weighed in on the matter alleging that former SEC Director of Corporate Finance, Bill Hinman, was paid to give a speech in which he declared that Ethereum was not a security.\n\nAccording to Hogan, Ripple, a leading cryptocurrency company, has suggested that Hinman was paid by the Ethereum Foundation or someone related to Ethereum to give the speech and give Ethereum a free pass.\n\nHogan\u2019s claims are based on email exchanges between Hinman and his colleagues, which reportedly show that Hinman had already named his first email \u201cthe Ether speech\u201d before he began crafting the speech.\n\nThis, according to Hogan, suggests that \u201cright from the get-go\u201d, Hinman is saying that ETH is not a security, and that was the point of him making the speech.\n\nHinman\u2019s speech, which was delivered in 2018, was seen by many in the cryptocurrency industry as a landmark moment in which the SEC effectively declared that Ethereum was not a security.\n\nThis was seen as a significant victory for Ethereum and the wider cryptocurrency industry, as it provided clarity on how the SEC would regulate cryptocurrencies.\n\nHowever, Hogan has suggested that the speech was not only a free pass for Ethereum but also an attack on XRP, which was at the time Ethereum\u2019s biggest competition. Hogan\u2019s claims are based on Ripple\u2019s ongoing legal battle with the SEC, in which Ripple has argued that XRP is not a security and should not be regulated as such.\n\nHogan\u2019s allegations are likely to fuel speculation about the relationship between the SEC and the cryptocurrency industry, and the extent to which the SEC\u2019s decisions are influenced by external factors. However, it is important to note that Hogan\u2019s claims are based on speculation and have not been proven.\n\nAt present, the value of XRP stands at $0.4731, indicating a marginal recovery of 0.6% over the past day. This comes after a dip to $0.4564 on Wednesday. Despite the recent drop, XRP enthusiasts remain optimistic and are looking forward to a positive outcome that could potentially boost the cryptocurrency\u2019s price to a new yearly high, surpassing the $0.5833 mark hit in May.\n\nThis could position XRP, the sixth largest cryptocurrency on the market, in a favorable position to reach the $1 milestone.\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "The Q1 2023 report from Messari highlights the continued dominance of Ethereum in terms of revenue generation among Layer 1 blockchains. However, the report reveals a notable standout: Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR), which demonstrated remarkable revenue growth fueled by its Consensus Service.\n\nEthereum Dominates Q1 Revenue\n\nDuring Q1, Ethereum proved its dominance once again, emerging as the clear leader in revenue generation among Layer 1 blockchains. Driven by its widespread adoption and high gas fees, Ethereum recorded an impressive revenue of $457 million. This figure was nearly 2.8 times higher than the combined revenue of all other featured Layer 1 chains.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum remained the leader in most key financial and ecosystem metrics including market cap, revenue, DeFi TVL and volume, NFT volume, and full-time developers. Ethereum scored a 22 in DeFi Diversity, followed by Polygon (19), Solana (18), and BNB Chain (16).\n\nHedera (HBAR) Growth In Q1\u201923\n\nWhile Ethereum dominated in terms of total revenue, the standout performer in Q1 was Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR). Hedera experienced an extraordinary revenue growth rate of 489% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ). This significant increase can be attributed to the adoption and utilization of Hedera\u2019s Consensus Service\n\nHedera Hashgraph\u2019s Consensus Service offers a unique approach to distributed consensus, enabling secure and scalable transactions. This service has gained traction among enterprises and developers seeking a robust and efficient blockchain solution.\n\nAcross featured networks, full-time developers (devs) decreased by 4% QoQ. Ethereum\u2019s full-time dev count of 1,976 is almost equal to all other featured networks combined.

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction in the Crypto Market Crash: ETH Crash to $1,400? - CryptoTicker.io - Bitcoin Price, Ethereum Price & Crypto News",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is undoubtedly a sea of volatility, and it\u2019s once again undergoing a massive tidal wave. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, has plummeted to a new low, crashing below $24,000. Ethereum, being the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has not been spared from this downward spiral, falling sharply to $1,600. The unrest in the crypto market further escalated as the SEC initiated lawsuits against two major crypto exchanges, Coinbase and Binance. Amid all these uncertainties, investors and crypto enthusiasts are left pondering over one question: What\u2019s next for Ethereum? Let\u2019s analyze in this Ethereum price prediction.\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nBefore diving into the future, let\u2019s take a brief look at what Ethereum is and how it works. Ethereum is a blockchain-based, open-source platform for decentralized applications. It uses its native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), as a means for powering these applications. Developers worldwide utilize Ethereum to write smart contracts, representing self-executing agreements coded onto the blockchain.\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, which is primarily a digital currency, Ethereum\u2019s broader scope allows for a wide array of applications, including DeFi (Decentralized Finance), NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), and much more. However, like Bitcoin, Ethereum is subject to the same market dynamics and sentiment shifts that have recently caused significant price declines.\n\nThe SEC Legal Action and Its Impacts\n\nThe crypto market took a major blow as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance, two of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges. These regulatory actions have further stirred uncertainty, leading to a more cautious approach by investors. The impact of these lawsuits has been far-reaching, instigating a significant sell-off and contributing to the fall in Ethereum\u2019s price.\n\nThis development highlights the growing need for clear regulatory frameworks around cryptocurrencies, which could potentially stabilize the market in the future. However, in the short term, such news tends to create panic among investors, thereby driving prices down.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis: ETH Dips by More Than 6%\n\nIn the last 24 hours, Ethereum lost more than 6% of its value, declining from $1,740 to $1,630. This price fall resonates with the bearish sentiment engulfing the broader crypto market. The price volatility has left investors scrambling to reassess their investment strategies and seeking a potential turnaround.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that despite the ongoing crash, Ethereum\u2019s fundamentals remain strong. Its utility in various decentralized applications and DeFi platforms continues to foster substantial demand for the asset.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: Possible Plunge to $1,400\n\nLooking at the current market dynamics, it\u2019s projected that Ethereum could continue to drop towards $1,600. If the bearish trend persists and market conditions continue to worsen, ETH could potentially decline towards the next support level around $1,400.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might also like\n\nMore from Altcoin"

        "title": "2 Cryptocurrencies to Buy for the Long Haul - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Given the historical volatility in the crypto market, it can be hard to find high-quality cryptos that make good long-term prospects. But there are two cryptos that need to be on your investing radar as we head into the second half of 2023: Bitcoin (BTC 0.13%) and Ethereum (ETH 0.34%).\n\nBoth of these cryptos boast huge market caps, long track records of success, and promising future growth prospects. Here's a closer look at both.\n\nBitcoin\n\nBitcoin is the world's largest crypto by market cap, and for good reason. Bitcoin is the original cryptocurrency, and over its lifetime has turned in absolutely astronomical returns for patient investors. During the decade from 2011 to 2021, Bitcoin was the best-performing asset in the world, and it wasn't even close. Bitcoin's annualized return stands at 230%, which is 10 times higher than the second-best-performing asset class, the Nasdaq 100 Index.\n\nHowever, as savvy investors know, past performance is no guarantee of future performance. The good news, though, is that Bitcoin is just getting started. Institutional investors are now embracing Bitcoin, nations such as El Salvador are experimenting with Bitcoin as an alternative to the U.S. dollar, and new use cases are springing up regularly. This year, for example, saw the launch of Bitcoin Ordinals, a new class of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) for the Bitcoin blockchain. At the same time, nations around the world are now updating their regulatory frameworks to make Bitcoin a legitimate digital asset.\n\nOn the basis of these promising developments, future price targets for Bitcoin are growing increasingly aggressive. While some of these price targets are set by crypto enthusiasts and promoters, others have the imprimatur of Wall Street. Goldman Sachs, for example, has put out a $100,000 price target for Bitcoin. And Cathie Wood of Ark Investment Management has suggested a $1.48 million price target for Bitcoin. Given Bitcoin's current price of $26,000, there is obviously incredible upside potential for long-term investors. Just remember, though, that Bitcoin can be incredibly volatile, so there will be pull-backs along the way.\n\nEthereum\n\nEthereum is the world's second-largest cryptocurrency and has been an early pioneer in everything from decentralized finance to NFTs. The Ethereum ecosystem is incredibly diversified and includes everything from decentralized exchanges for trading digital assets to Web3 gaming platforms and metaverse worlds. Arguably, Ethereum is the single most diversified crypto that you can own right now, and that can help to reduce some of your risk exposure.\n\nJust like Bitcoin, Ethereum has turned in some head-spinning returns for long-term investors. Since its launch in 2015, Ethereum is now up an incredible 50,000%. While Ethereum likely will not be able to replicate those types of returns, it is certainly building the base for its next stage of growth. In 2022, for example, Ethereum carried out The Merge, a dramatic transformation of its blockchain architecture to make it faster, leaner, and more efficient. By transitioning to a proof-of-stake blockchain from a proof-of-work blockchain, for example, Ethereum became 99.9% more energy-efficient.\n\nIn terms of utility and real-world applications, Ethereum is well ahead of most blockchain rivals. Fortune 500 companies are using Ethereum blockchain solutions to improve their supply chains, while top Wall Street banks are experimenting with using Ethereum as a way to optimize trading. On the basis of these emerging use cases across a broad spectrum of industries, New York-based investment firm VanEck recently put out a $50,000 price target for Ethereum (the crypto now trades for about $1,650). While that forecast is aggressive, it does hint at the future upside potential of Ethereum.\n\nRisk factors\n\nAlthough Bitcoin and Ethereum stand out as the two cryptocurrencies that long-term investors can add to their portfolios, they are hardly risk-free. Right now, there is tremendous regulatory uncertainty hanging over the crypto market, so it's definitely important to keep an eye on what's happening in Washington, D.C., if you plan to invest in these cryptos. In addition, volatility is always an issue for cryptos, where valuations can rise and fall much faster than in equity markets. So you need to be ready to accept some down years in addition to the up years.\n\nBut if you are willing to take on this additional risk, you could be rewarded with tremendous potential returns. For that reason, I'm bullish on both Bitcoin and Ethereum as long-term investments."

        "content": "Disclaimer: The information presented does not constitute financial, investment, trading, or other types of advice and is solely the writer\u2019s opinion.\n\nThe imbalance on the chart is likely to be partially filled before the next price move down.\n\nA break in structure with a move above $15.55 could hint at uncertain short-term conditions.\n\nIn a recent report, the lack of volatility behind Ethereum Classic was highlighted as a sign that a large move was imminent. At that time the direction was uncertain, but Bitcoin\u2019s failure to reclaim $27k sealed the fate of ETC bulls.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETC\u2019s market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nThe market structure and the trend were wholly on the side of the sellers. A reversal was unlikely, and another move down to a Fibonacci extension level was expected.\n\nThe sharp drop below $16.5 meant sentiment was extremely bearish\n\nThe market structure of Ethereum Classic became bearish in the latter half of April, when prices fell below the $20.23 mark. Since then, the asset has posted a series of lower highs and lower lows on the chart.\n\nThe second half of May saw ETC enter a phase of price contraction. This could have been taken as a phase of accumulation, if only the OBV was in an uptrend. It was the opposite, and the sentiment in the market was also in favor of the sellers.\n\nThe uncertainty in the crypto sphere and Bitcoin\u2019s plunge below $26k saw Ethereum Classic dive by 26.6% from $17.18 to $12.61 on 10 June. A set of Fibonacci retracement levels (pale yellow) was plotted based on this move. It showed the 50% and 61.8% levels in a region of imbalance (white) that the quick dump had left behind.\n\nSuch an imbalance was seen at the $17.5 mark and is highlighted in white. It was partially filled before the price continued to trend downward. Therefore, a similar scenario could unfold in the coming days and presents a shorting opportunity targeting the 23.6% extension level. This idea would be invalidated if ETC pushes upward past $15.5 and $16.2 as that would signal bullish intent (but could also be a liquidity hunt).\n\nThe Open Interest chart posted a weak bounce as the bulls clawed their way above $15\n\nOn 14 and 15 June, Ethereum Classic bulls embarked on the toilsome task of driving prices higher. The spot CVD reflected a severe lack of demand, and the bounce was not accompanied by significant buying pressure.\n\nHow much are 1, 10, or 100 ETC worth today?\n\nDuring this minor bounce the OI increased by close to $5 million but this value paled in comparison to the losses the OI has seen over the past week. The funding rate was positive but overall, the sentiment was bearish and buyers had little conviction."

Such statements were made by Frax Finance's Sam Kazemian yesterday, on June 15.\n\n\u26d3\ufe0fFRAXCHAIN\u26d3\ufe0f\n\n\n\nYesterday, we released a landmark episode where Sam revealed that Fraxchain would most likely be launched by the end of the year! \ud83d\udc40\n\n\n\nHeres a quick recap of what we learned\ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/iinwQT3AKH \u2014 FlywheelDeFi.eth (@FlywheelDeFi) June 15, 2023\n\nThe new blockchain that is currently dubbed FraxChain will be a fully EVM-compatible easy-to-code environment for all types of decentralized applications.

As a result, the new blockchain will be an outstanding solution of many issues dangerous for the modern L2 ecosystem:\n\nThis design has multiple beneficial factors that will set Fraxchain apart from other L2's and rollups: faster transaction finality, enhanced security through validity proofs, increased throughput, capital efficiency, decentralization capabilities.\n\nfrxETH will then be redistributed among veFXS holders.

This is the most anticipated upgrade for all EVM blockchains that can turn every wallet into a decentralized bank.\n\nThe announcement excited the global Web3 community: the price of Frax Share (FXS), a core asset of Frax Finance's ecosystem, spiked from $4.67 to $5.08.\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, since December 2022, BNB Chain hosts a native version of Frax Finance's USD-pegged stablecoin FRAX."

Ethereum (ETH) was steadily approaching $1800, with a previous record increase due to Shanghai\u2019s Blockchain upgrade.\n\nEthereum is trading at $1,674.76 after a gain of 2.68% in the past 24 hours. However, the ETH price has dropped 7.69% in the past seven days, and the current market cap has reached US$201 billion.\n\nInvestors pushed Ether (ETH) beyond the overhead resistance of $1,680 on June 16. However, the breakout didn\u2019t stay for long, and the price closed below $1,680.\n\nThe upsloping 20-day Exponential Moving Average and the positive RSI imply that Ether bulls are in check. Investors might try to cross the overhead barrier at $1,680 and push the price to $2,000. As a result, the $1,800 level may cause some resistance, but the prices may be crossed.\n\nMany Crypto Analysts thought that Shanghai\u2019s Blockchain upgrade would cause a price fall, but this was not the case. The upgrade caused Ethereum (ETH) to have steady increases. The upgrade allowed Ethereum (ETH) to shift from a proof of stake protocol to a proof of work protocol.\n\nUndoubtedly, much of the crypto market is bullish on Ethereum price prediction. The coin is an essential part of the industry, and with it, many of the top applications and services that have risen to popularity in the last few years would be here today.\n\nOf course, only some feel the same, and there are plenty of reasons some investors will not touch ETH. The shift allowed staked Ethereum (ETH) to be withdrawn from the blockchain. You don\u2019t necessarily have to agree with them, but you must hear them out. You should be fully aware of ETH\u2019s pitfalls and benefits. Because when some ask, \u2018Will ETH continue falling?\u2019 No one knows the answer.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nIn a June 9, 2023 post on his website, Ethereum co-founder, Vitalik Buterin outlined the three major technical transitions that the Ethereum protocol must undergo to offer an open, global, and permissionless experience to the average user.\n\nAccording to Buterin, the three simultaneous transitions for Ethereum are; the Layer 2 (L2) scaling transition, the wallet security transition, and the privacy transition. Buterin says that intense coordination requiring deep changes from applications and wallets is required to achieve these transitions.\n\nButerin points out that smart contract wallets make the keeping of one address more difficult since some L2 blockchains are not compatible with Ethereum Virtual Machines (EVM), yet privacy may require each user to have even more addresses. The EVM is software that executes smart contracts and updates Ethereum Network after a new block is added to the chain.\n\nButerin says that since many users\u2019 funds are stored in the same smart contract and hence at the same address, apps that rely on the assumption that address ownership is immutable will have to find alternative ways to achieve this goal.\n\nFor key recovery, Buterin proposes that instead of running the recovery procedure on each address separately, the wallet can include software to execute the recovery procedure across all of a user\u2019s addresses at the same time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, considerations still need to be made on gas cost implications and privacy concerns over publicly linking all addresses by recovering them at the same time and hence proposes the use of an architecture that separates verification logic and asset holdings.\n\nButerin says that overcoming the above challenges requires lots of secondary infrastructure to be updated and wallets interacting with spending and encryption keys will have to be improved.\n\nButerin gives an example of the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) that makes it a lot easier for regular users to minimize the possibility of using a wrong wallet address mistake considerably but is expensive. To enhance its use, Buterin says that ENS subdomains are now automatically verifiable on L2 blockchains.\n\nButerin says that although wallets are essential for securing assets, they also hold user data. Holding a single encryption key could resolve the protection of user data, however losing your encryption key, still results in loss of assets.\n\nHowever, to avoid users having multiple recovery paths, Buterin proposes that wallets will likely need to manage both the recovery of assets and encryption keys.\n\nButerin further proposes that any chosen design should maintain decentralization while at the same time offering easy access to users\u2019 assets using open and not proprietary solutions.\n\nButerin says that achieving the three technical transitions is crucial and Ethereum must rise to the challenge for improved user experience and to attain a sustainable future."

        "content": "The Federal Reserve\u2019s decision caused a significant decline in Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] prices.\n\nRetail investors showed interest while whales and network growth declined, leaving ETH\u2019s recovery uncertain.\n\nOn 14 June, the Federal Reserve opted not to proceed with an 11th consecutive interest rate hike. This was done as it assessed the consequences of the previous ten increases. The decision was made by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) during their two-day meeting.\n\nHowever, the committee projected that two additional quarter percentage point rate increases will likely take place before the year concludes.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nFOMC causes FUD\n\nThe FOMC\u2019s choice to halt interest rate hikes had an immediate effect on the price of Ethereum. CoinMarketCap\u2018s data revealed a 6.49% drop in ETH\u2019s value within the past 24 hours.\n\nThe decisions made by the FOMC often carry significant weight in the market due to multiple factors. When the FOMC hints at potential interest rate increases, it alters investor sentiment.\n\nHigher interest rates make traditional investments more appealing, diminishing demand for cryptocurrencies. Additionally, market sentiment and risk perception come into play. If the FOMC expresses caution or concerns about economic stability, investors tend to become more risk-averse, resulting in a sell-off in cryptocurrencies.\n\nFurthermore, regulatory concerns and potential policy measures discussed during FOMC announcements can adversely impact the crypto markets.\n\nThe panic among investors was evident through the behavior of the whales. Data from Glassnode highlighted a considerable reduction in the number of addresses holding more than 10,000 ETH in recent months.\n\nHowever, retail investors continued to exhibit interest in ETH, perceiving the price decline as an opportunity to purchase the coin at a discounted rate. While retail investors\u2019 interest may offer temporary support to ETH\u2019s price, it leaves them vulnerable to whale behavior in the long term, considering that the majority of ETH was still held by ETH holders.\n\n? #Ethereum $ETH Number of Addresses Holding 0.01+ Coins just reached an ATH of 24,343,133 Previous ATH of 24,343,031 was observed on 11 June 2023 View metric:https://t.co/XXb0u19ouH pic.twitter.com/u7rzmRqXcz \u2014 glassnode alerts (@glassnodealerts) June 15, 2023\n\nSome traders remain hopeful\n\nRecent data also suggested a decline in Ethereum\u2019s network growth alongside its price. This indicated a waning interest from new addresses. Moreover, the velocity of Ethereum also decreased. This was an indication of the substantial reduction in the number of ETH transactions occurring on the network.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nDespite these factors, data from Coinglass revealed an increase in the number of long positions taken against ETH in the past few days. This suggested that investors remained hopeful and optimistic about Ethereum\u2019s future prospects."

        "content": "The brutal bear market in crypto over the past few months has taken a serious toll on ETH\u2019s price and profitability. The price of Ethereum has been stuck in a sideways range recently, and many ETH holders have been unlucky for it. According to data from Glassnode, the percentage of Ethereum addresses in profit has now dropped to a 5-month low.\n\nPercentage Of Addresses In The Green Drops To 55.414%\n\nBack in 2021, when the price of ETH was at its highest, the majority of addresses held a comfortable position. Now, two years later, for new investors who bought at higher prices, the wait for their positions to go green again has been a long one.\n\nGlassnode, a crypto analytics platform, reports that the percentage of Ethereum addresses in green while measuring over a 7-day moving average is now at a 5-month low of 55.414%.\n\nPercentage of addresses in profit drop to five-month low | Source: Glassnode on Twitter\n\nThis indicates that more than 44 percent of the people who own ETH are currently at a loss. In the same vein, the number of profitable addresses has dropped to its lowest point since March of this year, standing at 56,311,171.899 at the moment.\n\nMoving ETH Off Exchanges\n\nThe amount of ETH held on cryptocurrency exchanges has also dropped to its lowest level in over 5 years. This means less ETH is available for trading on exchanges, which can impact the price and liquidity. Traders are withdrawing their ETH from exchanges and holding it in private digital wallets.\n\nThe drop can also be linked to an all-time high level of staking in the ETH 2.0 deposit contract. Data shows that the majority of ETH held by large investors are now moving ETH into the contract, showing that interest in ETH staking is growing. This declining supply, coupled with increasing mainstream interest in ETH, could drive the price higher if demand remains strong.\n\nEthereum Plunges Below $1,700\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum broke below critical price support earlier this week. The price plunged below $1,700 to $1,630 yesterday, marking its lowest value since March 16. The plunge in price and profitability is largely attributed to negative sentiment around rising inflation fears and the overall weakness in the crypto market recently.\n\nETH has since then recovered and is now trading at $1,720, looking to retest the $1,800 resistance once more. Of course, if $1,700 fails to hold, Ethereum could fall further to test support at $1,400 or even $1,300. A drop below $1,700 again would be very bearish and see the profitability percentage drop further.\n\nEthereum price recovers above $1,700 | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nFeatured image from The Cryptoknowmist, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "The recent expansion of Novatti Group Limited\u2019s Australian dollar-backed stablecoin, AUDD to the XRP Ledger, has sparked a discussion on the survival of various cryptocurrencies in the face of the SEC\u2019s undeclared war. In this comparative article, we will delve into the similarities and differences between AUDD, Dogetti, and other notable cryptos like Ethereum, and analyze their ability to withstand the heat of the moment.\n\nNovatti Group Limited: A Fintech Powerhouse\n\nNovatti Group Limited is a leading Australian payments fintech company that has made significant strides in the crypto space. With the expansion of its AUDD stablecoin to the XRP Ledger, Novatti aims to provide users with a secure and stable digital asset that can be seamlessly utilized in various transactions.\n\nThe AUDD stablecoin offers a unique value proposition by being backed by the Australian dollar. This feature provides stability and mitigates the volatility often associated with cryptocurrencies. Moreover, Novatti\u2019s established reputation in the fintech industry adds credibility to AUDD and enhances its potential as a reliable digital currency.\n\nDogetti: The Rising Star\n\nIn the midst of the crypto market\u2019s dynamic landscape, Dogetti emerges as a meme coin with a vision of fostering a strong and united community of holders. Inspired by mafia-themed books and films, Dogetti brands its community as \u201cThe Family,\u201d aiming to create a sense of uniqueness, togetherness, and a shared purpose among its members.\n\nThe primary goal of the Dogetti project is to uplift the net worth of every member of \u201cThe Family.\u201d Through a 2% reflection protocol, Dogetti ensures that holders are rewarded on a regular basis.

While the specifics are not provided, the project promises to integrate multiple forms of utility, adding further value to the meme coin.\n\nSurviving the SEC\u2019s Undeclared War\n\nIn the backdrop of the SEC\u2019s undeclared war on cryptocurrencies, it is crucial to assess how these digital assets, including Novatti\u2019s AUDD, Dogetti, and other prominent cryptos like Dogecoin and Ethereum, will navigate the challenges ahead.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s regulatory scrutiny has raised concerns about the legal status and compliance of cryptocurrencies. However, it is important to note that the landscape of crypto regulations is still evolving, and no definitive actions have been taken against any specific crypto projects, including Dogetti.\n\nWhile uncertainties loom, the distinct characteristics of Dogetti, such as its loyal and engaged community, may serve as an advantage. The strength and unity of \u201cThe Family\u201d fostered by Dogetti\u2019s branding strategy contribute to a resilient support system that can weather the storms of regulatory scrutiny.\n\nIn contrast, larger and more established cryptocurrencies like Ethereum may face heightened regulatory scrutiny due to their widespread adoption and market influence. This scrutiny could potentially impact their value and utility. However, the survival and success of these cryptocurrencies will depend on their ability to adapt to evolving regulations and demonstrate their compliance with legal frameworks.\n\nNovatti Group Limited\u2019s AUDD and Dogetti represent two distinct approaches to the crypto market. While Novatti leverages its expertise in the fintech industry to introduce a stablecoin backed by the Australian dollar, Dogetti positions itself as a meme coin with a strong and united community.\n\nAmidst the SEC\u2019s undeclared war on cryptocurrencies, Dogetti\u2019s branding as \u201cThe Family\u201d and its unique rewards system provide it with a competitive edge. The ability to withstand regulatory challenges will play a crucial role in the survival and success of cryptocurrencies like Dogetti, Dogecoin, and Ethereum.\n\nInvestors and enthusiasts looking for the next big crypto investment or meme coin with utility can find valuable opportunities in projects like Dogetti. By joining \u201cThe Family\u201d and participating in a thriving community, individuals can potentially increase their net worth and be part of something unique and special.\n\nTo explore Dogetti further and join \u201cThe Family,\u201d visit their website for more information.

        "content": "In the ever-evolving crypto market, Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Collateral Network (COLT) are making waves. As the COLT presale garners attention, Ethereum (ETH) holders are snatching up billions of Collateral Network tokens. Let\u2019s delve into these developments and their implications.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nShiba Inu: The Meme Token with a Bite\n\nThe recent news regarding the memecoin Shiba Inu see a massive transaction of SHIB tokens to Binance. This shift has the potential to increase the Shiba Inu\u2019s popularity in the crypto market.\n\nShiba Inu, often dubbed the \u201cDogecoin killer,\u201d has been on a roller coaster ride. The token, which started as a joke, has now become a serious player in the crypto market. Its decentralized spontaneous community building and its ShibaSwap platform have attracted many investors.\n\nRecent developments have seen a Shiba Inu whale unstake 4 trillion SHIB tokens and move them to Binance. This sizable transaction has increased the circulating supply of Shiba Inu by 1%, bringing the total supply to a staggering 578.9 trillion tokens. On the flip side, the number of staked Shiba Inu tokens has dwindled, indicating a shift in investor strategy.\n\nEthereum: The Backbone of DeFi and NFTs:\n\nEthereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, continues to play a pivotal role in the crypto market. As the backbone of the decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFT sectors, Ethereum\u2019s influence extends far beyond its price.\n\nEthereum\u2019s blockchain technology, powered by smart contracts, enables the creation of decentralized applications (dApps) and the issuance of a variety of digital assets, including the likes of Shiba Inu and Collateral Network. Its robust platform has made it the go-to choice for developers and investors alike.\n\nHowever, as Ethereum is the second-largest crypto by market cap, it has a limited upside. This is why many Ethereum whales are looking for promising ERC-20 tokens. Recently, a number of them shifted their attention to Collateral Network and its explosive presale.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nCollateral Network: The Future of Lending:\n\nCollateral Network, an Ethereum web3 peer-to-peer lending platform, will disrupt the lending industry by offering decentralized lending protocols for real-world assets.The platform allows users to borrow cryptocurrencies against physical assets, addressing the difficulties in obtaining loans for non-traditional assets and the outdated pawnbroking industry.\n\nFor lenders, the platform offers fixed passive income, tangible NFT-backed assets, and security in case of loan default. Borrowers, on the other hand, can enjoy fast turnaround, privacy, transparency, competitive rates, and borderless borrowing.\n\nAdditionally, owners of the $COLT token will have access to our exclusive online auctions for distressed assets. This will give investors the chance to buy properties below market value when a borrower defaults on a loan. Some of these auctions will also be held in the metaverse, as well.\n\nAnalysts predict a 3,500% (35x) price increase during the COLT presale, with the price potentially reaching $0.35. The token is expected to surge by 100x when it lists on major exchanges. With the team tokens locked for 2 years and the liquidity pool locked for 33 years, the Collateral Network offers a promising investment opportunity.\n\nFind out more about the Collateral Network presale here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.collateralnetwork.io/\n\nPresale: https://presale.collateralnetwork.io/register\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/collateralnwk\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Collateralnwk\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Crypto Crackdowns\n\n\n\nRegulatory compliance\n\nInvestor protection\n\nImpact on investment returns\n\nFuture of cryptocurrency\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor decades, investment opportunities were primarily limited to traditional assets like real estate, commodities, bank deposits and stocks.However, the dawn of digital era has paved the way for a fresh wave of investments options, with cryptocurrencies being the most prominent digital asset. Despite initial hesitations and uncertainties surrounding unregulated assets, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum have garnered notable momentum and exhibited increasing competitiveness in daily returns, particularly in the Indian market.Furthermore, the Government of India in a recent G20 summit has published a comprehensive report that sheds light on the willingness of numerous countries to adopt and legitimize cryptocurrencies, ultimately augmenting their accessibility. Within this context, India has firmly established itself as the seventh-largest nation, poised to embrace cryptocurrencies in the coming years and beyond.Undoubtedly, as the adoption of cryptocurrencies continues to surge, India has solidified its position as a global frontrunner in embracing and integrating the digital currencies into its financial landscape.With the ever-increasing traction in India, a diverse array of businesses, young individuals, and first-time investors have developed a fervent interest in venturing into this digital landscape.According to data released by KuCoin, a global cryptocurrency exchange, despite the government's initial skepticism towards cryptocurrencies, India is estimated to have an astounding 115 million investors, all propelled by a collective aspiration for long-term gains.This comprehensive report not only illuminates the burgeoning prevalence of cryptocurrency adoption but also emphasizes that a significant 56% of investors believe cryptocurrencies will fundamentally shape the future of the financial ecosystem.So, before diving into the future of cryptocurrencies, it is better to understand what it means for investors and its avenues for desired results.While digital assets offer numerous advantages, they also raise specific concerns, including the risk of fraud, market manipulation, money laundering, security vulnerabilities, and the potential misuse of cryptocurrencies for illicit purposes.Thus, in order to address fraudulent and unlawful activities, cryptocurrency crackdown that involves the implementation of regulations, increased oversight, and the imposition of penalties in the segment, appeared as a rigorous approach. This regulation aims to bolster investor protection and uphold the market's integrity.In addition, recently, the Securities and Exchange Commission 's (SEC's) crypto crackdown has significant implications for investors and the future currencies. The SEC regulates securities offerings and protects investors in the United States.While cryptocurrencies are not classified as traditional securities, the SEC has taken steps to assert its authority and regulate certain aspects of the crypto market. It is, thus, safe to say that with this uncertainty, there is a possibility for market fluctuation in India too. So, let's delve into the potential aspect and what investors need to consider before investing in cryptocurrency.A cryptocurrency crackdown typically entails the introduction of more strict regulations and compliance requirements. In this context, investors may be required to adhere to Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures, furnish additional documentation, and fulfill reporting obligations. As a result, this may heighten administrative burdens and lead to more stringent compliance requirements for crypto projects, potentially impacting their operations and raising barriers to entry for new projects.The protection of investors emerges as a primary goal of regulatory crackdowns, aiming to safeguard them against the inherent risks posed by fraud, scams, and illicit activities in the cryptocurrency market. Through the implementation of stricter regulations, a multitude of enhanced measures can be introduced to reinforce investor protection.These measures encompass a comprehensive range of disclosure requirements, thereby promoting increased transparency and instilling heightened confidence among investors. Furthermore, strengthened safeguards are established to counteract fraudulent practices, effectively establishing a fortified investment environment that fosters trust and security for individuals venturing into the dynamic realm of cryptocurrencies.The impact on investment returns resulting from a cryptocurrency crackdown may introduce uncertainty in the immediate aftermath.Regulatory interventions and the prevailing market sentiment have the potential to trigger short-term price fluctuations, possibly leading to market corrections. Nevertheless, when viewed holistically, a diligently regulated and unwavering market can offer investors a more promising investment landscape over the long haul. This steadfastness and regulatory oversight evoke heightened confidence and establish the foundation for a sustainable and thriving market, ultimately presenting investors with amplified.On the other hand, regulatory actions may also create short-term volatility and uncertainty in the market. This, in turn, could impact the overall growth and future adoption of cryptocurrencies.Thus, investors need to stay informed about the regulatory landscape, comply with the applicable regulations, and conduct thorough due diligence before making investment decisions in the cryptocurrency market. Moreover, seeking professional advice from financial and legal experts can help navigate the evolving regulatory environment and assess the potential impact on investment strategies.The outlook for cryptocurrency in India for investors during a crackdown is uncertain and contingent upon multiple elements. SEC's crackdowns may introduce initial obstacles, their primary objective is establishing a secure industry foundation. Investors may encounter short-term market volatility and heightened compliance obligations, affecting prices and the confidentiality of transactions.Nevertheless, crackdowns safeguard investors against fraud and illicit activities, bolstering confidence and attracting institutional investors to facilitate long-term market expansion. According to Statista, the cryptocurrency market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 9.83% to reach $324 million by 2027.In addition, the formulation of clear guidelines can stimulate innovation and responsible conduct, culminating in a sustainable investment environment. Despite direct uncertainties, the crackdown is anticipated to yield a regulated and mature cryptocurrency market, presenting growth prospects for compliant investors. Thus, in order to get long-term growth, investors need to focus on a trusted advisor before investing in cryptocurrency.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

Furthermore, the total value locked in Solana surged by 23.5% quarter-over-quarter.\n\nSolana vs Ethereum: The Battle of Meme Coin Across Networks\n\nHowever, Ethereum-based meme coins such as Pepecoin, Dejitaru Tsuka, and MillionaireGame Coin (MG) remain strong contenders. These coins continue to attract attention from the market, posing a challenge to Solana and its native meme coins, Bonk.\n\nIntroducing popular meme coins on the two networks:\n\nBonk (BONK) Pepe (PEPE) MillionaireGame Coin (MG) Dejitaru Tsuka (TSUKA)\n\nBONK: What Happened to Solana\u2019s Meme Coin?\n\nBonk (BONK), once the representative meme coin on Solana, has been struggling to maintain its price growth trend since the end of 2022. Despite the challenges, it continues to hold a significant position in the market.\n\nPEPE: The Heir to the Meme Coin Season of 2023\n\nPepe (PEPE), an Ethereum-based meme coin, has seen its price remain stagnant since late April. Even though dedicated investors maintain a positive outlook, early-stage investments in coins such as MillionaireGame Coin (MG) may provide greater potential returns.\n\nMillionaireGame Coin (MG): The Millionaire-Maker Meme Coin of 2023\n\nMillionaireGame Coin (MG), an Ethereum-based meme coin, offers a unique proposition: Create a millionaire every month, powered by the community. Every month, the Millionaire Game selects a token holder every month to \u201cmint\u201d a new millionaire, offering an opportunity for small investments to yield massive returns.\n\nThis innovative game, backed by carefully designed tokenomics, can run for over 50 years, offering a transparent and fair play powered by smart contracts. Still in its early stages, MG\u2019s pre-sale fundraising progress is astonishing, approaching the next stage and welcoming a surge in prices.\n\nTSUKA: The Mysterious Power of the Dragon\n\nDejitaru Tsuka (TSUKA), another Ethereum-based meme coin, experienced several price spikes and falls since late June. Despite future growth potential, investing in early-stage coins like MillionaireGame Coin (MG) might offer higher returns.\n\nIn the face-off between Solana and Ethereum, both networks offer a rich selection of meme coins for investors to explore.

        "title": "Top Ethereum ERC20 Tokens Guide & List - finder.com.au",
        "content": "A token is a type of cryptocurrency that can be created by anyone, without the need for much technical know-how or skill.\n\nThis is one of the reasons there are so many cryptocurrencies on the market - tokens have enabled almost any brand, company or idea to make their own in a matter of minutes.\n\nERC20 is a technical standard for tokens issued on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nIn this guide we explain how they work, list some popular ones and show you where to store them.\n\nDisclaimer: This information should not be interpreted as an endorsement of cryptocurrency or any specific provider, service or offering. It is not a recommendation to trade.\n\nWhat are ERC20 tokens?\n\nSince its launch in 2015, Ethereum has become one of the driving forces behind the growth of cryptocurrency. Initial coin offerings (ICOs) have raised billions of dollars in funding for crypto projects from all around the world, and most of these ICOs are based on the Ethereum platform. Buyers contribute Ether (ETH) or bitcoin (BTC) to participate in a crowdfunding sale, and in return receive some of the ICO project\u2019s native tokens.\n\nERC20 is a technical standard for tokens issued on the Ethereum blockchain, providing a list of rules that all Ethereum-based tokens must follow. These include how the tokens can be transferred, how transactions are approved, how users can access data about a token and the total supply of tokens. The protocol is necessary to ensure compatibility between the many different tokens issued on Ethereum.\n\nJust like bitcoin, Litecoin and any other cryptocurrency, ERC20 tokens are blockchain-based assets that have value and can be sent and received. The difference is that instead of running on their own blockchain, these tokens are issued on the Ethereum network. This means they\u2019re hosted by Ethereum addresses and are sent using Ethereum transactions.\n\nERC20 tokens are \"smart assets\" that can be programmed to do certain things by using smart contracts. For instance, tokens can be programmed to be paid out to employees by the hour or minute instead of at the end of the work week. This sort of programmability allows for new sorts of financial applications and innovations and is part of what makes Ethereum special.\n\nHackday project In 2018 as part of a hackathon I created a cryptocurrency in about 20 minutes by using the ERC20 token standard. It cost me about AUD $30 of ETH at the time. The goal was to use the tokens as reward points that would automatically be paid out to anyone who used green financial products. Doing so helped me bring my prototype to life by having a working cryptocurrency that I was able to send to judges and other participants. \u2014 James Edwards, Cryptocurrency Expert\n\n\n\nPopular ERC20 tokens list\n\nMany crypto newcomers are surprised to discover just how prevalent ERC20 tokens are. Take a look at a list of the top 100 digital currencies by market cap, and you'll see plenty of well-known currencies that use the ERC20 standard, including:\n\nImportant: Some coins are launched as an ERC20 token, before being migrated over to their own blockchain. This means that the token will have to be swapped for a coin on the new blockchain once the migration is complete. If this happens, you will need to migrate your tokens over to the new chain, and will no longer be able to send the tokens to an Ethereum-based wallet. If you send coins from one blockchain to a wallet on another blockchain, you will lose your coins. Make sure you know which blockchain your coins or tokens are hosted on before sending them to a new wallet or address, especially as some tokens may exist across multiple chains.\n\nFind out more about altcoins in our top 100+ list.\n\nDid you know? Want to know why they're called ERC20 tokens? The \"ERC\" stands for \"Ethereum Request for Comments\", which is an official protocol used to propose improvements to the Ethereum network. The \"20\" is the unique ID number used to identify the proposal.\n\nWhich wallets support ERC20 tokens?\n\nIf you\u2019re buying any digital currency that\u2019s issued as an ERC20 token, you\u2019ll need to find a wallet that\u2019s compatible with these types of tokens. Happily, because ERC20 tokens are so popular, there are plenty of wallets to choose from, including the following:\n\nTo find out ways to securely store your ERC20 tokens, you can begin by comparing the above wallets.

        "title": "XRP Army Finds Clues Why Hinman Gave Ethereum Free Pass - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "The XRP community has been digging through the recently released 400+ pages of Hinman documents in the legal battle between Ripple Labs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), examining why the former director of the SEC\u2019s Division of Corporation Finance, Bill Hinamn, gave Ethereum (ETH) a free pass as a non-security.\n\nAs NewsBTC reported, Hinman spoke on the phone with Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin ahead of his speech to ascertain how Ethereum operates. In addition, Hinman defied the recommendation of the SEC\u2019s Office of General Counsel (OGC), which opposed including ETH in the notorious speech.\n\nNew Revelations By The XRP Army\n\nXRP community member Ashley Prosper has read the Hinman documents in full and found some interesting stuff regarding Ethereum and Bill Hinman. To recall, Hinman returned to the law firm Simpson Thacher, which is also part of the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance, in 2020.\n\nAccording to Prosper, the documents reveal how Hinman was pushed hard by Simpson Thatcher and ConsenSys to give the Ethereum Free Pass speech. Hinman intentionally refrained from sending the speech to any of the commissioners except Jay Clayton because it would, in his words, \u201cslow down the process significantly.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Hinman stated that he researched Ethereum in depth before giving his speech. Still, he could not answer how much Ether (ETH) Joe Lubin, Vitalik Buterin or the Ethereum Foundation owned, or who was funding the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nThe XRP Community member also speculates that the SEC is so concerned about the revelation of Joseph Lubin\u2019s name that it has blacked out any mention of the name \u201cJoe\u201d in Hinman\u2019s interview. Even when it was about Joseph Grundfest. Prosper further states:\n\nJorge Tenreiro [SEC attorney] is fighting tooth and nail in Hinman\u2019s deposition to prevent any answers related to ETH, Ethereum, Consensys, or Lubin. Just look at how he approaches the ETH questions compared to the Bitcoin ones.\n\n#XRP #XRPCommunity\n\nThe SEC is so worried about revealing Joseph Lubins\u2019 name that they redacted every reference to the name Joe in Hinmans deposition. Even when it belonged to Joesph Grundfest, whom they already identified by name. The fear is real\u2026 what does @ethereumJoseph\u2026 pic.twitter.com/j9vUnuHIOy \u2014 Ashley PROSPER (@AshleyPROSPER1) June 15, 2023\n\nYet Prosper found a passage in the documents that reveals Hinman had four to five meetings with ConsenSys, as well as face-to-face conversations with people associated with the company.\n\nRenowned XRP community member Mr Huber speculates, based on Prosper\u2019s findings, that the reason for the urgency of the speech was to exempt Ethereum from the ethics provision coming into effect the next week, which would have required all government employees to disclose their ETH holdings.\n\n\u201cHinman\u2019s speech not only prevented that from happening, it also ensured that many politicians joined Ethereum afterwards, which is why people are still trying to cover it up,\u201d Mr Huber says.\n\nRenowned XRP lawyer Jeremy Hogan has a similar suspicion. He claims Hinman was paid to \u201cgive ETH a free pass\u201d. In an interview on CryptoLaw, Hogan speculated that an Ethereum member bribed Hinman to give ETH a free pass during the speech:\n\nMy speculation is that Ripple\u2019s position here is that Bill Hinman was somehow paid, and he was paid by the Ethereum Foundation or someone related to Ethereum to give the speech, give Ethereum a free pass.\n\nHowever, Hogan also clarified that Ripple does not want to make accusations against others like the Ethereum Foundation, presumably because there is not enough evidence.\n\nAt press time, XRP changed hands for $0.4735, down 6.3% in the last 24 hours.\n\nFeatured image from VOI, chart from TradingView.com"

        "content": "Crypto analyst, Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, shared valuable observations regarding potential levels of reversal for Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), and Litecoin (LTC).\n\nVan de Poppe indicates that BNB\u2019s inability to sustain support around the $270 level indicates a possible trajectory toward $200.\n\nIn a YouTube video, cryptocurrency analyst, Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, shared valuable observations regarding potential levels of reversal for Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), and Litecoin (LTC) during the ongoing correction in altcoins. Van de Poppe\u2019s analysis emphasizes crucial price levels that have the potential to initiate trend reversals for these prominent digital currencies.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nThe renowned analyst, with a subscriber base of 163,000, expressed concern about Ethereum\u2019s potential for additional downward movement unless it manages to regain stability around the $1,785 support level. According to Michael,\n\nThis entire area of $1,785 is something we need to sustain. Otherwise, we are going to look at a case that I think we are going to retest the area around $1,600 and have the reversal taking place.\n\nAs of the time of writing, Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $1,636.51. If the market moves towards the reversal range identified by Van de Poppe, it implies a potential decline of more than 8% for this prominent altcoin.\n\nBinance Coin (BNB)\n\nAnalyzing Binance Coin (BNB), which serves as the utility token for the largest cryptocurrency exchange globally, Van de Poppe indicates that the altcoin\u2019s inability to sustain support around the $270 level indicates a possible trajectory toward $200, where a potential reversal could occur.\n\nVan de Poppe added that placing bids in the $200 range could become significant if the market continues to demonstrate weakness. As of press time, the coin is currently trading at $237.59.\n\nLitecoin (LTC)\n\nRegarding Litecoin (LTC), Van de Poppe indicates that the correction phase for this decentralized payment network might be approaching its conclusion. He identifies $70 to $73 as the potential zone for a trend reversal in LTC. A rapid upward surge can be expected if Litecoin successfully secures support within this range. Presently, LTC is trading at $72.65.\n\nNevertheless, the reversal levels identified can play a vital role in signaling possible market trends for Ethereum, Binance Coin, and Litecoin in the upcoming days. Traders will closely monitor whether these cryptocurrencies succeed in reclaiming their support levels or if they persist in the ongoing downward correction.\n\nIn a video analysis he uploaded on the 5th of this month, Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe said that Litecoin\u2019s narrative surrounding the halving event could drive the peer-to-peer payments network to a price level previously observed in December 2021.\n\nHe further stated,\n\nLitecoin is doing absolutely great, too. It is on the edge of having a breakout\u2026 I think the halving will take place in (August), which means that we still have six to eight weeks before it takes place. I think having a strong rally is likely if it breaks through $100.\n\nVan de Poppe further said that Ethereum, the prominent smart contract platform, is in a similar situation. According to the crypto strategist, as long as ETH maintains a trading price above $1,800, it can surpass its immediate resistance level.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

        "content": "EigenLayer, a Seattle-based Decentralized Finance (DeFi) platform, announced the deployment of its staking protocol on the Ethereum mainnet. Ethereum released its Shapella Upgrade on April 12, 2023, allowing un-staking of Ether. The investors who staked 32 ETH to become validators could not withdraw their money, and the upgrade allowed them to gain rewards from this staking mechanism.\n\nWe are thrilled to announce the deployment of the Stage-1 EigenLayer protocol on Ethereum Mainnet!\n\n\n\nThis marks a significant milestone in our mission to create a permissionless environment for innovation.https://t.co/QZ529WsIAS pic.twitter.com/SYHexSRTA0 \u2014 EigenLayer (@eigenlayer) June 14, 2023\n\nRe-staking Protocol Rolled out on Ethereum Mainnet\n\nEigenLayer would allow ETH stakers to deposit select liquid staking tokens, including Rocket Pool ETH (rETH), Lido stETH (stETH), and Coinbase Wrapped Staked ETH (cbETH). In March 2023, EigenLabs, the developers behind EigenLayer, raised $64.5 million at the valuation of $500 million in a series of investment rounds, adding another $50 Million in a Series A funding round.\n\nThe parameters set by the DeFi protocol for liquid and native staking are set along with liquid re-staking acceptance of a maximum of 3,200 for each liquid re-staking token and a maximum limit of 32 tokens per deposit address. Native re-staking is scheduled to be paused with the limitation of 9,600 ETH reached on the protocol.\n\nThe concept of liquid staking has been gaining serious ground since the blockchain shifted from energy-intensive Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism through a merge that occurred in September 2022. Data suggests that a total of $16.92 Billion ETH are currently staked on the top five liquid staking protocols.\n\nThe Upgrade Which Allowed Un-Staking\n\nThe Ethereum Shapella Upgrade was operationalized on April 12, 2023. The soft-fork event on the blockchain allowed the un-staking of nearly 4.4 Million ETH staked after the merge. Before the upgrade, analysts argued that this step would be devastating as it would result in a withdrawal influx, which would badly affect the price.\n\nContrary to speculations, the upgrade proved beneficial as most stakers steered away from dissolving their stake and preferred to earn passive income through staking. Moreover, developers were rooting for this to happen, as this is believed to be the main motive behind the upgrade.\n\nExperts predict that the scenario shall only grow from here onwards, especially when deflationary forces come into play. The average waiting time for gaining yield from staking is roughly over a month. Still, the investors are lining up for it.\n\nData suggests that over 50,000 individuals want to become validators on the blockchain. Also, the current annualized yield for staking ETH is between 4% to 5%. This hints that the Ether owners are eager to become validators and enjoy dual benefits.\n\nThe Beacon Chain went live in December 2020, and since then, staking emerged as a passive source of income. However, following this, the stakers could not leverage any yield from the locked coins. Furthermore, the subsequent price drop caused most stakers to bear losses.\n\nThe upgrade facilitates the flexibility of withdrawing the staked ETH, preventing the fear of the amount being locked for an extended period. This scenario caused the deposits on the blockchain to surpass the withdrawals for the first time. Additionally, the investors now have a new avenue to earn apart from holding on to ETH and waiting for the price to surge."

        "title": "Is Ethereum a Good Investment for Beginners? - Coinposters - Cryptocurrency News",
        "content": "Cryptocurrencies have gained significant popularity in recent years, and Ethereum, in particular, has emerged as one of the leading blockchain platforms. As a beginner investor, it\u2019s important to carefully evaluate the potential of any investment before committing your hard-earned money. This article aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of whether Ethereum is a good investment for beginners. We will delve into the features of Ethereum, examine the factors to consider, explore the benefits and risks associated with investing in Ethereum, and offer tips to help you make an informed decision.\n\nOverview of Ethereum\n\nEthereum is a decentralized blockchain platform that enables the creation and execution of smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). It was proposed by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 and launched in 2015. Ethereum stands out among other cryptocurrencies due to its versatility and ability to support a wide range of applications beyond digital currency.\n\nKey Features and Advantages of Ethereum\n\nEthereum offers several key features that contribute to its appeal and potential as an investment:\n\nSmart Contracts: Ethereum introduced the concept of smart contracts, which are self-executing agreements with predefined rules. These contracts automatically enforce the terms and conditions, eliminating the need for intermediaries and enhancing efficiency.\n\nDecentralized Applications (dApps): Ethereum provides a platform for developers to build decentralized applications. These dApps operate on the blockchain, offering transparency, immutability, and resistance to censorship.\n\nEthereum Virtual Machine (EVM): The EVM is a runtime environment that executes smart contracts on the Ethereum network. It allows developers to write code in multiple programming languages, making it accessible to a broad developer community.\n\nComparison with Other Cryptocurrencies\n\nWhile Ethereum is often compared to Bitcoin, they serve different purposes. Bitcoin primarily functions as a digital currency, whereas Ethereum\u2019s primary focus is on facilitating the development of decentralized applications and smart contracts. Ethereum\u2019s programmable nature and extensive developer support give it a unique advantage over many other cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhat is the minimum amount to invest in Ethereum\n\nFactors to Consider for Beginner Investors\n\nBefore investing in Ethereum, it\u2019s crucial to evaluate several factors that can significantly impact the investment\u2019s success.\n\nMarket Analysis of Ethereum\n\nTo assess the investment potential of Ethereum, consider the following:\n\nHistorical Performance and Price Trends: Analyze the historical price data of Ethereum and its market performance. Look for patterns, trends, and potential catalysts that have influenced its price movements in the past.\n\nMarket Capitalization and Liquidity: Market capitalization represents the total value of all Ethereum in circulation. Higher market capitalization indicates a more established and liquid market, which can contribute to price stability and ease of trading.\n\nRisk Assessment\n\nUnderstanding the risks associated with investing in Ethereum is essential. Consider the following:\n\nVolatility and Price Fluctuations: Cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, are known for their price volatility. The value of Ethereum can fluctuate significantly in a short period, which may lead to substantial gains or losses.\n\nRegulatory and Legal Considerations: The regulatory landscape surrounding cryptocurrencies is evolving. Changes in regulations or government interventions can impact the value and adoption of Ethereum.\n\nSecurity Risks and Potential Vulnerabilities: Like any digital asset, Ethereum is susceptible to security risks such as hacking, phishing attacks, and smart contract vulnerabilities. Assess the security measures and best practices implemented by the Ethereum community to mitigate these risks.\n\nBenefits of Investing in Ethereum\n\nNow let\u2019s explore the potential benefits of investing in Ethereum:\n\nPotential for Long-Term Growth: Ethereum has demonstrated remarkable growth since its inception. Its widespread adoption and the increasing number of decentralized applications being built on the platform indicate its potential for long-term growth.\n\nAdoption and Use Cases of Ethereum: Ethereum\u2019s versatility has led to its adoption across various industries. It has found applications in finance, supply chain management, decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and more. The growing use cases contribute to the demand for Ethereum and its potential as an investment.\n\nDevelopment of Decentralized Applications (dApps): The Ethereum platform has fostered a vibrant ecosystem of developers and entrepreneurs. The continuous development and innovation in dApps enhance the value proposition of Ethereum.\n\nDiversification of Investment Portfolio\n\nInvesting in Ethereum can provide diversification benefits for your investment portfolio:\n\nCorrelation with Other Assets: Ethereum\u2019s price movements often exhibit a low correlation with traditional assets such as stocks and bonds. Adding Ethereum to a diversified portfolio can potentially reduce overall portfolio risk.\n\nHedge Against Traditional Financial Systems: Ethereum\u2019s decentralized nature makes it less reliant on traditional financial systems.

        "content": "Cryptocurrencies have gained significant popularity in recent years, and Ethereum, with its vast potential and smart contract capabilities, has emerged as one of the leading players in the market. If you\u2019re new to the world of cryptocurrencies and wondering how to buy Ethereum, this comprehensive guide will walk you through the simplest way to get started. From research and planning to selecting a platform, creating an account, funding your account, and securing your investment, we\u2019ll explain each step in detail on the Simplest Way to Buy Ethereum, ensuring you have a solid understanding of the process.\n\nResearch and Planning\n\nBefore diving into buying Ethereum, it\u2019s crucial to familiarize yourself with the cryptocurrency and its underlying technology. Ethereum is a decentralized platform that enables developers to build and deploy smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). By understanding the potential benefits and use cases of Ethereum, you can make an informed investment decision.\n\nOnce you\u2019re familiar with Ethereum, it\u2019s time to research available platforms and exchanges. Consider factors such as user experience, fees, security measures, and supported payment methods. Look for reputable platforms that have a user-friendly interface and positive reviews from the community. By conducting thorough research, you can choose a platform that suits your needs and preferences.\n\nIn addition to selecting a platform, you\u2019ll also need to set up a digital wallet to securely store your Ethereum. A digital wallet is a software application that allows you to store, send, and receive cryptocurrencies. There are various types of wallets available, including hardware wallets, software wallets, and online wallets. Evaluate the different wallet options based on their security features, ease of use, and compatibility with Ethereum.\n\nRemember to conduct thorough research, choose a reputable platform, secure your digital wallet, and stay informed about market trends to make informed investment decisions.\n\nSelecting a Suitable Platform\n\nChoosing the right platform is crucial for a seamless Ethereum buying experience. Consider the following criteria when selecting a platform:\n\nEase of use and user interface:\n\nLook for a platform that offers a user-friendly interface and intuitive navigation. A clean and well-designed interface makes it easier for beginners to navigate through the buying process.\n\nSupported payment methods:\n\nEnsure that the platform supports your preferred payment method, whether it\u2019s credit/debit cards, bank transfers, or other options. Different platforms may have different payment options, so choose one that aligns with your needs.\n\nSecurity measures:\n\nPrioritize platforms that have robust security measures in place, such as two-factor authentication (2FA), encryption, and cold storage for funds. A secure platform reduces the risk of unauthorized access and ensures the safety of your investment.\n\nReputation and user reviews:\n\nCheck online reviews and forums to gauge the platform\u2019s reputation. Look for platforms that have positive reviews and a strong track record in the cryptocurrency community.\n\nEvaluate different platforms based on these criteria and compare their pros and cons. Take your time to choose a platform that meets your requirements and aligns with your priorities.\n\nCreating an Account and Verification\n\nOnce you\u2019ve selected a suitable platform, you\u2019ll need to create an account. The sign-up process typically involves providing your email address, creating a strong password, and agreeing to the platform\u2019s terms of service. Some platforms may also require additional personal information for Know Your Customer (KYC) verification purposes.\n\nDuring the verification process, you may be asked to provide identification documents such as a passport, driver\u2019s license, or utility bills. Follow the platform\u2019s instructions carefully and ensure that the documents are valid and up to date. Verification is a standard procedure that helps prevent fraud and ensures compliance with regulatory requirements.\n\nFunding Your Account\n\nAfter successfully creating and verifying your account, it\u2019s time to fund it. Determine the payment method that suits your needs and consider factors such as fees and processing times. Common payment methods include credit/debit cards, bank transfers, and sometimes even alternative payment options like PayPal or cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nChoose a payment method:\n\nEvaluate the available payment options on the platform and select the one that is most convenient for you. Credit/debit cards offer quick transactions, while bank transfers may have lower fees but longer processing times. Consider your priorities and select the method that aligns with your preferences.\n\nLink your payment method to your account:\n\nFollow the platform\u2019s instructions to link your chosen payment method to your account. This usually involves providing the necessary details, such as card information or bank account details. Some platforms may require an additional verification step to ensure the ownership of the payment method.\n\nComplete necessary verification steps:\n\nDepending on the platform and your location, you may need to complete additional verification steps for the payment method. This could involve providing additional documentation or confirming small deposit amounts from your bank account. Follow the platform\u2019s instructions carefully to successfully link and verify your payment method.\n\nPlacing an Order\n\nWith your account funded, you are now ready to place an order to buy Ethereum. Follow these steps to complete the purchase:\n\nDetermine the amount of Ethereum to purchase:\n\nConsider your investment goals and budget to decide the amount of Ethereum you want to buy. It\u2019s important to invest an amount that you are comfortable with and aligns with your risk tolerance.\n\nSelect the desired purchase option:\n\nPlatforms typically offer two main purchase options \u2013 market orders and limit orders.\n\nMarket order:\n\nA market order allows you to buy Ethereum at the current market price. This option provides immediate execution but may result in slightly higher fees due to market fluctuations.\n\nLimit order:\n\nWith a limit order, you can set a specific price at which you want to buy Ethereum. The order will only execute if the market reaches or goes below your specified price. This option gives you more control over the purchase price but may take longer to execute.\n\nComplete the purchase:\n\nEnter the amount of Ethereum you wish to buy and review the transaction details, including any applicable fees. Take a moment to double-check the details and ensure everything is accurate. Once you are satisfied, execute the order. The platform will process your order, and you will soon become a proud owner of Ethereum.\n\nStoring and Securing Your Ethereum\n\nAfter purchasing Ethereum, it\u2019s crucial to transfer it to a secure digital wallet. Follow these steps to store and secure your Ethereum:\n\nObtain your wallet\u2019s receiving address:\n\nSet up a digital wallet if you haven\u2019t already and obtain the wallet\u2019s receiving address. This address is a unique identifier where you can receive Ethereum.\n\nInitiate a withdrawal from the platform:\n\nOn the platform, look for the option to withdraw or send Ethereum. Enter your wallet\u2019s receiving address and the amount of Ethereum you want to transfer. Review the transaction details and confirm the withdrawal.\n\nEnable additional security measures:\n\nStrengthen the security of your digital wallet by enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) if available. This adds an extra layer of protection by requiring a second verification step, such as a code generated on your mobile device, during login or transaction confirmation.\n\nBack up your wallet\u2019s private key or recovery phrase:\n\nDigital wallets often provide a private key or recovery phrase that serves as a backup to restore access to your wallet. Safely store this information offline in multiple secure locations. Losing access to your private key or recovery phrase can result in permanent loss of your Ethereum.\n\nBy transferring your Ethereum to a digital wallet and implementing additional security measures, you have more control and ownership over your investment.\n\nWATCH THE VIDEO BELLOW\n\nWhat is the simplest way to buy Ethereum?\n\nMonitoring and Managing Your Investment\n\nAs an Ethereum investor, it\u2019s important to stay informed and actively manage your investment.

        "content": "EigenLayer Stage 1 has been positioned on the Ethereum mainnet, through which Ethereum stakers can take part in EigenLayer, control their liquid staking tokens, and shift their funds. This is made possible with the help of EigenLayer contracts. Another option is building an EigenPod and shifting the funds to the EigenPod addresses.\n\nIn the next stage, Eigenlayer will be bringing in operators who will carry out the confirmation activities related to Actively Validated Services (AVSs) that have been duly created on the EigenLayer protocol. The third stage will witness the protocol setting off the deliverance of various AVSs by utilizing the strong EigenLayer base.\n\nFollowing the delivery of restakers, operators, and AVSs on EigenLayer, the ecosystem will provide the option for stakers to allocate their staked ETH to operators. The control will remain with the stakeholder, and they will be able to select the AVSs of their choice. Operators and AVSs need to work in tandem.\n\nInitially, the EigenLayer will have some limitations for reasons of safety. Thereafter, the restrictions will slowly be lifted until they reach an absolute no-limit situation, all for the benefit of ether holders. At this point, the protocol will be fully backing liquid staking with regards to Lido stETH (stETH), as well as Rocket Pool ETH (rETH) and Coinbase Wrapped Staked ETH (cbETH).\n\nAs for the staking limits, deposits will be accepted for 3,200 tokens against every backed asset. In the case of a user transaction, 32 tokens will be allowed. There will also be no further building of EigenPods the minute the conventional restaking reaches roughly 9,600 ETH. There will be the introduction of a seven-day withdrawal period for safety reasons.\n\nIn order to ensure further safety, EigenLayer has gone through several external safety audits, along with $2,000,000 bug bounties accessible through Immunefi. EigenLayer has the vision of decentralizing the protocol and bringing together the attached community to participate in a complete trustless staking protocol.\n\nSmart contracts that are scalable and have the ability to pause operations were used to construct EigenLayer. Three prime governance multisigs have been assigned oversight over issues relating to contract scaling and the pause feature. There is the community multisig, the operations multisig, and the pauser multisig. All things considered, the launch of EigenLayer on Ethereum marks a significant milestone and moves open innovation into a more favorable environment."

        "title": "Argent Wallet Review: Is This The Best Ethereum Wallet In 2023? - Blockzeit",
        "content": "Argent Wallet is one of the latest trends in the diversified range of cryptocurrency wallets. The wallet solely helps users who only operate on the Ethereum blockchain. Being a new player in the market, the wallet has quickly gained popularity among crypto enthusiasts. But what makes it stand out from the rest?\n\nIn this Argent wallet review, we explore the features, benefits, and drawbacks of the wallet, which may help you decide if it is the right choice.\n\nWhat is Argent Wallet?\n\nArgent Wallet is a leading Ethereum-based cryptocurrency wallet that launched in 2020. During the time, the wallet was only meant to be a layer one wallet. However, From that time, the demand for Ethereum has grown, and gas fees on the protocol skyrocketed. The team behind the wallet developed a faster, more scalable version, Argent Wallet Layer 2.\n\nThe updated version is not a substitute for the Layer 1 counterpart but includes a broader range of benefits. The Layer 1 option remains the wallet\u2019s main settlement layer.\n\nThe wallet is available as a mobile app for iOS and Android. It allows you to store, send, earn interest, and invest within the wallet. It also brings in a unique functionality that assists in making decentralized apps (dApps).\n\nThe Argent Wallet is decentralized, and only you can access your assets, and nobody has the power to stop you from accessing them.\n\nPros\n\nGives multiple layers of security compared to other crypto wallets.\n\nIt supports tricky wallets and enables easy recovery.\n\nThe wallet gives returns as interest on the assets lent by users through DeFi.\n\nHas a low gas fee.\n\nCons\n\nSmart contract clashes when liquid staking ETH.\n\nCentralized infrastructure even though it is a decentralized hot wallet.\n\nThe indirect process of storing WBT can be challenging for new users.\n\nHow Does Argent Work?\n\nTo use Argent Wallet, you must download the mobile app on your iOS or Android smartphone. As the wallet is built on the Ethereum blockchain, your assets are stored, and you control them through the Argent app.\n\nYou have complete control over your wallet as you hold the private keys. Argent cannot access your assets or stop you from accessing them. You can also use the funds for other actions like transactions with external dApps.\n\nArgent Wallet Key Features\n\nArgent has some outstanding features. Such custom traits are mainly designed to ensure that you get maximum wallet benefits.\n\nETH Staking\n\nArgent offers a lucrative Ethereum staking on the Ethereum chain after the merge and cross-chain on leading Layer 1 blockchains like Solana, Polkadot, Terra, and Polygon.\n\nArgent has also integrated Lido Finance as one of its DeFi applications to achieve the requisite staking capabilities. Lido is a central liquid staking platform popular among enthusiasts. Stakers can commit their assets to the platform for profit, and then Lido generates derivative tokens.\n\nSecurity\n\nLike all crypto wallets, protecting your assets should be your number one concern. Argent operates as one of the most secure wallets. As a non-custodial DeFi wallet, only you can access and control your crypto assets, not even Argent. The platform implements some of the best security features targeted at transfer protection.\n\nArgent implements multi-sig protection, where you can select guardian accounts. There is also a seed-phrase-free wallet recovery. In this way, when you lose the credential to your wallet, you can quickly regain access without seed phrases. The wallet also implements wallet locking, where a guardian can prevent your wallet from making transactions.\n\nProfits from Liquidity Generation\n\nArgent allows for the presence of good liquidity pools. For instance, the USDC/DAI liquidity pool generates about 2.5% of revenue for its liquidity providers. However, it is crucial to note that Argent is more lucrative using the Balancer integration.\n\nArgent Wallet Fees\n\nAt its launch, Argent intended to provide fee-free transactions. However, the increase in gas fees made it no longer feasible for them to do so. Argent only charges a 0.5% commission per transaction. The commission is paid in ETH.\n\nBesides that, you may incur the network\u2019s gas fee, which entirely goes to the Ethereum blockchain, facilitating transactions. Gas fees fluctuate based on network congestion. Argent is, however, affordable as it has reduced congestion due to its high transaction processing speeds.\n\nSupported Cryptocurrencies and DApps\n\nThe Argent wallet is built on the Ethereum blockchain and is focused on Ethereum. You can access over 240 different Ethereum-based (ERC20) tokens in Argent. Such tokens include ETH, DAI, MKR, LINK, USDT, UNI, and WBTC.\n\nAdditionally, the wallet paves the way to access the most popular DeFi dApps from within your wallet. You can easily earn interest by providing liquidity for loans and exchanges with Compound, DAI savings, AAVE, and PoolTogether.\n\nHow to Install Argent Wallet Extension on Your Computer\n\n1: Head over to the Chrome browser Argent Wallet extension and click the Add to Chrome button.\n\nStep 2: Click Add Extension on the pop-up button, which allows Chrome to download the extension.\n\nStep 3: Once the downloads s complete, you will be redirected to an Argent X tab with the options to either Create a new wallet or Restore an existing one. Create the new wallet option.\n\nStep 4: Read the disclaimer, check the boxes next to them, and click Continue to proceed.\n\nStep 5: Enter your password, reconfirm it, and click Create Wallet. Finish the process.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nArgent is a wallet with high potential and comprises a unique combination of functionalities that can be utilized by a vast range of users from varying blockchains. For any user who only deals with the Ethereum blockchain, Argent would be an easy recommendation for those who are okay with maintaining a separate wallet for their Ethereum-based assets.\n\nThe only drawback of its functionalities is that it only supports tokens built on the Ethereum blockchain. There is also no desktop app for Argent, only an extension.\n\nFAQs\n\nIs Argent Wallet free?\n\nYou do not need to pay a dime to use the Argent wallet.\n\nIs Argent Wallet safe?\n\nArgent Wallet operates as one of the safest software crypto wallets on the market. The wallet is self-custodial and implements more security features like multi-sig, seed-phrase-free wallet recovery, and wallet locking. Such measures prevent unauthorized asset transfers."
