        "title": "Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade will dump huge sums of Ether into the market. Here\u2019s everything you need to know - Fortune",
        "content": "April 12 marks the end of one of the most patient waits in blockchain history. From then on, Ethereum investors can finally withdraw a $31 billion stash of ETH that started piling up at the tail end of 2020. That\u2019s due to Ethereum\u2019s latest upgrade, dubbed Shanghai, which unlocks close to 18 million so-called \u201cstaked ETH\u201d from the blockchain\u2014about 15% of all that\u2019s in circulation.\n\nThe giant token unlock marks the completion of Ethereum\u2019s most significant upgrade to date\u2014the Merge. Most significantly, the Merge cut ties with warehouses of crypto miners by combining the old blockchain with a new network that runs on an environmentally friendly transaction-validation mechanism called proof of stake.\n\nThe new proof-of-stake method gives out freshly minted ETH as a reward for those who \u201cstake\u201d (lock up) their crypto in Ethereum smart contracts. The more ETH a blockchain validator stakes, the more likely the Ethereum network will pick that validator to process a transaction, increasing the chance the validator will earn newly issued ETH.\n\nTo encourage validators to support proof of stake, Ethereum has since late 2020 offered interest rates up to 5% to anyone who parked huge amounts of ETH in its smart contracts. The ploy worked, and Ethereum developers implemented the Merge without a hitch last September, but there was one catch for investors: Those who staked ETH couldn\u2019t withdraw it fund until the developers gave permission.\n\n32 ETH\n\nShanghai is that permission. The upgrade grants about half-a-million validators\u2014each had to provide at least 32 ETH (now about $57,000)\u2014the right to withdraw their funds. So far, stakers have earned about a million ETH in rewards\u2014about 0.9% of Ethereum\u2019s total market capitalization.\n\nThe total number of individual stakers is far higher than that half-a-million figure; plenty of them pooled ETH from regular investors who couldn\u2019t afford to meet that 32 ETH requirement, staking the funds on their behalf in return for a cut of the nearly 5% annual rate. Right now, Lido, the largest decentralized finance protocol that allows for the delegation of ETH, holds about 31% of all staked ETH, according to crypto analytics site DeFiLlama.\n\nWhat else does Shanghai do?\n\nShanghai adds a host of other upgrades, known as Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs). The most important ones, EIP-3651, EIP-3860, and EIP-3855, restrict transaction costs for technical applications, which could go some way to reducing fees on the otherwise expensive Ethereum blockchain.\n\nAnd Shanghai only concerns upgrades to the execution layer of Ethereum\u2014the part that handles smart contract and protocol rules. Another set of upgrades, called Capella, will apply to Ethereum\u2019s consensus layer, the part of the network that ensures that Ethereum\u2019s validators are following the rules set forth by the execution layer.\n\nConfusingly, developers are calling the upgrades Shapella\u2014a portmanteau of Shanghai and Capella\u2014despite the proximity to the upgrade. Ethereum\u2019s Merge also changed its name close to completion from Ethereum 2.0 to the all-encompassing \u201cEthereum upgrades.\u201d\n\nShanghai is scheduled for the end of April 12, the date the network is expected to process the 6,209,536th \u201cslot.\u201d Ethereum applications shouldn\u2019t feel much of a pinch; although earlier Ethereum upgrades have been beset by delays, often by several years, a series of successful test-nets provide ample reason to believe Shanghai is firmly locked in.\n\nWill prices crash?\n\nExpect to witness a flood of ETH into the market. This is, after all, the first time investors have been able to cash out staked ETH for actual ETH. Before Shanghai, investors could only withdraw tokens that represented staked ETH on platforms like Lido, the equivalent of derivatives claims on ETH. They also could access fees earned during block proposals, such as tips paid to validators during each transaction, but not the newly issued ETH.\n\nJim McDonald, CTO of London staking firm Attestant, expects the price of Ethereum to dip sharply right after Shanghai as about 50% to 70% of early withdrawers cash out\u2014the price of ETH has more than quadrupled since December of 2020, and there are profits to be had. He said he expects the sell pressure will be worsened by the paucity of new ETH dripping into the market, a consequence of an old upgrade that burned ETH after every transaction.\n\nBut McDonald also predicts ETH\u2019s price will rebound quickly as stakers reenter the fray, perhaps after reshuffling providers or reevaluating their positions. New stakers also will join, he thinks, namely institutions that previously had feared staking derivatives services like Lido or RocketPool could burn to ashes, or that Shanghai would be delayed in perpetuity, locking away their funds forevermore.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re swapping your Ether for magic beans,\u201d McDonald said of Lido. \u201cNow, they\u2019re pretty well-tested magic beans, but trying to sell that to your CFO can be tricky. But after Shanghai, he added, institutions can \u201cretain control\u201d while staking. \u201cYou\u2019re not arguing with the taxman that you\u2019ve sold your Ether and swapped it for magic beans.\u201d\n\nA panel of top liquid-staking derivatives protocols also expect that the upgrade will bring institutions into the fold since they can add and remove funds at will, making Ethereum staking a whole lot more like an interest-bearing savings account than buying shares in a private company pre-IPO. Konstantin Lomashuk, a trader and contributor to Lido who appeared on the panel, told Fortune that Shanghai won\u2019t dent ETH\u2019s price while the wider banking crisis bears its weight on the crypto market.\n\nHow will withdrawals work?\n\nTwo types of investors are likely to withdraw: validators, and their 32-plus ETH, and regular investors who delegated funds to these validators. Yet there are reasons to believe that its effect on the market might be muted; Shapella sets some limitations as to how much ETH validators can withdraw at once, and it would take about 18 months for validators to withdraw everything.\n\nOnly 1,350 full validators can withdraw their entire holdings each day (the initial 32 ETH investment, plus any accrued rewards), or 43,200 ETH out of a total pot of 17.6 million. It\u2019d be far quicker to remove the cream on the top of the 32 ETH; about 110,000 validators can withdraw their rewards each day. McDonald, of Attestant, expects that about 1.1 million ETH (about $2 billion) will hit the market in the first week after Shanghai.\n\nLomashuk told Fortune that staking will almost double to 30 million ETH within a year, and that no more than 20% of stakers will withdraw their funds for good. Validators may not want to withdraw their ETH if the variable return rate, currently 4.6%, still beats returns elsewhere. That will grow the Ethereum network, he said, with the increase in transactions burning more ETH, and therefore raising the price \u201csignificantly.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nMore upgrades are on the way. One of the next major upgrades, Cancun, will introduce \u201cproto-danksharding,\u201d a method of speeding up the blockchain as it accommodates more users by running the network on several smaller chains at once.\n\nMichael Anderson, cofounder of the DeFi-focused VC fund Framework Ventures, told Fortune that proto-danksharding could be even more significant than Shanghai. \u201cA successful implementation could significantly reduce transaction costs on L2s,\u201d he said, referring to layer-2 protocols, \u201cenhancing the average user\u2019s experience and creating a huge competitive risk for a lot of the \u2018Ethereum killers\u2019 that dominated the conversation in the last market cycle.\u201d\n\nBut those upgrades will have to compete with Arbitrum and Optimism, as well as rival blockchains, that have eaten away at Ethereum\u2019s market share in the past few years. And while Shanghai is great for Ethereum, the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s ongoing crypto crackdown might put the kibosh on what early investors can do with their unstaked ETH.\n\nAn earlier version of this story stated the price of Ethereum had quadrupled since December. It has been updated to say the increase has occurred since December of 2020."

        "title": "What's a Better Buy: Bitcoin or Ethereum? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The debate between Bitcoin (BTC 0.96%) and Ethereum (ETH 1.61%) as a better investment has been a hot topic in the cryptocurrency community for years. Both are popular and established cryptocurrencies, but there are key differences between them that make Bitcoin a better investment. The reason for this belief can be boiled down to three simple reasons.\n\n1. The market cap difference\n\nMarket capitalization, or \"market cap,\" refers to the total value of a company or asset. In the case of cryptocurrencies, it is calculated by multiplying the total number of coins in circulation by the current market price of each coin. As of April 1, 2023, Bitcoin has a market cap of over $545 billion, while Ethereum's market cap is just under $220 billion.\n\nEssentially what this means is that Bitcoin is currently a more established asset than Ethereum and makes up a disproportionate amount of value in the entire crypto asset class. As of today, Bitcoin accounts for more than 45% of all the value in crypto.\n\nIts higher market cap indicates that it has more adoption and more trust among investors. Additionally, it suggests that Bitcoin is less volatile than Ethereum, as it would take a larger amount of money to move its price significantly.\n\n2. Increasing scarcity\n\nOne of the most significant differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum is their supply. Bitcoin has a hard cap of 21 million coins, which means that there will never be more than 21 million bitcoins in circulation. Currently, there are around 19.3 million circulating, with the remaining 1.7 million yet to be mined. Even better, though, these remaining 1.7 million bitcoins will be released at a diminishing rate for the next 117 years until the last bitcoin is mined.\n\nCurrently, Bitcoin's inflation rate is a minimal 1.7%. However, due to the gradual decrease in the rate of new coins being created, it is estimated that by 2056, this number will fall below 0.1%. By the year 2100, Bitcoin's inflation rate will be somewhere around 0.000001%. No matter the asset, an inflation rate this low helps to ensure that prices are not only maintained but grow as demand competes for a more limited supply.\n\nEthereum, on the other hand, has no hard cap. While it does have a mechanism known as burning to remove ether from circulation, there is, technically, no overall limit on the number of ether which could enter the market. Unlike Bitcoin, this means that Ethereum is subject to unknown levels of inflation, which can decrease the value of each individual coin over time.\n\n3. Decentralization and security\n\nFurthermore, Bitcoin has a stronger track record when it comes to security and decentralization. Bitcoin's blockchain is the most secure and decentralized of any cryptocurrency, with thousands of nodes and miners around the world helping to verify transactions and maintain the network. This makes it less susceptible to hacking or manipulation than Ethereum, which has had several high-profile security incidents in the past. Additionally, Bitcoin's decentralized nature means that it is not subject to the same level of centralization or regulation as Ethereum, which has been criticized for being too closely tied to its founders and developers.\n\nIn addition, Bitcoin has a more established and secure network than Ethereum. Bitcoin's network has been operating securely for well over a decade, and its underlying proof-of-work technology has proven to be reliable and resistant to attacks. Ethereum, on the other hand, has had some security issues in the past, including a major hack in 2016 that resulted in the loss of millions of dollars worth of ether. While Ethereum's security has improved over time, it still lags behind Bitcoin in terms of reliability and security.\n\nKeep it simple\n\nWhile Ethereum might be deserving of a spot in your portfolio, Bitcoin provides investors with a safer and more dependable option. Likely the greatest advantage Bitcoin has over Ethereum is its simplicity. Bitcoin's value proposition is clear and easy to understand: it is a highly decentralized and secure digital store of value that provides holders with reliability.\n\nEthereum, on the other hand, has a more complex value proposition that is tied to its smart contract functionality and decentralized applications. While this complexity can be appealing to some investors, it also makes Ethereum more difficult to understand and evaluate as an investment, as many of these use cases are in their beginning stages.\n\nFor investors looking to keep it simple and wanting to invest in cryptocurrency, look no further than the original digital asset, Bitcoin."

        "title": "Ethereum Shanghai hard fork: ETH price set for more gains versus Bitcoin in April - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ether (ETH) dropped by over 7.5% in its Bitcoin (BTC) pair in 2023. But ETH/BTC may wipe its year-to-date losses entirely in April, as Ethereum\u2019s long-awaited Shanghai hard fork is just days away.\n\nThe upgrade is set for April 12, enabling Ethereum stakers to withdraw around 1.1 billion ETH in rewards \u2014 worth over $2 billion as of April 8.\n\nETH price undergoes key technical bounce\n\nMany experts see the hard fork as bullish for Ether in the long term. For instance, the Shanghai buzz has helped Ether outperform Bitcoin in April.\n\nAs a result, the ETH/BTC pair has risen by about 4.75% month-to-date to reach 0.066 BTC as of April 8, a nearly 8% rebound since March 20.\n\nThe bounce was largely expected, particularly as ETH/BTC dropped to its historical ascending trendline support. Now, the upside move raises the prospects of an extended bullish retracement toward its descending trendline resistance, marked as a \u201csell zone\u201d in the chart below.\n\nETH/BTC three-day price chart.

Source: TradingView/CrediBULL Crypto\n\nEthereum vs. U.S. dollar outlook\n\nThe ETH/USD pair has rallied by more than 50% in 2023, primarily due to similar uptrends elsewhere in the crypto market.\n\nA weakening dollar, lower U.S. Treasury yields and expectations of a Federal Reserve pivot on interest rate hikes have helped cryptocurrencies rise across the board in Q1. These catalysts will likely remain in the spotlight until May\u2019s Federal Open Market Committee meeting.\n\nShanghai bringing the first greenshoots of #AltcoinSeason ?$ETH is perking up to an 8 month high as we approach one week until the Shanghai fork update @ 10:27:35 PM UTC on the 12th (Epoch #620,9536)\n\n\n\nThe rally has mostly been a Fed/USD rates story, causing BTC to lead the way.\u2026 pic.twitter.com/dI0bpywR16 \u2014 Rich Rosenblum (@Rich_GSR) April 4, 2023\n\nAs a result, Ether could sustain its yearly gains in April, consolidating inside the $1,800\u20132,000 range until the Fed decision.\n\nRelated: 3 key Ethereum price metrics cast doubt on the strength of ETH\u2019s recent rally\n\nMoreover, a decisive breakout at current levels could result in extended gains with a second-quarter ETH price target of over $3,000.\n\nETH/USD three-day price chart.

        "title": "Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR): Nothing Like a Traditional Blockchain - DailyCoin",
        "content": "Like all blockchains in the cryptocurrency industry, Hedera Hashgraph promises fast, cheap transactions and unmatched security in DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology). It\u2019s nothing we haven\u2019t heard of before, but the Hedera network brings a unique twist to Web3.\n\nIt\u2019s not technically a blockchain.\n\nAt face value, Hedera Hashgraph serves all the same purposes as traditional blockchains like Ethereum (ETH) or Cardano (ADA). You can store digital assets, use dApps and trade NFT collectibles. Despite the similarities, the Hedera Network is built differently under the hood.\n\nWhat exactly is a hashgraph? How is it different from a blockchain, and why does it enable the Hedera Network to charge a flat transaction fee of just $0.0001?\n\nWhat Is Hedera Hashgraph?\n\nHedera Hashgraph is a decentralized public ledger and cryptocurrency ecosystem. Unlike Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum, which are blockchains, the Hedera Network stores and transmits data on a directed acyclic graph.\n\nFor the end user, this doesn\u2019t make much difference to how we experience the network. Hedera Hashgraph smart contracts are mostly written in Solidity, the same as Ethereum. Hedera Hashgraph is EVM-compatible, meaning if you are familiar with Ethereum, you\u2019ll be right at home on Hedera.\n\nHow Does Hedera Hashgraph Work?\n\nHedera Hashgraph claims its unique hashgraph consensus algorithm is faster, safer, and more secure than traditional blockchain infrastructure. This is crucial for a public network, as it means that the Hedera network should be able to support thousands of users worldwide.\n\nThe Hashgraph \u2013 A Directed Acyclic Graph\n\nThe Hashgraph network is a type of directed acyclic graph. But how is a DAG different from a blockchain? Traditional blockchains form a line of interconnected blocks, or units of data. In a blockchain, network nodes or miners reach a consensus and validate new blocks using data from the previous block.\n\nIn a DAG, nodes can reference data from any block in the chain\u2019s lifespan, allowing them to verify information and confirm transactions faster. This is one of the main reasons behind the Hedera Network\u2019s high throughput of transactions.\n\nThe Hashgraph takes this one step further. It actively registers the timestamp of every transaction and digital signature in real-time, as well as the last hash sent and received by each node in the network. Hedera calls this phenomenon the gossip about gossip protocol, which helps put transactions in order on the network and ensures that all nodes are \u2018telling the truth\u2019 and reaching consensus.\n\nSource: Hedera Hashgraph\n\nThe gossip about gossip protocol is powered by a Proof-of-Stake mechanism. HBAR coins are staked to the network by node operators to secure the network and validate the hashgraph consensus.\n\nThanks to the hashgraph consensus, Hedera Network achieves asynchronous byzantine fault tolerance, or ABFT. This is a fancy crypto jargon term that means nodes agree with network transactions. ABFT isn\u2019t foolproof because it only requires 66% of nodes to agree for a consensus to be reached. Anyone controlling over 34% of the network might be able to get away with malicious behavior.\n\nHBAR \u2013 The Hedera Token\n\nHBAR is the native cryptocurrency of the Hedera hashgraph network. The use cases for HBAR are similar to other Layer-1 altcoins. HBAR is required to pay transaction fees on the mainnet and secure the Hashgraph through the PoS consensus.\n\nA Hedera crypto wallet and HBAR tokens let you explore the range of permissionless dApps, like decentralized exchanges on the hashgraph. HBAR is also the exchange currency in which Hedera non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, are priced.\n\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning Hedera Hashgraph\u2019s impressive network services and performance metrics. According to the team, the Hedera Network can process over 10,000 transactions per second. This significantly outperforms existing blockchain technologies like Ethereum, which struggle to clear 20 transactions per second.\n\nSource: Hedera Hashgraph\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the hashgraph enables the network to charge a flat fee of $0.0001 for network transactions, regardless of network congestion and HBAR price.\n\nHedera Governing Council\n\nThe Hedera Governing Council is an elite group of up to 39 international companies that oversee the growth and development of the Hedera Hashgraph ecosystem. The Council was formed to ensure the Hedera network would always enjoy decentralized governance and network stability and is made up of some of the world\u2019s largest companies, including IBM, Google, and Boeing.\n\nSource: Hedera Hashgraph\n\nIs Hedera Hashgraph Truly Decentralized?\n\nOne of the Hedera Governing Council\u2019s unique responsibilities is to decide who is and isn\u2019t allowed to operate a validator node and secure the hashgraph. This raises some questions about whether or not Hedera Hashgraph is truly as decentralized as they promise to be.\n\nIn contrast, anyone with sufficient ETH can launch a node on the Ethereum network. Whether or not you\u2019re allowed to operate a network node on Hedera Hashgraph is decided by a centralized source. This is expected to change as the Hedera network finds its feet in the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nMoreover, when Hedera Hashgraph initially launched, its codebase was not open-source. This was done to prevent the chain from being forked but raised concerns about whether or not the Hedera Network was operating in the true spirit of decentralization. Developers needed a license from Hedera before building applications on the network.\n\nFortunately, the Hedera Governing Council followed through on their promise to make their infrastructure open source in 2022.\n\nHedera Hashgraph History & Founders\n\nHedera Hashgraph was launched by co-founders Leemon Baird and Mance Harmon in 2018. The Hashgraph itself is actually a product of Baird and Harmon\u2019s software company Swirlds, which they founded together in 2015.\n\nSwirlds is a key player in the Hedera Ecosystem. The company has patented the hashgraph software and is guaranteed a place on the Hedera Governing Council for the entire lifespan of the Hedera ecosystem.\n\nPros and Cons of Hedera Hashgraph\n\nThe ins and outs of directed acyclic graphs and asynchronous byzantine fault tolerance are dense and complicated. To bring things back to earth, let\u2019s bypass the complex jargon and clarify the simple pros and cons of the Hedera Network.\n\nPros\n\nFast \u2013 Hedera Hashgraph can process over 10,000 transactions per second, making it one of the most performant Layer-1 networks available\n\n\u2013 Hedera Hashgraph can process over 10,000 transactions per second, making it one of the most performant Layer-1 networks available Affordable \u2013 Every transaction on the Hedera network will cost the user less than a penny, regardless of network congestion and HBAR price\n\n\u2013 Every transaction on the Hedera network will cost the user less than a penny, regardless of network congestion and HBAR price Energy efficient \u2013 The Hedera Hashgraph network uses significantly less power than traditional blockchains and has implemented carbon offsetting initiatives to go fully carbon negative\n\n\u2013 The Hedera Hashgraph network uses significantly less power than traditional blockchains and has implemented carbon offsetting initiatives to go fully carbon negative Sustained growth \u2013 There have been over 1.9 million accounts created on the Hedera mainnet, with more being added every day\n\n\u2013 There have been over 1.9 million accounts created on the Hedera mainnet, with more being added every day Accessible \u2013 The Hedera network is EVM-compatible, meaning its user experience will be familiar to anyone who\u2019s used Ethereum before. What\u2019s more, developers can easily port over Ethereum-based dApps to the Hedera network with minimal friction.\n\nCons\n\nHedera is not as decentralized as it appears \u2013 The Hedera Governing Council still controls who is allowed to operate a node on the network. It could also be argued that Swirlds, the company that invented the hashgraph has greater control, power, and influence over the fate of network.\n\n\u2013 The Hedera Governing Council still controls who is allowed to operate a node on the network. It could also be argued that Swirlds, the company that invented the hashgraph has greater control, power, and influence over the fate of network. Undeveloped ecosystem \u2013 Despite its position as a top 50 cryptocurrency in terms of market cap, few decentralized applications are built on the Hedera network. According to DeFiLlama there are only six DeFi apps on the network.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, Hedera Hashgraph is a fascinating network with excellent growth potential. However, it will struggle to attract users until it has a more developed ecosystem.\n\nThe Hedera network is not the only cryptocurrency network that uses a directed acyclic graph. Other layer 1s like Fantom Opera also use this technology and have attracted far more users and developers.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nThe Web 3 world is expanding beyond simple blockchain systems. Projects like Hedera Hashgraph prove there are always creative new ways to improve network infrastructure and drive innovation in the crypto industry.\n\nFAQs"

Recently, on 7 April, the network\u2019s consensus developers held their weekly call to discuss several pressing issues related to Ethereum\u2019s functionality and performance.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nWhat\u2019s new with Ethereum?\n\nIn the call, Ethereum\u2019s developers discussed the Deneb upgrade progress and MEV-Boost software releases on their weekly call. The Deneb upgrade is the next upgrade after Capella.\n\nMeanwhile, the Capella upgrade, set for 12 April, will enable staked ETH withdrawals. The Shanghai upgrade will activate simultaneously on the mainnet. The developers also launched their third mainnet shadow fork. This would to test the final client software versions for both upgrades. Fortunately, it went smoothly.\n\nChris Hager from the Flashbots team gave an update on the MEV-Boost releases, which were created in response to a rogue validator stealing MEV from searchers. Two significant changes were pushed to the MEV relay software, causing an increase in the number of orphaned blocks.\n\nThe developers agreed that more monitoring and collaboration with relay operators were necessary to identify and analyze data. The developers also stated that more security research on the MEV-Boost codebase was needed, and a coordinated bug bounty program was suggested.\n\nThe sentiment around ETH\n\nAmidst all the uncertainty before the upcoming Shanghai/Shapella upgrade, the sentiment around Ethereum remained positive at press time. On 7 April, Crypto exchange firm OKX conducted a survey amongst crypto users, according to which 63% of respondents predicted that ETH would hit a record high of over USD5,000 by the end of 2023.\n\nThis positive sentiment around ETH may help in gauging retail behavior in terms of ETH in the future.\n\nWhat\u2019s at stake?\n\nAs the Shanghai Upgrade gets closer, the behavior of users who have staked their ETH on the beacon chain will impact Ethereum.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nAccording to data provided by Flipside Crypto, there\u2019s 19.2 million ETH locked in the beacon chain. Out of which, a majority of stakers hold between 0-2 ETH. In the last 24 hours, each validator on the beacon chain has earned an APY of 3.7%.\n\nOnly time will determine how these stakers will react after they unstaking their holdings following the Shapella Upgrade."

        "content": "While it may have some short-term negative impact on the price of Ether (ETH), the upcoming Shanghai upgrade will be highly bullish for Ethereum\u2019s native token, as it will attract more capital to staking and increase the network\u2019s security, according to Ethereum researcher Vivek Raman.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade, scheduled for April 12, will allow network validators to withdraw funds that have been locked to secure the network since December 2020. The upgrade will complete the network\u2019s transition to a proof-of-stake system, which started in October 2022 with the Merge.\n\nAround 18 million ETH will be available for withdrawal following Shanghai. According to Raman, that may lead to some selling pressure on ETH\u2019s price in the short term.\n\nHowever, in the long run, the ability to unstake Ether will \u201cde-risk the ETH investment in a tremendous way,\u201d he pointed out. In particular, institutional investors that couldn\u2019t get involved earlier in staking will feel more comfortable once ETH can be unstaked. More capital entering ETH staking will improve the Ethereum network in the long run.\n\n\u201cThe more native proof-of-stake asset that\u2019s staked, the higher the cost to attack the chain,\u201d Raman pointed out.\n\nTo find out more about the implications of the upcoming Ethereum upgrade, check out the full interview on our YouTube channel and don\u2019t forget to subscribe!\n\nMagazine: \u2018Account abstraction\u2019 supercharges Ethereum wallets: Dummies guide"

        "title": "Ethereum's Commodity Status Like Bitcoin Sparks Bullish Market, Dogetti Meme Coin Pre-Sale Witnesses Skyrocketing ... - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) has reversed its downward trend and regained momentum, while Ethereum (ETH) has outperformed BTC, rising by more than 4%. This upward rally in the cryptocurrency market is attributed to several factors, including an increase in consumer confidence in March, recent advancements in the cryptocurrency industry, and Bitcoin\u2019s reputation as a safe-haven asset. Additionally, consumers are losing trust in traditional banks following recent bank collapses, which is considered a key factor in the Bitcoin price increase.\n\nEthereum Now Recognised As A Commodity Like Bitcoin\n\nThe crypto market cap has risen by 2.56% to $1.16 trillion, with Bitcoin and ETH leading the charge. The head of the US CFTC has reiterated that Ether is a commodity, not a security, which could boost its value. Ethereum\u2019s current price is $1,807.78, with a 24-hour trading volume of $7,635,430,660. It is likely to find an immediate resistance at $1,850, and a bullish breakout above this level could raise the price on to the next resistance level of $1,960.\n\nThe CFTC (Commodities Futures Trading Commission) has acknowledged Ethereum (ETH) and Litecoin (LTC) as commodities, similar to Bitcoin (BTC). This means that both of these altcoins are now considered trading assets, like gold or oil. The CFTC made this statement as part of an investigation into Binance, a popular cryptocurrency exchange. This development is likely to have a positive impact on BTC and ETH prices, as it verifies their commodity status, potentially enhancing their legitimacy and adoption in traditional financial markets. It could also lead to increased regulatory oversight and institutional investor approval.\n\nBitcoin Hitting Bull Market\n\nRecent strong predictions regarding Bitcoin\u2019s future are also contributing to the rise in BTC prices. For instance, former Coinbase technical director Balaji Srinivasan has bet $2 million that bitcoin would reach $1 million in value within 90 days, implying that the value of Bitcoin will increase sharply in the near-term future. Marshall Beard, the Chief Strategy Officer of Gemini, an American-based cryptocurrency exchange, is more cautious and interested, estimating that Bitcoin will hit $100,000 this year. These forecasts are being influenced by several factors, including the growing adoption of cryptocurrencies by institutional investors, which may increase demand for Bitcoin and ultimately its price.\n\nAs of this writing, Bitcoin\u2019s price is $28,259.78, and its 24-hour trading volume is $16.5 billion. A breakout above this level could potentially push Bitcoin\u2019s price toward the next resistance level of $28,900. The bullish potential for Bitcoin is also supported by the violated downward trendline.\n\nDogetti Strives To Be The Top Dog Coin\n\nDogetti (DETI) is one of the new altcoins that has caught the attention of investors in the meme coin cryptocurrency space. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, meme coins are designed to be fun and engaging while providing investors with an opportunity to make a profit.\n\nThe Dogetti (DETI) team values community and aims to provide a healthy income for all investors. Dogetti NFTs are a fun way to interact with other DETI holders besides generating a steady stream of income. These NFTs are modelled after canine companions and can be bought, sold, and traded for $DETI. In the future, the platform plans to allow Dogetti NFTs to reproduce, which would result in more NFTs and more funds for investors.\n\nInvestors who want to get in on the ground floor of this exciting altcoin can participate in Dogetti\u2019s presale. This presale offers investors the opportunity to purchase $DETI tokens before the official launch, giving them a chance to make a profit if the coin\u2019s value increases. The presale also offers various bonuses and incentives to investors who participate, making it an attractive opportunity for those who believe in Dogetti\u2019s potential.\n\nFor more information about Dogetti (DETI):\n\nPresale: https://dogetti.io/how-to-buy\n\nWebsite: https://dogetti.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/Dogetti\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_Dogetti_\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Daily active users on the BNB Chain tripled those on Ethereum\n\nThe Shapella upgrade has contributed to Ethereum\u2019s on-chain outpacing on BNB\n\nThe BNB Chain rose to prominence as an alternative to Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Layer One (L1) blockchain. Although the growth was not without challenges, the chain backed by crypto exchange Binance has been able to cut a significant part of the market share.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 BNBs worth today?\n\nAmong both blockchains, Ethereum is the one that has been around longer. But according to Token Terminal, daily active users on the BNB Chain were also three times that of Ethereum. The metric measures users that interact with a protocol during a designated time interval.\n\nThe choice to prefer the faster and cheaper chain only\u2026\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s active users were around 435,200, BNB Chain\u2019s outpaced it with a record of 1.2 million. Although the Ethereum L1 blockchain is less centralized than BNB, this rise implied that users would rather opt for the network with faster transactions and cheaper fees.\n\nHowever, BNB Chain\u2019s dominance in the aforementioned aspect did not translate to supremacy in every other area. Based on the data from the blockchain financial aggregator, the trading volume of tokens on the Ethereum blockchain was far above those registered on the BNB Chain.\n\nAs of 6 April, the volume on the BNB Chain was $601.1 million while Ethereum\u2019s volume was over $11 billion. This large spread means that there have been more tokens traded via the Ethereum network than BNB\u2019s.\n\nETH stays ahead of the game in\u2026\n\nMoreover, it seemed that the overall Ethereum ecosystem was hand down beating BNB apart from the user count. According to Santiment, Ethereum\u2019s development activity witnessed a rise and stood at 51.21. The metric tracks the work done in a project\u2019s public GitHub repositories, signaling upgrades on the project\u2019s network.\n\nThe Ethereum rise in this regard came as no surprise. Lately, the blockchain had passed the Sepolia and Goerli Testnets, as the Shanghai upgrade aimed at enabling staking withdrawals is only days away.\n\nFor BNB, it was an entirely different situation. At the time of writing, the chain\u2019s development activity was flat out at 0.048. This suggested that developers were not actively contributing, despite its recent announcement to improve the chain\u2019s security.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s BNB\u2019s market cap in ETH\u2019s terms\n\nHowever, several large ETH transactions have been making rounds with whale accumulating, and some moving into exchanges. According to Lookonchain, a whale who held 900ETH in Tornado Cash address sent all of it into a Bitfinex wallet on 5 April.\n\nThere was another whale who has been accumulating the altcoin since 15 January. As of 6 April, this same whale added another $2.4 million bought from Binance, to his bag."

        "title": "Forks in Crypto: Hard Forks vs Soft Forks - DailyCoin",
        "content": "Forks in Crypto are a perfect example of decentralization in action. The beauty of open-source, decentralized blockchain protocols is that anyone can suggest new rules and functionalities that improve the network.\n\nDespite blockchain forks having existed for years, there\u2019s still plenty of confusion around what they are and how they work. Key milestones like Cardano\u2019s (ADA) Vasil upgrade or Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) Merge are much more than catchy names, they\u2019re hard forks that improve the chain with new features.\n\nWhy do cryptocurrency forks happen and what do they mean for a blockchain network? What are the different kinds of blockchain forks and are they always for the best of the ecosystem?\n\nWhat is a Fork in Cryptocurrency?\n\nAs we all know, a blockchain network is a chain of data interconnected by units called blocks. When new blocks are created, they reference the data and events of previous blocks, which is why we can trace every transaction on the Bitcoin network right back to its genesis.\n\nWhen a blockchain fork occurs, it creates a permanent divergence from the network\u2019s latest version. Like branches on a tree, a blockchain split causes a new version of the network to run, often with new features and new rules, like a change in block size.\n\nThis process is called forking and essentially creates a new blockchain without changing the old version of the blockchain. In most cases, the new chain benefits from software upgrades voted in by community members.\n\nWhy Do Forks Happen?\n\nForks in crypto help blockchain networks improve. For example, the Alonzo hard fork introduced smart contracts to the Cardano blockchain. Ethereum\u2019s iconic hard fork, \u2018The Merge,\u2019 transitioned the network to a Proof-of-Stake algorithm, making it more scalable and energy efficient.\n\nOf course, not all forks stand the test of time and fulfill their vision of becoming new and improved versions of old chains. Bitcoin forks, despite being cheaper and more efficient networks, were never able to usurp Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s original and become the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency.\n\nJust like in your kitchen drawer, not all blockchain forks are created equal. Let\u2019s take a look at what types of forks exist and how they\u2019re different.\n\nThe Different Types of Blockchain Forks\n\nThere are two primary kinds of forks in the crypto world. In most cases, blockchain forks are recognized as either hard forks or soft forks. Both varieties serve the same purpose but have slight differences.\n\nAn easy way to understand the difference between hard forks and soft forks is to imagine upgrading your computer. In this example, a soft fork is like installing new software like an updated operating system. On the other hand, a hard fork is like replacing your computer entirely.\n\nHard Forks\n\nIn a hard fork, a significant upgrade means that the network effectively splits into two separate chains. Changes to the blockchain protocol are not backward-compatible, meaning that the new chain will not recognize the old chain. Node operators need to upgrade their software, or else the network won\u2019t recognize their new blocks.\n\nWhen this happens, node operators and community members need to make an important decision. Will they continue to use the updated software protocols of the new chain? Or would they rather stick to the old rules and the previous version of the software?\n\nIf there is enough community support for the old chain and the old rules, the pre-fork chain may continue to exist. This is why we still have networks like Ethereum Classic.\n\nIf a hard fork creates a new chain that means it also creates a new coin. Because a fork is a split of an existing chain, you can usually expect to have new cryptocurrency tokens. For example, if you held 1 Ether during The Merge, you would also have 1 Ether on the Ethereum PoW chain that still exists alongside the new Ethereum PoS chain.\n\nSoft Forks\n\nA soft fork occurs when changes occur to the network, but nodes and miners aren\u2019t required to upgrade themselves to continue participating in the blockchain. These nodes can still create new blocks under the new rules.\n\nIn blockchain technology, a soft fork is like a light software update. Any new blocks still recognize the existing network and node operators, so it doesn\u2019t force a blockchain split and result in a new blockchain.\n\nDeFi Application Forks\n\nIf you have any experience in the wild world of decentralized finance, you\u2019ve probably heard the word \u2018fork\u2019 mentioned in a slightly different way. DeFi application forks are essentially copies of existing platforms and smart contracts that might feature slight alterations.\n\nTo give you an example, think of the UniSwap decentralized exchange. The project is completely open source, so anyone can dive into the application\u2019s source code to see how it works. As more blockchain networks, like BNB Chain and Polygon, emerged, these networks needed their own DEXes for users to trade tokens on.\n\nInstead of building new apps and code from scratch, it\u2019s much easier to simply copy, or \u2018fork\u2019 an existing platform that works well. If you check the source code for QuickSwap, the leading DEX on Polygon, you\u2019ll see that all its basic code and functionality are directly copied from UniSwap\u2019s code.\n\nForking dApps is a common practice in the DeFi world. A comprehensive list of crypto projects created from forks is available on DefiLlama.\n\nHistoric Blockchain Forks\n\nCrypto history is full of crucial forks that have helped blockchain protocols address dangerous security issues and improve the most popular networks. Some of these hard forks have resulted in new coins that have held their position in the Top 100 cryptos by market cap for years on end.\n\nEven Dogecoin (DOGE), the most famous meme coin in the crypto market, was born from a fork of other networks. The Dogecoin blockchain was forked from LuckyCoin, which was in turn a Litecoin fork.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Forks\n\nThe Bitcoin blockchain is the oldest and best-known cryptocurrency network in the world. Naturally, many developers have tried to fork Bitcoin and create new and improved networks.\n\nBitcoin Cash\n\nIn August 2017, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) made history by becoming the first-ever fork of the Bitcoin blockchain. Like the original Bitcoin, BCH has a maximum supply of 21,000,000 coins.\n\nBitcoin Cash features a larger block size, meaning that the network can process more transactions per second than the original Bitcoin network. It\u2019s also cheaper to use, with lower transaction fees.\n\nThis Bitcoin fork is also called the SegWit upgrade, named after the initial proposal that eventually resulted in the Bitcoin Cash hard fork.\n\nBitcoin Gold\n\nAnother fork of the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin Gold aims to provide a more scalable alternative to Bitcoin as a payment network. Bitcoin Gold\u2019s vision was to make Bitcoin mining accessible to everyone. The forked network used common GPUs to mine new coins, instead of Bitcoin\u2019s competitive and intensive ASIC mining rigs.\n\nUltimately, Bitcoin Gold was more of a passion project than a genuine competitor. Its community appears to have abandoned the network. There have been no updates to the Bitcoin Gold site since 2021.\n\nEthereum Forks\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain has certainly witnessed a messy history, but you don\u2019t become the future of finance without overcoming some challenges along the way. Fortunately, the Ethereum community is resilient, as proven through several significant hard forks throughout the network\u2019s lifespan.\n\nEthereum Classic\n\nThe story of Ethereum Classic is an essential part of crypto history. It involves a historic hack worth hundreds of millions and a \u2018gross misuse\u2019 of blockchain technology from Vitalik Buterin and the Ethereum community.\n\nThe DAO was an investment group created in the early days of the Ethereum blockchain. In 2016, the DAO successfully raised over 150 million dollars worth of ETH, with the intention of becoming a venture capitalist firm in the emerging DeFi space.\n\nWhen hackers found a smart contract exploit in the DAO\u2019s wallet, they were able to siphon over $60 million in Ether, giving the hackers an enormous stake in the network and raising concern over whether the network was truly usable. At the time, the DAO held over 14% of all circulating ETH.\n\nAfter much negotiating between Vitalik Buterin, the Ethereum community, and the hackers themselves, it was eventually decided that a network hard fork could kickstart a new network from before the hack occurred, returning funds to investors and rewriting Ethereum\u2019s history.\n\nThis was an extremely controversial decision. It went against all the principles of blockchain technology, such as decentralization and immutable transactions. The Ethereum community was split in two; those who agreed with the hard fork proposal and those who did not.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain we know and love today is the new chain created from this historic hard fork. The old chain, whose community did not accept the display of power and control, is now called Ethereum Classic.\n\nEthereum POW (Proof-of-Work)\n\nIn late 2022, the Ethereum blockchain finally completed its long-awaited migration to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. This new chain was the result of years of work and reduces Ethereum\u2019s annual energy consumption by as much as 99%.\n\nEthereum miners who were against The Merge hard-forked the old chain and created Proof-of-Work Ethereum. The Ethereum PoW functions just like the normal Ethereum blockchain did pre-merge. However, the new coin, ETHPOW has little demand and the network doesn\u2019t see much user traffic.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nForks in crypto are essential processes that improve blockchain networks and help drive progress in the industry. However, they do pose security risks if poorly executed.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nHard fork events like The Merge, the Alonzo upgrade and the Shanghai update are crucial moments in blockchain evolution. Being informed about the processes involved can help you prepare for potential outcomes and help you better understand blockchain technology.\n\nFAQs"

        "content": "What is Shibarium? Shibarium is an upcoming layer-2 (L2) blockchain network built on Ethereum for Shiba Inu. It will transform Shiba Inu, a memecoin, into a complete ecosystem. Ryoshi, the anonymous creator of Shiba Inu, proposed the Shibarium project in a now-deleted blog post in May 2021. The project intends to build a blockchain layer-2 solution on the Ethereum blockchain. The expansion will transform Shiba Inu from a memecoin into a comprehensive ecosystem that includes a decentralized exchange (DEX), a metaverse and blockchain games, such as Shiba Eternity. Memecoins are cryptocurrency tokens depicted with comical or animated internet memes. Generally highly volatile, these coins are largely driven by pop culture and have an ample supply leading to high inflation. Shiba Inu (SHIB) itself has a total supply of 1 quadrillion, which equals 1,000 trillion. The Shibarium portal is aimed at reorganizing Shiba Inu as a multi-project and a stable ecosystem. Shibarium developers haven\u2019t yet released a launch date for the project. An alpha preview of SHIB metaverse, a part of the project, however, was on display at SXSW 2023 from March 13 to 15. The release was originally planned for February 2023 but was delayed because the developers were keen on launching an error-free version after thorough testing through various phases.\n\nWhat does Shibarium mean for Shiba Inu? The advantages of using Shibarium include higher transaction speeds, lower fees, increased token utility and seamless decentralized application (DApp) development. Despite its upgrade to a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain through the Merge, the Ethereum blockchain still struggled with scalability, despite its robust security layer. Shibarium is also a PoS project, which will help Shiba Inu to scale while keeping it hooked to Ethereum blockchain. Shibarium is expected to stabilize the value of SHIB and transform Shiba Inu into a value-added project with long-term prospects. Let us see below how Shibarium will unlock the potential infused in the memecoin. Better transaction speeds Adding layer 2 to the Shiba Inu ecosystem, Shibarium will increase throughput, enabling the project to handle significant growth. Shibarium is expected to boost the transaction speed considerably, though users will have to wait a bit more for precise information on throughput. Lower fees High transaction fees have been a problem for anyone performing a transaction on Ethereum. Sometimes, the fee is higher than the transaction amount. For instance, one might need to pay a steep fee of $50 worth of Ether (ETH) for a small transaction of $10 in value. The introduction of the Shibarium layer-2 solution is likely to make gas fees negligible. Complete ecosystem Contrary to being a mere memecoin, the Shibarium ecosystem will be comprehensive, comprising several projects, including SHIB metaverse, ShibaSwap DEX and blockchain games. The metaverse and games are expected to pull in users, while the DEX will provide better liquidity. Token utility The abundant supply of SHIB, despite the burning of more than 40% of the tokens, has been a huge hindrance to its growth. Shibarium handles this by introducing BONE as the native coin. When Shibarium takes off, validators on the network will get paid in BONE for securing and validating transactions. Moreover, in the new ecosystem, every transaction will consume SHIB, a mechanism to control the hugely inflated supply of SHIB. DApp development DApps are decentralized applications with backend code executing on a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) network. The memecoin, however, simply did not have the wherewithal to act as a native coin of DApps. Shibarium intends to develop a robust ecosystem comprising a layer-2 solution in conjunction with Ethereum. It will provide the technical ability to create DApps within the ecosystem.\n\nHow will Shibarium work? Shibarium will take away a large chunk of transactions off of the Ethereum blockchain, resulting in quicker throughput without compromising on security. The mechanism to burn tokens will help keep inflation in check. The upcoming Shibarium will function by handling transactions while retaining the security layer of Ethereum. As most network activities are handled by Shibarium itself, Ethereum will be relieved of the sheer volume of transactions that might swamp it. This will result in faster yet secure transactions. Before adopting PoS, the low throughput of Ethereum resulted in network congestion and pushed up gas fees to an astronomical $50\u2013$80 per transaction. The Merge boosted the throughput of the network and brought down fees. Still, L2 solutions are required, as the base blockchain has to handle a stream of projects that slows it down. To stem the inflation of the SHIB coin and set its prices in an upward motion, the Shibarium portal will have a mechanism to burn SHIB tokens paid as fees for executing transactions. This will bring down the coins in circulation and stabilize the price of tokens. Coin burning is a mechanism to send tokens to one-way wallets that accept the tokens but never release them. These coins are lost forever. Over time, the continual burning of coins keeps inflation at bay in cryptocurrency projects.\n\nWhich coins will make up the Shibarium ecosystem? The Shibarium ecosystem will have several coins with different roles. Shibarium will have a drastically different look compared to Shiba Inu. The new ecosystem, however, will have several digital tokens, all named in line with the dog theme: SHIB: An ERC-20 token that fuels Shiba Inu, SHIB has been around since August 2020. Its price has always fluctuated and never crossed the $1 mark per token.\n\nBONE: A governance token on ShibaSwap, BONE is now also a utility token in Shibarium. Developers are paid in BONE. The token\u2019s supply is capped at 230 million coins.\n\nLEASH: With its supply limited to 107,646 tokens, LEASH is staked by holders to earn rewards. Rewards include xLEASH tokens that users can mint after unstaking.\n\nTREAT: Designed as a reward token, TREAT will be paid to validators and developers along with BONE after reaching a certain threshold. It will also incentivize liquidity pools on ShibaSwap.\n\nSHI: The Shibarium ecosystem will have the SHI stablecoin as well. The purpose of SHI is to counter and balance payments while staving off market fluctuations. Related: How and why do stablecoins depeg?"

        "content": "Paris is positioning itself as the next major hub for the cryptocurrency industry, despite the closure of several crypto-friendly banks and the failure of FTX. The French government is showing support for the crypto industry and blockchain technology, with President Emmanuel Macron seeing cryptocurrency as a way to attract businesses to the region. This has significant implications for major crypto coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as newer tokens such as Signuptoken.com.\n\nSignuptoken.com: A Revolutionary Crypto Project\n\nSignuptoken.com is a new crypto project with a unique concept. Its goal is to create generational wealth by registering a single email that will help subscribers retire early. The project aims to accumulate one million email subscribers before launching its token on Uniswap. Currently, Signuptoken.com has already accumulated 3,000 email subscribers, bringing it one step closer to its target.\n\nSubscribers will receive regular email updates on the project\u2019s progress. Once the one-million email subscription goal is reached, the team will send out a single email announcing the launch of the ERC-20 token. The project is attempting something that has not been achieved on a global scale before.\n\nTo ensure the validity of the project\u2019s one million email subscription goal, the team will send out a verification email to confirm that all users added are genuine. The team has not revealed their identities and will not be providing tokenomics about the crypto coin.\n\nBitcoin: A Strong Investment Choice\n\nBitcoin is currently the largest cryptocurrency on the market, and more and more establishments are starting to accept it as a payment method. In Paris, Burger King has introduced power bank rental machines called Instpower, which accept crypto payments such as BTC. These machines are connected to Binance Pay and Alchemy Pay.\n\nThis move by Burger King in Paris is part of a larger trend of companies embracing cryptocurrency payments, highlighting the growing acceptance and legitimacy of digital currencies. With the rise of crypto and the growing demand for alternative payment methods, more businesses will likely start accepting cryptocurrency payments in the near future.\n\nEthereum Holders Await Price Rally\n\nMany Ethereum holders are eagerly anticipating a price rally, as suggested by crypto analyst Justin Bennett. Bennett speculates that Ethereum may face a rally that could liquidate traders facing bearish action on ETH\u2019s platform. The rally at the end of March could hint at the crypto market\u2019s short-term performance.\n\nWhile the crypto market is typically affected by stock market trends, there is often a lag between the two asset classes. If the crypto market takes cues from equities, a resistance level at $1,840 for Ethereum is possible. Therefore, a short squeeze could occur, triggering rallies, as there is a considerable amount of short liquidations over the $2,000 price level.\n\nEmbracing the Future of Finance with Crypto Coins\n\nAs Paris embraces cryptocurrency and recognizes its benefits and potential as an alternative to traditional forms of currency, it may inspire other countries to follow suit. While crypto investments do carry risks due to economic conditions and market volatility, accepting crypto as part of the future of finance can help everyone adapt to the changing landscape of the digital economy.\n\nSignuptoken.com could become the next major crypto coin to launch on an exchange.

        "content": "Shiba Inu is expected to become more decentralized than Ethereum.\n\nShiba Inu would also receive some critical infrastructure from Unification as UNODE plays a pivotal role in the ecosystem.\n\nShibarium is the project expected to transition Shiba Inu from a meme coin to a technologically focused ecosystem. It is set to operate as a blockchain layer that runs on top of Ethereum. Shibarium would take over a large portion of SHIB transactions to prevent the asset from solely relying on Ethereum. Recently, the beta testnet was launched. Shiba Inu could compete with Ethereum on the grounds of decentralization as development firm Unification, which is known as the main developer of the Shibarium project, considers this as an important objective.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRingoshi Toitsu, a popular validator of the Unification (FUND) network tweeted a screenshot on April 5 featuring an interaction between the Unification Foundation and a community user. As captured in the screenshot, Unification was attempting to address the centralization of Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) node operations issue. The Unification\u2019s upcoming tool UNODE for decentralized applications (dapps) in the Shibarium ecosystem would, therefore, be used by SHIB\u2019s layer 2.\n\nIt is worth noting that the native token of Unification is FUND. This is said to play a critical role as the only crypto that would be used by UNODE. According to Toitsu, UNODE would be very useful in the SHIB ecosystem.\n\nUnification is now tackling the next major point of centralization for Shibarium operations \u2013 EVM node operations. UNODE\u2019s launch in 2023 offers a more secure and decentralized infrastructure for developers & Dapps \u2013 using FUND as the gas!\n\nShiba Inu is currently bullish\n\nThe decentralization aspect of the project is very important considering how Ethereum has been a topic of discussion after its recent ETH.20 upgrade. According to Messari\u2019s study conducted in the fall of 2022, 70 percent of leading Ethereum applications run on four centralized node providers. In a blog post, Unification mentioned that Alchemy, Infura, Moralis, and Quicknode are the four centralized industry incumbents that provide the most ETH nodes. This is said to create a vulnerability in the technology stack of decentralized applications. Many also require card payments through DApps, hence, are permissioned and identifiable. In this case, tracking could be triggered.\n\nUnification\u2019s UNODE addresses this Achilles\u2019 Heel, by democratizing, decentralizing, and incentivizing EVM node operations. In accordance with our ethos, this will be pure Web3.\n\nOracle of Oracles (OoO), is also part of the Unification technology. OoO provides real-time asset prices by combining data from decentralized and centralized exchanges. This would be integrated into the SHIB ecosystem and includes ShibaSwap, Shiboshi NFTs, and Shibarium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis means important infrastructure from Unification would be received by Shiba Inu.\n\nUnification is doing an excellent job with their technology for Shibarium, and no one else can match it. We\u2019re still in an early beta stage with a focus on delegating/staking. People know that BONE is gas, there will be REAL governance, and TRUE SHIB users will be able to earn rewards from using the blockchain.\n\nThe current sentiment of Shiba Inu is bullish and is trading at $0.000011 as of press time. In the last seven days, the asset has surged by 2 percent.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

        "content": "If anything, the last couple of months have taught us that the crypto industry is a rollercoaster that goes both up and down\u2014and sometimes really down. The market is seriously bearish across the board, and investors are sitting on their hands, waiting for the perfect time to buy the dip.\n\nWhen is the perfect time? Investors are itching to get into buy positions as many coins on their watchlist are etching close to their all-time low price. This means bigger returns for investors if they get in early and if these tokens rally as high as they\u2019ve done in the past. The top item on this list for the majority of investors is Ethereum.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll explore expert opinions on the Ethereum price prediction for 2023 and when exactly it is the best time to buy Ethereum in order to maximize profit. We\u2019ll also dive into the world of Pikamoon, the new GameFi project that experts believe will outperform Ethereum in 2023.\n\nShould I Buy Ethereum Now? \u2013 Ethereum Price Prediction For 2023\n\nWhile Ethereum may have gained 2.5% in the last 7 days and 3.1% in the last 30 days, it is noteworthy to mention that the overall Ethereum trend is still bearish. Ethereum has dropped over 60% from its all-time high price and may still go lower if certain criteria are not met quickly.\n\nReports from Coinmarketcap show that 66% of investors holding ETH tokens are in profit, 29% are in loss, and a small 5% are at breakeven. With the majority of investors in profit, it is easy to get excited at the thought of loading up on your buy positions on Ethereum.\n\nExperts believe this may not be the best course of action at the moment as ethereum\u2019s price is not quite settled yet. The price of the ETH token is presently trading above the $1920 support level. This is a good indicator that prices may reach as high as $2500 without major obstructions. Before taking any more buy positions, wait for a clear close of the daily or weekly candle above the $2121 price region and a retest of the $1890 support level.\n\nNonetheless, the $2500 resistance zone is a critical region for the price of Ethereum. If the price of Ethereum fails to break the level to the upside, the price of its token may fall to $1800 lows or even lower.\n\nThis is why analysts are telling ETH investors who are looking to diversify their portfolios to load up on as many $PIKA tokens in the ongoing Pikamoon presale as the GameFi token is poised to rally as much as 20,000% before the end of the year.\n\nWhat is Pikamoon?\n\nPikamoon is a leading P2E in the crypto industry developed by crypto experts and blockchain analysts who are fully doxxed and properly vetted by Coinsult, a leading blockchain audit company. This is one of the many reasons big investors, the crypto community, and big brands trust the Pikamoon project.\n\nThat\u2019s not all. When it comes to community support, Pikamoon is way ahead of its peers in the industry. The Pikamoon community is made up of crypto enthusiasts and expert investors who are fully involved and invested in the project\u2019s success. This is why experts believe Pikamoon is on its way to becoming an industry leader.\n\nTo top it all off, the Pikaverse, which is the metaverse of the Pikamoon game, is built on the best gaming engine in the industry, Unreal Engine 5. This is the same gaming engine that the legendary Fortnite game is built on. So when it comes to your expectations of the Pikamoon game, you can let your imaginations run wild.\n\nBoth gamers and crypto enthusiasts are patiently waiting for Pikamoon\u2019s launch so they can experience the Pikaverse firsthand. This is why investors are loading up on $PIKA tokens on the ongoing presale because they know the value of Pikamoon will skyrocket once it launches.\n\nPikamoon Presale: The Easiest Way To Flip Your Portfolio In 2023\n\nPikamoon is the game changer you need to transform your financial situation, and there\u2019s no better time to invest in the project than now. Pikamoon is in the third and last stage of its presale, where $PIKA tokens are selling for as little as $0.0006.\n\nThe price of the Pikamoon token will never be this low again. Experts believe the $PIKA token will rally as high as 20,000% after its launch on major exchanges. Don\u2019t miss out on another massive price move that can make you a crypto millionaire.\n\nGet on the Pikamoon presale now!\n\nFind out more about Pikamoon (PIKA):\n\nBuy Now: https://pikamoon.io/buy\n\nWebsite: https://pikamoon.io\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Pikamooncoin\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/pikamoonofficial\n\nDisclaimer: This is a paid release.

        "content": "Ethereum is coming up with yet another improvement, the Shanghai Upgrade on April 12, leaving the crypto sector excited. The upgrade would allow billions of withdrawals of their native token Ether. As stakers who have previously staked them for various reasons can now un-stake, speculations are that this could bring the prices down as huge amounts will be in the market.\n\nCountdown 5 Days: 5\ufe0f\u20e3 \ud83d\ude80#Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade soon! \ud83c\udd99 Lower gas fees, smart contract updates, & staked #ETH withdrawal.\n\n\n\nExciting times ahead! pic.twitter.com/9chXE3msjT \u2014 Bitget (@bitgetglobal) April 7, 2023\n\nThe Much-awaited Shanghai Upgrade\n\nFrom its inception till September 2022, Ethereum incorporated energy-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) for transactions. This changed with a hard fork called Merge, and they shifted to proof-of-stake (PoS). This process involved users staking Ether to become validators and earn rewards in return. However, these staked Ether could not be withdrawn; the Shanghai upgrade would allow them to un-stake them. Studies show that almost 16% of the ETH supply is staked and valued at around $37 billion.\n\nHowever, it is unclear if the users would cash the staked ETH, as the values have fluctuated wildly over the years, especially since crypto winter started in 2022. Speculations are that the initial demand for withdrawal could exceed the new staking on the blockchain. But as time passes, the opportunity to withdraw staked ETH could make the proposition of Ether staking more rewarding and appealing.\n\nAnalysts argue that this increased volatility could benefit liquid-staking tokens and be used in many dApps to let people borrow, lend and trade coins, thereby increasing the trading volume and, thus, the price.\n\nCan Shanghai Upgrade Deliver on Promises?\n\nManaging withdrawals at such a massive scale would not be easy for the Ethereum network. When the withdrawals start, expectations are that people will have to line up for their chance. The wait could be short or long, depending on where the stakes are held. If a holder has had a liquid staking token on Lido, the process would be more complex. The services, which held about a third of the staked ETH, are expected to begin withdrawals in May 2023. Due to the scale of the project, its completion could take months. Moreover, mechanisms should be maintained to ensure no attacks occur and the ecosystem is not vulnerable while facilitating massive withdrawals.\n\nDue to its massive scale, there could be glitches when it goes live. Recent test results were not encouraging, as they revealed a long time for transaction confirmation because many computers could not handle the software upgrade. But still, Ethereum developers are tracking everything for seamless software changes.\n\nAnother issue that could arise is that the blockchain holding staked ETH has lost the access keys and could be thrown out of the process.\n\nAfter the Merge, Ether has inadvertently drawn the attention of regulators like the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. The authority argues that certain offerings from them should be counted as illegal securities and dealt with as such.\n\nThe Shanghai Upgrade has a very promising premise, and if it can deliver what is promised, it has the potential to revolutionize the crypto industry. However, certain underlying problems could surface and should be dealt with."
