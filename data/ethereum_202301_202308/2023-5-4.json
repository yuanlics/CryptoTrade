        "content": "\u2018Dencun\u2019 Will Focus On Scaling To Reduce Transaction Costs\n\nBy: Samuel Haig \u2022 Loading...\n\nDeFi News\n\nDespite Ethereum\u2019s Shapella upgrade going live just three weeks ago, the Ethereum Foundation is already looking ahead to the network\u2019s next upgrade, dubbed Dencun.\n\nAccording to a May 3 blog post from Ethereum Foundation community manager Tim Beiko, Ethereum\u2019s core developers are already in \u201cthe final stages of planning\u201d for Dencun.\n\n\u201cWe currently have a tentative set of [Ethereum Improvement Proposals] included in the next network upgrade,\u201d Beiko said.\n\nThe primary update included in Dencun is EIP-4844, also known as \u201cProto-Danksharding\u201d or \u201cThe Surge.\u201d Researchers anticipate the update will reduce the costs associated with transacting on Ethereum Layer 2 by orders of magnitude. Beiko did not offer any timeline for when Dencun might be activated.\n\nThe news comes as Layer 2 networks have emerged as the leading Ethereum scaling solution. Layer 2s surpassed the Ethereum mainnet by daily transaction volume in February, with L2s currently beating Ethereum by double with 2M transactions daily. L2 transactions peaked at nearly 4M six weeks ago, while mainnet activity trended steady at roughly 1M each day for the past six months.\n\nEthereum (blue) versus combined L2 (red) daily transaction volume.\n\nL2s represent a combined total value locked (TVL) of $9.3B, according to L2Beat, equal to one-fifth of the entire DeFi TVL, according to DeFi Llama.\n\nThe Surge\n\nEIP-4844 will replace the blockspace-intensive \u201ccalldata\u201d currently stored on-chain alongside transactions with \u201cblobs,\u201d with analysts tipping the upgrade will improve Layer 2 throughput by orders of magnitude. Unlike calldata, Blobs do not compete with Ethereum transactions for gas, significantly reducing the blockspace associated with processing transactions on L2.\n\n\n\nIn a recent appearance on The Defiant Podcast, Carl Beekhuizen of the Ethereum Foundation said the cost of storing data on-chain is the main barrier restricting the scalability of Layer 2 networks. \u201cThe idea behind Danksharding and EIP-4844 is to provide really cheap data storage\u2026 so the L2s can provide cheap transactions to their users,\u201d Beekhuizen said.\n\nOther Confirmed Upgrades\n\nBeiko confirmed that Dencun will include at least three other upgrades.\n\n\n\nEIP-1153 will introduce \u201ctransient storage,\u201d which allows certain data to be discarded from transactions rather than stored on-chain. The upgrade will further improve blockspace availability and reduce the costs associated with storing data on-chain.\n\nDeFi Alpha Premium Content DeFi Daily | Weekdays\n\nDeFi Alpha Letter | Weekly\n\nDefiant Podcast Transcript | Weekly\n\nInbox Dump | Saturday\n\nWeekly Recap | Sunday Looking for Alpha?

Start for free\n\nEIP-6475, also called SSZ Optionals, is a companion to proto-danksharding \u2014 which introduces a new type of transaction that uses simple serialize (SSZ) encoding. Beiko said EIP-6475 ensures transaction formats are forward-compatible future SSZ-upgrade devs plan to introduce in the future.\n\nEIP-6780 will deactivate the SELFDESTRUCT opcode, which is used to terminate a smart contract. Beiko said the function is not behaving as expected for certain use cases, adding that client teams are currently considering different solutions for modifying the code.\n\nAmbitious Roadmap\n\nEthereum is currently undergoing a period of significant transformation which began with the Merge last September, transitioning Ethereum to Proof of Stake consensus. Once the Surge is live following Dencun, Ethereum will undergo three other major upgrades in the form of the Verge, the Purge, and the Splurge.\n\nThe Verge will introduce Verkle trees and stateless clients to make Ethereum more lightweight and bolster decentralization. Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum\u2019s co-founder and chief scientist, said that after The Verge, users will be able to launch nodes \u201cwithout having hundreds of gigabytes on your disc.\u201d\n\nThe Purge will remove old history from the blockchain, meaning nodes won\u2019t be required to store the entire history of the blockchain. The network will delete transaction data after it is 30 days old, with infrastructure providers like the Etherscan block explorer expected to continue compiling older historical data.\n\nFinally, the Splurge will introduce \u201call of the other fun stuff\u201d bolstering the network\u2019s efficiency and performance not included in other upgrades.\n\nEthereum\u2019s core devs expect the network will enter a phase of relative stability following the Splurge, with Vitalik predicting that Ethereum \u201cwill look more like a system that optimizes for safety and predictability.\u201d"

        "title": "Joe Lubin: The truth about ETH founders split and 'Crypto Google' - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "\n\nThere\u2019s a narrative that\u2019s grown up around Ethereum\u2019s two most important co-founders, Joe Lubin and Vitalik Buterin, to explain how they went in different directions almost a decade ago.\n\n\n\nIt suggests the pair fell out over the blockchain\u2019s future direction, with the idealistic 20-year-old Buterin determined to turn Ethereum into a nonprofit foundation, while Lubin and others wanted to commercialize the technology via a for-profit company.\n\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t really what happened,\u201d the billionaire founder of Ethereum infrastructure and software firm ConsenSys tells Magazine during an in-depth interview in Tel Aviv.\n\n\u201cWhat happened was people were looking for a way to explain why these two people were bumped out of the project. And that was a convenient way to label it. But that wasn\u2019t the reason they were moved.\u201d\n\nLubin\u2019s referring to Ethereum\u2019s infamous \u201cRed Wedding\u201d in 2014 when the eight co-founders and the team gathered to incorporate Ethereum as a company.\n\nFormer Ethereum CEO Charles Hoskinson (right) with creator Vitalik Buterin (left) from back in the day. (Flickr)\n\nThe meeting descended into bickering and infighting over internal politics that saw a devastated CEO Charles Hoskinson pushed out of the team, along with underperforming co-founder Amir Chetrit.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s true that I and several people on the team \u2014 like maybe everybody else \u2014 believed that you need to draw businesses in, you needed economic, commercial validation in order to build better things, even open-source software,\u201d the 58-year-old says in his slow, measured tones.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut that wasn\u2019t the root of why I started ConsenSys or why two people were bumped off the project.\u201d\n\nRed Wedding and Crypto Google\n\nAs documented in Camilla Russo\u2019s history of Ethereum, The Infinite Machine, the co-founders had gathered in Zug, Switzerland on June 7, 2014, to sign a document transforming Ethereum into a for-profit company. But instead of signing the contract, tensions boiled over Hoskinson\u2019s management style and personality, Chetrit\u2019s contribution to the project, Ethereum\u2019s future direction and other internal political issues.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter much back and forth, the decisions were all left to the gangly 20-year-old math genius who\u2019d created the project in the first place. After some time alone on the terrace, he returned to say Hoskinson and Chetrit were out, and Ethereum would become a nonprofit foundation instead of a company.\n\n\n\n\u201cVitalik wrote an amazing white paper \u2014 it was right place, right time, incredible vision \u2014 and it attracted lots of people of disparate backgrounds, and we worked together well for chunks of time,\u201d Lubin says by way of context.\n\nJoe Lubin in conversation with Magazine in Tel Aviv.\n\n\u201cWe had differences of opinion, at times, those differences of opinion boiled over famously\u2026 infamously. And there was a moment where two people were bumped out of leadership, and up to that point, we were having discussions about whether we were going to be purely nonprofit, or whether we were going to pursue a nonprofit track, put it under a foundation, and then the same group of people who worked so nicely together would build Crypto Google together.\n\n\u201cAnd it became apparent to all of us that we probably weren\u2019t going to build Crypto Google. But it was also clear to all of us that nobody was even close to being able to build Crypto Google and that we\u2019re just building the foundation and the platform for a long time.\u201d\n\nLubin was already planning his own for-profit company to build out Ethereum\u2019s application layer when the decision was made, and it spun into life not long afterward.\n\nWhile other co-founders, such as Gavin Wood (Polkadot), contributed more to the early protocol itself, arguably none of them, apart from Buterin, has since contributed as much as Lubin to what Ethereum is today. While ConsenSys didn\u2019t turn into Crypto Google, its infrastructure and apps are as important to Ethereum now as Google is to the web.\n\n\u201cConsenSys wasn\u2019t formed to commercialize it. It was formed to continue the vision and the mission of the Ethereum platform,\u201d Lubin explains.\n\n\n\nRelated: The Vitalik I know \u2014 Dmitry Buterin\n\nWho is Joe Lubin?\n\nBorn in Toronto in 1964, Lubin studied electrical engineering and computer science at Princeton in the mid-1980s, where his roommate was another future crypto billionaire, Mike Novogratz of Galaxy Digital. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos was in the same faculty, though Lubin tells Magazine they never met.\n\nJoe Lubin was almost 50 before he jumped on board the Ethereum train and made his first billion.\n\nLubin has had a surprisingly diverse career, working in AI, robotics and autonomous music creation for a number of different employers. He founded a hedge fund and was the vice president of private wealth management at Goldman Sachs, but nothing world-changing, according to Novogratz, as quoted in the Financial Times in 2021.\n\n\u201cJoe was one of the brightest among us, a forward thinker, but by 45 hadn\u2019t done anything to stand out,\u201d Novogratz recalled. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of our gang would have guessed how things would turn out.\u201d\n\n\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s how Ethereum\u2019s ZK-rollups can become interoperable\n\nThe combination of his near-front-row seat to the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and then the global financial crisis shook him to his core. He said at the ConsenSys Ethereal Summit in May 2017 that the events had made him feel as though \u201cwe were living in a global society and economy that was figuratively, literally and morally bankrupt.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe believed a slow, cascading financial collapse was taking place, which made him receptive to the ideas in the Bitcoin white paper, which he read in 2011. The following year he moved to Jamaica with his girlfriend, who was trying to forge a career in dancehall music, and he became a music producer while investing in Bitcoin and waiting for the collapse.\n\nDuring a trip home to Toronto in late 2013, he attended a Bitcoin meetup alongside another co-founder, Anthony Di Iorio, and encountered a kid named Vitalik Buterin, who was touting his just-written white paper for an improved version of Bitcoin called Ethereum. Lubin was \u201cblown away,\u201d and he became an official co-founder in early 2014.\n\nThe core early Ethereum team at the house rented for Bitcoin Miami 2014, including Joe Lubin in the back row, second from right. (yanislav.medium.com)\n\n\n\nApproaching 50, he was an odd fit with a bunch of anti-establishment 20-something-year-old coders, but his Jamaican music production background gave him just enough cachet with the team to get by. And, of course, Lubin and Di Iorio personally bankrolled around $500,000 to $800,000 of the funding necessary to get Ethereum off the ground.\n\nLubin\u2019s experience also helped the team avoid potential pitfalls and roadblocks, and he insisted on early meetings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and hiring high-priced lawyers to minimize the extraordinary legal risks.\n\nConsenSys arises!\n\nConsenSys was founded in Switzerland in October 2014 for legal reasons, which subsequently led to a nasty ongoing court battle between employees and shareholders who claim they weren\u2019t properly compensated when the assets were transferred to an American entity.\n\nRelated: \u2018Account abstraction\u2019 supercharges Ethereum wallets: Dummies guide\n\nBut it actually operated from a graffiti-covered warehouse in Bushwick, Brooklyn. The aim was to build out applications and infrastructure for Ethereum by investing in startups, incubating projects and consulting with firms like JPMorgan and BHP Billiton on how to incorporate this new technology. It spawned more than 50 businesses early on, including a poker site, a prediction market and a healthcare records firm. But by all accounts, its early years were pretty slapdash, with no real corporate structure.\n\nMetaMask co-founder Dan Finlay spoke about the early days on the Epicenter podcast.\n\n\n\n\u201cConsenSys was this wonderful, just kind of chaotic incubator at the early stages. I don\u2019t know, there must have been hundreds of different experiments getting validated and tried out there. And there was a really exciting energy,\u201d he says, adding that a lot of projects got built before Ethereum could support them:\n\n\u201cBack then, it was very normal to just kind of build your application as if the blockchain was going to scale or did scale already.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, a Forbes investigation suggested that pretty much all of ConsenSys\u2019 projects were in the red, and the company was burning $100 million a year on non-profitable projects, including an asteroid mining company.\n\nForbes took aim at ConsenSys in a 2018 investigation. (Forbes)\n\nNot long after, Lubin axed a bunch of underperforming projects, culled the 1,200-strong headcount and reset the company into ConsenSys 2.0 with a much more corporate and accountable culture.\n\nDespite being worth $7 billion after its most recent $450-million fundraising round in 2022, ConsenSys let go of another 11% of its staff in January of this year. Lubin tells Magazine it was readying itself to survive bad conditions as \u201cmacroeconomic and geopolitical\u201d storm clouds gathered.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to ensure that we had significant runway so that we can stay strong and build,\u201d he says, revealing it was eyeing a number of acquisitions that \u201cif we\u2019re able to bring some on board that will add really valuable pieces.\u201d\n\nI am excited to share news of our Series D fundraise. https://t.co/SZP36mgBfl \u2014 Joseph Lubin (@ethereumJoseph) March 15, 2022\n\nCentralization vs. decentralization\n\nAnyone who\u2019s listened to Lubin speak will know that he\u2019s genuinely committed to, and a proponent of, the benefits of decentralization.\n\n\n\nSo, is there tension between running a centralized company like ConsenSys that provides the crucial infrastructure to a decentralized blockchain?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a tension,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about progressive decentralization. There\u2019s nothing wrong with having an entity that is organized in one way that is trying to build something that is organized in a different way.\u201d\n\nLubin explains that the products ConsenSys is building need to achieve \u201cproduct-market fit; otherwise, they\u2019re kind of useless, and so bringing something forth, wholly and perfectly decentralized, is very difficult \u2014 it may be impossible.\u201d\n\nConsenSys plays a big role in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nConsenSys\u2019 most crucial infrastructure is called Infura, which offers Ethereum nodes as a service, making it easier for developers and users to connect to the network. It\u2019s basically an intermediary service between decentralized apps (DApps) and the blockchain that projects rely on to stay up and running.\n\nInfura probably works a little too well, as much of the Ethereum ecosystem is dependent on it. That means if Infura goes down, so too do half the network\u2019s projects, including Uniswap, Compound, MetaMask and Aave.\n\nIt\u2019s also a weak point for censorship and was criticized by some for complying with the Tornado Cash sanctions.\n\nDecentralizing Infura\n\nConsenSys has been working on a plan for some time now to \u201cdecentralize Infura.\u201d This will take the form of a marketplace of competing infrastructure providers that offer similar services, of which Infura itself would be one.\n\nLubin believes it\u2019s \u201cextremely important\u201d to make this happen.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been a proponent of decentralizing Infura since the start but more actively since five years ago,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve run into is that our ecosystem keeps having these wicked growth spurts,\u201d he continues, adding, \u201cIt was a sub-priority to keep things going rather than to start a parallel project to parallelize and decentralize \u2014 and that\u2019s going pretty well right now.\u201d\n\nThe protocol will either be called XFura or the Decentralized Infura Network Protocol.\n\n\u201cThe idea is that we believe now that we can take a high-performance product and federate the protocol, initially do a lot of hand-holding with other providers and then we situate Infura on the protocol,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty close. There are a bunch of very sophisticated partners that are working closely with EG [Galano], the lead of the project. I can\u2019t give you a date.\u201d\n\nAlthough Infura researcher Patrick McCorry went out of his way in an interview with Cointelegraph to say censorship resistance was not the point of decentralizing Infura, that\u2019s certainly one of the benefits.\n\n\n\nA decentralized network would enable DApps to pick and choose providers, allowing them potentially to get around censored protocols or addresses like Tornado Cash.\n\n\u201cI like the idea that there\u2019s optionality,\u201d says Lubin, carefully noting that different providers would operate in different nation-states and jurisdictions.\n\n\u201cI think that works well if there\u2019s a lot of them and if there\u2019s real choice, so you can always go to an uncensored service and be sure that they\u2019ve got enough validating power so that you\u2019re gonna get your transaction processed fairly rapidly.\u201d\n\nHowever, he adds it\u2019s equally possible that future aspects of the protocol are obfuscated so that no one actually knows what\u2019s in a packet or a transaction. He says he knows of people already \u201cworking on protocol enhancements\u201d who will make this happen, and the explosion of layer 2s and layer 3s makes it even more likely.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re already glommed in and impossible to read, then it\u2019s hard to imagine that regulators will either care that much or have the ability to do anything,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure [there is] lots of criminal activity that flows through AWS and Azure and every mail server everywhere. So, there\u2019s a level of infrastructure that you just can\u2019t halt because it\u2019s doing mostly useful activity.\u201d\n\nDecentralizing MetaMask\n\nThe other core bit of infrastructure provided by ConsenSys that underpins the entire Ethereum ecosystem is its ubiquitous browser wallet MetaMask. It\u2019s also being sort of decentralized by crowdsourcing the development of new features and the addition of new blockchains.\n\n\n\nCalled MetaMask Snaps, it\u2019ll turn the browser wallet into a permissionless platform for others to build on \u2014 one proof-of-concept Snap enables MetaMask to act as a Bitcoin wallet.\n\nJoe Lubin has arguably made a bigger contribution to Ethereum than any other co-founder apart from Vitalik Buterin.\n\n\u201cThe MetaMask Grants DAO [decentralized autonomous organization] will get increasingly decentralized and will incentivize people to build cool things, to start companies that permissionlessly innovate that we have nothing to do with,\u201d says Lubin.\n\nHe explains that over the years, MetaMask was approached by numerous blockchains looking for support, but after they\u2019d crunched the numbers, there wasn\u2019t enough activity to justify splitting its focus from Ethereum. Snaps, though, will open the doors to everyone.\n\nCrypto regulations\n\nLubin is unconcerned about the possibility of Ethereum being declared a security, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s as likely and would have the same impact as if Uber was made illegal.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThere would be tremendous outcry from not just the crypto community but different politicians, certain regulators.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a sense of frustration from Lubin that this ground even needs to be covered again, saying that ConsenSys has been through all of this in discussions with the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission over many years.\n\n\u201cWe went in there on a voluntary basis five years ago or something like that, when they\u2019re just trying to wrap their heads around what tokens were,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey thought back then that everything was a security; we think [we] helped them significantly understand that lots of tokens are not securities and then they went away, and Gary and his team now think almost everything\u2019s a security.\u201d\n\nBut he believes that the renewed focus on regulations in the wake of the FTX and stablecoin collapses will ultimately be a good thing.\n\n\u201cWe now have the world\u2019s attention, and smart people who care will prevail because it just makes sense,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd sure, there will be people with agendas who don\u2019t want to see it that way. Maybe the banking lobby will help them not see it that way. But in terms of finally paying a lot of attention to trying to regulate an important space, I do believe that clear heads will think through this and that people will start to understand the benefits of decentralization and make good regulation for CeFi [centralized finance] and no regulation for tech, crypto.\u201d\n\nCrisis equals opportunity\n\nIn fact, Lubin is remarkably philosophical and sanguine about all the regulatory, game theory and technological challenges facing Ethereum. For example, he concedes centralization of staking on platforms like Lido could become a concern, but because progressive decentralization is baked into the nature of the ecosystem, it won\u2019t be a problem for long.\n\n\u201cThings don\u2019t start very decentralized,\u201d he says. \u201cThese are still pretty new innovations, and our ecosystem is pretty exacting. If you want to be in the Ethereum ecosystem proper, then you\u2019re not going to want to try to dominate something, you\u2019re not going to want to operate centralized for very long. The ecosystem will identify that as problematic and come up with solutions for it, which is great.\u201d\n\nIn Lubin\u2019s world view, problems are just short-term issues you deal with as part of the process of making the project better.\n\n\u201cI see things as processes. I hope we run into lots of complications in the near term, and all the way through, because every complication just points out how we can build a more robust platform and a more decentralized platform. Yes, hopefully, we\u2019ll run into lots of difficult problems.\u201d\n\n\u201cLots of smart people have good solutions that are being built.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlso read: Ethereum is eating the world \u2014 \u2018You only need one internet\u2019\n\nThe future of Ethereum\n\nThe big question is, where does he see Ethereum heading? Does he believe the world\u2019s entire financial system could end up running on Ethereum using ZK-Rollups?\n\nLubin says the founding conception of Ethereum was that it would become a \u201cworld computer,\u201d and he suggests that was still in the cards.\n\n\u201cI think several of us thought early on that we were building the Star Trek computer essentially,\u201d he says, explaining it handled pretty much anything and everything.\n\n\u201cAnd so, I think that decentralized protocols will be the underlying trust foundation for lots of heterogeneous architectures. So, it\u2019s possible that Ethereum will scale sufficiently so that we can have one trust foundation and then build lots of layer 2s and layer 3s and up.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere have been many computer revolutions for the last 200 and something years and this is another one.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, the answer\u2019s yes. And the answer will take time to unfold. It would be impossible to rearchitect the global economy or global financial system in a short period of time.\u201d"

        "title": "How to Unwrap Ethereum? - Watcher Guru",
        "content": "The Ethereum network has made the switch from proof-of-work mining to proof-of-stake mining. The transition was completed successfully on September 15, 2022. Additionally, the blockchain went through some major changes as the miners were replaced by validators.\n\nRecently, the much-awaited Shapella upgrade went live, allowing these stakers to withdraw their staked ETH. However, ETH is the second-largest cryptocurrency and was created way back before the emergence of dApps.\n\nAlso read: How To Change Slippage Tolerance on PancakeSwap?\n\nThen the real question emerges as to what it is and why it exists. Wrapped Ether was created to give Ethereum-based decentralized applications (dApps) a more standardized approach to interface with Ether, the network\u2019s native coin.\n\nWhat is Wrapped Ethereum (wETH)?\n\nwETH is just Ether wrapped in a smart contract to provide it with a standardized ERC-20 interface, allowing it to be exchanged and utilized within decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and other Ethereum-based services.\n\nGiven that Ether lacked the most widely used standard for tokens, the ERC-20 interface, it was necessary to create wETH. The process of wrapping ether includes moving the ETH to a smart contract. wETH will then be generated in return for this process. Additionally, this is to ensure that there is a reserve backing every wETH.\n\nAlso read: Is MetaMask Safe (2023)?\n\nBefore we look into how to unwrap Ethereum, let us look at how we can wrap it in just a few simple steps.\n\nHow to wrap Ether?\n\nThere are different ways to wrap Ethereum. One method involves the swapping of ETH for wETH through a cryptocurrency exchange. Another common method is the use of a smart contract. Let us look at the step-by-step guide on how to wrap ETH using OpenSea and MetaMask.\n\nGo to OpenSea and connect your MetaMask wallet.\n\nClick on the \u201cWallet\u201d option. You will see three dots in the top-right corner. Click on the three dots next to Ethereum.\n\nClick on \u201cWrap\u201d from the drop-down menu.\n\nEnter the amount and click on \u201cWrap ETH.\u201d\n\nOnce it is done, confirm the MetaMask pop-up for the transaction to be complete.\n\nThat\u2019s it. You will receive wETH which will shine brightly in pink.\n\nNow that we have covered how to wrap Ether, let us look at how to unwrap Ether using MetaMask and OpenSea.\n\nAlso read: How to Buy Crypto with Western Union\n\nHow to unwrap Ethereum?\n\nUnwrapping Ethereum is also a straightforward process. It works similarly to how you convert ETH to wETH. Let us look at the steps below."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBarry Silbert, the founder and CEO of Digital Currency Group (DCG), has sold some of his Grayscale Ethereum Classic Trust (ETCG) shares, according to a recent SEC filing.\n\nDCG is one of the largest crypto conglomerates on the market and counts Grayscale Investments, the trust\u2019s issuer, as one of its subsidiaries.\n\nAccording to the filing, Silbert has moved to liquidate nearly 120,000 ETCG shares, worth an aggregate market value of approximately $755,295 dollars. This also appears to be the first time Silbert has sold any of his ETCG shares, according to SEC filings.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe ETCG fund, which launched in 2017, allows investors to gain exposure to Ethereum Classic (ETC) through a brokerage account. ETC and Ethereum (ETH) used to be the same thing until 2016, when developers implemented a hard fork of the network to return millions worth of stolen funds to investors after a hack. The fork was notably backed by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin.\n\nThe ETCG sale represents a small portion of the fund\u2019s $225 million assets under management and 14 million outstanding shares\u2014of which Silbert is a 10% shareholder. He\u2019s also listed as one of the fund\u2019s directors.\n\nThe sale was brokered by New York-based firm Cannacord Genuity on April 28 on the OTCQX, the highest tier of over-the-counter (OTC) market for trading securities, according to the SEC filing.\n\nSilbert\u2019s shares were originally purchased during two privately negotiated transactions over the 2017-2018 period. So far, he hasn\u2019t made any official comments on the recent transaction.\n\nIt\u2019s a somewhat surprising development to see the crypto permabull selling his ETCG shares. Silbert has been in the crosshairs over the past months, due to a $630 million dollar debt DCG-owned lending desk Genesis owes to Gemini, a crypto exchange and custodian owned by the Winklevoss twins.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEarlier this week, the companies announced they had entered into a 30-day mediation process to settle the outstanding loan balance. \u201cIf DCG is unable to pay and/or restructure its debt, DCG risks defaulting on its obligations,\u201d Gemini said in a statement."

        "content": "The core feature of the Dencun upgrade is EIP-4844, or Proto-Danksharding, which will make Layer 2 transactions significantly cheaper.\n\nDencun will be the next major network upgrade after Shapella, and has the potential to lower transaction costs on Ethereum.\n\nIn a blog post published this week, Ethereum core developer Tim Beiko revealed the next set of major Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIP) that have been tentatively included in the Dencun upgrade.\n\nDencun, a term coined by a combination of the star Deneb and Mexican city Cancun, follows a similar naming convention to Shapella, which was named after the Chinese city Shanghai and northern-constellation star Capella.\n\nThe upgrade will focus on bringing improvements and changes to Ethereum\u2019s execution layer through four EIPs that have been decided upon so far. Just like most of the attention in the Shapella upgrade was centered around EIP-4895, which enabled validator withdrawals from the Beacon Chain, the focus of this upgrade will likely be EIP-4844, otherwise known as \u201cProto-Danksharding\u201d or \u201cThe Surge.\u201d\n\nThis EIP will introduce temporary \u201cdata blobs\u201d to the Ethereum network, which Layer 2 networks can use to post the transaction/proof data currently stored elsewhere. The fact that blobs are store ephemerally means that gas costs will be significantly lower, which will lead to much cheaper Layer 2 transactions, explained Beiko.\n\n\u201cWhile not quite as big as The Merge, EIP-4844 is a significant change to Ethereum: it introduces a whole new data layer to the network, which both the current consensus and execution layers must interact with,\u201d he said.\n\nIntroducing EIP-4844 will also mean there is less room for other changes to the network, but developers have still included three other EIPs alongside it. These include EIP-1153, which improves blockspace availability, EIP-6475, that makes transaction formats forward-compatible, and EIP-6780, which deactivates the code used to terminate a smart contract.\n\nBeiko did not specify when this upgrade would be deployed, but said that the next update on Dencun\u2019s finalized scope would likely be the first testnet fork announcement."

        "content": "Over US$635 million of Ethereum non-fungible token sales in April were wash trades, which made up nearly 60% of all NFT trades on the blockchain for the month, according to new data from CryptoSlam,\n\nThe new data also revealed wash trading activities on Solana, Binance, Polygon, Cardano, Flow and Arbitrum, which had been largely unknown until now.\n\nWash trades refer to an investor acting as both the buyer and seller of a financial instrument to generate misleading trading volume and potentially manipulate prices. The practice is illegal in U.S. securities markets.\n\nBlur marketplace\u2019s point farming is the primary driver of Ethereum NFT wash trades, leading to US$3.4 billion worth of NFT trades being flagged as wash sales so far this year. Blur traders\u2019 bids and listings are incentivized by the marketplace\u2019s points \u2014 the platform\u2019s loyalty system \u2014 fueling some traders\u2019 reliance on bulk wash sales to maximize points, which is subsequently rewarded in the form of Blur\u2019s utility token, $BLUR.\n\nIn March, over US$1.1 billion, or 66% of all NFT sales on Ethereum, were wash trades. However, the single highest wash trading day occurred on Feb. 20, days after the launch of $BLUR. Traders aggressively farmed points to earn more $BLUR token rewards, resulting in over 85% of the day\u2019s sales volume, valued at US$295 million, being flagged as wash trades.\n\nMonthly sales and wash transactions on Ethereum in 2023\n\nFebruary, March, and April stand out as high points for wash trading on Ethereum, with a combined total value of over US$3.135 billion. At the peak of wash trading on March 4, 2023, daily NFT wash trades transactions on Ethereum reached 49,806 compared to 2,743 on April 16, 2022, the apex of $LOOKS token farming.\n\nSimilar to $BLUR token farming in 2023, traders in early 2022 were farming $LOOKS tokens at the then-new LooksRare marketplace. CryptoSlam\u2019s data has revealed $LOOKS farming as the driving factor behind US$819 million in wash sales that took place on Jan. 19, 2022, the most successful day for wash trading ever. Over US$18 billion in wash trades were flagged in January and February 2022.\n\nThough the value of wash trading sales has decreased since last year, the number of transactions has grown nearly 20x, CryptoSlam data shows.\n\nThe top two wash-traded collections across all blockchains are Ethereum\u2019s Terraforms and Meebits, with US$11.5 billion and US$9 billion in flagged trades, respectively. Standout NFTs from these collections include Terraforms #4206, which has been wash traded for 86,905.12 ETH (US$242.97 million), and Meebit #13824 for 29,453.9 ETH (US$99. 4 million).\n\nMeebit #13824 (left) and Terraform #4206 (right).\n\nHighlighting the extent of traders\u2019 practices, CryptoSlam has uncovered US$31 billion in all-time wash trade sales volume on Ethereum, totaling 41% of the blockchain\u2019s US$74 billion in sales. An additional US$330 million in wash trades is reflected across the other top 10 NFT blockchains, making up a much smaller percentage of their all-time sales.\n\nWash trading is expected to continue and possibly increase on Ethereum as traders use liquidity-providing tools like BenDAO, NFTfi and Blur\u2019s new Blend lending protocol to pursue more platform rewards in Blur\u2019s Season 2.\n\n1/ Introducing Blend: the Peer-to-Peer Perpetual Lending Protocol for NFTs.\n\n\n\nBuilt in collaboration with @danrobinson and @transmissions11 at @paradigm, Blend enables 10x higher yield opportunities than current DeFi protocols and unlocks greater liquidity for NFTs.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s how \ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/uOFC6i3LSq \u2014 Blur (@blur_io) May 1, 2023\n\nWhile Ethereum owns the bulk of global wash sales due to $LOOKS and $BLUR token farming, it is expected to continue on other chains with a growing number of marketplaces adopting reward incentives.\n\n(Update: edits third paragraph to clarify wash trading defintion)"

        "content": "Cardano released its Layer-2 scalability solution, Hydra.\n\nHydra introduces a novel scaling solution that challenges Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others.\n\nAccording to Charles Hoskinson, Cardano\u2019s new solution could make it the fastest, most scalable network.\n\nCardano has long been vying for a spot among the top cryptocurrency projects. Now, with its scalability solution Hydra up and running, it has solidified its position as a major player in the industry, standing alongside its more established peers, Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nHydra, the Layer-2 solution from the Proof of Stake (POS) Chain, is one of the most highly anticipated upgrades. Now that it is here, people are excited to see it deliver Cardano\u2019s promise of being the fastest and most scalable payment network in the world, challenging the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nWhat Is Hydra?\n\nThe Hydra Head Protocol or Hydra is Cardano\u2019s open-source Layer-2 scalability solution that, according to Charles Hoskinson, would make Cardano the fastest payment network in the world.\n\nAnnounced in September 2019, after much anticipation, delays, and hurdles, Hydra finally made it to the Cardano main chain in May 2023, thanks to engineers from the Cardano Foundation and IOHK.\n\nHydra is an isomorphic scaling solution. This means it replicates Cardano\u2019s functionality and security guarantees on an off-chain ledger network while maintaining communication between the two layers.\n\nCardano Hydra use case. Source: Hydra Head Protocol.\n\nIt operates almost similarly to state-channel solutions such as Bitcoin\u2019s Lightning Network and Ethereum\u2019s Raiden Network. Users can securely and instantly perform transactions on their private networks, in this case, Hydra heads, and settle the result on the main chain, enabling faster and cheaper transactions while keeping the integrity and security of the network.\n\nWhat\u2019s unique about Hydra is that off-chain ledgers through Head nodes can act as special dApps for developers who look to scale their apps. With Hydra, developers can independently run on-chain scripts or software stack on their private nodes and securely publish the result on the main chain instantly and at a low price.\n\nHydra brings a solid solution, allowing Cardano to compete with Ethereum and Bitcoin.\n\nIn Contrast with Other Scalability Solutions\n\nBoth Bitcoin and Ethereum have long established themselves in the cryptocurrency world, with the latter powering a myriad of Layer-2 protocols. Additionally, Ethereum\u2019s sharding and Bitcoin\u2019s lightning network are some of the best solutions in the space, earning the networks a collective market cap of $807 billion.\n\nAlthough Cardano is often compared with Bitcoin and Ethereum, its string of delays and issues drew much criticism from the community, leading to slow growth evident with its $13 billion market cap. However, with Hydra in the mix, it can finally sit at the table with its solution.\n\nEthereum, Cardano, and Bitcoin Compared\n\nWhile Ethereum Sharding, Bitcoin Lightning Network, and Cardano\u2019s Hydra solution may come from the same family or operate similarly, comparing or saying one is better wouldn\u2019t be fair. Each scalability solution has its pros and cons and addresses different challenges.\n\nSharding is a Layer-1 solution that focuses on increasing the network\u2019s capacity and increasing the overall transaction throughput of the network. It breaks the blockchain into shards that process transactions parallel to the main chain.\n\nHowever, according to Charles Hoskinson, Sharding is \u201cvery complex.\u201d Because of this complexity, network security and performance drastically defer because it operates on the main chain. Additionally, it requires a lot of resources and can be expensive to implement.\n\nHydra, on the other hand, creates an independent off-chain ledger network that replicates the security and functionality of the Cardano chain, allowing it to maintain both security and performance without congesting the main chain. It doesn\u2019t rely on soft or hard forks, making it inexpensive and straightforward to implement.\n\nConversely, Bitcoin Lightning Network is a Layer-2 solution on top of Bitcoin, which uses bi-directional off-chain payment channels between users, enabling fast, cheap, and scalable transactions.\n\nHowever, because it uses payment channels, it only supports asset transfer, unlike Hydra, which allows developers to run scripts and elaborate transactions instantly off-chain as it would on the main chain.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nAn Ethereum founder accused Cardano Founder of contributing nothing to Ethereum.\n\nMany competitors called Cardano\u2019s EUTXO design a security flaw; Hoskin replied that the model made it more secure.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nCardano\u2019s Hydra solution brings competition to the space. The better the competition, the better the solutions, leading to greater adoption. Cardano\u2019s new protocol could significantly elevate the network\u2019s status in the cryptocurrency industry and attract more developers to build apps on the network.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat is Hydra on Cardano? Hydra is Cardano\u2019s Layer-2 scaling solution that creates independent off-chain ledgers with functionality, features, and security similar to the Cardano main chain. Is Hydra built on Cardano? Yes, Hydra is built on Cardano. It is a Layer-2 scaling solution that processes transactions on an off-chain ledger and settles the result on the main chain. Is Hydra a Layer-2? Yes, Hydra is a Layer-2 solution on Cardano. It operates on top of Cardano to maximize the throughput and functionality of the underlying blockchain. Is Cardano Layer-1 or Layer-2? In blockchain-speak, Layer-1 is the base blockchain where all network activity and transactions are validated and finalized. Cardano is Layer-1.\n\nRead about other blockchains\u2019 developments:\n\nHow Flare\u2019s New Blockchain APIs on Google Cloud Impact Web3\n\nRead what Charles Hoskinson has to say:\n\nCardano Founder Charles Hoskinson Responds to Jab by Ethereum Co-Founder"

This differs from other AMM designs, where assets are swapped at the price determined by the AMM curve.\n\nWhen the price of the collateral is higher, all of the user\u2019s deposits will be in the deposited collateral, but as the price of the collateral goes lower, the oracle will convert the deposits to crvUSD.\n\nCurve deployed its initial crvUSD smart contracts yesterday, but a minor issue where fees were not flowing to the project\u2019s DAO was noted by its team, Blockworks Research Senior Analyst Dan Smith said.\n\nThis protocol resolved this minor issue after Curve Finance redeployed an updated smart contract this morning.\n\nEven though information on Etherscan shows that Curve minted an initial 20 million crvUSD, Smith notes that this was part of the deployment process and the tokens themselves did not leave the system.\n\n\u201ccrvUSD only becomes circulating after it has been borrowed by an end user,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the time of writing, Michael Egorov, the founder and CEO of Curve Finance, has the only open loan of $1.05 million.\n\nThe final step, Smith noted, will be to push the user interface onto the Curve website.\n\n\u201cWith two major releases during the depths of the bear market (crvUSD and upgraded tri crypto contracts), Curve is well positioned for success when liquidity and volume returns,\u201d Smith said.\n\n\u201cCurve now controls multiple parts of [the] DeFi stack with a DEX, lending market, and stablecoin.\u201d\n\nTo learn more about Curve Finance and its Q1 performance, check out this detailed report by Blockworks Research.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "The total number of failed Ethereum transactions exceeded 500,000.\n\nETH\u2019s price craters as network activity experienced a dip.\n\nAccording to data from CryptoQuant, there was a significant surge in the total number of failed Ethereum[ETH] transactions, reaching over 500,000 as of 2 May.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nTaking a cue from ETH\u2019s historical performance, pseudonymous CryptoQuant Analyst MACD, found an interesting fact. Whenever the total count of failed ETH transactions exceeded 200,000, it indicated \u201cmarket overheating\u201d and was often followed by price corrections.\n\n\u201cIn the past, when Ethereum\u2019s transaction failures rise above 200,000, it shows a market overheating and has often seen a price correction.\u201d\n\nTo brace for a price correction or not?\n\nIn the last month, ETH\u2019s price oscillated between $2100 and $1800. At press time, the leading altcoin exchanged hands at $1,869, with a 2% price rally within the past 24 hours, data from CoinMarketCap showed.\n\nOn-chain assessment of ETH\u2019s performance revealed a decline in network activity since 14 April. According to Santiment, the count of daily active addresses that have since traded the alt fell by 41%.\n\nAdditionally, the number of new addresses created daily on the ETH network has plummeted as well. Information from the on-chain data provider revealed the creation of 12,492 new addresses on the ETH network on 1 May. This represented an 86% drop from the 91,560 new addresses created on 14 April.\n\nWith the continued decline in the count of new and active addresses trading ETH, the coin\u2019s value fell from $2100 on 14 April to $1,869 at press time.\n\nIn addition to a fall in its network activity, ETH\u2019s funding rates fell to a one-month low of -0.013 on 3 May. When a crypto asset records negative funding rates, it means that most traders in the market are taking short positions or betting against the asset.\n\nAs a result, it is often taken as an indicator of bearish sentiment and sometimes precipitates a decline in an asset\u2019s value.\n\nFurthermore, as ETH\u2019s price fell since mid-April, holders of 1000 to 100,000 ETH coins gradually distributed their ETH holdings, contributing to the decline in value, per data from Santiment.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nInterestingly, bigger whales, that hold between 100,000 to 10,000,000 ETH coins, increased their holdings during the same period. However, with bearish sentiments still lingering in the market, this has failed to result in any significant price rally.\n\nAt press time, ETH\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) were positioned beneath their respective neutral spots, in downtrend positions. This indicated waning buying pressure and highlighted the need for new demand to drive up the alt\u2019s value."

Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum\u2019s gas fees have surged above a one-year high as the demand for trading the PEPE meme coin continues to soar.\n\nThe average cost of a single transaction on Ethereum jumped above $15.82 on May 4.\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s mean transaction fees have reached much higher levels of between $50 to $70 in 2021, things have been quiet since the market crashed in May 2022.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDaily median gas price. Source: Etherscan .\n\nIt\u2019s likely that excitement around meme coins, specifically the newly-launched PEPE, is responsible for the revival in gas fees.\n\nIn the last 24 hours, the trading volume for PEPE surpassed $150 million on Uniswap, higher than Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) and USDT stablecoin volumes.\n\nThe PEPE token also entered the top 100 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization on May 1, obtaining a valuation of over $500 million. The token has continued to surge since then, last trading at a market value of $879 million.\n\nFollowing the success of PEPE coin, numerous copycats have also emerged representing different internet memes.\n\nData from crypto analytics firm Nansen shows that the most active smart contracts on Ethereum are currently Uniswap trading pools for meme coins such as SPONGE, TURBO, BOB, and TRBNR.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMost used DeFi contracts on Ethereum on May 5, 2023. Source: Nansen\n\nThe increased gas fees witnessed 9,392 in ETH burned over the last 24 hours, at par with one-year high levels.\n\nEthereum executed a hard fork in 2021 which meant that a portion of all Ethereum transactions were destroyed. Thus, as activity increases on the network, more ETH is destroyed.\n\nThe rise in Ethereum\u2019s transaction fees has led to a rise in gas fees for Layer-2 transactions as well.\n\nAre Ethereum scaling solutions helping?\n\nThe gas fees for layer-2 transactions have also surged with mainnet fees as related data for layer-2 transactions are also posted in layer-1 blocks for security.\n\nThere are two kinds of layer-2 scaling solutions: zero-knowledge proofs and optimistic. Both use another technology called rollups, which batch transactions off of the mainnet into a single, smaller transaction before settling on the mainnet.\n\nNotably, zero-knowledge proof (ZK)-based rollups were hit relatively worse than optimistic rollups. The fees for swapping tokens on ZK-based scaling solutions like Polygon zkEVM, Starknet, and zkSync Era mainnet surged between $2 to $11.\n\nA zkSync Discord community member noted they had to pay $11 swap ETH to USDC, noting in amazement that \u201cIs it gonna cost that much?\u201d\n\nAnother user complained about $30 in fees for DeFi deposits on zkSync.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n$30 gas fee on Layer 2 $ZKS $ZKSYNC @zksync\n\nI don't understand, I thought layer 2 were made to reduce gas fees \ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31 pic.twitter.com/Uz6k5p4bC5 \u2014 Kool Crypto \u2699\ufe0f\ud83d\udef8 (@healthymofin) May 5, 2023\n\nAccording to L2 Fees data, the gas fees for sending ETH on Arbitrum One and Optimism, both of which are Optimistic rollup solutions, are between $0.2 to $0.6 for swap tokens, which is around ten times higher than the mean value."

        "content": "A popular crypto strategist is updating his outlook on Bitcoin (BTC) and one Ethereum (ETH) rival as he warns memecoins are likely to collapse.\n\nPseudonymous analyst Altcoin Sherpa tells his 195,100 Twitter followers that Bitcoin continues to lack a clear upward or downward trend and remains trading sideways.\n\nAccording to his chart, Sherpa says Bitcoin has been chopping around in the $25,000 to $30,000 range for the past 48 days. The previous range Bitcoin chopped around in was between about $19,500 and $25,000 and that lasted 57 days.\n\n\u201cBTC: The problem for most traders the last six months is that there hasn\u2019t been a continuous trending environment like in 2020 and 2021 (for alts). Lots of chop overall and just a few trending weeks followed by more chop. Know yourself and where to trade.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is trading for $29,305 at time of writing, up 1.5% during the past 24 hours.\n\nAlso on the trader\u2019s radar is the new layer-1 blockchain Sui Network (SUI).\n\nBased on Fibonacci retracement levels, a method of technical analysis for determining an asset\u2019s support and resistance levels, Sherpa believes SUI will revisit a lower range of $1.29. However, he warns if Bitcoin dips, SUI could drop down to $1.24.\n\n\u201cSUI: Expecting range lows to come eventually around $1.29, but it\u2019s going way lower if Bitcoin shits the bed IMO (In my opinion). Still, it looks like somewhat accumulation phase as long as BTC is stable.\u201d\n\nSui Network is worth $1.31 at time of writing, down 1.9% during the past 24 hours.\n\nNext, the trader weighs in on skyrocketing Pepe (PEPE), a memecoin that launched last month. He warns Pepe and other meme tokens are likely going to collapse.\n\n\u201cPEPE derivatives are going to moon, aka all the other memecoins right now. But be warned; these are all going to go to $0 and will be short lived. Full on casino over the next few weeks IMO (in my opinion), same story as it always is.\u201d\n\nLastly, Altcoin Sherpa looks at layer-2 scaling solution Arbitrum (ARB).\n\nHe predicts Aribitrum will dip lower by looking at several Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) and the Fibonacci retracement levels. Traders look at the EMA to determine whether an asset\u2019s price is in a downtrend. If the price is below the EMA, then the asset is likely going to remain bearish.\n\n\u201cARB: Haven\u2019t paid as much attention to this one lately, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it falls through and goes to the $1.15-$1.20 area again. This is still a great chain but new flavor of the month (SUI) + memecoin madness (PEPE) are sucking liquidity out of \u2018normal\u2019 coins.\u201d\n\nArbitrum is worth $1.36 at time of writing, up 3% during the past 24 hours.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Ethereum Median Gas Fee Hit 12-Month High Amid Memecoin Resurgence - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "In recent weeks, the Ethereum community has been grappling with an issue causing concern for many users \u2013 the rapidly increasing gas consumption on the network.\n\nGas fees are charged for processing transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, and they have been rising at an alarming rate.\n\nEthereum Gas Fee Hits 12-Month High\n\nAccording to data from Dune, shared by data scientist Hildobby, the median price of ETH gas, measured in gwei and averaged over seven days, has surged to 87, a level not seen in the past 12 months \u2013 since May 2022. The average transaction fee now hovers around $50, a significant increase from just a few months ago when it was less than $10.\n\nThe high gas fees have caused frustration among users, who find it increasingly expensive to perform even simple transactions on the network. Many small-scale users, such as decentralized application (dApp) developers, traders, and retail investors, are finding it difficult to participate in the Ethereum ecosystem due to the high cost of gas fees.\n\ntry to buy a ~$20 NFT on eth, and the gas is ~$40.\n\nsome ppl say the infra operators deserve to be paid. sure, but imaging paying visa $40 fee for buying a $20 digital good.. infra should be affordable. pic.twitter.com/5L4SYjT5af \u2014 0xMQQ (@0xMQQ) April 18, 2023\n\nMemecoins Return\n\nThe issue is primarily due to the increasing demand for processing transactions on the network, as memecoins return to the market after being silent for almost two years. Over the past few weeks, memecoin trading has gained momentum, with most of the trading activities taking place on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nOne such memecoin is PEPE, whose market cap jumped by more than 100x within the last two weeks after its launch in mid-April. Other memecoins that have recorded significant hype over the past few weeks include ArbDogeAI, WOJAK, and SHIBAI.\n\nAnother possible reason for the high ETH gas fee is the resurgence in NFT trading on the Ethereum blockchain. While such volumes declined significantly in April, perhaps due to the rebirth of memecoins, reports revealed that they reached $4.7 billion in Q1, 2023, a 137% from the previous year.\n\nFurthermore, data from the blockchain intelligence platform Glassnode revealed that gas consumption from NFT-related activities on Ethereum surged by 94% between January and February.\n\nThe Way Forward\n\nThe Ethereum community is actively working on solutions to address the issue, including implementing Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844. This proposal aims to reduce gas fees and transaction throughput by introducing a new type of transaction that accepts \u201cblobs\u201d of data.\n\nIn the meantime, users have been forced to adjust their strategies, with some opting to perform transactions during off-peak hours when gas fees are typically lower. Others have been switching to alternative blockchain networks that offer lower fees or opting for layer 2 scaling solutions such as Polygon to reduce the cost of transactions."

        "content": "The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is designed as the runtime environment for Ethereum smart contracts. EVM functions similarly to a decentralized computer with millions of executable projects. It serves as the virtual machine that supports Ethereum\u2019s whole operating system and is responsible for the execution and deployment of smart contracts.\n\nThe EVM lies atop the hardware and node network layers of Ethereum. It is Turing-complete and can therefore execute any program written in any programming language, letting developers write smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps) for the emerging Web3 area with ease.\n\nIts primary function is to compute the network\u2019s status and to execute and compile different types of smart contract code into a human-readable format known as \u201cBytecode.\u201d This enables Ethereum nodes to identify smart contracts deployed on EVM-compatible chains such as Polygon or Avalanche and enables developers to easily move their Dapps or tokens from Ethereum to other EVM-compatible chains. These essential features of EVM make it one of the most powerful virtual computers currently available.\n\nHow Does It Work?\n\nThe Ethereum Network, conceived in 2013 by the programmer Vitalik Buterin, owes its phenomenal success as the blockchain of choice for DApp developers to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) that was created by Gavin Wood during his employment at Ethereum. EVM is a particular state machine that operates constantly and whose immutable actions define the state of each block in the Ethereum blockchain. It is written in C++ and uses the LLVM Project compiler.\n\nThe EVM not only governs what nodes can or cannot do to the distributed ledger maintained by the Ethereum blockchain but also defines the specific rules of changing state from block to block. This feature allows the smart contract functionality for which Ethereum has become renowned.\n\nThe EVM is a stack-based virtual machine, which means that it operates on a last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure known as a stack with a depth of 1024 items, each of which is a 256-bit word. The 256-bit word size of the EVM makes native hashing and elliptic curve operations possible, ensuring that only the rightful owners can use the funds. For each input it receives, the EVM generates an output that is deterministic and mathematically function-like in the most basic sense. This stack is used to hold and manipulate data during the execution of smart contracts. When a smart contract is executed on the EVM, the code is run through a series of operations that manipulate the stack.\n\nMoreover, the EVM supports a variety of programming languages, including Vyper and Solidity, with Solidity being the most widely used language for smart contract source code. These programming languages are applied to create smart contracts, which are then transformed into the bytecode required for the EVM. The on-chain bytecode, also known as the runtime bytecode, is subsequently turned into an opcode that the EVM computing engine interprets in order to carry out the specified activities."

The surge in registrations may be evidence that Bitcoin Ordinals NFT is becoming more accepted among BTC maximalists as they realize the potential for NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nThe explosion in numbers and daily enrollments is exciting news for the crypto industry and suggests that there is a growing demand for NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain. With the surge in interest in Bitcoin Ordinals NFT, we can expect to see more innovation and growth in the NFT market.\n\nBitcoin Ordinals NFTs are not only contributing to the growth of the NFT market but also to the overall Bitcoin network by incentivizing miners, prioritizing valuable transactions, and enhancing network security. While the high fees may put a higher price tag on transactions on the network, proponents of Ordinals believe that the benefits outweigh the costs and that it opens up new use cases for Bitcoin, bringing in liquidity, new users, and developers, ultimately making Bitcoin more valuable through better user experience and more use cases."

        "title": "How crypto traders can utilize MEV in blockchain transactions - Protos",
        "content": "Listen to this article.\n\nMaximum extractable value (MEV) refers to all of the money that can be extracted by reordering, viewing, adding, including, or excluding transactions within a block. The vast majority of MEV occurs via decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Uniswap.\n\nIn all financial markets, the order of transactions is one of the most important determinants of price \u2014 think quants who colocate nearby exchange servers with fiber optic cables to ensure their orders fill first.\n\nVery often, discussions of MEV include the parties responsible for confirming transactions for ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum, which can come with issues such as validators being complicit with trading bots. Digital asset market participants have other ways to extract MEV using the different types of maximum extractable value.\n\nHere are the four types of MEV:\n\nSovereign MEV\n\nBlockchain communities can attempt to control their own MEV through sovereign MEV, which refers to setting protocol rules for extracting MEV, allowing or disallowing certain tactics for MEV extraction, and specifying where MEV proceeds may accumulate.\n\nA protocol\u2019s community can decide who and what to prioritize via sovereign MEV practices, often with consequences for breaking these rules. With some blockchains with sovereign MEV rules, for example, an abusive validator might face penalties such as staking pool users moving to another staking platform or validator. Others allow the community to decide who gets the MEV or how MEV is generated.\n\nRead more: Ethereum tries to reduce MEV with blockers and rebates\n\nInternal MEV\n\nInternal MEV refers to MEV generated directly on an application-specific blockchain or \u2018appchain.\u2019 This form of MEV allows application developers to set rules that include the acceptable methods for capturing MEV. It can use atomic arbitrage, a trading strategy that places a buy order on one trading platform and a sell order of an equivalent quantity on another trading platform at the same time.\n\nCeFi-DeFi MEV\n\nCeFi-DeFi MEV uses a form of arbitrage that exploits the differences between centralized exchanges and decentralized finance apps. An asset\u2019s price tends to update on centralized exchanges before on-chain pools and DEX liquidity providers can reposition.\n\nCeFi-DeFi MEV is one of the largest generators of MEV due to activity from arbitrage traders.\n\nInterchain MEV\n\nInterchain MEV takes advantage of the idea that most blockchains operate in \u2018silos\u2019 that don\u2019t permit them to natively \u2018see\u2019 what\u2019s happening on other blockchains. For example, the Bitcoin network cannot (excepting the use of third-party oracles) \u2018see\u2019 transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nInterchain MEV allows traders who can analyze cross-blockchain data to profit from swapping assets across blockchains via bridges or DEXs. Interchain MEV and associated arbitrage tactics happen most often in cross-domain blockchains like Cosmos.\n\nMEV is unavoidable\n\nEven Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin has admitted that MEV will always exist in Ethereum. Validators can always select the transactions with higher fees \u2014 even if those transactions are from obvious front-running or sandwich attackers. MEV traders use a variation of arbitrage and other techniques to maximize profits.\n\nOn the bright side, developers can build ways to keep MEV under control by adding rules on who can get the rewards and how users can extract MEV from their blockchains through sovereign MEV practices.\n\nGot a tip?

Bitcoin (BTC) rose 2.44% to $29,152, whereas Ethereum (ETH) was above the $1,900 level. BTC volume in the last 24 hours stood at approximately $19.5 billion, rising 20.54% in the last 24 hours.\"Following the Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates by 25 basis points, Bitcoin is regaining its strength. The Fed indicated that this week's increase could be the last for the time being. At present, Bitcoin is being traded at the US$29,000 level and is gradually approaching its resistance levels of US$29,420 and US$30,000,\" Edul Patel, Co-founder and CEO at Mudrex, said.\u201cAs the upcoming US employment figures are scheduled to be released on Friday, investors and traders are keeping a watchful eye on them,\u201d Edul added.The global cryptocurrency market cap was trading higher around $1.20 trillion, rising 2% in the last 24 hours.The total volume in DeFi is currently 3,45 billion, 8.04% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume. The volume of all stablecoins was at $38.99 billion, which is 90.76% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume.The market cap of Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, was around $563 billion. Bitcoin\u2019s dominance is currently 47.13%, an increase of 0.21% over the day, according to CoinMarketCap.\"Bitcoin (BTC) rallied 2% overnight as the US Fed indicated that it may pause interest rate hikes in the future. Given concerns about the US banking crisis, investors are likely to move capital towards Gold and Bitcoin in the short term. BTC has to reclaim $30,000 to strengthen its 2023 rally,\" Vikram Subburaj, CEO of Giottus Crypto Platform, said.Sathvik Vishwanath, Co-Founder & CEO of Unocoin said that Bitcoin bounced back from the $28,100 level but faces strong resistance at the $29,295 level. \u201cA break above this level could lead to a target of $29,975 and eventually $30,000,\u201d he said.\"However, the candlestick patterns indicate bearish sentiment, while the RSI and MACD indicators indicate a possible downtrend.

        "content": "Summary:\n\nEtherscan data showed the average cost of Ethereum transactions rose as high as $15 on May 4, a 1-year high.\n\nGas fees on L2 networks also skyrocketed, particularly on chains built using zero-knowledge proofs like Polygon zkEVM and zkSync Era.\n\nCrypto participants believe the memecoin renaissance led by PEPE coin is the main reason behind expensive transaction costs on crypto\u2019s largest altcoin blockchain.\n\nGas fees on Ethereum flew to their highest level since 2022 in the middle of a memecoin renaissance championed by the \u201cPepe the frog\u201d themed altcoin, PEPE.\n\nThe cost of sending transactions rose as high as $15 on May 4, its highest point in over a year. Gas fees had previously stayed at lower levels in the months after Terra crashed and the crypto markets nosedived.\n\nPEPE Trading Propels Ethereum Gas Fees\n\nEthereum\u2019s ecosystem is no stranger to memecoin mania as tokens like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have drawn speculative traders before. It\u2019s unclear whether the PEPE token will last as long as these OG memecoins after hitting a $1 billion market cap, a topic that Binance weighed in on after listing PEPE for spot trading today.\n\nBinance paused PEPE deposits shortly after citing technical difficulties.\n\n#Binance has postponed the listing of $FLOKI and $PEPE until May 5, 2023, 18:00 UTC.\n\n\n\nTrading will start at 18:00 UTC, as opposed to the original start time of May 5, 16:00 UTC.\n\n\n\nPlease note that deposits for both PEPE and FLOKI will resume at 15:30 UTC.https://t.co/pJieemoTyP \u2014 Binance (@binance) May 5, 2023\n\nThere are also indicators pointing to PEPE as the reason behind Ethereum\u2019s pricey gas fees. PEPE holders traded $150 million in volume over the past 24 hours on the decentralized exchange Uniswap.\n\nIncreased interest in PEPE pushed the token into the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap. The token sits at #42 according to CoinMarketCap. Nansen data clocked several copycat tokens and increased trading activity tied to other memecoins on ETH\u2019s chain.\n\nHigh Gas Fees Rock L2 Networks Too\n\nLayer 2 networks designed to reduce transaction costs experienced high gas fees as network demand shot up. Fees on layer 2 scaling solutions built using zero-knowledge proofs like Polygon zkEVM and zkSync Era were significantly higher than L2\u2019s designed using optimistic rollups.\n\nPer L2 Fees data, the cost of a single transaction on zk rollups ranged between $2 to $11, rising as high as $30.\n\n$30 gas fee on Layer 2 $ZKS $ZKSYNC @zksync\n\nI don't understand, I thought layer 2 were made to reduce gas fees \ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31 pic.twitter.com/Uz6k5p4bC5 \u2014 Kool Crypto \u2699\ufe0f\ud83d\udef8 (@healthymofin) May 5, 2023\n\nUsers also flocked to Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible chains like BNB Chain as memecoin mania continued."

        "content": "Pepe Coin (PEPE) is the latest craze to grasp the crypto sector. The token has gained as much as 665% in the last week and 585% in 14 days. The asset has led to many investors bowing down in FOMO (fear of missing out) of what many think is the new memecoin king. However, a parallel development has taken place thanks to the craze around the frog-themed crypto project. Demand for Pepe Coin (PEPE) has caused a surge in Ethereum (ETH) gas fees. Gas fee on the popular network has reached one-year highs due to increased transactions to buy PEPE.\n\nOn May 4, the average cost of a single Ethereum transaction increased above $15.82. Although Ethereum\u2019s average transaction costs rose to between $50 and $70 in 2021, things have been relatively quiet since the market collapsed in May 2022.\n\nPEPE trade volume on Uniswap has topped $150 million over the past 24 hours, outpacing Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) and USDT stablecoin levels. On May 1, the PEPE token, with a market capitalization of nearly $500 million, also broke into the top 100 cryptocurrencies. The project is getting close to reaching a $1 billion market cap valuation.\n\nEthereum witnesses increased burns due to Pepe Coin\n\nDue to the higher gas prices, 9,392 ETH were burned during the last 24 hours, reaching a one-year high. In 2021, Ethereum underwent a hard fork, which leads to the burning of a portion of all Ethereum transactions. As a result, more ETH is destroyed on the network as activity rises. Moreover, gas fees for Layer-2 transactions have increased as a result of the increase in Ethereum\u2019s transaction fees.\n\nNonetheless, PEPE\u2019s rise, although meteoric, might be fueled by FOMO and the hopes of making a quick buck. The project does not have a lot of use cases, nor does it have a lot of liquidity. At press time, PEPE was trading at $0.00000208, up by 56% in the last 24 hours."

Still, both coins trade at far less than a penny, at press time.\n\nThe exchange has also provided another word of warning for prospective traders. \"Please note that, as of the time of writing, PEPE has no token utility or value support mechanism,\" reads the listing note on Binance. \"Also, there are signs that certain insiders or team members were able to buy 7% of the total token supply minutes after TGE [Token Generation Event].\"\n\nTrading for these two tokens kicks off today at 12pm ET. Interested parties can also trade both meme coins on margin against Tether's dollar-pegged stablecoin.\n\nWhat is PEPE?\n\nPEPE is the latest meme coin to soar in value and capture the crypto industry's attention. It's based on the artist Matt Furie's Pepe the Frog.\n\nOver the past week, the token has risen by a whopping 1,000%, per Coingecko. It's now the 45th-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, overtaking Fantom's native FTM token as well as The Sandbox's SAND token.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBesides its meteoric price rise, the flurry of speculation has also sent gas fees on Ethereum soaring to 1-year highs.\n\nDisclaimer The views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice."

        "content": "A record number of ETH has been burned in the past week.\n\nETH has never been as deflationary as now.\n\nETH deflation has been most likely supercharged by the meme coin mania led by PEPE.\n\nEthereum\u2019s native currency, ETH, is frequently called \u201cultrasound money\u201d due to its deflationary properties.\n\nIndeed, ETH has been consistently deflationary since Ethereum switched from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. And it\u2019s been extra deflationary in the past week or so, thanks to the ongoing meme coin mania led by PEPE.\n\nETH Hits Record Deflation\n\nEthereum\u2019s native currency ETH has been steadily going deflationary since merging the proof-of-work and proof-of-stake chains. However, in the past seven days alone it has burned around a significant portion of all ETH burned.\n\nAccording to data from Ultrasound Money, 33,200 ETH has been burned in the last week. This represents a whopping 21.5% of all ETH burned since the merge 232 days ago, which currently stands at 154,154 ETH. ETH has never been more deflationary than now.\n\nThe 33,200 burned ETH in the past week equals a 1.44% yearly deflation. If Ethereum still used proof-of-work, ETH\u2019s supply would grow by 2.09%.\n\nAt current daily run rate ETH would deflate 2% annually. Sure these levels aren\u2019t sustainable in a bear, but what happens when we get a bull? pic.twitter.com/3JW6tkpUUt \u2014 Hal Press (@NorthRockLP) May 5, 2023\n\nWhat\u2019s even more impressive about these numbers is that crypto is currently in a bear market and there\u2019s little economic activity going on.\n\nHowever, the meme coin mania that seemingly came out of nowhere is spurring the current ETH deflation.\n\nMeme Coins Supercharge ETH Burn\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing meme coins are great at doing post-merge, it\u2019s burning ETH and increasing its deflation.\n\nThe current meme coin mania has most likely supercharged the current ETH deflation. PEPE, a meme coin that surfaced just a few weeks ago, has pumped almost 3,000% and captured many hearts in the crypto space.\n\nPEPE is currently the 58th largest cryptocurrency with an almost $900 million market capitalization, according to data from CoinGecko.\n\nOther meme coins like WOJAK, CGPT, and WSB have also contributed to high gas fees and, in turn, larger ETH burn. In general, gas has increased significantly in the past few weeks, with people spending $20 and more on a single transaction.\n\nI downloaded 413,283 PEPE Uniswap transactions from @DuneAnalytics\n\n\n\nPEPE traders have burned ~5,300 ETH ($10M) in gas over the past 3 weeks \ud83e\udd2f\n\n\n\n1/\ud83e\uddf5 pic.twitter.com/9lZxGGjtT5 \u2014 Alex (@thiccythot_) May 5, 2023\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nThe meme mania may be unsustainable due to a weak economic environment and the ongoing bear market. Once the meme craze ends, ETH burn will significantly subside until the next bull market or another meme mania.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nETH being deflationary is one of the most attractive properties of the asset. Investors should consider following the deflation/inflation curve of ETH to position themselves better.\n\nRead more about recent PEPE price action:\n\nPEPE Rips 69% to Hit New All-Time as Whales Buy Millions\n\nRead more about a TikTok star joining a new Snapmuse.io creator platform:\n\nMajor TikTok Star Joins New Snapmuse.io Creator Platform on Polygon"

        "content": "The ongoing trading frenzy of memecoins like Pepe Coin (PEPE) has triggered an unwanted consequence for Bitcoin (BTC) \u2014 driving its transaction costs to multi-year highs.\n\nBitcoin transaction fees surged in early May, reaching their highest point over the past two years, according to data from Crypto Fees.\n\nOn May 3, the total amount of fees paid on the Bitcoin blockchain reached $3.5 million, jumping about 400% from late April. The average Bitcoin transaction fee reached as much as $7.2, according to YCharts.\n\nTotal Bitcoin transaction fees between May 2021 and May 2023. Source: CryptoFees\n\nThe latest increase in BTC transaction fees is primarily attributed to a surge in Bitcoin activity involving BRC-20 transactions. According to data from Galaxy Research, 50% of all Bitcoin transactions on May 2 were related to BRC-20 transactions.\n\nModeled after Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 token standard, BRC-20 is an experimental token standard allowing users to issue and transfer fungible tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. The standard was introduced in March 2023 by a pseudonymous on-chain analyst known as Domo.\n\nThe BRC-20 token standard has quickly become a major trend in the cryptocurrency industry, specifically amid the sharp growth of the PEPE memecoin. The token has rallied more than 600% over the past seven days, reaching its all-time high of $0.00000216 on May 5.\n\nPEPE 30-day price chart. Source: CoinGecko\n\nThe Bitcoin blockchain isn\u2019t the only blockchain affected by the ongoing memecoin hype. Gas fees on the Ethereum blockchain have also been skyrocketing to new multi-month highs recently.\n\nOn May 2, ETH transaction fees hit an aggregate amount of more than $19 million, a level not seen since May 2022, according to Crypto Fees. The Ethereum blockchain remains the most expensive network in terms of transaction fees at the time of writing.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin miners have earned $50B from BTC block rewards, fees since 2010\n\nDespite the latest spike in Bitcoin transaction fees, the current BTC transaction cost is still far from all-time high levels. The highest Bitcoin transaction fees were recorded in April 2021, when the average BTC transaction cost almost reached $70 amid a major decline in the Bitcoin network hash rate. The previous highest point in BTC transaction fees was in 2017, with transaction costs surging above $60.\n\nMagazine: Asia Express: Justin Sun\u2019s SUI-farming sins, PEPE\u2019s wild run, 3AC\u2019s oyster philosophy"

        "title": "Why Is Hydra Important for Cardano's Scalability? - DailyCoin",
        "content": "Cardano recently released its highly anticipated scaling solution Hydra.\n\nThe Layer-2 solution brings a novel infrastructure to the blockchain space that makes developing apps significantly scalable and efficient.\n\nHydra is still under development; however, it could propel Cardano\u2019s adoption when completed.\n\nCardano has been pushing to compete with Ethereum since its inception in 2017; however, it has long needed scalability and practicality. With Hydra in the mix, the Proof-of-Stake network may have found the key to unlock its potential as an \u201cEthereum killer.\u201d\n\nAfter much anticipation, Cardano\u2019s novel Layer-2 solution Hydra has made its way onto the main chain, bringing a plethora of essential features. The protocol expects to play a critical role in the network\u2019s adoption with its unparalleled speed and efficiency.\n\nHail Hydra\n\nCardano\u2019s new scaling solution Hydra is a force to be reckoned with. The protocol builds upon Bitcoin\u2019s iconic lightning network and adds heaps of functionality, security, and scalability.\n\nIt introduces a novel state channel framework that allows developers to instantly run scripts, complex transactions, and more off-chain while maintaining similar functionality and security to the Cardano main chain. This approach has been relatively challenging for most scaling solutions like sharding and zk-rollups, which struggle with performance and functionality.\n\nThanks to Hydra\u2019s isomorphism, the ability to replicate the functionality and security of Cardano\u2019s main chain, developers can now access a simple, low-cost, secure, and computationally inexpensive solution that enables them to scale up their decentralized protocols as if it were running on the Cardano main chain.\n\nWith Hydra, Web3 could soon welcome optimized and scalable dApps that rely on instant micropayments such as subscription-based content, in-app purchases, games, and more without congesting the main chain or raising network fees.\n\nLife Cycle of Hydra Head \u2013 Source: Hydra Head Protocol.\n\nHydra introduces a myriad of possibilities to Cardano. Another one of its many capabilities is customizability. Since Hydra nodes can be run independently, developers can customize their Hydra Heads to suit their dApps\u2019 needs.\n\nFor instance, decentralized exchanges can operate independently on Hydra Heads, handle millions of transactions and traffic, and run complex consensus and governance models, while maintaining users\u2019 security and network performance.\n\nHydra brings a solid solution with innovative features but is still under development. When completely developed, Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, shared that Hydra would make Cardano the fastest payment network in the world.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next for Cardano?\n\nThere\u2019s a lot in store for Hydra. It\u2019s an open-source project with hundreds of developers worldwide working to improve it. Initially, Hydra aimed to shift 99% of all Cardano traffic off-chain to Hydra Heads. However, the Cardano Foundation deemed it \u201ctoo ambitious\u201d and moved on to a new goal \u2013 bringing Dapps off-chain.\n\nThe first generation of Hydra is set on being the number one dApp on Cardano by all available metrics, such as Total Value Locked (TVL), traffic, volume, and more. According to DefiLlama, the top dApp by TVL is Minswap, with over $52 million locked. Cardano has a collective TVL of $154 million, and Ethereum has $29.42 billion at press time.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nCharles Hoskinson shared in an interview that Bitcoin lacks programmability and can only perform a limited set of tasks, such as pushing value around.\n\nCardano saw significant increases in financial and ecosystem metrics due to increased dApp transactions and the adoption of new stablecoins in Q1 2023.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nScalability is a big issue in the blockchain industry and one of the significant parts of the blockchain trilemma. Leading blockchains like Ethereum have struggled in the past with network congestion and high network fees, which can deter adoption.\n\nWith blockchain technology expected to take off, billions of users could likely adopt the technology, increasing the need for scaling solutions that can easily handle significant traffic, such as Hydra.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat does Hydra do for Cardano? Hydra, or Hydra Head Protocol, is a Layer-2 isomorphic scaling solution that creates a network of off-chain ledgers with the security guarantees and functionality of the Cardano main chain. How does Cardano solve scalability? Cardano solves scalability in several ways, including its Hydra Head Protocol. The Hydra Layer-2 solution allows developers and users to instantly process transactions, scripts, metadata, and more as if on the Cardano chain and then settle the final result on the main chain. How fast is Cardano Hydra? Hydra is rumored to have a whopping one million TPS; however, Charles Hoskinson dismissed those rumors and explained that Hydra works to achieve a limitless number. Currently, the speed at which Hydra operates is being tested. What happened to the Hydra crypto? Announced in 2019, after many delays, the first generation of Hydra made it to the Cardano mainnet in April 2023.\n\nAre whales migrating to Cardano?\n\nCardano Whales Amass $218M in ADA Tokens Over Two Weeks\n\nRead more about Hydra:\n\nHow Cardano\u2019s Hydra Layer-2 Is Challenging Bitcoin Lightning Network and Ethereum Sharding"

        "title": "Top 3 Cryptos for the Next Bull Market: Conflux (CFX), Ethereum (ETH), and Collateral Network (COLT) - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "In this article, we\u2019ll discuss the top 3 cryptos poised to lead the charge in the next bull market: Conflux (CFX), Ethereum (ETH), and Collateral Network (COLT). Among these projects, Collateral Network (COLT) is currently in the presale phase, offering early investors an opportunity to grab discounted COLT. Let\u2019s dive into each of these projects and discover how they could potentially benefit from the next bull market.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nCollateral Network (COLT)\n\nCollateral Network (COLT) is a groundbreaking peer-to-peer lending platform that empowers individuals to borrow money using real-world assets as collateral. What sets Collateral Network (COLT) apart from other lending platforms is their reliance on a blockchain system to execute transactions without intermediaries.\n\nCollateral Network (COLT) goes a step further by tokenizing the assets into NFTs. This process allows loan collateral to be divided into multiple segments, enabling lenders to finance any number of these fragments as they desire.\n\nCollateral Network (COLT)\u2019s approach not only expands the lending market to a broader array of potential lenders but also injects additional liquidity into the sector. As a result, Collateral Network (COLT) is poised to disrupt the trillion-dollar asset-backed lending industry.\n\nCOLT, the platform\u2019s utility token, grants holders access to NFT auctions, exclusive discounts, and the opportunity to stake for extra rewards. As Collateral Network (COLT) continues gaining momentum and onboarding new users, demand for the COLT token is expected to rise.\n\nCOLT tokens can be purchased for a current price of $0.014 during phase 2 of the presale. Since more than 30 million tokens have already been sold, analysts anticipate that Collateral Network (COLT) tokens could reach $0.35 per token by the end of 2023.\n\nConflux (CFX)\n\nConflux (CFX) is a third-generation blockchain network focused on scalability, security, and decentralization. Conflux (CFX) uses a new consensus algorithm called Tree Graph to make it more efficient than other blockchains without sacrificing any of its core principles.\n\nIn addition to its strong fundamentals, Conflux (CFX)\u2019s native token, CFX, has been performing exceptionally well on the market. The price of Conflux (CFX) has increased by more than 1,000% since the beginning of 2023.\n\nPart of this Conflux (CFX) price surge can be attributed to the fact that Hong Kong is opening back up to cryptocurrency. As a project based in China, Conflux (CFX) is particularly well-positioned to benefit from this new wave of crypto adoption.\n\nMoving forward, Conflux (CFX) is expected to build on its strong fundamentals and continue its impressive growth. Analysts anticipate that the price of Conflux (CFX) could surpass $0.80 by the end of 2023 \u2014 a potential 158%+ return.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nLast but certainly not least, is Ethereum (ETH). As the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Ethereum (ETH) is an obvious choice for any investor looking to diversify their crypto portfolio with a tried and true asset.\n\nWhat makes Ethereum (ETH) so attractive, is its strong and wide-reaching network of developers. With the help of Ethereum (ETH)\u2019s expansive developer community, projects built on top of the platform can benefit from a wider array of resources \u2014 allowing for faster innovation and more secure code.\n\nWhile there have been attempts to challenge Ethereum (ETH)\u2019s status as the leading smart contract platform, none have yet been able to unseat the king of dApps. This gives investors confidence that their investments in Ethereum (ETH)-based projects are likely safe from other competitors.\n\nLooking ahead, analysts anticipate that Ethereum (ETH) could reach $3,600 by the end of 2023 if the bull market continues. The $1,800 price mark should act as support, but if it breaks, Ethereum (ETH) could fall back down to $1,650.\n\nIf you wish to purchase the $COLT token for only $0.014, follow the links below and take advantage of this unique opportunity to earn an extra 40% purchase bonus on your investment!\n\nFind out more about the Collateral Network presale here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.collateralnetwork.io/\n\nPresale: https://app.collateralnetwork.io/register\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/collateralnwk\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Collateralnwk\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Big Eyes Coin Prevails Over Bear Market as Ethereum and Ripple Slump - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The crypto market is staring at a slump after reaching wild highs in April. Ripple and Ethereum, the biggest gainers of the last bull run, are facing selling pressure as the market has turned red. Ripple saw its value climb to $0.5697 but is now trading at $0.4641. Ethereum saw its price reach $2,127, but the second-biggest crypto by market cap is now trading at $1,837. Amidst marketwide bearish performance, Big Eyes Coin, a meme coin in presale, is emerging as an outlier to the market sentiments. The project is going through a highly successful, and the crypto community has taken note.\n\nRipple Feels the Heat From Crypto Liquidation\n\nRipple has seen its value come down to $0.4641 as the token has lost almost 3% of its value. The token\u2019s downward trend has come after a strong performance, even in the face of a lawsuit filed by the US SEC. XRP\u2019s poor performance comes after major exchanges are reporting wide-scale liquidations.\n\nThe Ripple network was built to facilitate efficient cross-border transactions. The network only takes seconds to perform transactions that traditional methods take upwards of hours or even days. The network uses XRP as its utility token and has seen adoption from governments and large banks like Santander. The network is projected to grow in popularity and value as its on-chain activity grows rapidly.\n\nEthereum Slips Below $1,900 Level\n\nEthereum slipped below the $1,900 level after a month of strong performance. The network saw its price rise to $2,127 after its successful Shanghai upgrade. The upgrade marked the network\u2019s full transition into a proof-of-stake (PoS) network. As of writing, ETH is trading at $1,848.\n\nEthereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, and the network has the largest ecosystem of Dapps. Ethereum boasts the largest developer community and has always been at the forefront of crypto innovation. The network PoS upgrade is aimed at making it energy and cost-efficient. The upgrade will improve the network\u2019s scalability and will drive more DeFi projects into the network. The network\u2019s improved fundamentals will make it a strong investment for the future.\n\nBig Eyes Coin Beats Market Blues\n\nBig Eyes Coin is in its presale, and the token has turned heads with its strong performance. The project has raked up investment worth more than $34.5 million. The cat-themed meme coin\u2019s presale will end on June 3rd and launch on Uniswap on June 15th. Big Eyes Coin Team has released the END300 promo code to celebrate the successful close of the presale. By using the code, investors can avail a 300% bonus on their purchase of BIG tokens.\n\nThe biggest draw of the network is its community-focused development roadmap. The network has released NFT cards that community members can use to mint BIG NFTs. Members can trade their BIG NFTs on Opensea, one of the largest NFT marketplaces. Additionally, the project has stated its aspirations to build DeFi projects in its ecosystem. The project is reportedly trying its hand in the p2e NFT gaming arena. These steps will potentially create wealth for the Big Eyes Coin community.\n\nBig Eyes Coin is also committed to acting on climate change. The project has set aside 5% of its liquidity to donate to charity. The community members can decide the causes the project contributes to.\n\nWhile the crypto market looks at a downturn, Big Eyes Coin has emerged as a bright spot. The project\u2019s hugely successful presale underlines investor confidence in the project and signals its utility too. Big Eyes Coin\u2019s performance is significant in the face of underperformance by heavyweights like ETH and XRP.\n\nSo, waste no more time and join the Big Eyes Coin presale to get in on an exciting crypto journey.

        "title": "Memes Gone Mainstream: A Closer Look At Ethereum-Based Meme Coins Shiba Inu, Floki Inu & Big Eyes Coin - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Meme coins have captured the world\u2019s attention, as they continue to soar in value following Elon Musk\u2019s tweets and the enthusiasm of the crypto community. While Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently the most well-known meme coin, other meme coins such as Shiba Inu (SHIB), Floki Inu (FLOKI), and Big Eyes Coin (BIG) are also gaining significant traction.\n\nAlthough all three of these meme coins operate on the Ethereum blockchain, they differ in terms of their utility and marketing approach. Shiba Inu and Floki Inu primarily rely on their cute mascots and celebrity endorsements to generate interest and appeal to the community, while Big Eyes Coin emphasises its usefulness in the e-commerce industry and its cat-themed approach.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at these meme coins and how they are becoming a sensation in the crypto verse!\n\nShiba Inu & Floki Inu: The Crypto Dog Duo\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) and Floki Inu (FLOKI) are two meme coins that have gained significant traction in the cryptocurrency world. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a meme coin inspired by the famous Japanese dog breed and gained widespread attention after a tweet from Elon Musk in early 2021.\n\nIt has been dubbed the \u201cDogecoin Killer\u201d due to its resemblance to Dogecoin. Shiba Inu (SHIB) has gained more popularity with the development of ShibaSwap, a decentralised exchange for SHIB tokens.\n\nOn the other hand, Floki Inu (FLOKI) is a newer meme coin that has been inspired by Elon Musk\u2019s recent announcement that his new dog is named Floki. It is still in its early stages, but it has already attracted a considerable amount of interest and attention from crypto investors.\n\nBoth of these meme coins are ERC-20 tokens operating on the Ethereum blockchain, with a total supply of one quadrillion tokens each. They also share a common tokenomics feature where a certain percentage of each transaction fee is burned to decrease the total supply and potentially increase the value of the remaining tokens.\n\nBig Eyes Coin: The Feline Snatching the Spotlight from the Canines!\n\nThe presale of Big Eyes Coin has been incredibly successful, with many investors eager to get their hands on this exciting new cryptocurrency. The presale has already raised over $34 million, making it one of the most successful presales in recent memory.\n\nHowever, time is running out for investors who have yet to participate, as the presale will end on June 3rd. Despite this, there is still a chance for investors to get involved and potentially profit from Big Eyes Coin.

Currently, BTC is supported at US$28,800 and faces resistance at US$29,420. In contrast, Ethereum remained stable at US$1,900 during the last 24 hours. Investors are closely monitoring the U.S. employment data set to release today.\u201d\n\nWazirX Vice President Rajagopal Menon said, \u201cCrypto markets remain in a state of confusion as Bitcoin stays near $29,000 while investors assess recent central bank interest rate increases and ongoing bank crises. Data from CryptoQuant shows high selling pressure but also a high Coinbase and Korean premium, suggesting strong buying demand. On WazirX, Orchid (OXT) and Bakery Token (BAKE) have been the top gainers in the last 24 hours.\u201d\n\nBuyUcoin CEO and India\u2019s second-longest-running digital asset exchange Shivam Thakral said, \u201cThe crypto market quickly recovered from the latest rate hike of 25 basis points announced by the Fed. BTC is holding strong above the $29,000 mark while Ether is almost touching the $1900 level at the time of writing. The crypto market is witnessing restricted growth due to high inflation and other macroeconomic factors and the Jobs data on Friday will act as a key stimulant for the market momentum.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin said, \u201cBitcoin is currently trading at $29,286 while other major cryptocurrencies like BNB and ETH are trading at around $326 and $1,900 respectively. The crypto market remains in a consolidation phase as economic risks and the likelihood of a short-term Fed rate cut cycle increase. US Treasury markets are taking note, and if yields continue to trend downward, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin could benefit from safe-haven demand as investors look for hard money alternatives to fiat currencies. Despite uncertainty about the global economic outlook, the potential for a short-term bitcoin price pump remains high.\u201d\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

        "content": "With the renewed interest in artificial intelligence (AI) sparked by the release of the text-based AI platform ChatGPT, the tool has proven exceptionally useful in multiple areas, including providing insights into the future price trends of assets on the cryptocurrency market, such as that of Ethereum (ETH).\n\nAfter dutifully reminding the reader that \u201cinvesting in cryptocurrencies is risky\u201d and that the actual price of Ethereum may be higher or lower than the estimates, ChatGPT has provided \u201csome information on the possible Ethereum price range by 2025, based on ecosystem developments and upgrades, related news, community support, user base, and other factors.\u201d\n\nIs $10,400 possible?\n\nAs some of the factors that could impact crypto asset\u2019s price by 2025, ChatGPT singled out the \u201congoing development and improvement of the Ethereum ecosystem, including upgrades to the Ethereum 2.0 protocol,\u201d and \u201cthe growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.\u201d\n\nOn top of that, the AI tool pointed out the \u201cadoption by major companies or financial institutions, or partnerships with other blockchain projects\u201d as well as \u201cthe number of customers and developers building on the Ethereum blockchain\u201d as further positive factors potentially driving its price up. Finally, as it explained:\n\nEthereum price prediction for 2025. Source: ChatGPT\n\nOther not-so-bullish predictions\n\nAt the same time, CoinPriceForecast is a lot less bullish on the price of Ethereum in 2025, predicting a price of $2,685 at the end of 2024, followed by $2,825 by mid-2025 and ending the year 2025 with $2,446, according to the most recent data retrieved by Finbold.\n\nEthereum price prediction for 2023, 2024, and 2025. Source: CoinPriceForecast\n\nInterestingly, the price prediction model over at PandaForecast trends more to the bearish side, targeting $2,045 in January 2025, $1,319 in June, and $1,752 in December 2025, with even its optimistic range seeing $2,224 at the year\u2019s beginning and $2,084 at its conclusion.\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum was at press time trading at the price of $1,901, which represents a very modest increase of 0.03% on the day, as well as a drop of 0.49% in the last seven days but still a 1.59% gain on its monthly chart, according to the data retrieved on May 5.\n\nEthereum 30-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nWhether the ChatGPT\u2019s very optimistic prediction has a chance o f coming true will largely depend on future positive sentiment and developments directly connected to the Ethereum network, as well as the overall attitude on the wider crypto and macro landscapes.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "A trader netted a massive $1.7 million in profits by buying more than four trillion PEPE coins just before this massive rally.\n\nAmid the current price surge, PEPE is leading the memecoin fest leading it to become the 41st largest cryptocurrency by market cap.\n\nThe memecoin crypto space is currently bustling with activity Pepe (PEPE), the competitor to Dogecoin and Shiba Inu is making much noise. As per the latest report, a crypto trader has recently netted 38,675 percent profit by trading PEPE which is already up by more than 500 percent in just over the last two weeks.\n\nAs per the blockchain tracker LookonChain, the crypto trader purchased a total of four trillion PEPE memecoins at a price of 2.1 Ethereum, worth $4,140 back then. As it turns out, the trader has sold more than 75 percent of its PEPE coin holdings netting more than $1.705 million in profits just within a span of two weeks. The trader now holds a balance of less than one million in his kitty. Data from LookonChain notes:\n\nA SmartMoney bought 4 trillion PEPE at a cost of 2.1 ETH ($4,410) and made approximately $1.71 million! And this guy also traded a lot of MEME coins. The SmartMoney discovered PEPE and spent 2.1 ETH ($4,410) to buy four trillion PEPE six hours after PEPE was listed. After each price surge in PEPE, he sold part of PEPE instead of selling all of them. He sold a total of 3.27 trillion PEPE for $906,000 and currently holds 700 billion PEPE worth $808,000.\n\nThe PEPE coin rally\n\nThe PEPE Coin has been currently leading the rally in the memecoin space and has become the undisputed cryptocurrency among its peers. As of press time, PEPE is trading 128 percent up at a price of $0.00000365 with a market cap of over $1.4 billion. By its market cap, PEPE ranks as the 41st largest cryptocurrency.\n\nAs per the on-chain data tracker, the trader who mostly transacts on the Ethereum blockchain has netted triple-digit profits over the two-other lesser known memecoins. The data from LookonChain notes:\n\n\u201cThis smart money has transactions on almost every chain, and 97% of assets are on Ethereum. He also bought BULL at $0.00075, now at $0.0045, which increases 500%. And bought BABYPEPE at $0.00000000024, now at $0.00000000123, which increases 415%.\u201d\n\nPEPE has once again triggered the memecoin fest and grabbed the limelight away from the top players such as Doegcoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB).\n\nRecently, there\u2019s quite some interesting activity spotted with these two of the biggest memecoins. Over the last month, dormant whale address inactive for the last 9.3 years and holding millions of DOGE coins turned active once again.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

        "content": "After the tumultuous market crash last year, 2023 has brought some relief to cryptocurrencies. Among them, Collateral Network (COLT), Stacks (STX), and Ethereum (ETH) are leading the way for bulls. In this article, we will analyze how a new project, Collateral Network, is leaving well-established cryptos like Stacks and Ethereum behind in growth rate.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nStacks Eyes To Tap Artificial Intelligence\n\nAs the hype around the integration of artificial intelligence into Web3 is growing, Stacks has also moved forward. Recently, an AI-powered developer platform, Replit, started featuring the Stacks layer for Bitcoin. After this development, verified Stacks \u201cRepls\u201d will be accessible to over 20 million users of Replit.\n\nThis will help developers learn how to build on the Stacks blockchain. The engineering resources available in the Stacks Replit profile will include code templates, the Stacks Connect start kit, and beginner tutorials. Although Stacks is trying to integrate new technologies into its blockchain, the growth has tumbled in the past few weeks. At the time of writing, Stacks (STX) is changing hands at $0.71.\n\nEthereum Launches ETHIndia Grant 2.0\n\nTo increase its adoption and network activity, Ethereum has launched the second season of the ETHIndia Grants program. Under ETHIndia, Ethereum will provide developers with up to $5,000 in equity-free grants to support their projects. Besides, Ethereum will also provide continuity grants or external funding to growth-oriented projects.\n\nEthereum, through this program, wants to encourage and incentivize developers to build projects in the areas of ZK tech, next-gen wallets, and more. The ETHIndia Grants 2.0 program has followed the launch of Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai Upgrade. Notably, the market value of Ethereum has witnessed a rise after the rollout of the Shanghai Upgrade. At the time of writing, Ethereum (ETH) is available to trade at $1,887.34, registering an increase of 9% in the past month.\n\nDemand For Collateral Network Shoots Up\n\nAre you looking for a platform where you can unlock liquidity from your luxury watch, vintage car, fine wine, or any other valuable physical asset and borrow crypto?\n\nCollateral Network will be the go to place on the blockchain to achieve this. On Collateral Network, people will be able to borrow crypto by using their real world physical assets as collateral. This unique platform is set to disrupt the traditional lending market set to be worth $1721.38 billion by 2031 (source: allied market research).\n\nBorrowers seeking loans send their physical assets to Collateral Network. The company then evaluates the asset, mints an NFTs that represent the physical item and fractionalizes it. These asset-backed fractional NFTs are sold to investors to fund the loans.\n\nLenders on the platform are from all over the globe so borrowers now have access to global liquidity and can obtain loans at competitive rates, lenders in return earn a fixed weekly income.\n\nThe platform is permissionless so there will be no need to submit private documents like proof of income or credit history to secure a loan.\n\nCollateral Network\u2019s presale is storming and COLT tokens are set to skyrocket by 3500% to $0.35 in the upcoming months. Just 38% of the total COLT supply will be released during the presale, and over 100 million tokens are already sold. At present, you can lock a COLT token at $0.014.\n\nFind out more about the Collateral Network presale here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.collateralnetwork.io/\n\nPresale: https://app.collateralnetwork.io/register\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/collateralnwk\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Collateralnwk\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Any information written in this press release or sponsored post does not constitute investment advice.

        "content": "The daily active addresses on the Shimmer Network saw a major boost with the start of the Treasures of Shimmer airdrop campaign.\n\nSince its launch 7 months ago, the Shimmer blockchain has delivered robust performance without any bugs or any other major issues.\n\nThe IOTA Shimmer network has gained popularity in just a few months of launch and is turning out to be one of the most preferred platforms for new projects to launch their services. In the latest development, IOTA co-founder Dominik Schiener took to Twitter to celebrate the milestone for the Shimmer Layer 1 network.\n\nReporting a massive growth in utility, Schiener said that the Shimmer blockchain now has 22,000 daily active addresses. This followed the airdrop campaign by Treasures of Shimmer. In the recent development, Web3 gaming experience IOTAHeroes has launched the Treasures of Shimmer Battle test on the ShimmerEVM network.\n\nSchiener said that the Shimmer ecosystem is flourishing and growing daily and that the native SMR token price will hit new highs very soon.\n\n22k daily active addresses just on the Shimmer L1 yesterday with the start of the Treasures of Shimmer airdrop campaign. The tech is amazing. The ecosystem is flourishing and growing daily. This is the way $SMR #Shimmer Imagine how SMR will fly once this hits mainnet. pic.twitter.com/H7utlU9e5y \u2014 Dominik Schiener (@DomSchiener) May 4, 2023\n\nThe Treasures of Shimmer kicked off earlier this week on May 3 and is a two-week-long incentive campaign that will reward projects and users for participating in the public testing of the ShimmerEVM chain, as well as the dApps deployed on it. Later, the participants will participate in the public testing of 1.3 million SMR tokens.\n\nThe Robust Performance of the Shimmer Network\n\nIn its report for the first quarter of the year 2023, the IOTA Foundation spoke about the success of the Shimmer Network attained in a very short period of time. Since its launch in late September 2022, IOTA\u2019s staging network Shimmer operated successfully without any bugs or any other major issues.\n\nAs we know, both IOTA and the Shimmer networks are Layer-1 platforms that use the Tangle technology with DAG for transactions as well as data storage but differ in tokenization. Shimmer\u2019s Stardust protocols also facilitate NFTs, customer tokens, and alias outputs on the Layer 1 network.\n\nNote that Shimmer is a staging network of the IOTA blockchain and serves as a testbed for testing new innovations before they make their way to the IOTA mainnet. The Stardust feature is currently limited only to Shimmer and might arrive on the IOTA blockchain in the future.\n\nAlso, while IOTA uses dust protection, Shimmer asks users to back up their stored data on the Tangle with the SMR tokens. Everyone is now eagerly awaiting the launch of the ShimmerEVM which will facilitate seamless transfer of assets between Shimmer and Ethereum.\n\nHowever, developers have currently launched the ShimmerEVM testnet a month ago. The Shimmer EVM testnet has reached a transaction milestone of approximately one million and has over 38,000 active wallet addresses, just a month after its launch. The platform has also successfully deployed over 2,200 smart contracts.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

        "title": "The Cancun Upgrade: Boosting the Performance and Benefits of Ethereum-Based Projects - The Currency Analytics",
        "content": "Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is gearing up for its next major upgrade, the Cancun upgrade. This upcoming upgrade is expected to boost the performance of the Ethereum network, making it more efficient and secure than ever before. As the Ethereum network undergoes this upgrade, it is predicted that Ethereum-based projects will also reap the benefits.\n\nOne of the projects that is set to benefit from the Cancun upgrade is Big Eyes Coin, an Ethereum-based project that has recently gained a lot of attention due to its successful presale. Big Eyes Coin is a unique deflationary token that employs a burn mechanism to increase the coin\u2019s scarcity and ultimately drive up its value. With the upcoming Ethereum upgrade, Big Eyes Coin is expected to attract even more attention from the crypto community.\n\nAnother project that is poised to benefit from the Cancun upgrade is Robot Era, a crypto project that aims to compete with the leaders of the NFT gaming metaverse. Robot Era is a platform that allows users to build and customize their own robots, which can then be used in various games and applications. With the improved efficiency and security of the Ethereum network post-upgrade, Robot Era is expected to become a more attractive option for gamers and investors alike.\n\nThe Cancun upgrade is set to bring significant improvements to the Ethereum network, including improvements to transaction throughput, security, and overall performance. These improvements will not only benefit Big Eyes Coin and Robot Era, but also the entire Ethereum ecosystem. As more projects are built on top of Ethereum, the network\u2019s performance and security become increasingly important.\n\nThe Ethereum network has been a leader in the blockchain space for years, and this upgrade shows the continued commitment of the Ethereum team to improving the network\u2019s capabilities. As more and more projects are built on top of Ethereum, the network\u2019s importance only continues to grow, and it is crucial that the network remains efficient and secure.\n\nOverall, the Cancun upgrade is a positive development for the Ethereum community, and it is expected to bring significant benefits to Ethereum-based projects, investors, and users alike. As the upgrade is implemented and the network\u2019s capabilities continue to improve, we can expect to see even more innovation and growth in the Ethereum ecosystem in the coming months and years.\n\nIn conclusion, the Cancun upgrade is a highly anticipated event in the Ethereum community, as it promises to bring significant improvements to the network\u2019s performance, security, and overall functionality. With these upgrades, Ethereum-based projects such as Big Eyes Coin and Robot Era are expected to see an increase in attention and adoption, as the network becomes more efficient and secure."
