        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s native token, ether, has turned deflationary. Again.\n\nWhat\u2019s driving the latest shift is a combination of factors, according to Blockworks Research analysts, previous reporting and crypto data providers. Among them:\n\nNFT trading volumes picking up steam since the start of 2023 after a period of depressed activity. The result has been rising gas fees, which power transactions on the Ethereum network. That increase, in turn, has triggered \u201csubsequent base fee burn\u201d for traders, Blockworks Research analysts said. (Base fees set a floor for gas and are burnt, or removed from circulation, to control the availability of ether on the market.)\n\nLingering effects from the Merge, which transitioned the network from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. A Blockworks Research report said the move was \u201cundeniable\u201d in terms of \u201cthe impact [proof-of-stake] has had on Ethereum\u2019s supply.\u201d\n\nEthereum\u2019s pending Shanghai upgrade, which is set to allow stakers that validate the blockchain\u2019s transactions to withdraw their locked-up ether for the first time.\n\nRamped-up volatility in terms of trading ether, which has an impact on the native token\u2019s overall supply. And bullish headwinds to start the year for bitcoin, ether and additional cryptoassets.\n\nEther (ETH) was trading around $1,600 as of Tuesday afternoon in New York, holding relatively flat on the day. That\u2019s significantly up from the start of the year, when ether was trading in the $1,200 range.\n\nThe cryptoasset \u2014 which has typically been inflationary \u2014 took a deflationary turn in November 2022 for the first time since the Merge. It previously had become deflationary in November 2021 and has flip-flopped at least three times this month.\n\n\u201cI strongly believe total ETH burn in the next cycle will be at least as great as the previous cycle,\u201d said Dan Smith, a senior analyst with Blockworks Research.\n\nEthereum has about 18 times more TVL (total value locked) than most layer-2 blockchains, according to Smith, which are \u201cbarely even [layer-2s] in their current state.\u201d Ether now has a peak burn rate of -2.8% compared to its last bull run, he said, based on an analysis of on-chain data from Oct. 26, 2022 to Jan. 24, 2023.\n\nREAD MORE: The effect of Ethereum\u2019s \u201csecurity budget\u201d on its inflation status\n\nNFT marketplaces OpenSea and Blur have burned more than 6,500 ETH over the past month, contributing significantly to the inflation versus deflation narrative, per Blockworks Research.\n\nAdded Smith: \u201cWhile layer-2s showed continued innovation and adoption in 2022, they lack decentralization in their current state.\u201d\n\nDecentralizing elements such as sequencers or provers will come later in 2023 or 2024, developers say.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Could Ethereum Hit $5,000 in 2023? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Once upon a time, what historians call November 2021, Ethereum (ETH 0.28%) was worth more than $4,890 per digital coin. Then a bitter crypto winter set in, driving Ethereum prices all the way down to $896 last summer.\n\nToday, the roller-coaster ride stands at the $1,633 station. Can the largest and oldest blockchain platform for smart contracts reach new all-time highs of $5,000 or more in 2023?\n\nThe short answer is, \"maybe.\" The most honest answer I can give you is, \"probably not; ask again next year.\"\n\nTo see the long answer, and my recommendations for Ethereum investors, keep reading.\n\nThe final destination\n\nI expect cryptocurrencies and smart contracts to disrupt economic systems around the world. The next generation of banking, money transfers, insurance, and asset management will look radically different. Go-betweens are dropping out of the equation, transactions will be faster and more automated, fees are going lower, and I'm just scratching the surface of what a decentralized financial system will look like.\n\nEthereum is one of the oldest and most respected cryptocurrencies on the market, with a larger group of app developers and projects than its younger rivals. It is also under active development, as seen in last summer's Merge and an ambitious long-term road map. So as the crypto market evolves, Ethereum should stay in the vanguard.\n\nGiven this potentially spectacular future, Ethereum should gain a lot of value over time. And $5,000 should be an early stop on a long ride up. Growth investing superstar Cathie Wood of Ark Invest fame expected Ethereum to reach \"triple-digit\" prices before 2030. That prediction may sound outdated since she published it nearly one year ago, but Wood has also doubled down on her long-term faith in Ethereum more recently.\n\nSpeed bumps in the road ahead\n\nHowever, those promising targets are pointing a few years into the future. Ethereum looks like a robust long-term investment, but I can't guarantee that it will make you a fortune in 2023.\n\nDecentralized finance is in its infancy, with as many stumbles as success stories. The Ethereum 2.0 development is incomplete after The Merge, leaving many crucial technology improvements for future platform upgrades. In addition, investors and consumers need time to rebuild their general trust in cryptocurrencies after multiple cash-burning scandals in 2022. And we are still waiting for sectorwide catalysts such as a firm regulatory system for crypto trading and ownership or large-scale involvement by banks and institutional investors.\n\nThe $5,000 price target is more than triple Ethereum's current price. Meeting it this year is a tall order, requiring many uncertain events to work out in Ethereum's favor -- and quickly.\n\nSo Ethereum may very well double in price this year, and maybe even triple. Crypto winters melting into a new spring can have that effect. At the same time, the gains can also take years to develop and Ethereum's price might dip again along the way.\n\nHow to invest in Ethereum this year\n\nIn other words, it's not a good idea to bet the literal farm on Ethereum right now. Building your holdings more patiently makes far more sense, allowing you to take advantage of the current price dip, as well as the potential potholes of the future.\n\nInvesting in Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies is really not different from buying stocks. Get-rich-quick schemes rarely work out in your favor, while patiently building your portfolio for the long haul is the real secret to lasting wealth.\n\nTherefore, I recommend picking up some Ethereum coins (or fractions of coins) in several buys across 2023. If it reaches that tantalizing $5,000 level, you'll celebrate getting in early enough to triple some of your first investments. And if the price chart dips again, your celebration will be just as heartfelt when Ethereum zooms past $5,000 to Cathie Wood's triple-digit targets in a few years.\n\nIt's just a matter of time and patience. Life in Wall Street's fast lane can be slow sometimes."

        "content": "The price of Ether (ETH) rallied 16% between Jan. 14 and Jan. 21, peaking at $1,680 before facing a 5.4% rejection. Curiously, the same resistance level resulted in a substantial correction in late August and again in early on Nov. 2.\n\nEther/USD price index, 2-day. Source: TradingView\n\nFrom one side, traders are relieved that Ether is trading up 35.5% year-to-date, but the repeated corrections that follow retests of the $1,680 resistance may have weakened investors' sentiment.\n\nNegative newsflow might have limited Ether investors\u2019 appetite after troubled cryptocurrency company Digital Currency Group (DCG) faced more legal issues this week. On Jan. 23, a group of Genesis Capital creditors filed a lawsuit alleging violations of federal securities laws. In addition, the plaintiffs allege the lending firm made false and misleading statements as part of a scheme to defraud potential and existing digital asset lenders.\n\nAnother new concern for Ether holders came on Jan. 22, after a \u201ctemperature check\u201d proposal to deploy Uniswap v3 protocol to BNB Chain received overwhelming support from the Uniswap community. Some 80% of Uniswap\u2019s UNI governance tokenholders have voted to deploy the additional version of the decentralized exchange protocol.\n\nOn the bright side, Ethereum developers have created a testing environment for the upcoming Shanghai network upgrade. According to Ethereum developer Marius Van Der Wijden, the testnet appears to have been created to evaluate staking withdrawals, which are currently disabled on the mainnet. Over 14.5 million ETH (worth $23 billion) has been deposited into the Ethereum staking contract, and harsh criticism followed the multiple delays in enabling withdrawals.\n\nLet\u2019s look at Ether derivatives data to understand if the $1,680 price rejection has impacted crypto investor sentiment.\n\nETH futures finally enter the neutral area\n\nRetail traders usually avoid quarterly futures due to their price difference from spot markets. Meanwhile, professional traders prefer these instruments because they prevent the fluctuation of funding rates in a perpetual futures contract.\n\nThe three-month futures annualized premium should trade between 4% to 8% in healthy markets to cover costs and associated risks. When the futures trade at a discount versus regular spot markets, it shows a lack of confidence from leverage buyers and this is a bearish indicator.\n\nEther 3-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe above chart shows that derivatives traders are no longer bearish because the Ether futures premium reached the 4% threshold for neutral markets. So, bulls can celebrate that the indicator shifted to a modest premium, but that does not mean traders expect the immediate result of positive price action.\n\nFor this reason, traders should analyze Ether\u2019s options markets to understand how whales and market makers are pricing the odds of future price movements.\n\nOptions traders are comfortable with downside risk\n\nThe 25% delta skew is a telling sign when market makers and arbitrage desks are overcharging for upside or downside protection.\n\nIn bear markets, options investors give higher odds for a price dump, causing the skew indicator to rise above 10%. On the other hand, bullish markets tend to drive the skew indicator below -10%, meaning the bearish put options are discounted.\n\nEther 60-day options 25% delta skew: Source: Laevitas\n\nRelated: Why is crypto pumping? Watch The Market Report live\n\nThe delta skew has stabilized near 0% in the past week, signaling that Ether options traders are presenting a neutral sentiment. That is a stark contrast from the end of 2022 when the 25% skew index hovered near 18% \u2014 indicating a lack of comfort in taking downside risks.\n\nUltimately, both options and futures markets point to pro traders moving out of the neutral-to-bearish sentiment to a neutral positioning, meaning there is no discomfort after the rejection at $1,680 and subsequent correction.\n\nConsequently, the odds favor Ether bulls because the negative newsflow could not prevent the 35.5% year-to-date gains and the demand for shorts using futures contracts remains thin.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "How Long Will the Ethereum LSD Narrative Last? Talking 2023 Trends with Nansen\u2019s Martin Lee - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Ethereum Liquid Staking tokens are going through the roof. Lido is up 150% in a month, similarly Frax Shares, while other protocols, such as Rocket Pool, are also catching up.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all. NFTs are also seeing massive volumes for multiple consecutive weeks, showing little signs of slowing down.\n\nThe question now is for how long this positive trend will sustain \u2013 is it a dead cat bounce or the beginning of a much-awaited recovery?\n\nTo help us crunch the numbers and interpret some of the on-chain data is Martin Lee \u2013 a Data Journalist from the popular cryptocurrency analytics firm Nansen.\n\nLiquid Staking Coins Trend Upwards, but for How Long?\n\nEthereum LSD, or liquid staking derivative coins, have been the hottest story of 2023 so far, with many of the protocols seeing tremendous growth in the value locked and, by extension \u2013 popularity.\n\nTo those unfamiliar with the concept, we have a comprehensive guide on Ethereum liquid staking.\n\nAs opposed to staking directly into the Beacon depositor contract, LSD protocols allow users to stake their ETH and receive a synthetic version of it \u2013 a new token, per se \u2013 that can then be used across various DeFi applications to trade, farm, provide liquidity, and so forth.\n\nSpeaking on the matter, Lee outlined two major advantages that, according to him, are part of the reasons why the narrative has grown so strong. For instance, h outlined that staking ETH directly into the smart contract is \u201creally capital inefficient\u201d because of a few things. First, the capital requirement is quite considerable (32 ETH), and the lockup period used to be unknown.\n\nTherefore:\n\nThe natural solution to this would be liquid staking. You get a liquid token in exchange for whatever you\u2019ve staked (in this case ETH). For example, if you stake ETH with Lido, you get stETH, which is fully liquid and you can interact with various DeFi protocols.\n\nLiquid staking solves both the problems of the staked ETH being illiquid and the high capital requirement to participate in ETH staking.\n\nNative tokens of LSD protocols, such as Lido\u2019s LDO, for instance, have been on the run lately. LDO itself is up close to 150% in the past month, similar to other protocols of the kind like Rocket Pool and others.\n\nThe catalyst for this seems to have been the recent announcement that Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade will hit the public testnet in February and the mainnet in 2023. This is a pivotal moment for the Ethereum community because it will allow validators to unlock the 32 ETH they\u2019ve staked in the Beacon contract for the first time. The consensus seems to be that this would increase the demand for liquid staking alternatives, which is the predominant reason for the current popularity and increase in their valuations.\n\nOn when the narrative will inevitably die out, Lee says that most trends like this typically slow down on the date of the event that prompted their emergence in the first place \u2013 in this case, the Shanghai upgrade.\n\nTypically, the trend dies out on the date of the event itself. For example, the ETH Merge was such a huge topic, but on the Merge date itself, people completely stopped talking about it.\n\nNFT Volumes Also Pop\n\nAt the time of our recording, NFT trading volume was going through the roof, and even though there was a certain decline in the past couple of days, the market saw a considerable rebound.\n\nIn fact, by January 17th, ETH NFTs saw five consecutive weeks of up-only volumes.\n\nCommenting on the matter, Lee said that it\u2019s more or less this is in line with what we\u2019ve seen in past cycles.\n\nWhenever we have long periods of very boring action, where there\u2019s basically no movements, prices are extremely stable, NFTs tend to go on their own mini-run whenever that happens. In the past 2-3 months, the price action across the board was extremely stagnant. Then, NFTs kind of went on their own mini-run, with some projects doing better than others.\n\nTo find out what Lee thinks the trends of this year will look like, as well as whether or not the Shanghai upgrade will cause a lot of selling pressure on ETH\u2019s price, don\u2019t hesitate to watch the full video above."

        "content": "This article answers the most important question for the next bull rally. Which is a better investment for the next bullrun ETH or MATIC. Take a look at this: ETH\u2019s ICO Price\u2014$0.31 and its ROI in 10 years was 5,277x. On the other hand, MATIC\u2019s ICO Price\u2014$0.00263 and its ROI in 4 years was 376X.\n\nDoes this big ROI number for ETH mean that the token has had its run? And for those 10X 50X returns in 2023 we should hold MATIC rather than ETH? To get the right answer, I had to do a lot of ground work. But to make it simple for you, I have compared the 2 most important parameters for ETH and MATIC, as these helped me conclude which one I should finally hold for the next bullrun and why? Before I come to the 2 parameters, let me first update you on what is happening with both these projects in 2023.\n\nWhat is Happening with Ethereum in 2023?\n\nIn March 2023, Ethereum has its next big upgrade coming in the Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade. This will enable withdrawal of staked ETH to the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nAt the time of writing this article, over 13.49% of total ETH supply is staked and from March 2023, a part of it will unlock for withdrawals. This enabling of withdrawal is also likely to have some ramifications on market demand for ETH, and that could have an effect on the price of ETH.\n\nSo, I plan to keep a close eye on ETH staking withdrawal schedule to understand its impact on ETH price. Now here is something interesting. Shanghai upgrade will also have effect on Polygon. How and why I will explain in the next section that talks about what is Polygon up to in 2023?\n\nWhat is Happening with Polygon in 2023?\n\nPolygon killed 2022 with its mainstream partnerships with some of the biggest of the biggest brands: Adobe, Disney, Meta, NFL, NuBank, Reddit, Robinhood, and Starbucks. And in 2023 Polygon is bound to make it big because of these 4 factors:\n\n#2022 wrap-up #onPolygon by Polygon Analytics\ud83d\udc47 Active wallets hit a new ATH: 11 mm+ \ud83d\ude80\n\nTotal active wallets: 206 mm (+58% from \u201821) \ud83d\udcc8\n\nRange of monthly transactions: 80 mm+ \ud83e\udd1d@LensProtocol & @unstoppableweb saw explosive growth after launch #onPolygon \ud83d\udca5 pic.twitter.com/c1OXO7ymKr \u2014 Polygon (@0xPolygon) January 24, 2023\n\nProjects Migrating to Polygon\n\nThe end of December 2022 saw 3 popular protocols migrate to the Polygon network. For instance, two major Solana NFT platforms, DeGods and y00ts, announced their move to Polygon. More projects mean more users and more token usage.\n\n2. Mastercard Incubator Project\n\nOn January 7th, traditional finance giant, Mastercard, announced an incubator program that will teach emerging artists how to use web3 technology. The program is called the Artist Accelerator program, and it is being developed in collaboration with Polygon.\n\n3. NFT Sale Volume Spike\n\nPolygon defied crypto winter with a spike in NFT sales volume\n\n4. Uptick in Users\n\nPolygon also recorded more NFT users than most other networks. All this will undoubtedly translate into price action for Matic.\n\nNow, here is something that most of us don\u2019t know. Shanghai was originally expected to include additional much-anticipated enhancements, including proto-danksharding\u2014a streamlined data sampling process that would make layer-2 transactions like Polygon transaction on Ethereum significantly cheaper and faster. But both updates were postponed to make sure ETH withdrawals could debut by March.\n\nWhile the world is going nuts about ChatGPT, #GenerativeAI is taking a new leap #onPolygon \ud83e\udd2f@real_alethea and Polygon have launched the world's 1\ufe0f\u20e3st AI Collectibles campaign \ud83e\udd16#AI launching on #Web3?\n\nWhaaaaa?! \ud83e\udd29https://t.co/VXjtO467j2 \u2014 Polygon (@0xPolygon) January 19, 2023\n\nHowever, cheaper and faster transactions on Polygon will attract more users to Polygon and translate into price action. But Ethereum developers have not announced any date about this upgrade yet. Except that it should take place in March.\n\nPros Ethereum VS Polygon\n\nIf we look at the pros of each chain, we see an interesting development. On one side, Ethereum has the most devs and highest TVL of all chains. 60% of all chains, compared to 2.59% on Polygon. That\u2019s $26.7 billion compared to $1.15 billion.\n\nHowever, on the other hand, we see Polygon with fast and cheap transactions. The other day I wanted to buy a $15 NFT on OpenSea on Ethereum, with $11 gas fees. I\u2019m like, \u2018really\u2019? So, it\u2019s no surprise that Polygon has the full support of the Ethereum community. Ethereum has a lot of institutional demand. That\u2019s not bad at all, since that\u2019s where a lot of money is at. As a result, this has a positive effect on the price of ETH. For example:\n\nZK solutions\n\nOptimism\n\nLayer 2 and Layer 3 solutions building on Ethereum. Layer 2 deals with scalability and cheap & fast transactions. The layer 3 chains deal with interoperability. The IBC on Cosmos or Quant are samples of layer 3.\n\nPolygon vs. Ethereum, which is better for NFTs? \ud83e\udd4a Here's a side-by-side comparison of their TVL, consensus mechanism, transaction per second, gas fees and tokenomics! \u2b07\ufe0fhttps://t.co/QcMR6ls4bR \u2014 CoinGecko (@coingecko) January 21, 2023\n\nOn Polygon, we see mostly retail demand. However, their list of Web2 partnerships is impressive. They partnered recently with seemingly every big name in the Web2 world. They all want an entrance into Web3, and choose Polygon for this. For example:\n\nDisney\n\nStarbucks\n\nThe NFL\n\nAdidas\n\nStripe\n\nOr Meta\n\nIf you are keen to know more about Polygon in detail, I recently did a deep dive video. It tells you all about the ZKs and rollups and about their partnerships. Coming back to the point and comparing the upcoming narrative.\n\nComparing the Upcoming Narratives\n\nOn the narratives, we see that Ethereum\u2019s staking is very successful. Although you need to invest 32 ETH to become a validator, many people simply delegate their ETH. In other words, they hand over their ETH to a validator. Yield is around 4% in average.\n\nSoon, you will be able to unlock your staked ETH, with the Shanghai update. This is due in March 2023. Currently, holders stake over 16 million ETH. The withdrawal option for ETH is the main narrative for the Shanghai update.\n\nEthereum also turned deflationary after the Merge. Shortly after the Merge, the circulating supply of ETH is declining. This is due to a new burning mechanism of fees. Now let\u2019s have a look at Polygon. 5 They just completed a hard fork on 17th January. This took care of gas fee spikes. It also reduced the time for making a new block. In other words, transaction finality improves.\n\nFurthermore, Polygon is a prime mover with ZK solutions. This is a technology that improves scalability. Ethereum has a TPS (transactions per second) of 11-15. ZK rollups can change that to up to 5000 TPS or more. Polygon also has the zkEVM Rollups coming. This is the first ZK technology that is completely compatible with Ethereum. It will reduce transaction costs even more and allow for higher throughput. Being Layer 2, it\u2019s built on top of Ethereum. As a result, it benefits from Ethereum\u2019s security.\n\nPolygon zkEVM: Now with more throughput and less latency. But how? Recursion makes proofs smaller. Aggregation makes them correct. Batches of proofs are also 150% larger. pic.twitter.com/3Hi9H2uasT \u2014 Polygon ZK (@0xPolygonZK) January 13, 2023\n\nDemand Drivers and Buy Walls\n\nEthereum attracts mostly institutional demand. Both from Web2 and Web3. On the other hand, Polygon is more for retailers. They attract some Web2 institutions, however, not as constant investments.\n\nWe also see a strong ETF demand for ETH. That\u2019s an exchange-traded funds. In other words, you can trade in BTC or ETH on a traditional exchange. So, you don\u2019t have to go through a crypto exchange. Ethereum also offers a multitude of Layer 2 and ZK solutions. Companies and firms will also put Ethereum in their balance sheets.\n\nThe number of dApps in the Ethereum ecosystem is great, with around, 3750 dApps. However, Polygon hosts no less than 53,000 dApps. The ETH gas fee will remain high, and people will see Polygon\u2019s gas as a perfect alternative.\n\nThe Verdict\n\nSo, with all the information at hand, many expect that Polygon might take this one. However, I\u2019m going to give you a potentially less popular opinion. I think that Ethereum will outperform Polygon. And here\u2019s why, for example:\n\nThe deflationary dynamics and buy walls ensure ETH dominance over Polygon. Buy walls are when a large group of traders, sometimes whales, try to control an asset\u2019s price. This will, of course, suit their best interest.\n\nWe also see rising competition in L1 space, which is not benefiting Polygon in the long run:\n\nETH and 3 BTC are down 69%.\n\nMATIC is down 67.5% from its ATH.\n\nIt is a clear sign that Polygon is overvalued at this price for a bear market entry. It\u2019s best to accumulate Polygon in the range of $0.5-0.7 and ETH in the $900-1k range.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f For more cryptocurrency news, check out the Altcoin Buzz YouTube channel.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f Check out our most up-to-date research, NFT and Metaverse buy, and how to protect your portfolio in this market by checking out our Altcoin Buzz Access group, which for a limited time, is FREE.

        "content": "Ethereum price has finally recorded some pullback after a 40% rally in January, giving investors an opportunity to buy ETH at lower levels. The ETH price hit a high of $1,674 last Saturday and fell under $1,550 today due to profit-taking by traders as the rally had no significant pullback.\n\nWhile investors speculate whether this is the best level to buy Ethereum, crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe believes there\u2019s more to it.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Can Fall To $1,450\n\nPopular crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe in a tweet on January 25 predicts a further fall in the Ethereum price to near $1,450. He believes Ethereum price may witness some rebound from the crucial support level of $1,550, but the actual bounce for another rally will come only from below the crucial support level.\n\n\u201cSome slow grind upwards and then one more sweep in the coming days and the correction should be over and we\u2019ll continue the party.\u201d\n\nEthereum (ETH) price fell nearly 5% in the last 24 hours to hit a low of $1,530. Profit booking by traders and selloff by whales were the primary reasons behind the recent fall in ETH prices.\n\nAccording to Whale Alert data, a whale dumped 24,768 ETH worth $38 million to crypto exchange Coinbase today. Whales had transferred ETH worth almost $200 million to crypto exchanges and liquidity pools in the last few days.\n\nOn-chain data by Santiment confirms profit-taking transactions since Ethereum hit a high of $1,674. The Ethereum Ratio of Daily On-Chain Transaction Volume in Profit to Loss jumps higher on January 20 indicating a rise in profit-taking transactions.\n\nMoreover, the social dominance of Ethereum has hit its highest value since July last year after the price drop, indicating traders looking for a \u201cbuy the dip\u201d opportunity.\n\nEthereum Price Shows Slight Recovery\n\nEthereum (ETH) price fell over 5% in the last 24 hours, with the price currently trading at $1,553. The 24-hour low and high are $1,530 and $1,637, respectively. Furthermore, the trading volume increased by 14% after the fall, indicating a slight increase in interest among traders.\n\nHowever, ETH price will remain under pressure until the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2018s rate hike decision on February 1 and the fourth-quarter GDP data due on Thursday.\n\nAlso Read: Reasons Why Bitcoin (BTC) Price Rally Is Likely Over"

        "content": "Top NFT Collections Fear Return of High Gas Fees and Look to Layer 1s\n\nBy: Samuel Haig \u2022 Loading...\n\nNFT News\n\nDespite Ethereum being the birth-place of NFTs, some of the network\u2019s most popular NFT communities are expanding onto alternative Layer 1 blockchains. The reason? The threat Ethereum\u2019s high gas fees may return.\n\nOn Thursday, Pudgy Penguins and Doodles both announced they will expand beyond Ethereum. Pudgy Penguins launched cross-chain bridging between Ethereum, Arbitrum, Polygon, and BNB Chain, while Doodles announced its new Doodles 2 project will live on the Flow blockchain.\n\nCore Motivation\n\nBoth teams said securing low gas fees for their users was a core motivation behind exploring other alternative smart contract chains. Pudgy Penguins warned that with less than 2M transactions currently processed by Ethereum daily, a surge in on-chain activity could drive gas fees up by \u201c1,000% or more\n\nThe 2021 NFT boom was a major source of congestion for the Ethereum network, with average transaction fees for simple transactions spiking above $50 while complex smart contract interactions cost hundreds of dollars in late 2021 and early 2022.\n\nAccording to BitInfoCharts, average Ethereum transaction fees fell 93.5% from $63 in November 2021 to just $4 today.\n\nDespite leading players in the NFT sector making significant gas fee optimizations in 2022 and on-chain activity remaining low during recent months, the moves from Pudgy Penguins and Doodles to explore alternative chains suggests many developers are bracing for the possibility that Ethereum fees could soon spike again.\n\nNFT Provenance\n\n\u201cEthereum is an ideal base chain for preserving your NFT\u2019s provenance over time,\u201d Pudgy Penguins said in a blog post. \u201cHowever, Ethereum mainnet\u2019s user experience is not as friendly as it could be for people new to the technology.\u201d\n\nPudgy Penguins teamed up with Layer Zero, a cross-chain interoperability protocol, to launch its bridge.\n\nDeFi Alpha Premium Content DeFi Daily | Weekdays\n\nDeFi Alpha Letter | Weekly\n\nDefiant Podcast Transcript | Weekly\n\nInbox Dump | Saturday\n\nWeekly Recap | Sunday Looking for Alpha?

The team said it chose Arbitrum, Polygon, and BNB Chain for its first multi-chain foray due to their \u201crapidly growing usage and exposure.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt must be easy for the next wave of users, that are in the hundreds of millions, to interact and become a part of the Pudgy Penguins ecosystem,\u201d the team said. \u201cBy enabling the Lil Pudgys to go cross-chain, we\u2019re setting up the Pudgy Penguins ecosystem to reach millions of people.\u201d\n\nPudgy Penguins has a market cap of $77.2M, according to NFT Floor Price. Its floor price is $8,710, a 246% gain in two months.\n\nAlso on Jan. 25, Doodles, a popular PFP avatar collection limited to 10,000 NFTs, announced it will launch Doodles 2 on Flow.\n\nDoodles 2 will allow users to customize their NFT. After minting a base-level doodle and selecting traits such as skin tone and hair color, holders can then customize their NFT with digital wearables such as clothing, accessories, and gadgets of \u201cvarying tiers and rarity.\u201d\n\nSpace Doodle\n\n\u201cIn 2023, we\u2019re opening the gates so Doodles can live everywhere,\u201d Doodles tweeted. \u201cThanks to Flow\u2019s nonexistent gas fees, Doodles holders can enjoy endless customization to create their own uniquely personalized characters.\u201d\n\nDoodles said it will mint the first digital wearables for the new project on Jan. 31. The team hinted that a second set of wearables will be launched roughly one month later.\n\nUnannounced Experiences\n\nDoodles 2 wearables buyers will also receive \u201cDoodles 2 Beta Passes\u201d granting access to the project\u2019s private beta launch.\n\nThe team said it will continue to invest in its Ethereum-based ecosystem, including upcoming \u201cunannounced experiences\u201d it plans to launch on the chain.\n\nDoodles is the 14th largest NFT collection by market cap with $114.7M, according to NFT Price Floor. The collection\u2019s last sale was $11,475, up nearly 80% from its local low in November."

        "content": "Ethereum developers launch Withdrawal-Mainnet-Shadow-Fork-1 ahead of Shanghai.\n\nVitalik Buterin proposes Stealth Addresses to tackle privacy concerns on the network.\n\nThe developers of Ethereum [ETH] made a significant advancement towards deploying the Shanghai update by creating a \u201cShadow Fork.\u201d Additionally, Vitalik Buterin suggested a method for guaranteeing transaction privacy on the Ethereum network in a related development. What effects could these developments have on the network and ETH?\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nA Fork before the Fork\n\nAn Ethereum engineer named Marius Van Der Wijden announced the Mainnet Shadow Fork on 23 January. Wijden planned to introduce rogue nodes into the testnet that would send out faulty blocks and messages to trick other nodes into joining a phony fork of the network.\n\nWithdrawal-Mainnet-Shadow-Fork-1 is finalizing ??? It started out with a few issues because the config wasn't correctly applied on geth (we disallow overriding the mainnet config). The config is applied correctly and all nodes are in agreement. We will start some evil nodes,. \u2014 MariusVanDerWijden (@vdWijden) January 23, 2023\n\nThis testnet was dubbed Withdrawal-Mainnet-Shadow-Fork-1. It also appeared to simulate the requirements for withdrawing staked Ether (ETH).\n\nA shadow fork is an interim test fork that implements some of the necessary protocol modifications before the full Shanghai hard fork. Before the big switch to a proof-of-stake network, known as the Merge, which occurred last year. Ethereum employed multiple shadow forks for testing.\n\nVitalik going stealth\n\nEthereum\u2019s founder and current CEO, Vitalik Buterin, also proposed the implementation of a feature he named \u201cStealth Addresses.\u201d In an article, while highlighting the difficulty of ensuring privacy in the ecosystem, Buterin stated:\n\n\u201cFixing this state of affairs is a serious topic.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, Stealth Addresses would be a way to conceal the true ownership of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and domain names registered using the Ethereum Name Service (ENS). Stealth addresses are created by wallets, which scramble public key addresses for anonymous transactions. A unique \u201cspending key\u201d key is required to access these incognito exchanges.\n\nIf the Dev team\u2019s shadow fork turned out to be successful, users could withdraw their staked ETH without fear of the network being compromised. The lack of privacy concerns on the Ethereum network might also be solved if Vitalik\u2019s suggested stealth address could be deployed. If these updates increase the network\u2019s popularity, ETH\u2019s value may rise.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nDevelopment activity decent, but price drops\n\nThe Development Activity indicator on Santiment could be used to get an idea of how busy the developers are. As of this writing, the Metric indicated that developer input had nearly reached 50. As the Shanghai update approaches, this may very well climb further.\n\nOn the daily timescale chart, Ethereum traded at about $1,618. In addition, the price continued, the little decline it had been experiencing over the previous 48 hours -until press time \u2013 by dropping by almost.50%.\n\nHowever, it was apparent that the price action was higher than the long and short Moving Averages (blue and yellow lines). The support level was also shown by the yellow and blue lines."

        "content": "Morgan Creek Capital CIO Mark Yusko says Avalanche (AVAX) has the potential to go on a massive surge and outperform the rest of the crypto market in the next cycle.\n\nIn a new interview with Paul Barron, the crypto veteran says the smart contract platform could skyrocket 50x in the next bull market cycle, as long as Bitcoin (BTC) and the overall digital asset market succeed.\n\n\u201cThe key to investing in this ecosystem is diversification. Don\u2019t put all your eggs in one basket. You want to have a big chunk in Bitcoin, fine. But if you think about it, if Bitcoin is as successful as we all think it will be, it won\u2019t be the best performing, full stop. Just because it\u2019s the largest. It\u2019s just the law of large numbers. You\u2019re not going to go from $400 billion today \u2013 even if you go to $4 trillion, that\u2019s a 10 bagger. Ethereum at almost $200 billion \u2013 if it gets to a $4 trillion that\u2019s almost twice as much.\n\nBut if Avalanche actually becomes that intermediate layer, or becomes a bridge to connect Ethereum\u2026 it could be maybe 50x.\u201d\n\nAvalanche is changing hands at $18.02 at time of writing, a more than 68% increase from where it was at the start of the year. With a market cap of $5.7 billion, Avalanche is the 17th largest crypto asset.\n\nYusko also makes an analogy between the potential future infrastructure of crypto, and the internet\u2019s infrastructure, such as the Internet Protocol (IP), Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and World Wide Web (WWW).\n\nThe comparison is one reason he thinks these blockchain projects will survive the volatile markets and have an important utility in the crypto space.\n\n\u201cI can argue that on top of Web3 is\u2026 Bitcoin is the base layer, Filecoin is FTP, Ethereum is WWW and Cosmos, Polkadot, Avalanche are SMTP, HTTP, I don\u2019t know which ones.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nDoodles is one of the most prominent Ethereum NFT projects around, with colorful profile pictures (PFPs) that stand out on social media, more than $550 million in trading volume to date, and musician Pharrell Williams as its chief brand officer.\n\nBut for its next big drop, Doodles is heading to the Flow blockchain.\n\nToday, Doodles announced that its upcoming larger-scale Doodles 2 project will launch on Flow, the Web3 platform best known for sports NFT projects like NBA Top Shot and NFL All Day.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDoodles 2 was first announced last June at an NFT NYC event. It retains the pastel, cartoonish style of the original series and artist Scott \u201cBurnt Toast\u201d Martin, but is said to span millions of NFTs instead of the 10,000 avatars in the first Doodles series.\n\nIt will also let NFT holders endlessly customize their characters for use in games, on social media, and elsewhere. Owners of Doodles 2 NFTs will be able to personalize the look of their avatars, including the body, apparel, expression, and accessories.\n\nDoodles will release digital wearable items for the NFT avatars \u201cvia limited-edition IRL drops tied to specific events and brand collaborations,\u201d it said in a press release, with the items then tradeable on the Gaia marketplace on Flow.\n\nAt NFT NYC, the team said that Doodles 2 would launch on a different blockchain platform than Ethereum due to the customization element, as Ethereum mainnet transactions can carry expensive network gas fees. Some in the NFT space had speculated it would be Solana, or perhaps Polygon.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFlow is an unexpected pick, and a coup for Flow creator Dapper Labs. Doodles will be the first high-profile NFT project to start on Ethereum and shift over to Flow, which has seen dwindling NFT activity in recent months as its token price has fallen sharply. Dapper Labs laid off 22% of its team in November amid broader NFT market slowdown.\n\nIn its announcement today, Doodles said that the Flow launch will \u201cmark the start of a future of strong cross-interoperability with Ethereum.\" The launch of Doodles 2 NFTs will be tied to the existing Dooplicator NFTs on Ethereum that were offered free to existing Doodles NFT holders last June.\n\nA Doodles representative told Decrypt that Flow blockchain developers helped create an app-specific bridge for the project that lets NFT holders use their Doodles characters across the chains. If a collector connects an Ethereum wallet that holds both a Doodles NFT and Dooplicator NFT, then they can use the Dooplicator to create wearable customizations on Flow.\n\nThe bridge app will then prompt the user to connect a Dapper wallet on Flow to receive the wearables. The Doodles 2 rollout will begin on January 31 for existing Doodles NFT holders, the team said, with additional details to follow before then.\n\nInterestingly, Dapper Labs helped create Ethereum\u2019s NFT standard back in 2017, and its project CryptoKitties nearly took down the network as users flocked to collect and trade digital cats. Dapper decided to create its own blockchain platform as a result, and said in 2020 that it would also bridge CryptoKitties from Ethereum to Flow\u2014but that still hasn\u2019t happened.\n\nDoodles was valued at $704 million in September when it announced a $54 million fundraise led by Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian\u2019s Seven Seven Six firm, with participation from 10T Holdings, Acrew Capital, and the now-shuttered FTX Ventures.\n\nOn Monday, Doodles announced the acquisition of animation studio Golden Wolf, which has worked on projects for Disney, Adidas, Adult Swim, Nike, and PlayStation, among other brands. Golden Wolf previously produced the Doodles 2 animated teaser seen above.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin proposes a solution to the privacy problem on Ethereum - Forbes India",
        "content": "\n\n\n\nVitalik Buterin, one of the co-founders of Ethereum, has proposed a potential solution to the issue of privacy on Ethereum, which he considers to be the most significant remaining challenge for the platform.\n\n\n\nIn a blog post, Buterin acknowledged the need to develop a privacy solution because, by default, all information recorded on a public blockchain is publicly accessible.\n\nButerin suggested the idea of \"stealth addresses\" as a way to potentially anonymize various types of transactions on Ethereum, such as peer-to-peer transactions, non-fungible token transfers and Ethereum Name Service registrations, thus providing privacy to the users.\n\n\n\n\n\nButerin, in the blog post, explained how transactions on Ethereum can be made anonymously between two parties.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe process starts with the recipient generating and keeping a \"spending key\", which is then used to create a \"stealth meta-address.\" This meta-address is then given to the sender, who uses it to perform a computation and generate a \"stealth address\" that is of the receiver.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sender then transfers assets to the receiver's stealth address and publishes a temporary key to make sure that the stealth address belongs to the receiver. This results in a new stealth address being generated for each new transaction.\n\n\n\n\n\nButerin noted that to ensure the link between the stealth address and the user's meta-address is not publicly visible, a \"Diffie-Hellman key exchange\" and a \"key blinding mechanism\" must be implemented. He also added that a technology called ZK-SNARKs, which is a cryptographic-proof technology with built-in privacy features, could be used to transfer funds to pay for transaction fees.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Buterin pointed out that this solution may have its own drawbacks in the short term, as it would cost a lot of gas, potentially adding hundreds of thousands of gas to the cost of a single transfer.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe concept of stealth addresses has been proposed as a solution for on-chain privacy issues on Ethereum for several years, but few solutions have been implemented so far. This is not the first time that Buterin has discussed the use of stealth addresses in Ethereum.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn August, he described stealth addresses as a low-tech solution for anonymously transferring ownership of ERC-721 tokens, also known as non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe writer is the founder at yMedia. He ventured into crypto in 2013 and is an ETH maximalist. Twitter: @bhardwajshash"

        "content": "Although he\u2019s had a variety of jobs in the industry, including a stint as Arcane Asset\u2019s chief investment officer, Eric Wall is probably best known for shitposting and arguing with people on Crypto Twitter.\n\n\n\n\u201cJust like any other person, I\u2019m scrolling my Twitter feed, and then you see people saying dumb shit that is incorrect, and that is based on a lie. And then I just argue with that person, and then those arguments lead to long-form Medium articles,\u201d he says with just a faint trace of a Swedish accent.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just trying to correct \u2018incorrectness\u2019 in the space.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s been working on a super-secret project ever since he left Arcane early last year, so he doesn\u2019t have an official title apart from \u201cblockchain researcher\u201d and board member for Ethereum scaling solution the StarkNet Foundation.\n\nAfter arguing with people for years for free, more recently, Wall has been attempting to make money from challenging antagonists to a bet and has also (semi-literally) begun collecting the skulls of his enemies. \u201cThat has been paying off in tungsten cubes and actual money,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s multiple cryptocurrency communities who have me as their favorite hate object basically. They want to put you in your place. And they have all sorts of idiotic ideas.\u201d\n\nEric is the \u201cprime antagonist\u201d for Richard Heart and Hex. Source: Twitter\n\nWall recently moved to Portugal from Sweden, attracted by the crypto-friendly regulation and the lifestyle \u2014 and for safety reasons, after the next most prominent crypto personality in Sweden was physically attacked in an attempt to steal his crypto. He explains the tax system there is so transparent that anyone can look up your net wealth. \u201cIf you combine that with the fact you know they\u2019re into crypto, and it\u2019s very easy to pick out targets in Sweden,\u201d he says.\n\nWall says he paid for the rent on his new flat through the hatred of HEXicans. He\u2019s been at loggerheads with the HEX community since 2019 when founder Richard Heart explained the scheme to him. In February last year, he made a bet with HEXican Dixon Piper that HEX \u2014 then trading at $0.18 \u2014 wouldn\u2019t reach a new all-time high by February 2023.\n\nWhile he hasn\u2019t won yet (but almost certainly will, given HEX\u2019s current price), after HEX plunged to $0.04, he was able to hedge the bet and lock in a profit of $16,000 to pay for his apartment in Lisbon.\n\n\u201cI have this place now with just the most amazing view that I\u2019ve ever seen in my life. I see the entire Portuguese coast from that window, from that balcony. I can have these HEXicans telling me how stupid I am while looking at that view.\u201d\n\nUpdate: I rented my dream apartment in Portugal with it. https://t.co/HGGJZir4VM pic.twitter.com/5HbvANfl7J \u2014 Eric Wall (@ercwl) July 16, 2022\n\nSimilarly, he bet Blockstream CEO Adam Back that PlanB\u2019s \u201cfloor model\u201d was going to be wrong \u2014 which it was. \u201cSo, Adam had to pay up a tungsten cube with his face engraved into the cube,\u201d he says. He won another bet against Bitcoin Magazine\u2019s CK Snarks that the Ethereum Merge really would happen in 2022.\n\nHis plan is to build up a collection of 20 tungsten cubes with the faces of his vanquished foes so that people think twice about arguing. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be pretty intimidated,\u201d he says. \u201cDo you want to be the next face in this collection?\u201d\n\n2021 I won a tungsten cube from Adam Back over S2F/PlanB.\n\n\n\n2022 I won a tungsten cube from Christian Keroles (Managing Director at Bitcoin Magazine) over the Merge.\n\n\n\n2023 I plan to win against @bitcoinerrrrr over ETH withdrawals. pic.twitter.com/T2sIy2qolp \u2014 Eric Wall (@ercwl) January 9, 2023\n\nBitcoin maxi to mini\n\nWall is a recovering Bitcoin maximalist who was once known as the \u201caltcoin slayer\u201d for his brutal takedowns of altcoins during the era of ICOs. One of the most qualified critics in the space \u2014 he literally wrote his Master\u2019s thesis about blockchain \u2014 he can zero in on technological issues and communicate those problems effectively to less technical members of the crypto community.\n\nBack when he was pointing out that most ICO altcoins were centralized shitcoins with myriad security issues, he was a hero to Bitcoiners. But ever since he started busting myths about Ethereum and suggesting that Bitcoin was being left behind by smart contracts, scaling and NFTs, they\u2019ve liked him much less.\n\n(in case he deletes it)\n\ni'm enjoying this eric wall arc pic.twitter.com/Qd7lGrHW5j \u2014 Tony Link \u262f (\ud83d\udc99,\ud83e\udde1) (@chainlank) August 2, 2022\n\nAs you have no doubt gathered, Wall goes to great lengths to prove he is correct and once spent a month downloading an Ethereum node purely to bust the Bitcoiner myth that it took 8 terabytes of data to fully validate transactions.\n\n\u201cIt was extremely difficult, but it was possible, and it didn\u2019t take 8 terabytes of space on the hard drive.\u201d\n\nOne of the big reasons for the shift from maxi to mini (he\u2019s still a proponent of Bitcoin) is that Wall has been fascinated for years with building decentralized finance on an open and permissionless settlement layer. That was the essential subject of his thesis, and the need for decentralization to bring it about was only reinforced by seeing the limitations of permissioned blockchain platforms while working for Cinnober and Nasdaq. So, he was naturally drawn to the DeFi sector on Ethereum when it began to emerge in 2019.\n\nThat same year, it became clear that Ethereum and other blockchains could scale using zk-Rollups or optimistic fraud proofs, whereas Bitcoin had \u201calmost entirely abandoned\u201d the idea of doing anything with DeFi. So, he got behind DeFi on Ethereum.\n\n\u201cThat made me fall out of favor with Bitcoin maximalists because I was their golden kid: the one that was supposed to slay the altcoins, not one that was supposed to say actually, there is a use case here though, and this system actually does scale, and it\u2019s not as bad as you think.\u201d\n\nEric Wall. Source: LinkedIn\n\n\u201cSo, then I had to change Bitcoiners\u2019 understanding of the Ethereum system because they were now the ones that were spreading false facts about how the system works.\u201d\n\nHe concedes his former Bitcoiner friends think he\u2019s become a \u201cshitcoiner for financial motives.\u201d But Wall also wants to scale Bitcoin, too, and is involved in a research project with StarkNet and the Human Rights Foundation to investigate how to apply zk-Rollup scaling to Bitcoin, pondering \u201cwhat the benefits of that would be and how feasible it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, I am working on that, on trying to introduce that system and those technological benefits to Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s behind the Wall?\n\nWall was born in 1991 in the Swedish city of Link\u00f6ping and spent a gap year after high school traveling through Australia and Norway, working odd jobs from a deckhand on a luxury yacht to a \u201cchugger\u201d (charity mugger).\n\nHe studied computer engineering at Lund University, and his time there was notable for his organizational efforts as the \u201cfunmaker\u201d of \u201cSweden Silent Party,\u201d a series of silent disco events inspired by one the best nights of his life in Byron Bay. He also became one of the first Scandinavian engineers to write a Master\u2019s thesis about using blockchain to run a securities exchange in conjunction with local fintech Cinnober.\n\nEric Wall organized silent discos while at university. Source: Lund University\n\nHe was introduced to Bitcoin in his first year of university in 2011 by a classmate who showed him an article about darknet marketplace Silk Road. Buying Bitcoin at the time for $4 was a week-long process that required wiring money to Mt. Gox in Japan, so he gave up. A year later, Bitcoin had doubled to $8, and he thought he\u2019d \u201cmissed the boat.\u201d \u201cBut I became interested in this asset that increased 100% in one year\u201d and saw an opportunity to \u201cget an edge\u201d in a totally new asset class. He lost everything in Mt. Gox but gained a new career as a blockchain researcher and, later, blockchain lead at Cinnober.\n\nDuring his time there, and later at Nasdaq, he realized that companies or even countries weren\u2019t going to agree to create the sort of infrastructure required to build a genuinely decentralized, cross-jurisdictional system for the settlement of securities.\n\n\u201cIt needs to be something that the Chinese and the Japanese and the U.S. can use as a mutual system,\u201d he says. \u201cBut that was a gargantuan task. That\u2019s never going to happen from the inside. I understood that later. It has to be a system that comes from the outside and keeps growing.\u201d The only likely candidates were Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nHe told his bosses to put a hold on the enterprise blockchain stuff and to instead sell their incredibly fast matching engine tech to the big crypto exchanges. His colleagues thought crypto was a game or a joke \u2014 until Bitstamp turned up in a private jet.\n\n\u201cEven big stock exchange teams didn\u2019t spend that kind of money on a meeting with Cinnober,\u201d he says. \u201cThen they actually did take it seriously, and we did deliver a solution to them.\u201d\n\nMedia crypto commentator\n\nDuring this time, he also became the Swedish media\u2019s go-to guy for crypto commentary. He was determined to seize the opportunity but hated the stressful, anxiety-inducing process of appearing on live TV, so he\u2019d load up on valium to get through it.\n\n\u201cThen everything was fine. It didn\u2019t matter like getting a big camera in my face. I was completely zoned out,\u201d he says.\n\nEric sometimes adopts the persona of the slightly nicer Erica Wall online. Source: Twitter\n\n\u201cBut because I was so into crypto, I was doing crypto 17 hours a day. Even in that state, I could still articulate and explain everything about Bitcoin and what was going on even if I was only half conscious.\u201d\n\nIt was a similar story at crypto conferences, where Wall\u2019s ingrained Swedish standoffishness made the hundreds of brief interactions he had as a well-known figure quite stressful.\n\n\u201cFor them, they only get, like, five seconds with me on an escalator, and that\u2019s how they\u2019re going to remember me for years. So, I always feel like I want to deliver on that interaction. Which makes me feel a lot of pressure.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe\u2019s stopped taking meds these days after realizing he was meeting the same people multiple times at conferences and forgetting them.\n\n\u201cI have realized that now, at this point, like, I\u2019m gonna just be natural. I think I feel comfortable. I\u2019ve overcome my Swedishness eventually.\u201d\n\nNasdaq takeover\n\nCinnober was eventually taken over by Nasdaq in early 2019 for $190 million, and Wall found himself in a massive bureaucratic organization with little agency and lots of rules.\n\n\u201cAfter Nasdaq acquired, they told us, well, \u2018The great thing about Nasdaq is you\u2019re never gonna have more than six bosses above\u2026\u2019 It\u2019s a very flat organization,\u201d he says with dry humor. \u201cEvery tweet that I wrote had to go through the Nasdaq approval department.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Wall was fighting with multiple token projects online about their hyped claims. \u201cI thought that I was doing something very important,\u201d he explains. One notable conflict, still running today, was with the Iota founders after he argued in a 2017 Medium post saying the protocol does not provide any censorship resistance and is centralized around the Iota foundation\u2019s coordinator node.\n\nThis guy bet me 1 BTC that IOTA would disable the Coordinator in 2018 based on a technology I had debunked in detail how it was fraudulent (it was admitted years later and the CTO was fired and the project completely redesigned)\u2014yet he is upset me with *me* for wasting his time. https://t.co/MufJ6E0b0U \u2014 Eric Wall (@ercwl) November 25, 2022\n\nUnfortunately, Iota was also being considered by the Swedish Central Bank to help create a central bank digital currency, so Wall\u2019s online antics were not considered politically helpful.\n\n\u201cPeople were lying about what their technology could do, and you still had to treat them as respected industry participants, which I wasn\u2019t going to do. So, I didn\u2019t ask for permission from Nasdaq to tweet, and it ended up with us going our separate ways.\u201d\n\nArcane Assets\n\nWall then decided the best way to participate in the blockchain revolution was to participate in the economy, \u201cSo, I changed strategy and became a hedge fund manager,\u201d he says.\n\nIt\u2019s quite the leap from engineer to trader, and Wall tried and abandoned a variety of approaches. Initially, he learned technical analysis, using rules-based trading around indicators like Bollinger Bands and moving average convergence/divergence. But after writing an algorithm to backtest the rules, he realized they performed no better than random chance. Similarly, he thinks most charts and models are ludicrous, which is why he constantly jokes about the superiority of the Rainbow Chart (\u201chas emoji\u201d).\n\n1/15 Today, I'm comparing the two currently most popular bitcoin price models: Rainbow chart vs S2F!\n\n\n\nRainbow chart:\n\n\u2705 Tried & tested log regression (2014)\n\n\u2705 Never changed\n\n\u2705 Has emoji \ud83c\udf08\n\n\n\nS2F:\n\n\u274c New & complex (2019)\n\n\u274c Changes often\n\n\u274c Sounds like a sex position\n\n\n\nA thread \ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/1Td6pZXPM4 \u2014 Eric Wall (@ercwl) April 15, 2020\n\nThen he moved on to investigating the technological fundamentals of projects to guide investment decisions, only to see his returns totally dwarfed by people who invested based on what the logo looked like. He\u2019s since settled on a new approach to trading: Work out what unsophisticated investors will buy in the future and buy it first.\n\n\u201cThe price is driven by just social factors. Basically, there\u2019s no fundamentals,\u201d he explains. \u201cWhen I go out and I write some articles about a particular technology component in some cryptocurrency that undermines the whole value proposition, that\u2019s a completely different thought process than the investment process. The investment process is just about, well, are people going to buy it?\u201d\n\nBut having to explain to his serious hedge fund bosses that he was buying tokens because he thought the masses would buy any old token with a dog on it, was tricky.\n\n\u201cThat was one of the things that I didn\u2019t like so much. These are regulated, traditional \u2018we run a pretty posh hedge fund that took capital from institutional level investors\u2019 and they don\u2019t want to hear: \u2018Well, people like the dog picture.\u2019 But that\u2019s how the market works.\u201d\n\nHe recalls investigating whether investing based on the viral growth of crypto hashtags on TikTok could be a path to riches, but the fund wouldn\u2019t give the strategy the go-ahead. Instead, Arcane insisted he invest based on rules and a checklist \u201cto make it an institutional-grade crypto fund that avoided all the bullshit.\u201d\n\n\u201cProblem is if you avoid all the bullshit, you avoid most of the profit.\u201d\n\nSo, again, Wall found himself chafing at the requirements of working for a big organization.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m like a degen in my blood. I think that the cryptocurrency space moves extremely fast, and you have to be as nimble as the space is. If the market one day says \u2018Okay, but screw all the technology \u2014 we\u2019re trading pictures of monkeys now,\u2019 you have to make the decision extremely fast that monkeys is what it is all about.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, if I\u2019m going to do something else, now it\u2019s going to be somewhere where the mandate is completely open.\u201d\n\nHe handed in his resignation in the first quarter of 2022 to work on a super-secret project that he\u2019s yet to reveal even a year on.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m now in the process of doing something else that hasn\u2019t been announced yet,\u201d is all he\u2019ll reveal."

The unlocking event represented 1.812% of the asset\u2019s total supply and was worth more than $60 million at current prices.\n\nThe recent price action of AXS flies in the face of conventional wisdom about token unlocks, which give investors opportunities to sell digital assets after vesting periods expire. Traditionally, token unlocks are viewed as bearish catalysts.\n\nAxie Infinity\u2019s next token-unlocking event will occur on April 17th. The unlock will represent 1.45% of the asset\u2019s total supply (worth nearly $50 million at time of writing), according to TokenUnlocks.\n\nAXS is up more than 100% since the start of 2023 when it was trading around $6.00.

Source: TradingView\n\nInterestingly, Ether\u2019s pullback versus Bitcoin has landed its price at the bottom of its EMA ribbon range, as shown below.\n\nETH/BTC weekly candle price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe EMA ribbon indicator shows numerous exponential moving averages of increasing timeframe on the same price chart. Dropping below the ribbon range increases an asset\u2019s likelihood of seeing an extended down-move.\n\nIn other words, breaking lower would increase its possibility of declining by more than 20% from its current price levels.\n\nConversely, rising above the ribbon range raises the asset\u2019s chances of a broader rally.\n\nEther\u2019s price capped by key descending trendline\n\nThis week, ETH/BTC dropped to the 55-week exponential moving average (the red wave) \u2014 a bottom wave \u2014 of its EMA ribbon indicator, as shown below. Buyers took control near the 55-week EMA, prompting Ether to recover a mere 0.35% versus Bitcoin to 0.0708 BTC on Jan. 24.\n\nRelated: This $25K BTC price target would spell misery for Bitcoin shorters\n\nBut now, the likelihood of retesting the EMA ribbon bottom is high due to a multi-month descending trendline resistance (black trendline in the chart below), where sellers have been more active as of late.\n\nETH/BTC weekly price chart focusing on descending trendline resistance.

        "content": "A \u201ctemperature check\u201d proposal to deploy the Uniswap v3 protocol to BNB Chain received overwhelming support from the Uniswap community on its governance forum.\n\n80% of voters holding Uniswap\u2019s UNI (UNI) governance token have voted in favor of deploying the third version of the decentralized exchange protocol on BNB Chain, a rival of the Ethereum network.\n\nIn a proposal posted on Jan. 17, Ilia Maksimenka, CEO of the decentralized finance protocol Plasma Finance, argued why the Uniswap v3 protocol should be deployed to BNB Chain, writing:\n\n\u201cWe believe this is the right moment for Uniswap to deploy on BNB PoS Chain, for many reasons (one of them is License expiration).\u201d\n\nAfter the discussion on the governance forum, the Uniswap community conducted a \u201ctemperature check\u201d poll to see if the community approved of the idea. Eighty percent of the votes were in favor of the deployment, while the remaining 20% voted against it.\n\nBlockchain software firm ConsenSys supported the move. According to Cameron O\u2019Donnell, DAO governance strategist at ConsenSys, the firm views the brand of the protocol as \u201cstandalone and not beholden to any particular chain\u201d despite centralization concerns. O\u2019Donnell explained:\n\n\u201cRegardless of personal views, Uniswap entering the BSC market will provide current and future users with a secure and established medium for decentralized exchange.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the ConsenSys executive also said that the firm believes that it\u2019s important for Uniswap to be \u201cchain agnostic\u201d to better serve all users within the Web3 space.\n\nFollowing the approval of the governance proposal, the Plasma Finance team estimates that the deployment of the necessary smart contracts to BNB Chain may take around five to seven weeks.\n\nRelated: BMW taps Coinweb and BNB chain for blockchain loyalty program\n\nOn Dec. 22, BNB Chain surpassed the Ethereum network in the number of unique addresses. BSC Scan data showed that the blockchain had 233 million addresses compared with the 217 million unique addresses on Ethereum. However, while the chain claims to be \u201cthe largest layer 1 blockchain,\u201d the numbers are far from the Bitcoin network\u2019s 1 billion unique addresses.\n\nUpdate: A part of the article has been updated to reflect that the proposal in question is to check the community's interest in using BNB Chain for v3 protocol deployment, which is the first of three votes required to pass a governance proposal."

This milestone comes ahead of the scheduled upgrade for the Shanghai network, set to take place at the end of the first quarter of 2023.\n\nThere are now over 503k active Proof-of-Stake Validators on the #Ethereum beacon chain. The total number of new, or exiting validators is capped each day, depending on the validator pool size. The current limit is 1575 validators/day. ? Live Dashboard: https://t.co/bsdjS0vv0Q pic.twitter.com/lijbqXNMXM \u2014 glassnode (@glassnode) January 24, 2023\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nAccording to data from the on-chain data provider, the number of validators on the PoS chain grew by 76% on a year-over-year basis. Since the Merge on 15 September 2022, this has increased by about 20%.\n\nState of the PoS network\n\nThose looking tp become a validator on the Ethereum PoS network need to deposit 32 ETH into the Ethereum 2.0 contract. As of this writing, the total number of ETH deposited into this contract by validators running the network was 16.23 million ETH, per data from Glassnode.\n\nThis represented 13% of the altcoin\u2019s current circulating supply of 120.53 million ETH. With more validators joining the network, the total value of ETH deposited into the Ethereum 2.0 deposit contract grew by 78% in the last year.\n\nValidators on the Ethereum PoS network are grouped into sets of committees and block proposers for each 32-slot Epoch. A validator on the committee is responsible for producing blocks for each 12-second slot.\n\nThese validators are automatically organized into sets of committees and block proposers for each 32-slot Epoch. A validator in a committee is charged with the duty of producing blocks for each 12-second slot. However, if the assigned validator is unavailable, it results in a missed block.\n\nFUD overruns the market\n\nData from Glassnode revealed that the number of missed blocks on the PoS network has decreased by 90% since its daily peak of 259 missed blocks on 6 September, 2022. In the last year, this fell by 54%.\n\nFurther, to ensure that the PoS network runs optimally, there has to be a high degree of participation by validators on the network. According to Glassnode, a high participation rate indicates a reliable validator node uptime and, thus, fewer missed blocks and superior block space efficiency.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nSince the temporary slip of participation rate on the network to 97% on 7 December 2022, it regained its spot at 99%, where it sat at the time of writing. This meant that almost all the network validators were actively participating in the block production process.\n\nAccording to data from Santiment, a significant surge in the alt\u2019s social dominance was spotted on-chain. A sudden spike in this metric typically suggests widespread euphoria in the market. This is followed by a decline in an asset\u2019s price.\n\nAmid a market-wide dip, ETH\u2019s price declined by 5% in the last 24 hours."

        "title": "Where in the World is Ethereum? - This Morning On Chain",
        "content": "We broke down where the bulk of Ethereum nodes are run, and the amount of centralization is pretty surprising.\n\nThe Ethereum network is obviously distributed across the globe, and anyone holding 32 ETH is capable of running a node and contributing to the network. Even if you don\u2019t have 32 ETH, you can stake on managed nodes, using exchange hosted nodes (Coinbase for example) or projects like Rocketpool. However, there has been concern about Ethereum\u2019s concentration.\n\nEthereum nodes are really top heavy when it comes to distribution by country. The US is nearly half the network. Given that, I can kind of understand why the DOJ felt like they could sanction crypto mixers like Tornado Cash. Here\u2019s the breakdown by country:\n\nEthereum Node Percentage by Country:\n\nUnited States (46.7%)\n\nGermany (11.9%)\n\nSingapore (4.5%)\n\nUnited Kingdom (3.7%)\n\nJapan (2.9%)\n\nIf you\u2019re going to run your own node, you\u2019re going to want some threshold of tech skills and operational management. The easiest way for most people to do this is through a cloud provider, like Amazon Web Services (AWS). Essentially you pay AWS to run the machine and keep it online, then you can log on and do whatever you want within that machine. Using a service like AWS means you don\u2019t have to worry about your computer going down, so your node will always be active. Prior to services like this, you would have to manually restart your service if something happened, meaning you\u2019d lose yield.\n\nGiven how easy and reliable running a node on these cloud providers has become, it\u2019s the go-to option. That means most of the Ethereum nodes are not just concentrated by country\u2013they\u2019re concentrated by data center. Here\u2019s where the hosting of these nodes come from:\n\nEthereum Node Percentage by Network Type:\n\nHosting\u2013Mostly Cloud Provider (64%)\n\nOf this, 62% is AWS\n\nResidential\u2013People\u2019s Homes (33.1%)\n\nBusiness (2%)\n\nThe crazy thing about this distribution is how concentrated nodes are within countries due to major cloud hosting services using their own large data centers. In the United States, 45% of all nodes are in Ashburn, Virginia. A town of 46,349 people hosts nearly half of all the Ethereum nodes in the country because that is where Amazon\u2019s primary East coast datacenter lives.\n\nUltimately, I think the risk around Ethereum centralization is overstated. We have to balance the level of centralization with the rate of progress we want to make, and I\u2019m not concerned about the scale Ethereum is at. But decentralization junkies do have a point, a single disaster could take out 45% of the Ethereum nodes in an instant."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe former lead of Ark Invest's crypto department, Chris Burniske, believes Solana and Ethereum can be used as more than trading and investment instruments but also as risk indicators. Here's how.\n\nCrypto risk spectrum\n\nAccording to the analyst, the SOL/ETH trading pair can be used as a key indicator of the crypto risk spectrum or, simply put, a tool to evaluate the risk tolerance of cryptocurrency investors on the market. Considering that both Solana and Ethereum are historically far more volatile than Bitcoin, using them to determine if the current risk level on the market is beneficial.\n\n$SOLETH has become a key indicator of crypto risk-spectrum appetite for me, alongside the OG of $ETHBTC. \u2014 Chris Burniske (@cburniske) January 24, 2023\n\nHowever, Solana and Ethereum are not only assets that can be used as risk indicators. The cryptocurrency market as a whole is a reflection of risk tolerance among investors. Digital assets are extremely volatile and sometimes illiquid, which makes crypto investors extremely vulnerable to double-digit swings, especially if margin trading is in effect. Those who expose themselves to such instruments are considered risk tolerant from the standpoint of a traditional investor.\n\n\"Doesn't look like it wants to stop\"\n\nAccording to Burniske, it seems like ETH to SOL does not look like it will be retracing any time soon, suggesting that appetite for risk is going to move upward only, instead of going down. However, considering cryptocurrency' s market dependency from stocks and traditional markets in general, Solana or Ethereum should not be considered as market-moving assets or indicators.\n\nIn the last few weeks, the cryptocurrency market had an enormous and explosive rally that led to numerous breakthroughs and helped assets to reach important resistance levels that, if broken, will most likely lead to long-term reversals and the beginning of a prolonged new bull market."

        "content": "The broader crypto market is off to a good start in 2023, and Ethereum has been enjoying a smooth uptrend with the rest of the community. There are multiple factors behind Ethereum\u2019s growth at the moment, including ETH\u2019s increased burn rate and a clear growth of ETH address balances.\n\nHowever, one of the main driving forces behind ETH\u2019s momentum over the last few weeks is the blockchain\u2019s upcoming Shanghai Upgrade. This update will allow users to withdraw their staked ETH and their respective staking rewards, which have been locked on the protocol since 2020.\n\nTo reach this goal without any hiccups, Ethereum recently implemented the \u2018Withdrawal-Mainnet-Shadow-Fork-1.\u2019 In this article, we will discuss what this shadow fork is and how it will help Ethereum realise one of its biggest updates since the Merge in 2022.\n\nWhat is Ethereum\u2019s mainnet shadow fork?\n\nOn January 23, Ethereum developer Marius Van Der Wijden announced the successful launch of the \u2018Withdrawal-Mainnet-Shadow-Fork-1.\u2019 The shadow fork will allow developers to test the waters before the upcoming Shanghai upgrade. The trial environment is a fork of the mainnet and is only used for testing the network; it is not a parallel or a separate blockchain.\n\nMainnet shadow forks are conducted as previews or rehearsals of upcoming upgrades. They allow the developers to identify any flaws or glitches and resolve them before the upgrade is implemented. As such, Ethereum\u2019s shadow fork will help developers determine the preparedness of the ETH staking withdrawal feature.\n\nAccording to Wijden\u2019s tweet, the shadow fork was taken live successfully after ironing out a couple of glitches. \u201cWithdrawal-Mainnet-Shadow-Fork-1 is finalising. It started with a few issues because the config wasn't correctly applied on geth (we disallow overriding the mainnet config). The config is applied correctly, and all nodes are in agreement. We will start some evil nodes,\u201d wrote Wijden.\n\nAmong many things other things, Ethereum core developers Van Der Wijden and Potuz will be creating malicious nodes that will try to convince other nodes on the network to follow a false iteration of the blockchain. The purpose or objective is to see if malicious entities can threaten or harm the network during the upgrade or after it.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade is the first major upgrade to be implemented on the blockchain since the iconic Ethereum Merge which took place in September 2022. The Merge saw Ethereum transition from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. The transition enabled users to stake their ETH and earn the rights of validating transactions on the blockchain. In exchange for that, the users will be rewarded with freshly minted ETH.\n\nHowever, users can only withdraw their staked and rewarded ETH once the Shanghai upgrade is completed. Therefore, testing the upgrade is incredibly essential, especially with more than $26 billion worth of tokens currently staked on Ethereum.\n\nConclusion"

        "content": "How to Use the Arbitrum Bridge to Transfer ETH from Ethereum to Arbitrum?\n\nAs we move further towards a multi-chain ecosystem, bridging tokens between different blockchain platforms is becoming an increasingly common task. One of the platforms you\u2019re most likely going to be bridging to is Arbitrum, a layer 2 that functions on top of Ethereum. The reason why you\u2019ll likely want to bridge your crypto to Arbitrum is because the platform offers much lower fees and faster transactions.\n\nBridging tokens from the Ethereum mainnet to Arbitrum is a simple process, although there are some details you have to look out for. In this article, we\u2019ll be demonstrating how to add Arbitrum to your MetaMask wallet and showing you how to use the Arbitrum bridge to transfer your ETH from the Ethereum mainnet to Arbitrum.\n\nBefore we get started with bridging ETH to Arbitrum, let\u2019s do a quick refresher on what Arbitrum actually is.\n\nWhat is Arbitrum?\n\nArbitrum is a layer 2 platform providing a faster and cheaper alternative to Ethereum. Transactions made on Arbitrum are executed off-chain for better performance, but get posted on the Ethereum blockchain in the form of rollups. More specifically, the scaling technique underpinning Arbitrum is called optimistic rollups.\n\nThe Arbitrum mainnet was launched in September 2021, and is currently going through a gradual launch. The Arbitrum platform is not yet fully decentralized, as it relies on a permissioned set of validators at the moment. The plan is to gradually decentralize Arbitrum over time if the platform proves itself to be reliable and working as expected.\n\nHowever, developers are already able to deploy fully-fledged decentralized applications on Arbitrum with the same smart contract functionality that\u2019s available on the Ethereum mainnet. In fact, you can use decentralized applications on Arbitrum right now to save on transaction fees.\n\nThe Arbitrum project is being developed by a company called Offchain Labs. The two main products they are working on are Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova. To avoid any confusion, we should note that the layer 2 platform that we are referring to throughout this article is technically called Arbitrum One. However, we\u2019ll just be calling it \u201cArbitrum\u201d, as that\u2019s how it\u2019s broadly referred to in the crypto community.\n\nWhy would you want to bridge to Arbitrum?\n\nLow fees and fast transactions\n\nThe main reason to use Arbitrum is to benefit from faster transactions and lower fees compared to the Ethereum mainnet. Arbitrum is fully compatible with the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine), which means that any smart contract that can be deployed on Ethereum can also be deployed on Arbitrum.\n\nThe number of unique addresses on Arbitrum has been growing rapidly. Image source: Arbiscan\n\nAt the time of writing, sending ETH on Arbitrum will cost you about $0.05 per transaction, compared to $0.75 on Ethereum. The savings are even more impressive when it comes to swapping tokens. A token swap on Arbitrum currently costs about $0.13 in fees, compared to $3.74 on Ethereum.\n\nSo, if you plan to do a lot of ETH transactions or make multiple token swaps, Arbitrum is definitely worth considering. The decentralized application ecosystem on Arbitrum is quite impressive as well, as you can find popular protocols such as Uniswap, Aave, 1inch, Curve and many others on Arbitrum.\n\nThere\u2019s also some decentralized applications that are available on Arbitrum, but not the Ethereum mainnet. One such example is GMX, a popular decentralized derivatives exchange.\n\nYou might get an airdrop in the future\n\nA less obvious reason why you would want to use Arbitrum is the possibility of a future Arbitrum airdrop. The Arbitrum platform doesn\u2019t have its own token, which is why many members of the crypto community are speculating that an Arbitrum token might be launched in the future.\n\nIf an Arbitrum token launch does happen in the future, there\u2019s a decent chance that it would be distributed through a \u201cretroactive airdrop\u201d, where a snapshot of past transactions on Arbitrum would be used to distribute tokens to users.\n\nSo, if you use the Arbitrum platform today, there\u2019s a chance that you could get free tokens in the future if there is an Arbitrum airdrop. Please keep in mind that this scenario is purely speculative, as the Arbitrum project hasn\u2019t actually announced any plans to launch an Arbitrum token.\n\nHow to move ETH from Ethereum to Arbitrum\n\nNow, we\u2019ll show you how to move ETH from Ethereum to Arbitrum using the Arbitrum bridge.\n\nStep 1: Add Arbitrum to MetaMask\n\nBefore you can get started with using Arbitrum, you should set up your cryptocurrency wallet to support the Arbitrum network. We recommend using MetaMask, as it provides a convenient way to store your crypto in a non-custodial manner. Adding Arbitrum to MetaMask is easy, and we\u2019ll show you exactly how to do it.\n\nThe easiest way to connect your MetaMask wallet to Arbitrum is to simply go to the Arbitrum Bridge website at https://bridge.arbitrum.io/ and select \u201cArbitrum One\u201d in the dropdown menu. This will automatically prompt your MetaMask wallet to ask you if you wish to connect to Arbitrum.\n\nAs you can see, all the necessary information is already filled in. After clicking \u201cApprove\u201d, you will be prompted to switch the current network your MetaMask is connected to from Ethereum to Arbitrum. You can of course switch your MetaMask back to Ethereum any time you like.\n\nYou can also connect MetaMask to Arbitrum manually\n\nYou can also connect your MetaMask wallet to Arbitrum manually, if you wish. Click on your profile picture in your MetaMask wallet, and select \u201cSettings\u201d.\n\nIn the \u201cSettings\u201d menu, choose \u201cNetworks\u201d and then click \u201cAdd Network\u201d. Choose \u201cAdd network manually\u201d.\n\nHere are the details you need to connect your MetaMask to Arbitrum:\n\nNetwork Name: Arbitrum One\n\nNew RPC URL: https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc\n\nChain ID: 42161\n\nCurrency symbol: ETH\n\nBlock explorer URL: https://arbiscan.io\n\nStep 2: Bridge tokens\n\nOnce your MetaMask is set up to use the Arbitrum network, you\u2019re ready to bridge ETH from the Ethereum mainnet to Arbitrum.\n\nNote: Moving ETH from Ethereum to Arbitrum is fast. However, ETH withdrawals from Arbitrum back to the Ethereum network take approximately 7 days to finalize. Please keep this in mind any time you\u2019re bridging funds.\n\nHead over to the Arbitrum bridge at https://bridge.arbitrum.io/.\n\nMake sure that the \u201cFrom\u201d network is \u201cMainnet\u201d and the \u201cTo\u201d network is \u201cArbitrum One\u201d. Input the amount of ETH that you want to bridge over to Arbitrum. Make sure to consider the gas fee ($2.13 in our example) before approving the transaction.\n\nIf everything looks good to go, click \u201cMove funds to Arbitrum One\u201d.\n\nYour MetaMask wallet will pop up with the details of the transaction. If everything checks out, press \u201cConfirm\u201d to continue.\n\nAfter clicking \u201cConfirm\u201d, the Arbitrum bridge website will notify you that the bridging transaction is currently taking place, and will provide you with an estimate of how long it will take.\n\nOnce the bridging is complete, you\u2019ll be able to use Arbitrum-based decentralized applications with the ETH that you just transferred over. You can use the Arbiscan block explorer to view transactions on the Arbitrum network.\n\nYou can also get ETH to Arbitrum through centralized crypto exchanges\n\nAbove, we showed you how to get funds to Arbitrum using your own wallet. However, there\u2019s also an alternative method available. Some centralized exchanges have added support for the Arbitrum network, allowing users to withdraw funds from the exchange directly to Arbitrum.\n\nSome examples of exchanges that support withdrawals to Arbitrum include:\n\nIf you have ETH on any of these exchanges, you can withdraw it directly to Arbitrum if you wish to do so. Of course, you will also need to set up a wallet for the Arbitrum network beforehand in order to receive the funds and actually use Arbitrum.\n\nThe bottom line\u2014Moving ETH to Arbitrum will allow you to enjoy fast and cheap transactions\n\nBy using the Arbitrum bridge, you can easily move ETH from the Ethereum mainnet over to the Arbitrum layer 2. This will enable you to utilize decentralized applications on the Arbitrum network with much lower transaction costs than what you would have been paying on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nYou can bridge your ETH over to Arbitrum directly with your wallet, or use a centralized exchange that allows you to withdraw ETH to Arbitrum directly. Many leading cryptocurrency exchanges, including Binance, now support this feature.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in learning more about Arbitrum and the chances of an Arbitrum token being released in the future, check out our article that will tell you everything you need to know about the potential Arbitrum airdrop."

        "content": "The whales on Curve Finance have requested for more gauges to be added to Ethereum.\n\nCRV was significantly overbought at press time and might be due for a price correction.\n\nFollowing a request from whale addresses on its platform, Ethereum-based decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Curve Finance has put forward a proposal to add more gauges to its liquidity pools on Ethereum.\n\nAfter seeing how well v2 pools work with different tokens given enough liquidity, there was a request from whales for more gauges on Ethereum. Adding one per several weeks, we start that batch with MATIC/ETH \u2013 up for a vote now!https://t.co/LAnrvFSNJh \u2014 Curve Finance (@CurveFinance) January 22, 2023\n\nThe gauge system on Curve Finance measures the liquidity of a particular pool or set of pools on the platform. The gauges are used to determine a given pool\u2019s stability fee (or interest rate), with pools with lower gauges having a higher stability fee. With gauges on Curve Finance, liquidity is distributed evenly among its pools.\n\nRead Curve Finance\u2019s [CRV] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nAccording to Curve Finance, the request for adding more gauges to the Ethereum Network was due to the success of its V2 pools made up of different tokens with sufficient liquidity. These gauges will be added by adding one gauge per several weeks, starting with the MATIC/ETH, Curve Finance said.\n\nAdding more gauges to the Ethereum network on the Curve Finance platform will expand the number of pools available for users, providing more options for exchanging various assets.\n\nAs of this writing, all 22 votes cast were in favor of adding more gauges.\n\nCRV amongst the top gainers\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, the Curve DAO Token [CRV] saw a 20.89% increase in value over the past week, making it one of the top five cryptocurrencies with the highest gains during this period. As of this writing, the altcoin traded at $1.08, having seen a 7% price jump in the last 24 hours.\n\nAs the overall cryptocurrency market has been showing positive sentiment since the start of the year, the number of unique addresses trading CRV tokens has increased since 1 January.\n\nAdditionally, there has been a significant rise in demand for the token as the daily number of new CRV addresses created has increased by 103%.\n\nWith increased CRV accumulation since the year started, the alt was overbought at press time. Its Relative Strength Index (RSI) was 84.60 Its Money Flow Index (MFI) was spotted at its highest position ever, 100.\n\nAt these significantly overbought highs, a price correction is common. Buyers typically find it challenging to support any further price rally at these highs, and the bears often return to the market to initiate a price drawdown.\n\nA look at the alt\u2019s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) confirmed this. At press time, CRV\u2019s CMF was spotted in a downtrend, although still above the center line.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the CRV Profit Calculator\n\nWhen an asset\u2019s CMF is trending downward while the price of the asset is increasing, it can indicate that the asset\u2019s price is rising on weak buying pressure. It means that the asset is being bought by a smaller number of investors or that the buying pressure needs to be stronger to support the price increase.\n\nThis typically suggests that the asset is overbought and that a price correction is more than likely to occur."

        "content": "2022 was a year of bloodied crypto markets that had exchanges and investors alike mopping up investment losses. Many large crypto-currencies lost their fair share in value. The global crypto-industry had to contend with tighter wallets from investors on account of inflation and federal rate hikes.\n\nApart from macro trends, a singular event but just as bad for crypto-markets was the downfall of the second largest crypto-exchange, FTX. While this caught the attention of news portals and social media, this was not the first crypto firm to go in 2022.\n\nBefore FTX, many others called it quits due to poor collateral value or questionable investment practices. Some of these firms were Voyager Capital, Celsius, 3AC etc. Their losses were in the hundreds of millions.\n\nAccording to CNBC sources, these coins fell hard in their value:\n\nTerra: -100%\n\nSolana: -93%\n\nAMP: -93%\n\nCardano: -80%\n\nEther: -67%\n\nBitcoin: -63%\n\nDogecoin: -55%\n\nHowever, not all hope is lost. 2023 holds promise with coins like Bitcoin and Ethererum showing an upward tick in their prices.\n\nThe current price of Ethererum is $1636, an increase of 37% from $1195 at the start of the year (Jan 1st, 2023). Bitcoin is up 39% and fixed at a current price of $23,059.62. Both cryptos were tied through correlation in 2022 and seem to be now as well, which means if Bitcoin goes up, Ethereum goes up as well.\n\nThis positive trend may have extended to other cryptocurrencies as well. Solana has increased in price but most of the established coins in the market remain well below their previous peaks.\n\nNew meme coin offers a potential investment to crypto-enthusiasts\n\nShiba Inu was recently delisted in trading pairs from Binance. Perhaps Big Eyes Coin, a new and popular meme coin, can interest old and new crypto-investors alike.\n\nBig Eyes is a new community meme coin that is devoted to increasing the wealth of its members. It is not entirely profit based. Big Eyes has a humanitarian mission as well: saving the oceans and all its swimming inhabitants. According to its whitepaper, a charity wallet holding 5% of tokens will be held in place for donations to humanitarian organizations. Another 5% will be kept aside for marketing, an overhead expense necessary to keep Big Eyes company operations running.\n\nNFTs will be a huge part of this coin\u2019s offerings and gifted to anyone who joins as a community member. The cat friendly coin will have a supply of 200 billion tokens and 80% of the total supply will be available at launch.\n\nThe presale of the token has raised $17.44 million so far from investors, large enough to hint at possible upside to anyone who buys the token.\n\nFor All Things Big Eyes Coin (BIG)\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nDisclaimer: This article is not investment advice.

        "content": "The FBI is pinning the blame for a $100 million cryptocurrency heist last June on the Lazarus Group, a team associated with the North Korean government that is notorious for stealing cryptocurrency to help support that country\u2019s military and weapons programs.\n\nOn Tuesday, the FBI released a statement identifying Lazarus Group, also known as APT38, as the culprit for the June 24 attack on the Harmony Horizon bridge that resulted in the loss of $100 million in Ethereum. The Harmony Horizon bridge is a connection between various cryptocurrency systems, specifically Harmony and Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Binance Chain. In June, attackers were able to gain access to the bridge and make off with the Ethereum.\n\n\u201cThe Harmony team has identified a theft occurring this morning on the Horizon bridge amounting to approx. $100MM. We have begun working with national authorities and forensic specialists to identify the culprit and retrieve the stolen funds,\u201d Harmony said at the time of the incident.\n\nThe FBI, along with the Department of Justice\u2019s National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team, and various United States attorney\u2019s offices has been investigating the Harmony heist and on Tuesday said that the Lazarus Group was responsible for the attack and had used its malware tool known as TraderTraitor as part of the operation.\n\n\u201cOn Friday, January 13, 2023, North Korean cyber actors used RAILGUN, a privacy protocol, to launder over $60 million worth of ethereum (ETH) stolen during the June 2022 heist. A portion of this stolen ethereum was subsequently sent to several virtual asset service providers and converted to bitcoin (BTC),\u201d the FBI said in a statement.\n\n\u201cOn Friday, January 13, 2023, North Korean cyber actors used RAILGUN, a privacy protocol, to launder over $60 million worth of ethereum (ETH) stolen during the June 2022 heist.\"\n\nThe Lazarus Group has been operating for many years and is closely associated with the government of North Korea and typically operates in support of the government\u2019s interests. The group\u2019s best-known operation was an attack on the Bank of Bangladesh in 2016 that netted it $81 million and Lazarus has continued to target banks and crypto exchanges in the ensuing years.\n\nTraderTraitor is actually a group of tools that Lazarus Group uses in many of its intrusions at cryptocurrency firms, exchanges, and other targets. Those operations often start with the attackers sending phishing emails to employees at a target firm, trying to entice them into downloading a file that includes the malware.\n\n\u201cThe messages often mimic a recruitment effort and offer high-paying jobs to entice the recipients to download malware-laced cryptocurrency applications, which the U.S. government refers to as \u2018TraderTraitor\u2019,\u201d CISA said in an advisory in April.\n\n\u201cThe term TraderTraitor describes a series of malicious applications written using cross-platform JavaScript code with the Node.js runtime environment using the Electron framework. The malicious applications are derived from a variety of open-source projects and purport to be cryptocurrency trading or price prediction tools. TraderTraitor campaigns feature websites with modern design advertising the alleged features of the applications.\u201d\n\nThe Lazarus Group has used TraderTraitor in a number of intrusions and has found quite a bit of success with it. They also have used other tools, including an older macOS backdoor called AppleJeus.\n\n\u201cThe Lazarus Group used AppleJeus trojanized cryptocurrency applications targeting individuals and companies\u2014including cryptocurrency exchanges and financial services companies\u2014through the dissemination of cryptocurrency trading applications that were modified to include malware that facilitates theft of cryptocurrency. These actors will likely continue exploiting vulnerabilities of cryptocurrency technology firms, gaming companies, and exchanges to generate and launder funds to support the North Korean regime,\u201d the CISA advisory says.\n\nThe FBI said it worked with some of the exchanges to which the Lazarus Group moved the Bitcoin from the Harmony intrusion to freeze those assets."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nA major player like auto brand Porsche entering the Web3 space is typically a cause for celebration among NFT collectors. However, pre-launch concern quickly evolved into a 1,800-NFT pileup this week when Porsche\u2019s pricey NFT drop fell well short of selling out, forcing the brand to announce plans to shift gears and cut the supply.\n\nPorsche\u2019s project focused on the German automaker\u2019s iconic 911 sports car, with a planned drop of 7,500 Ethereum NFTs that would celebrate the vehicle and allow holders access to events and exclusive merchandise. It would also let crypto-savvy car junkies vaguely \u201chelp design Porsche's future in the virtual world.\u201d\n\nBut buzz around the project took a hard negative turn last Friday when Porsche announced that it would sell the NFTs for 0.911 ETH apiece, or about $1,475 as of this writing. That\u2019s a steep asking price in an NFT market that has lost considerable steam from the heights of early last year, particularly for a project with several thousand such NFTs on offer.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe backlash from Crypto Twitter was swift and severe. Notable builders and collectors in the space responded calling the move \u201ctone deaf,\u201d \u201cclueless,\u201d and a \u201ccash grab,\u201d as the tweet racked up more than one million impressions primarily through mocking shares.\n\nSome suggested that 0.0911 ETH (about $145) would have made a lot more sense. But Porsche didn\u2019t directly acknowledge the backlash in public, and its plans didn\u2019t change.\n\nSoon after the public mint started on Monday, primary sales slowed to a crawl\u2014and in what\u2019s seen as a death knell for any newly launched project, the NFTs were quickly being resold below the mint price on secondary marketplaces as owners fled the scene. By this morning, only about 1,500 of the NFTs had been minted. Porsche then made its move.\n\n\u201cOur holders have spoken,\u201d the official project account tweeted today. \u201cWe\u2019re going to cut our supply and stop the mint to move forward with creating the best experience for an exclusive community. More info in the next hours.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis is a pristine example of a large brand trying to extract liquidity from the community without onboarding itself into Web3. Porsche had a .911 mint, in a bearmarket, for 7500 pieces. Of course it failed. Next to no marketing, trying to raise on prestige alone. https://t.co/0HFbpxgRDP \u2014 camol (@camolNFT) January 24, 2023\n\nJust over 1,850 NFTs have been minted as of this writing, with the sale now set to end at 6 a.m. ET on Wednesday. The floor price\u2014that is, the cost of the cheapest-listed NFT on a marketplace\u2014has fluctuated, briefly climbing above the 0.911 ETH mark on top marketplace OpenSea but again dropping below. Currently, it sits at 0.905 ETH (about $1,465).\n\nEven the decision to announce plans to kill the mint but not immediately do it was slammed by some. Rug Radio co-CEO Farokh Sarmad called out the project\u2019s Twitter messaging, writing, \u201cWhoever is running @eth_porsche, you're not helping the @Porsche brand and you suck.\u201d\n\nThis mint didn't close and the tweet made people FOMO into minting more NFTs at 0.911 ETH. You can check the chain, but the amount sold is pretty big in the last 2 hours since the tweet. Whoever is running @eth_porsche, you're not helping the @Porsche brand and you suck. https://t.co/RRn4YO8B7e \u2014 Farokh (@farokh) January 24, 2023\n\nPorsche replied to Decrypt's earlier requests for comment on Wednesday, following the end of the public mint and the original publication of this article.\n\n\"The NFT is meant to be a long-term investment. We see a lot of interest in the mint from art lovers and Porsche enthusiasts. Many customers from the Web3 community have obviously held back because direct resale seemed unprofitable due to the customization of the NFT,\" the Porsche representative wrote. \"The size of the community is not decisive for us. What is crucial is that we can offer the community the most exclusive and individual events and utilities possible.\u201d\n\nPorsche is the latest example of a brand endeavor in the Web3 world gone wrong. While some traditional companies have been praised for partnering with existing NFT projects\u2014as Budweiser and Adidas did\u2014or using the tech in ways that aren\u2019t revenue drivers themselves (like Starbucks and Reddit), others have faced considerable criticism\n\nPepsi\u2019s Mic Drop is a notable example\u2014even as a free mint, it was criticized for clunky messaging and strange artwork. A recent Game of Thrones NFT launch was widely mocked for generic, glitchy artwork. And while it ultimately sold out, a Tiffany & Co. NFT drop last year tied to CryptoPunks-themed pendants was criticized for its costly mint price.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCelebrity-linked NFT projects have faced similar criticism in the past, whether or not they\u2019ve sold well. Donald Trump\u2019s recent collection, for example, was widely mocked\u2014even by Trump supporters\u2014but ultimately sold out and rose in value. A Michael Jordan-inspired project launched by his son last year on Solana cut its own supply after a slower-than-expected mint.\n\nBroadly, Web3 advocates appear increasingly keen on brands attempting to build in the space by giving away NFTs or making them affordable and accessible. Attempts by established firms and celebrities to simply extract value via high prices and minimal value don\u2019t tend to land well.\n\nPorsche\u2019s drop, to many observers, is yet another example of the latter\u2014and the brand may have learned a tough first lesson in Web3 as it considers a modified path ahead.\n\nEditor's note: This article was updated after publication to add the comment from Porsche."

But there are many Bitcoin alternatives like Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, Cardano, Binance Coin, and more that can be strong options for diversifying your crypto portfolio. In the ocean of 20,000+ cryptocurrencies, let\u2019s check out the top 10 Bitcoin alternatives you must consider before your next investment:\n\nEthereum\n\nEthereum is Bitcoin\u2019s largest competitor. Being the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, it\u2019s also the biggest platform for decentralized applications. The applications on Ethereum are run on ether, its platform-specific cryptographic token. Bitcoin is primarily a store of value and medium of exchange; Ethereum is seen as a general-purpose blockchain.\n\nBitcoin Cash\n\nBitcoin Cash has marked a milestone as one of the first altcoins that emerged and successfully traded off from bitcoin. The cryptocurrency emerged as a solution to the unsettling issues between bitcoin developers and miners. Bitcoin Cash got split from bitcoin\u2019s chain and created its own path towards adoption and growing market capitalization.\n\nShiba Inu\n\nShiba Inu is one of the most popular meme coins with a large and active community. Being a deflationary cryptocurrency, it can be good for long-term value growth. At present, Shiba Inu is trading at $0.00001212, with a 24-hour trading volume of $389,319,671.\n\nDogecoin\n\nOften called a \u2018meme coin,\u2019 dogecoin is the first cryptocurrency that came out from the Shiba Inu joke that trended on the internet years back. After maintaining a low profile for many since its inception in 2013, dogecoin showed its potential in 2020 when it was accepted as a payment model among sports teams and entered the AMC theaters.\n\nSolana\n\nSoaring by more than 11,000% throughout 2021, Solana created history. Although it is trading below its all-time high of $260 in 2022, Solana has outperformed the majority of other cryptocurrencies, which makes it one of the top 10 Bitcoin alternatives.\n\nTether\n\nTehter is born out as the brainchild of people who thought that the cryptocurrency market was very volatile and unsettling. As the foremost stable coin, the tether is pegged to the US dollar and experiences fewer fluctuations compared to bitcoin. This alone makes the cryptocurrency the best alternative for bitcoin.\n\nRipple\n\nRipple Network is a network that has been developed to provide quick and secure transactions to banks, especially by using blockchain technology. The Ripple system scores better than the bitcoin network for its lower processing times and lower transaction charges.\n\nBinance Coin\n\nBNB is the cryptocurrency promoted by Binance Coin exchange. Unlike bitcoin that just acts as a cryptocurrency, Binance Coin is both a virtual token and a crypto exchange platform that could pump up value based on its market performance. Besides, the platform also incentivizes users with BNB coins over transactions, enhancing the circulation of the token as much as possible.\n\nCardano\n\nCardano is one of the most fundamentally strong and best Bitcoin alternatives in the market today. With low transaction fees and continued developments in Cardano\u2019s ecosystem, the coin does have an advantage over both Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nLitecoin\n\nReferred as the \u2018silver to bitcoin\u2019s gold,\u2019 Litecoin was launched in 2011 with much of its functionalities similar to bitcoin. Litecoin was created by an MIT graduate and former Google engineer, Charlie Lee. With an open-source global payment network, Litecoin can add faster blocks compared to bitcoin, which contributes to its faster transaction time.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "A big Ethereum whale buys $228 million worth of Shiba Inu, as meme coin gains 50% in January - Nairametrics",
        "content": "The most massive Ethereum whales are actively stockpiling Shiba Inu, a dogecoin rival.\n\nThe enormous Ethereum whale has collected over $228 million in SHIB and is currently holding more than 18 trillion tokens, according to blockchain tracking firm WhaleStats.\n\nBy eliminating the ETH portion, the whale, whose identity is still unknown, has given SHIB 75% of his total portfolio as of this writing.\n\nMore details: The meme coin has a strong start to the year and is presently trading at $0.00001209, up roughly 50% year to date. As the ecosystem prepares for the introduction of Shibarium, the proposed layer-2 solution that intends to provide scalability among other aspects, price movement and whale buildup is taking place.\n\nSince the beginning of the year, Bone ShibaSwap (BONE), the token intended to be used for gas on Shibarium, has also experienced rallies. At the time of this writing, BONE is selling for $1.40, up 60% on the year.\n\nA meme coin is a word used in the digital market space as an asset referred to well-liked currencies that have ardent online supporters and traders and are occasionally portrayed with humorous or animated memes. Meme coins may be entertaining, but they are also extremely hazardous investments that may or may not have any real value.\n\nThis group includes currencies like Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, and others that may be more entertaining than practical. Understanding the dangers is essential while purchasing or trading meme coins so that you can steer clear of unforeseen volatility and losses.\n\nThe whales: According to CoinMarketCap, the aforementioned whale holds the sixth-largest stake in SHIB, accounting for 1.88% of the coin\u2019s total supply.\n\nIn addition, the wealthy investor\u2019s wallet also has the decentralized oracle service Chainlink and the Polygon (MATIC) scalability solution for Ethereum (LINK).\n\nData from WhaleStats revealed that additional Ethereum whales are aggressively allocating to SHIB in a similar fashion. SHIB is currently the largest holding among the top 1,000 Ethereum whales, excluding stablecoins and ETH itself, according to a recent analysis from Whalestats.\n\nShibarium\u2019s release has been teased by Shiba Inu creators earlier this month, but no precise date has been announced. However, a sizable number of financial analysts describe meme coins as sophisticated pump-and-dump operations. Investors should be extremely cautious when entering these markets as a result of this claim and should be aware of meme currencies."

        "content": "Shiba Inu has been one of the best performers out of the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. The meme coin started 2023 with a bang, rallying with the entire crypto market but also clocking in some independent gains due to anticipation around Shibarium and general bullishness in the market. Now, the digital asset has crawled back into favor with large Ethereum whales as they renew their interest.\n\nShiba Inu Is The Biggest Token Holding By Dollar Value\n\nOver the last year, Shiba Inu had fallen out of favor with the large Ethereum whales who reduced their holdings as the price of the coin plummeted. These large Ethereum whales went from holding over $1 billion worth of the meme coin at one point in 2021 to holding less than $300 million at the worst point in 2022.\n\nThis has quickly changed especially with the price recovery of SHIB. Ethereum whales have once again pitched their tents with the meme coin, accumulating trillions of tokens in the last couple of months. This has brought Shiba Inu back to its glory days of being the largest token holding by dollar value for the top 100 ETH whales, according to data from WhaleStats.\n\nCurrently, they hold over $608 million worth of SHIB, which makes up 15.99% of their total token holdings excluding ETH. Activity in the meme coin has also soared and SHIB also registers as the most traded token by these whales in the last 24 hours.\n\nSHIB becomes largest holding among top 100 ETH whales | Source: WhaleStats\n\nThe SHIB smart contract is the fourth most used smart contract by the whales, coming behind ETH, USDC, and USDT, with a 186% increase in the smart contract usage by the top 100 ETH whales.\n\nSHIB Grows 50%, Is There More Runway?\n\nShiba Inu\u2019s price is already up more than 50% in the last three weeks, but there could still be more runway for the digital asset. One factor that could contribute greatly to such an increase is the launch of Shibarium, a Layer 2 blockchain, which is currently the most anticipated release in the community.\n\nWith the launch of Shibarium, the possibility of a rally in the price of SHIB becomes more likely. Although BONE, which will be the ecosystem token stands to gain more, this movement will likely rub off on Shiba Inu as the launch of its own Layer 2 blockchain will trigger more adoption.\n\nSHIB price rises over 50% in first three weeks of 2023 | Source: SHIBUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThere is currently no set date for the launch of Shibarium, but if it were to happen while the market is still seeing high momentum, then it will accelerate the growth of the coin. It puts SHIB\u2019s price at a possible $0.00002 once the launch is complete.\n\nSHIB is currently trading at $0.00001209 at the time of this writing. Its price is up 0.33% in the last 24 hours and 14.12% in the last seven days."
