        "content": "Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal says Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) technicals and fundamentals suggest the second-largest cryptocurrency may massively outperform Bitcoin (BTC) in the coming cycle.\n\nIn a new interview on the crypto-focused YouTube channel Altcoin Daily, Pal says he has his eye on the chart of Ethereum against Bitcoin (ETH/BTC).\n\nAccording to the macro guru, the ETH/BTC pair is coiling inside a wedge, and a breakout could send ETH into a rally that leaves Bitcoin in the back seat.\n\nSays Pal,\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s the chart of Ethereum versus Bitcoin. That\u2019s one hell of a wedge.\n\nIf that plays out, then we should see ETH doing 1x, 2x, 3x, 4x [or] 5x Bitcoin in the next run. And ETH probably won\u2019t be the best performing crypto either.\u201d\n\n\n\nAccording to Pal, the ETH/BTC pair must take out resistance at around 0.077 BTC ($2,115) to confirm the breakout. At time of writing, ETH/BTC is trading for 0.0639 BTC ($1,755).\n\nAs for Ethereum\u2019s fundamentals, the Real Vision executive believes that the leading smart contract platform\u2019s total addressable market is much larger than Bitcoin\u2019s.\n\n\u201cEthereum is a broader basis architectural protocol of which we can build more stuff on top of. Bitcoin just doesn\u2019t do that. It has a different use case. So it\u2019s unlikely to be as big.\n\nIs the internet worth more than gold? Yes, simple as that, and that\u2019s basically the argument here.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Ethereum worth $1,758.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Better Buy: Coinbase vs. Ethereum - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The crypto winter has crushed valuations for tokens and companies that operate trading exchanges. Ethereum's (ETH 1.37%) price has fallen roughly 65% from it's record high set in November 2021. Meanwhile, leading exchange-services provider Coinbase Global (COIN 0.78%) has seen its valuation plummet 81% from its peak.\n\nWould investors be better off putting their money behind the leading Layer-1 blockchain services provider's ether token or buying Coinbase stock based on today's pricing levels? Read on to see why two Motley Fool contributors have differing takes on which looks like the better investment right now.\n\nEthereum is a category leader in blockchain services\n\nKeith Noonan: Launched in 2015, Ethereum has proved its staying power and has established itself as the clear leader in Layer-1 blockchain services. The company's network has become the go-to destination for those looking to build, deploy, and scale blockchain-based applications, and this foundation provides a key fundamental support for the value of the Ether token.\n\nIf Ethereum continues to attract new projects and facilitate their growth, that should create demand for the ether token and be a price catalyst.\n\nWhile Coinbase might appear to have lower risk based on the fact that its core business is providing trading and holding services for the broader crypto ecosystem, I actually see this as a source of greater risk.\n\nCoinbase's platform allows users to easily buy and sell an incredibly wide range of cryptocurrencies, but I think that most of these coins will probably trend toward zero on the valuation scale, and it seems almost inevitable that even some relatively high-profile projects will eventually blow up in big scandals.\n\nCoinbase has already had some scandals of its own -- including security breaches, insider trading, and allegations of insufficient safeguards against money laundering.\n\nThe crypto industry is still very much in its infancy, and the low barriers to launching and promoting a token mean that investors should take a highly selective approach to their investments in this sector.\n\nI view the vast majority of crypto projects to be of very low quality, so the prospect of investing in a business whose core services revolve around crypto trading and wallet services does not seem appealing. By comparison, Ethereum has already proved itself to be a much higher-quality project.\n\nIn general, I think that investors should only focus on crypto projects and related companies with proven track records. Ethereum fits the bill, has proved to be relatively scandal free, and can stand through the rise and fall of other projects and businesses in the crypto industry.\n\nCoinbase has demonstrated its potential\n\nParkev Tatevosian: Coinbase stock has been hammered in recent quarters due to the decrease in popularity of cryptocurrencies as an asset class. In the early stages of the pandemic, the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies reached $3 trillion. That figure has dropped to about $1 trillion.\n\nCoinbase, a platform that lets users buy, hold, and sell digital currencies, attracted millions of new customers during the crypto frenzy. Admittedly, many of those folks will leave if the popularity and prices of crypto assets don't recover. Still, Coinbase stock can be lucrative for investors as long as it can retain a meaningful portion of those early customers.\n\nThe explosive growth peaked in 2021, when Coinbase's revenue reached $7.8 billion and operating income hit $3 billion. That showed investors the magnitude of profits it could generate at scale. It will need to lower expenses to match a smaller scale if the industry doesn't rebound to pandemic highs.\n\nThere is a risk that Coinbase might not be profitable on a smaller scale. However, the stock is trading at a price-to-sales ratio of 4.5, which is significantly below the ratio of more than 18 at its peak. The stock might come with high risk, but it also has plenty of upside for investors with a high risk tolerance.\n\nSo which is the better buy?\n\nFor investors seeking broad-based exposure to the crypto space, investing in both Ethereum and Coinbase could be the right move. Otherwise, it makes sense to focus on their differing characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses and then determine which potential investment vehicle is better aligned with the direction you see the crypto space heading in.\n\nIf you're looking to take a narrower approach to investing in crypto and think that Ethereum will continue to be a top provider of network services, then it's probably the better buy. On the other hand, if you're positioning for an overall rebound in crypto valuations and are seeking investment vehicles that have a diversified exposure to the broader market, Coinbase stock is likely the better fit for your investment priorities."

The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn 2023, the total amount of destroyed Ethereum (ETH) coins has reached a staggering 66,000 ETH, worth approximately $117 million at the current price of $1,780 per coin. This significant reduction in supply is expected to alleviate some of the pressure on the second-largest digital asset in the market and make it increasingly scarce. With the present burn rate, an estimated 614,000 Ethereum will be removed from circulation annually, which, at the current price, equates to an astounding $1.09 billion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Ethereum network underwent a crucial update in August 2021, known as the London Hard Fork, which introduced the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559. This proposal led to the implementation of a base fee mechanism that burns a portion of transaction fees. Since then, the Ethereum network has been steadily destroying coins, reducing the overall supply and creating deflationary pressure.\n\nThe ongoing burn has a direct impact on the Ethereum ecosystem, as it reduces the total number of coins in circulation. This reduction in supply, combined with increasing demand for the digital asset, has the potential to drive the price of Ethereum higher. The current burn rate of approximately 614,000 ETH per year further highlights the magnitude of the change brought about by EIP-1559.\n\nIt is essential to consider that the burn rate can fluctuate based on various factors, such as the number of transactions on the network and the gas fees associated with them. As Ethereum moves toward Ethereum 2.0, a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, the network is expected to become more efficient, which could impact the burn rate and its influence on the market.\n\nIn conclusion, the growing annual burn rate of Ethereum has led to a significant reduction in the overall supply of the digital asset, making it increasingly scarce. As the total amount of destroyed coins surpasses 66,000 ETH, the market dynamics are expected to evolve, with the potential for increased demand and higher prices. Investors and traders should keep a close eye on the developments in the Ethereum ecosystem and the factors influencing the burn rate, as these could play a crucial role in shaping the future of the digital asset."

        "title": "Use Multi-Signature And Social Recovery Wallets To Achieve Self-Custody, Ethereum Creator Says - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin advised crypto investors to use social recovery and self-custody wallets. Buterin\u2019s suggestion comes amid heightened expectations for the new Arbitrum token airdrop scheduled on March 23 and the upcoming Shanghai upgrade.\n\nThe recommendation makes sense given the increased cyber-related crimes in crypto, with hackers targeting a vulnerability in user wallets. The Ethereum co-founder suggested multi-signature and social recovery wallets so that users can hold self-custody of their funds.\n\nSelf-Custody Is Crucial In Crypto: Ethereum Creator\n\nSocial recovery wallets are smart-contract-powered wallets that allow users to recover access to their stolen funds even if they lose their private key. On the other hand, a multi-sig wallet requires two or more private keys to authorize a transaction or access funds.\n\nIn a tweet, Buterin noted that self-custody is crucial in the crypto ecosystem, especially with the last year\u2019s event. The many hack exploitations in 2021 and 2022 with the FTX fiasco magnified the need for self-custody wallets.\n\nButerin suggests multi-sig wallets for long-term holdings and social recovery wallets for short-term day-to-day trading activities.\n\nFollowing his recommendation, Buterin made a Reddit post that detailed his opinion on how users should choose guardians for social recovery and multi-sig wallets. In his Reddit post, the founder recommended multi-sig wallets like Gnosis Safe, an easy and reliable wallet to store funds.\n\nButerin explained that centralized organizations are trustworthy but pose risks of regulatory pressure, including system and human errors. Therefore he advised users not to trust centralized entities.\n\nFurther, he stated that social recovery wallets are easier to use than multi-sig wallets. The ERC-4337 account abstraction and newly built smart contract wallets like Soul Wallet bolsters wallet security.\n\nChoice Of Wallets, Key Guardians Can Minimize Risks Of Assets Loss\n\nIn addition, Buterin suggested using social recovery for hot wallets that store smaller portions of funds and multi-sigs for cold wallets that store more funds. Also, he noted that selecting good guardians is crucial.\n\nGood guardians improve the security of crypto funds by reducing the chances of losing keys, funds theft, and risks of sharing private keys with others. In the post, Buterin detailed how to choose a secure guardian.\n\nOne of the comments to Buterin\u2019s post talked about the importance of having guardians that can use hardware wallets. It also noted that using guardians for hardware wallets is better than storing keys in Metamask or Google Drive.\n\nWhile responding, Buterin said that hardware wallets are unnecessary due to issues that might arise with the issuing company. However, he agreed with the commenter that using Google Drive or Metamask to store keys are risky.\n\nButerin\u2019s posts followed several wallet attacks that led to a loss of thousands of dollars. These include MyAlgo Wallet exploit, which saw massive amounts of money stolen from users\u2019 accounts.\n\nThat is not Buterin\u2019s first time recommending social recovery wallets. On January 11, 2021, Buterin posted a blog detailing the need for crypto investors to adopt recovery wallets. In the article, Buterin said multi-sig is his favorite of all wallet categories. He introduced recovery wallets as easy to use with high-level security.\n\nFeatured image from Pixabay and chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

NAB executed the test trade on the Ethereum blockchain and utilized smart contracts for seven of the world\u2019s most important currencies. The deal showcases the ability to greatly lower the duration and expense of international transactions, which will be advantageous to the corporate and institutional customers of NAB who conduct business across several jurisdictions and currencies.\n\nNAB\u2019s executive general manager of financial markets, Drew Bradford, stated that the bank is making investments in the creation of Australia\u2019s most reliable, straightforward, and secure digital asset environment. Bradford stated, \u201cWe have dedicated ourselves to exploring digital asset prospects with unambiguous customer advantages.\u201d We think that blockchain technology will facilitate aspects of the foreseeable future of finance, and the tokenization industry is already undergoing accelerated transformation. We are able to promote the development of a secure and dependable digital banking system because we have in force stringent regulatory mechanisms.\u201d\n\nNAB will completely support its Australian stablecoin, AUDN, with the Australian dollar and administer it as a bank obligation, making it the foundation of NAB\u2019s digital asset aspirations. Furthermore, by the end of this year, it intends to assist chosen customers with digital asset transactions. NAB partnered with Blockfold and Fireblocks to develop and launch its stablecoins on the Ethereum blockchain. This required utilizing their skills in the development of smart contracts, the creation and destruction of stablecoins, and the custody of digital belongings on the blockchain.\n\nMichael Shaulov, CEO and co-founder, stated, \u201cNAB\u2019s effective trade completion marks the start of the transformation of the financial services industry from Web2 to Web3, which is supported by blockchain technology and solid supervision and risk administration.\u201d While the CEO and co-founder of BlockFold, Francois Schonken, stated that \u201cNAB\u2019s successful execution of multi-currency trans-border settlement on a public blockchain is thrilling. The NAB stablecoin network establishes cross-border payment channels that unleash tokenization prospects for both physical assets and financial goods.\u201d\n\nNAB\u2019s goal is to facilitate deals in seven of the most widely used currencies in the world, including Australian, New Zealand, Singapore, and US dollars, Euro, Yen, and Pound Sterling."

        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has emphasized the importance of having a varied set of \u201cguardians\u201d to maximize the safety of crypto asset self-custody via multisig and social recovery wallets.\n\nGiven the ever-growing rate of crypto scams and hacks over the past few years, and several major crypto firms going bust in 2022, self-custody and maintaining sufficient wallet safety procedures have never been more critical.\n\nIn a March 16 Reddit post on the r/ethereum community titled \u201cHow I think about choosing guardians for multisig and social recovery wallets,\u201d Buterin gave a detailed run down of how he approaches wallet security.\n\nSelf-custody is important. And social recovery and multisig is a great way to do it.\n\n\n\nA quick reddit post on how I think about choosing guardians for social recovery and multisig wallets:https://t.co/FY1iyJ6BFC \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) March 17, 2023\n\nWhile their structures differ, multisig and social recovery wallets rely on guardians, which serve as external sources to recover funds or approve transactions. Generally, guardians can be sets of external wallets belonging to the same individual or addresses controlled by other people or entities.\n\nAccording to Buterin, it\u2019s important to decentralize wallet guardians, as owning more than one of your guardians provides a \u201ctricky tradeoff: you get to trust other people less, but you\u2019re also concentrating more power into yourself, which can create a risk if you get hacked, coerced, or incapacitated or die.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy rule of thumb is that enough guardians should be controlled by other people that if you disappear there are enough other guardians left to recover your funds.\u201d\n\nButerin went on to advise that someone\u2019s set of guardians should not know of each other, as this \u201cgreatly reduces the risk that they collude\u201d to attack their wallets and assets. However, they should still be able to find each other in case something happens to the wallet owner.\n\nComments on Buterin\u2019s post. Source: Reddit\n\n\u201cIf something happens to you, they will still be able to find each other, because there are obvious standard protocols that naturally come to people\u2019s minds in such a situation (e.g. contact your family),\u201d he wrote.\n\nAdditionally, the Ethereum co-founder suggested that people should \u201cinstruct guardians to ask a security question\u201d that only they and the guardian will know when confirming an operation \u2014 and only confirmed when the correct answer is given.\n\nRelated: DeFi sees its biggest hack in 2023 as Euler loses $197M: Finance Redefined\n\nFor degen traders or those not making long-term hodl plays, the Ethereum co-founder also stressed that they should use guardians that can respond quickly to suit their fast-moving needs.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re doing degen stuff with on-chain contracts, you may need to act quickly: pull money out if a contract gets a vulnerability, move money around if you are close to being liquidated, etc. If your needs include this, then you want to find guardians who can act quickly on short notice.\u201d\n\nFinally, Buterin recommended testing each guardian at least once a year, as this will confirm that they \u201chaven\u2019t forgotten or lost their accounts.\u201d\n\nGiven the ever-growing rate of crypto scams and hacks over the past few years, and several crypto firms going bust last year, maintaining sufficient wallet safety procedures has never been more important."

        "content": "The world of cryptocurrencies is constantly evolving, with new technologies and trends emerging every year. In 2023, Ethereum (ETH) and RenQ Finance (RENQ) are two tokens that are expected to reach new heights.\n\nEthereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is already a popular choice among investors due to its strong development team and widespread adoption. RenQ Finance, on the other hand, is a relatively new blockchain platform that offers unique features and advantages over other cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn this Report, we will explore why these two tokens are expected to grow in popularity and reach new highs in 2023, with a particular focus on RenQ Finance.\n\nEthereum (ETH): The King of Smart Contracts\n\nEthereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, and it has been around since 2015. It is an open-source, blockchain-based platform that enables developers to build decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts. Ethereum has gained widespread adoption due to its ability to execute complex smart contracts that are automated, transparent, and secure.\n\nOne of the reasons why Ethereum is expected to reach new heights in 2023 is its Ethereum 2.0 upgrade. This upgrade introduces a new consensus mechanism that makes the network more efficient and scalable. It also brings in new features like staking, which allow users to earn rewards by holding ETH tokens. Additionally, the upgrade reduces transaction fees, making it easier for users to interact with DApps on the network.\n\nRenQ Finance (RENQ): AI Meets DeFi\n\nRenQ Finance is a new token that combines AI with blockchain technology to enable decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. The platform uses machine learning algorithms to analyze market trends and make investment decisions. This unique approach to AI has gained significant attention from investors who are looking for new investment opportunities in the DeFi space.\n\nOne of the key advantages of RenQ Finance is its fast and secure network. It can process millions of transactions per second, making it ideal for DeFi applications that require quick and efficient data processing. Additionally, the platform has a limited supply of tokens, which could lead to increased value as demand increases.\n\nRenQ Finance has already raised $2.7 million in its presale, indicating a high level of interest from investors. The platform has also passed the Certik audit, which provides additional security and reliability to the token.\n\nWhy Ethereum and RenQ Finance?\n\nBoth Ethereum and RenQ Finance have unique features that make them stand out in the crowded cryptocurrency market. Ethereum\u2019s ability to execute complex smart contracts and the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade makes it an attractive investment option. RenQ Finance\u2019s AI-powered approach to DeFi and fast, secure network make it an appealing choice for investors who are looking for new opportunities in the DeFi space.\n\nMoreover, Ethereum and RenQ Finance are both backed by strong development teams, which provides confidence to investors that the tokens will continue to grow and evolve. In addition, both tokens have gained significant attention from the crypto community and have a growing user base.\n\nSummary\n\nIn 2023, experts predict that Ethereum and RenQ Finance will soar to new heights. Ethereum\u2019s capacity to handle intricate smart contracts following its upgrade and RenQ Finance\u2019s innovative AI methodology and rapid, secure network make them both appealing investment opportunities.\n\nNonetheless, it is vital to conduct thorough research and comprehend the risks before deciding to invest in any token.\n\nClick Here to Buy RenQ Finance (RENQ) Tokens.\n\nVisit the links below for more information about RenQ Finance (RENQ):\n\nWebsite: https://renq.io\n\nWhitepaper: https://renq.io/whitepaper.pdf\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "A popular crypto analyst known for calling the 2018 Bitcoin (BTC) bottom is predicting a massive rally for Ethereum (ETH).\n\nThe pseudonymous analyst Smart Contracter tells his 221,400 Twitter followers that Ethereum appears to be at the end of a correction and ready to surge.\n\n\u201cETH/BTC just took out a six-month low, only 3% lower before my major buy zone.\n\nNot the circumstances I was expecting this to happen under (I thought ETH and BTC would be falling but ETH more so) but there\u2019s no chance I\u2019m missing the monster ETH rally that\u2019s coming.\u201d\n\nLooking at his chart, the analyst shows ETH/BTC in a downward correction and about to tap the crucial 0.618 Fibonacci retracement support, which traders see as a likely point for a bounce.\n\nSmart Contracter\u2019s bullishness on ETH comes as crypto analytics platform Santiment says sharks have accumulated 3.61 million ETH coins in the past year, worth a whopping $6.13 billion.\n\nHowever, whales unloaded more than double that amount.\n\n\u201cEthereum\u2019s large addresses have shifted their supply held substantially. Addresses holding 10-10,000 ETH have collectively added 3.61 million coins in the past year. Meanwhile, addresses with 10,000-10,000,000 ETH have collectively dumped 9.43 million in the same timeframe.\u201d\n\nThe crypto analyst also says Optimism (OP) is also looking bullish.\n\n\u201cBullish expanded flat on daily for OP against USD, BTC and ETH pairs. Looks like one of the alts that will perform very well in my opinion.\u201d\n\nUsing the Elliott Wave theory, an advanced technical analysis method that forecasts future price action based on crowd psychology manifesting in waves, Smart Contracter says Optimism is at the bottom of a correction and setting the stage to move to the upside.\n\nEthereum is worth $1,819 and Optimism trading at $2.57 at time of writing.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Dogetti Catches Ethereum and Cosmos By Surprise With Latest Protocol Upgrade - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Dogetti (DETI) looks set to break into the top ranks within the cryptocurrency market, as its developers look to leverage its DAO principles to surprise existing projects like Ethereum (ETH) and Cosmos (ATOM). The DAO principle and other features empower the users, making them more involved in the platform\u2019s activities. Read on for more information on Dogetti\u2019s (DETI) new protocol and its implications for the DeFi space.\n\nEthereum \u2013 Elite Blockchain with Extensive DApps\n\nEthereum\u2019s launch in 2015 presented a more relatable platform than Bitcoin, where users could access a wide range of DeFi tools and Web3 applications for a better blockchain experience. The network has become a first stop for a complete cryptocurrency experience, given its many attractive features.\n\nEthereum (ETH) initially operated a proof of work protocol, which encouraged the mining of Ethereum tokens using different devices. The proof of work protocol is not scalable, so increased traffic on the Ethereum blockchain caused many network lags and delayed transactions. Also, its intensive energy consumption affected network charges, as users paid huge fees to complete their transactions on time.\n\nAs the trading traffic on Ethereum (ETH) increased, the developers incorporated other platforms like Polygon to help with handling transactions, particularly in the NFT sector. By 2022, they scheduled an upgrade, dubbed \u2018the Merge,\u2019 that will take Ethereum to a proof of stake protocol. The shift took place in September, and users are expecting the gas fees on Ethereum to start dropping soon.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is host to several popular NFT marketplaces, including OpenSea and EtherScan, which the ETH token directly powers. Its involvement in the NFT trade has made Ethereum the biggest NFT trade centre in the cryptocurrency market, with over $500 million in market capitalization.\n\nETH token provides fuel for the platform, and it now functions as a stake token with the latest developments. ETH is listed on Coinbase for about $1605.55.\n\nCosmos \u2013 Internet Of Blockchains\n\nCosmos (ATOM) is an independent decentralised platform that hopes to host DApps and tokens like Ethereum, Avalanche, and Solana. It aims to create a network of blockchains that will be able to interact with other blockchains in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nCosmos (ATOM) runs on a proof of stake protocol called the Byzantine Fault Tolerance protocol. The code uses a small group of validators to quicken transaction processing, which ultimately maximises energy requirements on the platform.\n\nThe protocol helps coordinate the two aspects of Cosmos\u2019s operations, the software development kits and the Cosmos Hub. The software development kits are frameworks or models for creating public domain blockchains that interact with one another and the main blockchain.\n\nOn the other hand, the Cosmos Hub is the central part of the Cosmos economy and establishes connections between the platform and other platforms in the cryptocurrency market. It features bridges that allow token transfers to Bitcoin and Ethereum networks and maintains security within the blockchain.\n\nCosmos runs using the ATOM tokens, which serve the roles of staking, voting, and fueling the platform. ATOM is listed on Coinbase for about $12.92.\n\nDogetti \u2013 NFTs and So Much More\n\nDogetti\u2019s (DETI) protocol will serve multifocal uses, as the developers have managed to compile several user-oriented features to provide users with a unique crypto journey. Top of these features is the DAO structure which will encourage more active participation from the users, contributing to increased wealth creation and longevity of the platform.\n\nA Decentralised Autonomous Organization represents a token community where the protocol upgrades and improvements are subject to approval from the community. The users have an enormous stake in the project\u2019s holdings, and so hold the deciding factor in policy-making and protocol alterations.\n\nDogetti (DETI) has earmarked 50% of the total coin supply for the presale event, giving its users a significant advantage in terms of token stake. This will promote user participation and ensure that only the user-friendly features get to the protocol at every upgrade.\n\nAnother significant feature Dogetti (DETI) will be offering its users is the NFT marketplace. Dogetti intends to keep up with contemporary DeFi trends and will allow users and developers to create and sell their NFT collections and projects on the platform. The whitepaper also promises that future upgrades will enable the NFTs to grow and breed, increasing user wealth on the network.\n\nDogetti\u2019s (DETI) presale is on and the best time to join is now.

        "content": "Billionaire and Ethereum (ETH) creator Vitalik Buterin is highlighting what he thinks is the best way for users to self custody their crypto.\n\nIn a new Reddit post, Buterin says that using multisigs, plus what he calls \u201cguardians\u201d or a network of trusted devices or individuals, is his preferred method of crypto security.\n\nA multisig wallet requires two or more signatures before it could confirm and process a transaction.\n\nButerin says that both he and the Ethereum Foundation use a multisig wallet to store the bulk of their crypto funds. The Ethereum creator also references \u201csocial recovery wallets,\u201d which he covered in more detail in a January 2021 blog post.\n\n\u201cMultisig wallets (eg. Gnosis Safe) are an easy and safe way to store funds, and can give you most of the key benefits of self custody \u2013 namely, your funds not being subject to disappearing because a centralized entity that seemed trustworthy turns out not to be at all \u2013 without the risks of having to be personally responsible for your entire security setup. I use a multisig wallet personally to store the bulk of my funds, as does the Ethereum Foundation.\u201d\n\nButerin says trusting other people to help secure one\u2019s coins means having a level of trust, but also allows for easier recovery of the crypto if you become compromised somehow.\n\n\u201cIt makes natural sense to have at least one guardian be a wallet on one of your own devices \u2013 it doesn\u2019t reduce decentralization to do that, and after all, it is your money. Once you go above one guardian controlled by yourself, however, you get into a tricky tradeoff: you get to trust other people less, but you\u2019re also concentrating more power into yourself, which can create a risk if you get hacked, coerced, or incapacitated or die.\n\nMy rule of thumb is that enough guardians should be controlled by other people that if you disappear, there are enough other guardians left to recover your funds. That is, you should control at least one guardian, and at most N(set of addresses) -M (trusted people) guardians. Also, each guardian should be on a separate device (laptop, phone, old phone, etc).\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Meme Coin Star, Big Eyes Coin, Surpasses Ethereum and Theta Network Presale Records - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market has witnessed numerous presale events, but those of Ethereum and Theta will continue to stand out from the rest. Both presale events generated about $19 million, with Ethereum (ETH) setting the record in 2015 and Theta (THETA) matching it in 2017. Now Big Eyes Coin (BIG), the meme coin that rocked late 2022, has generated more than $25 million in its presale, surpassing mother blockchain Ethereum\u2019s 2015 record. Read on to find out more about the alluring feline meme coin and join the presale while you can.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) blockchain was developed in 2015 to provide a better relatable crypto platform for easier transactions, as Bitcoin was disappearing out of sight in terms of value. The Ethereum blockchain promised a more extensive, feature-packed protocol that gave users and developers opportunities to get the best out of their crypto journeys.\n\nEthereum (ETH) initially launched with a proof of work protocol similar to Bitcoin\u2019s code. The code base allowed users to mine ETH tokens while they received rewards. As the protocol got more popular and DApps increased, the need for supplementary networks arose, and platforms like Polygon were used to improve the quality of blockchain services on Ethereum.\n\nThe desired move to a proof of stake occurred in 2022, as the developers moved the entire blockchain to a PoS code that promised faster transactions at lower gas fees. The move has also improved the platform\u2019s security, as users can stake their ETH assets to better Ethereum\u2019s security.\n\nEthereum (ETH) has delivered on every metric as it has profound involvement in key crypto sectors. Its NFT trade sector is the largest, with a capitalization of over $500 million and its blockchain is host to numerous Metaverse platforms and tokens, propagating Decentralized Finance all over the crypto space.\n\nEthereum (ETH) currently sells for about $1,671.84 on CoinMarketCap.\n\nTheta Network (THETA)\n\nTheta Network (THETA) is the only blockchain solution available that upgrades video quality for its users. The platform uses several DApps to increase the bandwidth available for video streaming. Edgecast, a notable Ethereum DApp, enables users to contribute their bandwidth to enhance video sharing and streaming.\n\nTheta initially existed on the Ethereum network, where its access to the many DApps caused its success before and after the presale. The platform moved to an independent blockchain, in 2019, where it runs on a Byzantine Fault Tolerance protocol, a variation of the conventional proof of stake protocol. The BFT protocol allows for faster transactions, as it uses a small unit of validators who work round the clock to validate transaction blocks.\n\nTheta Network (THETA) has two tokens used to run the platform. There is the non-tradable TFUEL token that runs the network\u2019s economics by functioning as fuel, and THETA token that is used to vote on protocol changes and the platform\u2019s future. The THETA is tradable and listed on various exchanges on the cryptocurrency market.\n\nTHETA is available on CoinMarketCap for about $1.17.\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG)\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG) is a cat-meme token that sought to dominate the meme coin sector in the crypto space. The coin started its presale in September, during the crypto collapse, and is edging closer to the launch date. Unlike many meme coin platforms, Big Eyes (BIG) boasts a value-packed protocol that ensures users within its meme community access some of the benefits of DeFi.\n\nBig Eyes\u2019 most notable feature is the anticipated Sushi Crew project. Sushi Crew is an NFT marketplace where users will be able to create, mint, and trade their NFTs. The developers have decided to have NFT trades at no cost, thus relieving users of the enormous Ethereum gas fees, as the token will launch on the Ethereum blockchain. The NFTs will keep projects like a Metaverse within sight for future upgrades.\n\nBig Eyes (BIG) also plans to host a supportive community where every user contributes to the token\u2019s plans and has a stake in its future. The developers also plan to help newbie users with tutorials to put them through the basics of DeFi and its principles. This will help make the community more close-knit, a common feature of successful crypto projects.\n\nThe final days are here, and we expect the launch date anytime. Click here to buy your BIG tokens and join the already-growing Big Eyes (BIG) community.\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG)\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "As cryptocurrency continues to grow, so does its demand for being accepted as payment, especially within the digital world. In this day and age, it\u2019s quite surprising that so few online betting sites accept it. Below, we will discuss the top three different online betting sites that offer Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies!\n\nTake Advantage of ONWIN\u2019s Amazing Odds Using Crypto!\n\nONWIN is still new to the scene, and though it\u2019s yet to stand the test of time, this platform has gained a mass following and is already presenting itself as a serious threat to other online betting sites in the industry. Their main demographic is based in Brazil, which is unsurprising given that the world of online sports betting is more popular there than in any other country. In addition to Bitcoin and Ethereum, ONWIN also accepts other cryptos too, such as USDT and BNB.\n\nHowever, welcoming cryptocurrency as a payment method is only a fraction of the desirable features ONWIN offers. The main reason the site has attracted so much attention in so little time is down to their incredible and unprecedented betting odds. ONWIN also offers some other fun and interesting features such as eSports betting, Casino betting, and live sports betting! They have been praised for their awesome bonus deals and Sports betting promotions. Newcomers get a 100% welcome bonus for Bingo and $100 worth of bets!\n\nCrypto in Return for Loyalty\n\nBwin has been around for more than 15 years and has since become a top-class booker maker and a public favorite in the world of online betting. Bwin\u2019s fan-base claims they are the perfect choice for punters looking for a platform that offers a wide range of sports, fast payouts, and impeccable betting odds. In terms of complaints, many customers have requested that Bwin launch a live chat service.\n\nThey also offer a good range of payment options, which is what we\u2019re highlighting here. They use \u201cpay with crypto,\u201d which is a payment method that allows customers to deposit their money into their Bwin account. Then, through BVNK, a third-party virtual assets service provider, they provide them with a fixed exchange rate for an hour and convert their cryptocurrency into euros. There is a small catch, which is that paying in crypto is exclusive to customers that have been using the platform for over three months.\n\nGet A Weekly Crypto Allowance with Stake.com\n\nStake.com is an online betting site that advertises itself as a \u201ccrypto casino & sports betting\u201d platform. It\u2019s best known for offering a high RTP (percentage return to player) and lots of unrestricted weekly and monthly bonuses. In addition, all users of their platform get a weekly allowance of 5-10 dollars.\n\nThe cons? Since Stake.com is a cryptocurrency betting site, there is currently no means of withdrawal into traditional fiat money, but considering the rising number of customers strictly choosing to gamble with crypto, there\u2019s a huge market for what their offering.\n\nFor More Information on ONWIN, Click On the Links Below!\n\nWebsite: Onwin.com\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/on_win\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_OnWin_\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Grayscale: focus on the Ethereum PoW crypto - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "Grayscale Investments, the crypto investment firm, announced on 16 March that it will extend the review period for evaluating the market environment to determine whether it can acquire Ethereum PoW (ETHW) tokens.\n\nExtending the purchase period of the Ethereum PoW (ETHW) crypto\n\nThis move comes after much speculation about Grayscale\u2019s potential acquisition of forked Ethereum tokens after the merger. Grayscale will now take up to 180 days to decide whether, when and how to sell ETHPoW on behalf of shareholders with registration dates.\n\nThis decision by Grayscale highlights the careful consideration that must be given when considering the potential acquisition of a new asset. Even though the company has been notoriously bullish on Ethereum in the past, it is clear that it is taking a cautious approach when it comes to ETHPoW.\n\nThe decision to extend the review period indicates that Grayscale is taking the time to carefully consider all the factors involved and make an informed decision in the best interest of its investors.\n\nThe post-merger forked Ethereum tokens, ETHPoW, were created as a result of the transition of the Ethereum network from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS). This transition was one of the most significant changes made to the Ethereum network since its inception and was met with mixed reactions from the cryptocurrency community.\n\nAlthough PoS is considered a more energy-efficient and scalable consensus mechanism, some community members have expressed concern about the potential centralization of the network that could result from the transition.\n\nIn addition, the creation of ETHPoW has caused some confusion, with some investors uncertain about the value and utility of the forked asset.\n\nDespite these concerns, the potential of ETHPoW is still very exciting. The forked asset represents a unique opportunity for investors to gain exposure to a new asset class and potentially benefit from the growth and adoption of the Ethereum network.\n\nGrayscale Investments has long been an advocate of investing in digital assets and has played a significant role in bringing cryptocurrencies into the mainstream.\n\nThe decision-making factors of Grayscale Investment\n\nThe firm is best known for its Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), which was the first publicly traded Bitcoin investment vehicle in the United States. Since then, Grayscale has expanded its offerings to include a range of other digital assets, including Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash.\n\nWith the potential acquisition of ETHPoW, Grayscale has the opportunity to continue its mission of providing investors with exposure to innovative and disruptive technologies.\n\nHowever, it is clear that the company is taking a cautious approach to this new asset, recognizing that the decision to acquire and sell ETHPoW must be made with great care and consideration.\n\nSeveral factors are likely to have influenced Grayscale\u2019s decision to extend ETHW\u2019s review period. One of the most significant factors is the current regulatory environment surrounding cryptocurrencies.\n\nGovernments and regulators around the world are increasingly concerned about the risks associated with cryptocurrencies, particularly their potential use for money laundering and other illicit activities.\n\nThis has led to increased scrutiny of the cryptocurrency market and could potentially lead to new regulations or restrictions on the market in the future.\n\nAnother factor that could influence Grayscale\u2019s decision is the current state of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe market has been extremely volatile in recent months, with the prices of many cryptocurrencies rising and falling dramatically in short periods of time. This volatility has made it difficult for investors to predict how the market will evolve in the coming months and may cause institutional investors like Grayscale to take a cautious approach to the market.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s decision to extend the ETHW review period also has several potential implications. One of the most significant implications is that it could further increase uncertainty and confusion in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe creation of ETHW has already created confusion among investors, and Grayscale\u2019s decision to extend the review period could potentially increase this confusion by creating further uncertainty about the future of the forked asset.\n\nAnother potential implication of Grayscale\u2019s decision is that it could signal a change in the way institutional investors approach the cryptocurrency market.\n\nEven though institutional investors have become increasingly interested in cryptocurrencies in recent years, the market is still relatively new and untested.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s cautious approach to ETHW may signal that institutional investors are becoming more risk-averse when it comes to cryptocurrencies and may be less willing to invest in new and untested assets in the future.\n\nEthereum Merge, common creative license"

        "content": "In a landmark move for the world of cryptocurrency, the supply of Ethereum has been reduced by 66,000 ETH in 2023, according to the information shared by market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock published on March 18.\n\nThis comes as a result of Ethereum\u2019s \u2018Merge\u2018 transition to proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus that took place in September 2022. With the new consensus mechanism, a fraction of ETH transaction fees is being burnt. This made Ethereum deflationary.\n\nIn 2023, the supply of Ethereum reduced by 66k $ETH due to burning a fraction of transaction fees. This move has made Ethereum deflationary, which is great news for crypto enthusiasts seeking scarce digital assets. #Ethereum #deflation pic.twitter.com/2RuwiioffW \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) March 18, 2023\n\nFor those who are not familiar with the term, a deflationary currency is one where the supply of currency decreases over time. This is in contrast to inflationary currencies, which see the supply of currency increase over time.\n\nNotably, deflationary currencies are particularly attractive to crypto enthusiasts who are seeking scarce digital assets, as they believe that scarcity can drive up the value of an asset.\n\nApril\u2019s Shanghai upgrade\n\nIt is worth mentioning that another highly anticipated Shanghai-Capella upgrade, also known as the Shapella upgrade is scheduled to go live on April 12, 2023.\n\nThe most notable aspect of this upgrade is Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4895, which will introduce validator staking withdrawals to the main network. This is a crucial feature that was left out during Ethereum\u2019s shift to proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus in September last year, following the Merge upgrade.\n\nAs of the time of writing, the ETH price is hovering around $1,816.52 per coin. The asset\u2019s price registered solid growth in the last 7 days, rising by 26%."

        "content": "In our previous articles, we compared the three best altcoins \u2013 Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA). In this post we move forward into the magnificent world of cryptocurrencies to draw a detailed analysis of the two crypto heavyweights \u2013 Ethereum (ETH)vs Bitcoin (BTC). As we dive deep into their details, it will become easier to understand which is the best cryptocurrency.\n\nFor the longest time, investments have been limited to assets such as real estate, gold, bank deposits, and stocks. However, over the past few years, a new investment asset class called \u201cCryptocurreny\u201d has garnered immense popularity among investors and traders all across the world. This latest form of asset has been doling out good returns for its investors, promising to disrupt the monopolistic traditional financial ecosystem. Suddenly, from global conglomerates to street artists, everybody wants a piece of this action.\n\nCryptocurrency \u2013 A Financial Revolution\n\nThe saga of this new financial revolution started with the inception of Bitcoin (BTC) in 2009. Since then, the popularity of cryptocurrencies immediately took off with scores of other digital tokens getting launched one after another. The growing popularity of these digital assets in the past decade and the recent acceptance of Bitcoin (BTC) as legal tender in El Salvador suggest that there is growing acceptance of these instruments and that cryptocurrencies are here to stay.\n\nComparatively new, Ethereum (ETH) which was launched in 2015 took the crypto industry by storm becoming the second most valuable cryptocurrency after Bitcoin (BTC). Soon, both the tokens gained astronomical traction becoming the \u201cCoca- Cola and Pepsi\u201d of the crypto universe. Over the past couple of years both the digital tokens have witnessed substantial price growth, attracting infinite new investors all around the globe to the burgeoning crypto industry.\n\nThus, gaining knowledge about the differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum will allow us to know exactly which cryptocurrency best suit the need of each investor. In order to understand the digital tokens in depth, we need to start from the beginning. Let us begin by looking at their history.\n\nBrief History of Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin is known to be the biggest and oldest coin in the crypto world. It was invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. The primary purpose of Bitcoin was to establish itself as a viable alternative to traditional fiat currencies backed by countries.\n\nThis means, it is basically a store of value and often used as a medium of exchange. Since its well-known globally, this coin has been leading the market for the past decade. Over the years, it has experienced several major surges, and each time it has broken records, touching new all-time highs.\n\nThe digital coin has also experienced a fair share of ups and down during its journey till date. In 2017, Bitcoin\u2019s price skyrocketed enabling the crypto industry to forge a ground-breaking financial renaissance as well as gain its own identity. However, following the rally, a massive correction took place dragging Bitcoin (BTC) to be termed as a bubble, and a failed asset. Several people predicted the crypto industry would come to an end.\n\nDespite the negative sentiments, Bitcoin doubled in value again in just three years, reaching a new all-time high in 2021. It is worth noting that Bitcoin improves upon gold by offering increased portability. Unlike physical gold, which has to be mined from the earth and transported to markets, Bitcoin can be easily transferred over the internet, rightfully earning the title, \u201cDigital Gold\u201d.\n\nBrief History of Ethereum\n\nAs for Ethereum (ETH), it was created in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin, a computer developer. It is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts used to build and deploy decentralized applications (dApps) whose back-end code is placed in a distributed peer-to-peer network. The vital goal behind Ethereum is to form a decentralized suite of financial products that are capable of providing trustless products and services.\n\nThe decentralized applications are built on Ethereum that can be used for a variety of purposes including finance, gaming and social media. As the native currency on the Ethereum platform, ETH or Ether is needed to run dApps on the global computer that is the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nEther works very similarly to Bitcoin and can be used for peer-to-peer payments. People can use Ether to pay for transaction fees and gas, which is a unit of measurement used to calculate the amount of computational power needed to run a dApp.\n\nMain differences between Ethereum and Bitcoin\n\nAs both the digital tokens race for dominance, it is becoming increasingly common to hear investors and developers weighing in their options between Bitcoin vs Ethereum. Although both Ethereum and Bitcoin are powerful digital assets, each platform has some major advantages as well as disadvantages. In order to compare the two crypto behemoths, let us segregate both the platforms under some basic categories\n\nBlockchain\n\nAlthough, Bitcoin and Ethereum are both based on the \u201cblockchain\u201d technology, Bitcoin (BTC) was created for the sole purpose of providing a way for people to transfer value from one to another without a central bank. It was designed to be an alternative to traditional currencies and hence a medium of exchange and store of value.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum is seen as a general purpose blockchain that outpaces Bitcoin when it comes to developing smart contracts and distributed applications. Owing to the boom in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFT) in the recent past, Ethereum (ETH) has witnessed an exponential growth.\n\nHowever, it depends completely on user requirements. Bitcoin works better as a peer-to-peer transaction system while Ethereum works well when an individual needs to create and build distributed applications and smart contracts. In a nutshell, Bitcoin uses Blockchain to store transaction data while Ethereum uses Blockchain to execute code on it. Bitcoin Blockchain keeps records of payments while Ethereum Blockchain keeps records of a computer program.\n\nConsensus Mechanism\n\nA consensus mechanism is a program used in blockchain systems to achieve distributed agreement about the ledger\u2019s state. Bitcoin uses a consensus protocol called proof of work (PoW). This consensus mechanism uses a lot more energy to do verify one block as it uses randomly selected validators to confirm transactions and create new blocks.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum started as a PoW protocol, but shifted to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus in September 2022 through a software upgrade called, \u201cThe Merge\u201d. This made the Ethereum network more scalable and secure. PoS also substitutes computational power with staking, making it less energy-intensive. With regards to block time, Ethereum is quicker than Bitcoin- an ether transaction is confirmed within seconds compared to minutes for Bitcoin.\n\nEcosystem\n\nFor decades, the Bitcoin ecosystem was limited to storing and transferring value. Hence, developer activity on the world\u2019s oldest blockchain network was minimal, to say the least. But things began to change with the emergence of various Bitcoin DeFi protocols such as Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), Stacks (STX), Rootstock (RBTC), etc.\n\nMoreover, the utility of the Bitcoin network has been expanded even further with the arrival of the Ordinals Protocol. This latest innovation allows developers and artists to create and store digital artworks directly on the Bitcoin blockchain.These platforms have helped to create new use cases for the big daddy of cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe TwelveFold auction has ended. Congratulations to the top 288 bidders \u2013 you will receive your inscription within one week. Valid bids that did not rank in the top 288 will have their bid amount returned to their receiving address within 24 hours. \u2014 Yuga Labs (@yugalabs) March 6, 2023\n\nOn the contrary, Ethereum takes the trophy for a much bigger ecosystem. The Ethereum ecosystem is growing by leaps and bounds, thanks to the surging popularity of its dApps in areas such as DeFi, NFTs, gaming, and technology.\n\nWith a large developer community, robust development tools, it provides developers with a vast array of options for building decentralized applications and smart contracts. It is home to some of the most innovative and successful Blockchain projects, including Uniswap, Compound, and MakerDAO.\n\nUse Cases\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has a limited range of use cases such as remittances, quick international payments, and privacy-focused transactions, for those who want to keep their costs low and avoid high banking fees. It allows users to securely transfer money without the need to go through traditional financial institutions.\n\nThe decentralized nature of it also helps with eliminating fraud, double spending and other issues that can occur with online payments. In a nut shell, Bitcoin is an ideal solution for people looking to purchase goods or services without using their bank account.\n\nConversely, the most promising real-world use cases for Ethereum (ETH) is decentralized finance applications. It provides a decentralized storage facility while the blockchain can also be used to quickly and securely transport data between millions of servers while encrypting it.\n\nWith the increasing DeFi related activitiesthe uses cases of Ethereum has gone through the roof. It has also steadily trotted into the banking systems, particularly because of its decentralized nature making it nearly impossible for hackers to gain access to the network.\n\nBanks and various financial institutions have started using Ethereum-based payment systems as a channel to make payments and remittances because of its security. The world\u2019s second biggest cryptocuurency is also being used in the shipping industry to track cargo and prevent misplacement of goods.\n\nSecurity\n\nTo see how Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) stack against security features, we need to check on their respective hashing algorithms. Hashing algorithms are how these systems can maintain their privacy and ensure security. Bitcoin uses a hashing algorithm known as SHA-256 and Ethereum uses a cryptographic algorithm called \u201cEthash\u201d.\n\nThe most significant difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum is that the Ethash algorithm is memory intensive while the SHA-256 algorithm is not. However, Ethereum\u2019s hash rate is generally much higher than Bitcoin\u2019s, meaning that Ethereum is much more secure against cyber attacks.\n\nDecentralization\n\nIn the context of cryptocurrencies, Decentralization refers to the shift of control and decision-making power from a central authority to a participatory network of peers. Bitcoin and Ethereum, without a doubt, sit on two different sides of the decentralization spectrum. However, Bitcoin is arguably more decentralized than Ethereum as the only way to alter the network is if more than 50% of the network voted in favor of a change.\n\nHowever, with the successful transition to PoS, Ethereum decentralization has increased. It is estimated that since April 2022, Ethereum\u2019s decentralization level has risen by 50%.\n\nComparative Table Ethereum vs Bitcoin\n\nEthereum (ETH) Bitcoin (BTC) Launch Date 30 July 2015 3 January 2009 Max. Token Supply Infinite 21 Million Consensus Mechanism Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Proof-of-Work (PoW) Transactions Fees $2-$6 (depending on network traffic) $0.77 \u2013 $1.95 per transaction Transactions Per Second 30 transactions 7 transactions Programming Language Solidity C++ Web https://ethereum.org/en/ https://bitcoin.org/en/\n\nConclusion\n\nAs the battle between the two giants heat up, we can say that fundamentally Bitcoin and Ethereum are both very different ideas: Bitcoin is considered as a store of value whereas Ethereum is considered as a decentralized platform to program other decentralized ideas. From an investment point of view both the cryptocurrency seem to have huge potential and have lots of reasons to grow further.\n\nSo, to the address the question, \u201cWhich one to buy, Ethereum or Bitcoin\u201d there\u2019s no clear answer. The fact is both the coins have individual uses, cases and great potential, along with having a reason and room to grow.\n\nThis article is for information purposes only.
