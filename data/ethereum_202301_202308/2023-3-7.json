        "title": "CFTC Chair Says Ethereum Is a Commodity\u2014Despite Gensler's 'Bitcoin Only' Position - Yahoo Sports",
        "content": "The chairman of the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has taken a firm stance against the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC)\u2019s subtle power creep over the digital asset market.\n\nRostin Behnam told the Senate Agriculture Committee on Wednesday that Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency next to Bitcoin, is a commodity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been listed on CFTC exchanges for quite some time, and for that reason,\u201d said Behnam, who argued that it creates a \u201cdirect jurisdictional hook\u201d for the agency to police both ETH\u2019s derivatives market and underlying market.\n\nHis opinion appears to directly contradict that of SEC chairman Gary Gensler, who argued last month that \u201ceverything other than Bitcoin\u201d falls under securities laws. While not naming any names, the chairman has hinted many times that this would include Ethereum\u2014especially after the network transitioned to a proof of stake consensus mechanism.\n\nSEC Commissioner Hester Peirce Outlines Problems With the SEC\u2019s Howey Test\n\nUnder the Howey Test, a security counts as an asset sold to raise money from the public, from which they expect profits based on the efforts of others. Gensler\u2019s own words reinforced this in January 2022. However, under the securities act, the definition can be much broader.\n\nComments in late November suggested that Behnam had come to agree with the SEC chief that Ethereum fell under this umbrella, but his argument Wednesday shows that he is standing by his long-held position that there\u2019s room for more than one crypto commodity.\n\n\u201cWe would not have allowed the Ether futures product to be listed on a CFTC exchange if we did not feel strongly that it was a commodity asset,\u201d he elaborated, stating that his agency has \u201cserious legal defences\u201d to support their case.\n\nThe regulatory chiefs also disagree on stablecoins. While the SEC recently threatened to sue Paxos for issuing BUSD as an unregistered security, Behnam believes stablecoins should be considered commodities\u2014absent any legislation to claim otherwise.\n\nBehnam cited an investigation into Tether during a 2021 lawsuit, after which Tether agreed to pay over $40 million to settle charges that it had lied about its dollar reserves.\n\n\u201cExamining the circumstances around the Tether case, it was clear to our enforcement team and the commission that the Tether stablecoin was a commodity, and that we needed to move forward, and swiftly, to police that market,\u201d he said."

        "title": "Ethereum price action and derivatives data confirm bears are currently in control - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The price of Ether (ETH) declined 6% between March 2 and 3, followed by tight-range trading near $1,560. Still, analyzing a wider time frame provides no clear trend, as its chart can point to a descending channel or a slightly longer seven-week bullish pattern.\n\nEther (ETH) price index in USD, 1-day. Source: TradingView\n\nEther\u2019s recent lack of volatility can be partially explained by the upcoming Shanghai hard fork, an implementation aimed at allowing ETH staking withdrawals. Those participants were each required to lock 32 ETH on the Beacon Chain to support the network consensus protocol.\n\nAfter a series of delays, typical for changes in the production environment, the Shanghai Capella upgrade \u2014 also known as Shapella \u2014 is expected for early April, according to Ethereum core developer and project coordinator Tim Beiko. The Goerli testnet upgrade on March 14 will be the final rehearsal for the Shanghai hard fork before it is rolled out on the mainnet.\n\nRecession risks increase, favoring ETH bears\n\nOn the macroeconomic front, United States Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testified before the Senate Banking Committee on March 7. Powell stated that interest rates will likely rise higher than anticipated after \u201cthe latest economic data have come in stronger than expected.\u201d\n\nEvidence points to the Fed lagging behind the inflation curve, boosting the odds of harder-than-expected interest rate increases and asset sales by the monetary authority. For instance, an inflation \u201csurprise\u201d index from Citigroup rose in February for the first time in more than 12 months.\n\nFor risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, a more substantial move by the Fed typically implies a bearish scenario, as investors seek shelter in fixed income and the U.S. dollar. This shift becomes more pronounced in a recessionary environment, which many speculate is either coming or already here.\n\nThe regulatory environment is adding additional pressure for cryptocurrency firms, especially after U.S. Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the White House has noted that the crypto-friendly bank Silvergate had \u201cexperienced significant issues\u201d in recent months.\n\nLet\u2019s look at Ether derivatives data to understand if the $1,560 level is likely to become a support or resistance.\n\nETH derivatives show reduced demand for longs\n\nThe annualized three-month futures premium should trade between 5% and 10% in healthy markets to cover costs and associated risks. However, when the contract trades at a discount (known as \u201cbackwardation\u201d) versus traditional spot markets, it shows a lack of confidence from traders and is deemed a bearish indicator.\n\nEther 3-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe chart above shows that derivatives traders became slightly uncomfortable as the Ether futures premium (on average) moved to 3.1% on March 7, down from 4.9% one week prior. More importantly, the indicator became more distant from the 5% neutral-to-bullish mark.\n\nStill, the declining demand for leverage longs (bulls) does not necessarily translate to an expectation of adverse price action. Consequently, traders should analyze Ether\u2019s options markets to understand how whales and market makers are pricing the odds of future price movements.\n\nThe 25% delta skew is a telling sign th market makers and arbitrage desks are overcharging for upside or downside protection.\n\nIn bear markets, options investors give higher odds for a price dump, causing the skew indicator to rise above 10%. On the other hand, bullish markets tend to drive the skew metric below -10%, meaning the bearish put options are in less demand.\n\nEther 30-day options 25% delta skew: Source: Laevitas\n\nThe delta skew moved above the bearish 10% threshold on March 4, signaling stress from professional traders. A brief improvement happened on March 7, although the metric continues to flirt with bearish expectations as options traders place higher costs on protective put options.\n\nInvestors basing their decisions on fundamentals will likely look to the first couple of weeks following the Shanghai upgrade to measure the potential impact of the ETH unlock. Ultimately, options and futures markets signal that pro traders are less inclined to add long positions, giving higher odds for $1,560 becoming a resistance level in the coming weeks.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Ethereum validators win \u2018short term\u2019 as Blur, OpenSea rivalry drives up gas fees - Forkast News",
        "content": "Ethereum miners, now referred to as validators after the Ethereum blockchain \u201cMerge\u201d in September, are benefiting from the intense competition between non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces Blur and OpenSea that has driven up transaction, or gas, fees on the network.\n\nEthereum gas fees, which typically rise when there is greater demand for network blockspace, have been climbing from the beginning of the year, with recent spikes mainly driven by the NFT market, according to data from on-chain data firm Glassnode.\n\nEthereum validators earn rewards via gas fees by staking their own Ether to help secure the network. Median transaction gas prices came in at 35 Gwei (a denomination of ETH) on Monday, and exceeded 38 Gwei on Feb. 16, the highest since June 2022, Glassnode data showed.\n\n\u201cMiners are the clear winners right now, as they\u2019re processing this massive increase in transactions on Ethereum,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT relations strategist of Forkast Labs\u2019 Cryptoslam.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re reminded of that each time you go to transact, whether sending some ETH between wallets or buying an NFT. That little warning pops up in MetaMask telling you that the network is busy, and you can\u2019t help but think of how well the miners are doing,\u201d Petscher added.\n\nThe Blur NFT marketplace, which launched in October, has gained traction as it doesn\u2019t charge transaction fees for users and recommends a low royalty rate payment for NFT creators. The moves were seen as a clear challenge to NFT market leader OpenSea, which responded by slashing its fees to zero for popular NFT collections as it lost ground to Blur.\n\nShort-term win?\n\nAlice Kohn, an analyst at Glassnode, wrote in a report last week that the recent market focus on Blur has \u201cled to a surge in demand for blockspace, resulting in increased fees for validators.\u201d\n\nOver the past seven days, the Blur NFT marketplace recorded US$410.93 million in trading volume, more than seven times higher than OpenSea\u2019s US$52.4 million, DappRadar data showed.\n\nElsa Kong, head of research of Singapore-based NFT data firm NFTGo, told Forkast that the high gas fees caused by the Blur token airdrop may be seen as beneficial for Ethereum validators in the short term, but \u201cprobably it wouldn\u2019t bring any big changes in the long run.\u201d\n\nKong said that it was not entirely accurate to call Ethereum miners the \u201cwinners\u201d in this situation, as the success of the Ethereum network depends on a variety of factors, including user adoption, network security and developer activity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to note that the Blur token airdrop is not directly related to Ethereum miners, as the miners care more about the Ethereum upgrade such as (the switch from) proof-of-work to proof-of-stake,\u201d Kong said.\n\nBigger stakes\n\nNick Ruck, head of strategy of NFT intellectual property licensing firm ContentFi, said smaller stakers may not see a big difference in their earnings, adding he has been an active Ether staker since November.\n\n\u201cObviously, higher gas fees aren\u2019t great for everyday users, but you get more fees for stakers anyway,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cPersonally, the higher gas fees from my own day trading aren\u2019t offset by the increase in earned fees, but I\u2019m also not staking a whole lot compared to a larger staking-as-a-service firm,\u201d Ruck added. \u201cFor most people staking in pools, they might not see a big difference since they\u2019re sharing in portions.\u201d\n\nRuck said that there\u2019s \u201ca lot of maintenance\u201d that goes into validating. \u201cThe more industrialized your setup is, the more you\u2019ll earn simply due to being more efficient. If you do this at home, you\u2019ll get penalized for going offline, for example.\u201d\n\nRuck agreed that validators will not be long-term beneficiaries from the Blur and OpenSea fight for dominance \u201csimply because I think it\u2019ll be short-lived.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor now, they may earn more, but I think it\u2019s too temporary,\u201d Ruck said. \u201cHow long can Blur and OpenSea go without earning those fees, or just earn minimally compared to previously?\u201d\n\nKohn of Glassnode wrote that the recent attention surrounding Blur has \u201cyet to have an appreciable impact on network adoption.\u201d\n\nKohn said Blur and OpenSea may be fighting over the same pre-existing user base, as the latest interest in NFTs \u201cappear to primarily appeal to existing users, and are as yet, unable to attract new users to the Ethereum network.\u201d\n\nValida Pau contributed to this report."

        "title": "EIP 4337 Activated by Ethereum (ETH): Comprehensive Guide - U.Today",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nWith the new function activated, every owner of a noncustodial Ethereum (ETH) wallet can dramatically increase its functionality and make his/her experience with Ethereum (ETH) and EVM-compatible blockchains secure.\n\nEIP 4337 goes live on Ethereum (ETH): Highlights\n\nYesterday, on March 1, 2023, Ethereum (ETH) developers announced that the Account Abstraction mechanism included in Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP 4337) was stress tested, audited and deployed to mainnet.\n\nBeing in discussions since 2016, Account Abstraction is among the most ambitious changes of Ethereum's (ETH) design;\n\nEIP 4337 is co-developed by the Ethereum Foundation and a number of heavy-hitting Web3 teams: Stackup, Biconomy, Alchemy; OpenZeppelin performed its security audit;\n\nIt blurs the line between Externally Owned Accounts (wallets) and Contract Accounts (smart contracts) and introduces a new instrument in Ethereum: Smart Accounts;\n\nThis update is of paramount importance for the security, operability and massive adoption of the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain;\n\nBesides Ethereum (ETH), this update goes live on all EVM-compatible blockchains: Polygon Network (MATIC), BNB Chain (BSC), Ethereum's L2 networks and so on.\n\nWith EIP 4337 activated, Ethereum (ETH) users can turn their noncustodial wallets into full-stack decentralized banks. This protects new users from losing access to their ETH wallets due to seed phrase issues.\n\nWhat is EIP?\n\nEthereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) are descriptions for standards on the Ethereum (ETH) network: core protocol specifications, client APIs and contract standards. Major network upgrades are associated with the mainnet implementation of this or that EIP.\n\nEthereum (ETH) enthusiasts submit their proposals for discussion and review; the full cycle of approval takes eight phases. Some sophisticated EIPs caused heated debates and were discussed for years.\n\nEIP 20 (introduction of ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum), EIP 721 (non-fungible token standard), and EIP 1559 (dynamic transactional fee model with periodic token burn events) are among the most crucial EIPs since Ethereum's (ETH) inception.\n\nWhat are EOAs and CAs on Ethereum?\n\nEthereum, a first-ever blockchain network with smart contracts support (programmable blockchain), has two types of accounts in its design. Simply put, not unlike traditional banking and payment apps, an Ethereum (ETH) account is where cryptocurrency is stored.\n\nExternally Owned Accounts (or EOAs) can store cryptocurrency but are not able to send transactions themselves. Users need to authorize the transactions with private keys. Crypto wallets like MetaMask are textbook examples of EOAs.\n\nBy contrast, Contract Accounts are software programs that can perform financial operations. They are controlled by code, not private keys. Smart contracts \u2014 basic elements of DeFi and NFT protocols \u2014 are \"Contract Accounts\" (CAs) by design.\n\nWhat is EIP 4337 or Account Abstraction (AA)?\n\nEIP 4337 is an upgrade of the Ethereum (ETH) network's design; it is implemented as an additional layer on the top of the Ethereum (ETH) mainnet, so it did not need a hard fork to go live. With Account Abstraction, Ethereum (ETH) users can easily turn their wallet into a smart contract and supercharge them with extra functionality.\n\nA \"smart account\" is a new type of wallet that becomes available with EIP 4337. First and foremost, average users will be able to turn their accounts into multi-signature storage. This will eliminate the need for account owners to be responsible for private keys.\n\nImage by Stackup\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation highlights that EIP 4337 will allow the use of the results of off-chain computations on-chain, which is truly game changing for making Ethereum (ETH) feature-rich:\n\nERC-4337 attempts to do the same thing that EIP-2938 does, but through extra-protocol means. Users are expected to send off-chain messages called user operations, which get collected and packaged in bulk into a single transaction by either the block proposer or a builder producing bundles for block proposers. The proposer or builder is responsible for filtering the operations to ensure that they only accept operations that pay fees. There is a separate mempool for user operations, and nodes connected to this mempool do ERC-4337-specific validations to ensure that a user operation is guaranteed to pay fees before forwarding it.\n\nSince the first days of EIP 4337 operations \u2014 as revealed by John Rising, Stackup co-founder and vocal upgrade proponent \u2014 the new functionality has a solid infrastructure background and is available on all major EVM-compatible blockchains.\n\nHow EIP 4337 will change Ethereum (ETH) forever\n\nEIP 4337 has already made it into the top ranking of the most important and ambitious EIPs in Ethereum's (ETH) history. With EIP 4337 activated, the Ethereum (ETH) experience for a new generation of users and developers will be different.\n\nEIP 4337 for security\n\nWhen it comes to private key management, EIP 4337 makes it possible for various users to authorize transactions from one account. As such, Ethereum (ETH) holders can integrate their wallet with a smartphone to streamline key management and add an extra recovery instrument for their coins.\n\nEIP 4337 for usability\n\nWhen it comes to smart contracts, EIP 4337 paves the way for 100% \"gas-less\" contracts: now developers can hard-code the opportunity to utilize this or that wallet as a source for gas payments. Previously, such a design needed all transactions to be authorized with private keys.\n\nEIP 4337 for massive adoption\n\nAll enthusiasts, proponents and developers of EIP 4337 are certain that it will make the user experience of Ethereum (ETH) more newbie friendly. The Ethereum (ETH) toolkit becomes more feature-rich than ever before. Now it enables more sophisticated and eccentric designs that would have been impossible without \"smart accounts.\"\n\nWrapping up: What's next for Account Abstraction in EVM?\n\nAs such, EIP 4337 activation is a major milestone for Ethereum (ETH) in 2023. While it now appears overshadowed by the hotly-anticipated Shanghai upgrade (and its economic promises), Account Abstraction is as important for Ethereum's (ETH) tooling as EIP 721 and EIP 1155."

He suggests that bitcoin and ethereum should be viewed as economies, rather than just assets, each having unique characteristics.\n\nPal compares the Bitcoin economy to the Catholic church or the gold bug community, which fiercely protects the integrity of its protocol and is resistant to innovation. The Ethereum economy is compared to the U.S. economy, with a central bank that follows the rules of responsible monetary policy to ensure value is upheld.\n\nPal also notes that ETH has a deflationary supply, which makes it attractive to investors seeking yield. Pal argues that the Ethereum economy presents opportunities for capital gains through private sector lending, NFTs, and the emerging layer of dApps, DAOs, social tokens, and layer 2s.\n\nHe sees the Ethereum economy as the fastest-growing economy on earth, offering many opportunities for investors. However, Pal emphasizes the significance of investing time to find the best options, dollar cost averaging, and diversifying to avoid potential losses.\n\nRegarding other major crypto projects, Pal compares XRP to the U.K., an old economy that lacks innovation and grows slowly.\n\nSolana is compared to South Korea just after the Asian crisis when its currency and equity market came crashing down. It presented an unmatched opportunity that outperformed both the USD and SPX for six years.\n\nHowever, solana failed to continue the outperformance and did not stand the test of time.\n\nPal concludes that the crypto ecosystem presents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for those willing to put in the work to navigate and understand it. Pal also comments on other emerging cryptocurrencies, including Sui, Aptos, Meta, Instagram, and Polygon, and sees ETH as the easiest way to invest with the least risk.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Data shows Ethereum\u2019s year of high correlation with Bitcoin is coming to an end with the metric hitting ATH values.\n\nEthereum Ends 2022 With All-Time High Correlation To Bitcoin\n\nAccording to the year-end report from Arcane Research, the global markets have all fallen strongly correlated this year. The \u201c30-day correlations\u201d is an indicator that measures how in-tune Bitcoin has been with another asset in terms of price movement over a 30-day period.\n\nWhen the value of this metric is greater than zero, it means there has been a positive correlation between BTC and the other asset in the past month. On the other hand, negative values imply that the price of the crypto has been reacting to changes in the value of the other asset by moving in the opposite direction.\n\nAlso, the higher the metric value (in either direction), the more the degree of the correlation. Naturally, the metric has a value equal to zero suggesting the two prices aren\u2019t tied to each other at the moment.\n\nNow, here is a chart that shows the trend in Bitcoin\u2019s 30-day correlations with Ethereum, S&P 500, and Nasdaq over the past year:\n\nLooks like the metric's value corresponding to ETH has been very high in recent weeks | Source: Arcane Research's 2022 - Year in Review\n\nAs the above graph displays, Bitcoin positively correlated with these three assets during 2022. BTC\u2019s correlation has been around or above 0.5 for most of the year for the US equities, suggesting it has been decently tied with them.\n\nThe correlation with Ethereum, however, has been at values of around 0.9 or more, implying Bitcoin has been extremely correlated with it. Even now, as the year\u2019s end, the correlation between these cryptos stands at 0.97, around ATH levels.\n\nBack in September of this year, ETH successfully finished its much-anticipated transition to a Proof-of-Stake consensus system, an event known as the Merge. Since the Merge brought some developments unique to Ethereum, the correlation with BTC dropped, as is apparent in the chart.\n\nHowever, it wasn\u2019t long before the two started moving on the same wavelength again, so even the Merge wasn\u2019t enough to cause sufficient impact to separate the coins.\n\nAlso, since Bitcoin is highly correlated with stocks, so is Ethereum. Though, Arcane Research expects that this correlation between the cryptos and the US equities will soften in the next year due to trading volumes in the crypto market declining substantially.\n\nETH Price\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum\u2019s price floats around $1,200, down 2% in the last week.\n\nETH seems to have gone down recently | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Pierre Borthiry \u2013 Peiobty on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, Arcane Research\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Mastercard's CBDC project explores use of eAUD on public blockchains - Ledger Insights - Ledger Insights",
        "content": "Last week, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and the Digital Finance Cooperative Research Centre (DFCRC) outlined their retail and wholesale central bank digital currency (CBDC) pilot projects. One of the partners selected for the 14 CBDC use cases is Mastercard, which is working with Cuscal on an interoperable CBDC for trusted Web3 commerce. The aim is to enable the use of an eAUD on public blockchains.\n\nThe pilot proposal will use the CBDC to pay for an NFT on Ethereum. Since the CBDC itself is not issued on a public blockchain, the test will \u201clock\u201d the required amount on the CBDC platform and mint an equivalent sum of wrapped tokens on Ethereum. However, for the transaction to go through, the Ethereum wallets of the buyer and seller and the smart contract itself must first be whitelisted. This will illustrate the possibility of implementing controls on public blockchains, such as know-your-customer (KYC) rules.\n\nHowever, wrapping is not without risks. Essentially, a wrapped token is a tokenized copy of a coin that exists on a different blockchain, pegged to the value of the other asset and backed on a 1:1 basis. Hence, wrapping allows building bridges between different chains, circumventing the limitation on non-native assets on public blockchains such as Ethereum or BNB Smart Chain.\n\nThe risks of wrapping CBDCs\n\nYet the process needs to be transparent. Earlier this year, it surfaced that the Binance USD (BUSD) stablecoin, which is issued by the New York-regulated trust company Paxos on Ethereum, was not always 1:1 backed on other chains, despite being rock solid on Ethereum. As it turned out, Paxos was not involved in managing or supporting wrapped versions of BUSD, which it was upfront about on its website. Instead, other actors were issuing wrapped or pegged BUSD on other chains.\n\nJust as important is who wraps a CBDC, not specific to this particular use case. Locking currency on one blockchain and issuing on another means that code runs the process. Numerous smart contract vulnerabilities have resulted in the loss of significant sums of crypto through bridges between blockchains. It\u2019s one thing if a vulnerability damages the reputation of a crypto firm, but another issue if there\u2019s institutional reputational damage or one connected to a central bank.\n\nAdditionally, a group of people will be responsible for the keys that control wallets. It\u2019s not unheard of for protocol creators to run off with funds. So they need to be trustworthy.\n\nApart from that, the central bank will be fussier about anti-money laundering than a stablecoin issuer. So they\u2019ll want to influence who wraps their CBDC. But on permissionless public blockchains, in theory, anyone can wrap anything they want if someone is willing to use it.\n\nCentral banks around the world are taking different approaches to public blockchain. Many completely ignore public blockchains, such as Europe, which so far has focused on payment for retail sales and P2P transfers. Others are more accepting, including Brazil, which tested its digital real for a couple of retail applications using public blockchains. But CBDCs will inevitably be wrapped, so some regulations on what is allowed will likely be implemented.\n\nThe Mastercard solution will enable CBDCs to be tokenized into other chains with controls to ensure that only authorized parties can hold, use, and redeem them. According to the project team, this will allow consumers\u201d to participate in crypto ecosystems using trusted and reliable forms of money\u201d. More broadly, it will increase the utility of the CBDC and exploit many of the benefits offered by cryptocurrencies and Web3 commerce."

        "content": "UCSD\u2019s Geisel Library. Photo by Chris Stone\n\nThe founder of the Ethereum blockchain network has donated $15 million to UC San Diego for open-source research into airborne pathogens and pollution, the university announced Tuesday.\n\nThe gift from Vitalik Buterin through his Balvi Filantropic Fund establishes the Meta-Institute for Airborne Disease in a Changing Climate.\n\n\u201cOver the last several years, it has become abundantly apparent that we need more open-source scientific research to better understand airborne pathogens and pollutants and how they affect us,\u201d said Buterin, a Canadian-educated programmer who emigrated to the West from Russia.\n\n\u201cI am pleased to support the creation of this new institute at UC San Diego, which will work to grow our scientific knowledge about airborne disease and share it freely, enabling changes to infrastructure and policy that benefit people around the globe,\u201d he said.\n\nThe gift was made in USD Coin, a cryptocurrency pegged to the U.S. dollar.\n\nButerin\u2019s donation is one of the largest cryptocurrency gifts made to a U.S. university. The gift was exchanged into dollars through Engiven, a San Diego-based provider of cryptocurrency donation services to nonprofits.\n\nThe new institute will represent a cross-campus collaboration, using expertise in varied fields to better understand aerosolized pathogens and their impact, which could include health issues such as allergies, asthma and systemic diseases spread by aerosol transmission, such as COVID-19.\n\n\u201cAt UC San Diego, we translate discoveries into solutions,\u201d said Chancellor Pradeep K.

        "title": "Polygon (MATIC) and Ethereum (ETH) are Listed for Leverage Trading on Covo Finance - PR Newswire",
        "content": "NEW YORK, March 7, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Covo Finance is a decentralized trading platform that allows users to trade popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Polygon (MATIC), and others directly from their cryptocurrency wallets. It allows users to trade perpetual futures with up to 50x leverage, similar to how it's done on centralized exchanges. However, unlike centralized exchanges, users keep custody of their assets using a cryptocurrency wallet.\n\nPolygon, formerly Matic Network, is a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum that aims to improve scalability and usability for decentralized applications. Thanks to its low fees and fast transaction times, Polygon (MATIC) has quickly gained popularity among developers and traders alike. Ethereum (ETH), on the other hand, is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and is widely used for smart contracts and decentralized applications.\n\nWith the addition of these two cryptocurrencies to Covo Finance's platform, traders can now access even more profit opportunities. Leveraged trading allows traders to amplify their gains (or losses) by borrowing funds to increase their exposure to an asset. For example, a trader with $1,000 in their account could trade up to $50,000 worth of the cryptocurrency using 50x leverage.\n\nEasily Trade Top Crypto with Leverage with Covo Finance\n\nTo start trading crypto with leverage, users must connect their cryptocurrency wallet to the Covo Finance platform and deposit funds. Users can then select the asset they want to trade and choose their desired leverage level. The platform supports a variety of cryptocurrencies, including Polygon (MATIC), Ethereum (ETH), USDC, BTC, and others.\n\nEarn Up to 70% APR on MATIC and ETH by Depositing to COVOLP Pools\n\nCOVOLP is a token representing a share of the liquidity pool on Covo Finance, from which traders can borrow for their leverage trading. By staking COVOLP, stakers can earn 70% of the trading fees generated by the platforms and additional rewards in COVO tokens.\n\nTo mint COVOLP, users must first provide liquidity by depositing MATIC, ETH, or USDC to receive COVOLP tokens in return based on their pool share.\n\nNext, COVOLP holders must approve and stake their COVOLP tokens in the dashboard. The APR for staking COVOLP depends on several factors, such as the fees earned by the platform and COVO tokens inflation. According to Defillama , the current APR for staking COVOLP is around 67%.\n\nStep-by-Step Guide for Crypto Margin Trading with Covo Finance\n\nCovo Finance also includes various features to help traders stay informed and make informed decisions. The platform includes:\n\nReal-time market data.\n\nCharting tools.\n\nVarious technical indicators help traders analyze market trends and make informed trades.\n\nOpening a position at Covo Finance is straightforward. Traders need to click \"Long\" or \"Short,\" depending on which side they want to open a leverage position. A long position earns a profit if the token's price goes up and makes a loss if the token's price goes down. A short position earns a profit if the token's price goes down and makes a loss if the token's price goes up.\n\nAfter selecting their preferred position, users must key in the amount they want to pay and the leverage they want to use. For instance, 0.1 ETH worth $352.33 is used to buy a 5x ETH (Ethereum) long position of $1752.89. The \"Entry Price\" is $3541.17, and the Liquidation Price is $2903.76.\n\nThe trading fee to open a position is 0.1% of the position size, and there is a 0.1% fee when closing the position. There are no price impacts or slippage for opening or closing trades as Covo Finance uses decentralized oracles for asset prices which is the aggregate price of Major Exchanges.\n\nManaging positions on Covo Finance is also straightforward. After opening a trade, users can view it under their Positions list. They can also click \"Edit\" to deposit or withdraw collateral, which allows them to manage their leverage and liquidation price. When a user opens a position or deposits collateral, a snapshot of the USD price of their collateral is taken. So, for example, if a user's collateral is 0.1 ETH, and the price of ETH is $3523.30 at the time, then their collateral is $352.33 and will not change even if the price of ETH changes.\n\nA user's profit and loss will be proportional to their position size. If, for instance, $352.33 is used to buy $1752.89 worth of ETH, and the price of ETH increases by 10%, the position would have a profit of $175.29. If the price of ETH decreases by 10%, the position will lose $175.29.\n\nIf a short position is opened instead, and the price of ETH decreases by 10%, the position would profit $175.29. However, if the price of ETH increases by 10%, the position would lose $175.29.\n\nCovo Finance's platform is designed to make leveraged trading more accessible and user-friendly. The platform is decentralized, and trades are executed on a peer-to-peer basis. Decentralization reduces the risk of hacking or theft, as funds are not held in a central location.\n\nAdding Polygon (MATIC) and Ethereum (ETH) to Covo Finance's platform is a significant development for the decentralized trading ecosystem. It gives traders even more opportunities to profit from the growing cryptocurrency market while offering a user-friendly and secure platform for leveraged trading. However, traders should be aware of the risks associated with leveraged trading and use caution when executing trades.\n\nMedia Contact:\n\nCompany: Covo Finance\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nWebsite: https://covo.finance\n\nLogo: https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2017634/Covo_Finance_Logo.jpg\n\nSOURCE Covo Finance"

        "content": "Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal thinks investors should view crypto projects like digital nation-states rather than assets or tech advancements.\n\nThe former Goldman Sachs executive says in a new blog post that crypto ecosystems are networks that produce intrinsic and extrinsic value.\n\nThe Bitcoin (BTC) network, he argues, is founded on the principle that BTC is an independent monetary system free from the corrupting influence of governments.\n\n\u201cIt is fiercely protective of the integrity of its protocol (how its society functions) and as a result, shuns innovation in the name of purity. Think of the Bitcoin economy as the Catholic Church back in the Dark Ages or the gold bug community. There can only be one God or one asset. In the case of the Bitcoin economy, the only asset that exists is Bitcoin. So, if you wish to allocate capital to this economy, your only choice is to HODL [hold on for dear life] Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nPal says the Ethereum (ETH) network, by contrast, shares more similarities to the complex US economy.\n\n\u201cIn this system, you can start out by buying ETH which has a deflationary supply, meaning there will be less of it as time goes by. Because of this, its \u2018central bank\u2019 (the staking) adheres to responsible monetary policy designed to ensure that value is upheld and not debased.\u201d\n\nPal notes that staking ETH is like purchasing Treasury bonds with the US government and decentralized finance (DeFi) is akin to the riskier banking sector. The Real Vision CEO predicts the Ethereum economy\u2019s greater complexity will make it bigger than the Bitcoin economy over time.\n\nPal also compares XRP and Ethereum competitor Solana (SOL) to their own respective national economies.\n\n\u201cFor example, you could think of XRP as the UK: an old economy that, while important and well established, does not grow very fast because of a lack of innovation.\n\nSolana on the other hand might be South Korea just after the Asian crisis when its currency and equity market came crashing down. It was an unmatched opportunity that outperformed both the USD and SPX for six years. However, it did not stand the test of time. It failed to continue the outperformance. Who knows how Solana will play out.\u201d\n\nHe concludes by looking at the total market capitalization of crypto assets, which he says is currently flashing \u201ca perfect setup\u201d as it sits between two long-term support levels.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Ethereum Price Balks As Dormant Whales Reactivate - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum price closely followed that of bitcoin throughout the week and this saw the digital asset fall below the $1,200 level once more. Presently, the entire market looks to be consolidating but Ethereum has been put under some pressure following the activation of two whale addresses. These addresses which had not transacted for about half a decade had suddenly moved tens of millions of dollars worth of ETH between them.\n\nFive-Year-Old Whales Move $27 Million\n\nIn the early hours of Monday, Lookonchain, an on-chain data tracker, took to Twitter to post the re-awakening of long-dormant Ethereum addresses. These addresses both held at least $10 million worth of ETH on their balances and had not seen any type of activity in the last five years, until today.\n\nBoth wallets, seemingly out of nowhere, had first transferred out 1 ETH to a new wallet in what looks like test transactions. What followed was another large transaction that would empty out their balances.\n\nThe first wallet would transfer a total of 9,877 ETH in a single transaction, worth $11.7 million at current prices, while the second wallet would transfer out a total of 13,103.99 ETH in its second transaction, worth $15.5 million at press time. This brought their cumulative total transactions to more than $27 million.\n\nETH stalls at $1,185 | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nAll of the ETH was transferred to new, unknown wallets with no prior history besides the 1 ETH test transaction. The ETH is now sitting in these new Ethereum addresses and has not been touched so far.\n\nBad News For Ethereum?\n\nThe movement of such a large amount of ETH has stopped the digital asset in its tracks. So far, there has not been any meaningful movement in the Ethereum price which shows a lot of wariness on the part of investors and traders alike.\n\nHowever, despite the ETH from these whales being significant, it does not look to have any market impact since the coins were just moved from one storage wallet to another, as it seems. There has been no movement to centralized exchanges, and if this was a sale, it was an OTC trade which eliminates the pressure such a sale would have had on the open market.\n\nEthereum price on the other hand has now moved into the control of the bears. The $1,200 support was flipped and is now a resistance level that bulls must beat to attain any momentum. This also drags the digital asset well below the 100-day moving average of $1,439, showing bearishness for the medium to long term.\n\nETH\u2019s price is currently trending at $1,180. It is down 5.22% in the last 7 days and saw trading volumes of approximately $4 billion in the last 24 hours.\n\nFeatured image from Bitcoinist, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Solana (SOL) has been completely engulfed in FUD since the FTX crash. This invariably resulted in the price of the token declining much faster than the rest of the market, and last week, SOL touched single-digit values for the first time in almost two years. However, there seems to be a turn in the tide for the digital asset as it receives support from Vitalik Buterin.\n\nVitalik Buterin Offers Support To Solana\n\nTaking to Twitter, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin expressed support for Solana for the first time. Solana which had been the fiercest competitor of Ethereum had been unable to keep up given its ties to FTX crypto exchange, its sister company Alameda Research, and its disgraced founder Sam Bankman-Fried, but Buterin is not pleased that the competitor is essentially crumbling.\n\nIn the tweet, the Ethereum founder explained that \u201csome smart people\u201d had told it that there was still a good developer community on the blockchain who are earnest and smart. Furthermore, they added that since the opportunistic people trying to make a quick buck had now been pushed out, they expect the network to have a bright future.\n\nButerin himself explains that he couldn\u2019t tell if this was true looking in from the outside but said that he hoped that \u201cthe community gets its fair chance to thrive. This tweet was made about four days ago and it had an incredibly positive impact on Solana.\n\nSOL Price Rallies On Buterin Comments\n\nThe price of SOL saw an upward trend following the tweets from the Ethereum founder. Although Solana remains a long way from its glory days, Buterin\u2019s tweets had given the bulls just the morale boost they needed and by Monday, SOL\u2019s price had surged as high as $12 before correcting back down.\n\nSOL recovers above $11 | Source: SOLUSD on TradingView.com\n\nPresently, the price of the digital asset is sitting above $11, rising over 15% in the last 24 hours. This recovery has also helped to wipe out most of the losses recorded over the last week, and now, it is down only 1.81% in the last 7 days compared to over 20% losses being recorded last week.\n\nThis recovery also puts the digital asset close to the top of the list of gainers for the day. It sits only behind Lido DAO which is up over 16% in the last hours.\n\nAs for whether SOL will be able to maintain current prices and go higher, it depends on the momentum in the market. The cryptocurrency is still subject to intense FUD and community morale remains low but the $13 level remains within sights as long as buy pressure keeps up.\n\nFeatured image from Coin Culture, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Ethereum Stalls At $1,200, Why Bears Still Have The Upper Hand - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum is still closely mirroring the price of bitcoin through the bear market and that has seen its price basically stall in the last day in tandem with BTC. ETH\u2019s price is presently resting just above $1,200, and while this would have served as a good bounce-off point for the digital asset, it shows no signs of doing so.\n\nEthereum Price Stuck At $1,200\n\nGiven the current market circumstances, Ethereum at $1,200 presents one of the best prices that the market will see for the digital asset before 2022 runs out. The momentum in the market was already on a decline but the 49% jump in Ethereum\u2019s trading volume in the last day put a perhaps temporary stop to that decline. Short-term indicators pointing towards sell points to this being temporary.\n\nNow, for the lull in price, it can be explained by ETH\u2019s price sitting so close to the 20-day moving average of $1,247. Since there isn\u2019t much movement in the market, it makes sense that the digital asset would only try to maintain its price at just above $1,200 at this time.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s tight correlation to the stock market has also impacted Ethereum. Although cryptocurrencies did not fall like the stock market following the release of the US GDP data on Thursday, it definitely hindered any growth from taking place in the market.\n\nETH price struggling at $1,200 | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nWhy Is ETH Struggling?\n\nEthereum has received some bad press over the last couple of days. One of the most prominent was when the Paxful peer-to-peer exchange announced that it was delisting Ethereum. CEO Ray Youssef presented the reason as \u201cIntegrity over revenue\u201d as the exchange believes that the network was not decentralized.\n\nThis stoked fears that had previously subsided following the move to proof of stake. For many, this move made Ethereum much easier to control and Youssef said, \u201cOne day you will need permission to use it.\u201d\n\nGiven this, the price of ETH has buckled under the pressure of the FUD it created. If bulls are unable to hold the $1,200 support, then it could send the digital asset into free fall, with no significant support until $1,140. The cryptocurrency is already headed for a close below its year-to-date peak but a close below $1,200 would see it start the new year with a very bearish outlook.\n\nETH is trading at $1,224 at the time of this writing, according to data from Coinmarketcap. It is up 0.64% in the last 24 hours and boasts a market cap of $149.8 billion.\n\nFeatured image from Ledger Insights, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "An analyst has explained that the absence of miners on the Ethereum network could be bullish for the ETHBTC ratio.\n\nMiners Provide A Persistent Selling Pressure On Bitcoin\n\nAs explained in a tweet by Tom Dunleavy, a Messari research analyst, BTC miners sell almost all the coins they mine. The below chart contains data about the top ten public Bitcoin mining companies, displaying information such as how much each of them mined this year, the amounts that they sold, and the size of their current holdings:\n\nLooks like Marathon is holding the largest reserve right now | Source: Tom Dunleavy on Twitter\n\nIn total, the ten largest mining companies in the space mined a collective 40.7 BTC this year and sold 40.3 BTC. This means that they roughly dumped the entire supply that they mined in 2022 and in the process, applied constant selling pressure on the network.\n\nEarlier in the year, Ethereum successfully transitioned to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, which means the blockchain no longer uses miners for handling transactions, and rather uses stakers (investors that have locked 32 ETH in the PoS contract) to act as validating nodes.\n\nIn a Proof-of-Work (PoW) system, miners compete with each other using large amounts of computing power. Therefore, many expenses are involved in getting up their facilities, but one cost, in particular, stays with them as long as they continue to operate: the electricity bills. It is because of these electricity bills that miners have to continuously sell what they mine to keep their business sustainable.\n\nSome miners try to hold onto their reserves for as long as possible, like Marathon, and Hut8 can be seen doing in the chart. Still, in a market like right now, where electricity prices have shot up while the BTC price has plummeted due to the bear, margins are fine for the already debt-ridden public miners, and thus most of them can\u2019t afford to accumulate.\n\nIn the case of a PoS chain, however, stakers don\u2019t incur such expenses and thus don\u2019t have any particular need to sell the rewards they earn while staking. This implies that the type of selling pressure that miners put on Bitcoin isn\u2019t present on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe analyst believes that this fact provides a good thesis to be bullish on the ETHBTC ratio.\n\nEthereum Price\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH is trading around $1,200, down 1% in the last week.\n\nThe value of the crypto doesn't seem to have moved much during the last few days | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Pierre Borthiry \u2013 Peiobty on Unsplash.com, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "As digital assets continue to grow in popularity worldwide, many investors are looking for ways to stay ahead of the game. If Cryptocurrencies can continue to build on their already strong foundation, there\u2019s no telling how much their prices could go up. For that reason, it\u2019s essential to stay well informed and learn all about the predictions of these two cryptocurrencies for the year that has just commenced.\n\nFor those who are looking to get in on the action early, there are a few things to do. The first is to learn about the predictions of these two currencies and then read about what steps to take to start investing in Crypto. You can do that by checking out this article with predictions for Ethereum and Bitcoin prices in 2023 and a guide on how to invest in them.\n\nOur predictions for Bitcoin\n\nCryptocurrencies have doubtlessly been on the rise for years now. Bitcoin, in particular, has seen tremendous growth, with its value increasing tenfold since 2017. This trend is expected to continue in the coming years, and many experts have made bitcoin price predictions 2023 that are staggering.\n\nSome believe that bitcoin could reach as high as $1 million per coin by the end of 2023, while others believe it will settle around $100,000. Those who get in early stand to make the most profit, so it\u2019s important to do your research and make an informed decision about whether or not to invest.\n\nOur predictions for Ethereum\n\nThe year 2023 might see Ethereum prices reach new highs. ETH could be worth $10,000 by the end of this year. While this may seem like a stretch, it\u2019s important to remember that the price of Bitcoin reached nearly $20,000 very fast.\n\nThe growth of the DeFi sector, increasing institutional adoption, and the launch of ETH 2.0 could all contribute to pushing Ethereum prices higher in 2023, which is why the Ethereum price prediction is high.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to get involved and want to invest in Ethereum, there are a few actions you can take. Naturally, you should first make sure you carry out your research before investing in it. After that, look into buying ETH on a reputable exchange like Coinbase or Kraken. And for your final step, consider storing your ETH in a secure wallet like Ledger or Trezor. By keeping an eye on Ethereum price predictions for 2023, you could make more informed decisions for investing in ETH.\n\nSteps to take for your first Crypto investment\n\nAs you could have concluded by now, Bitcoin and Ethereum are two of the most popular cryptocurrencies, and their prices have certainly caught plenty of attention. If you\u2019re thinking about investing in crypto, here are some factors to consider.\n\nThe basics\n\nIt\u2019s important to understand how cryptocurrency works. Cryptocurrency is a digital currency that uses cryptography to secure its transactions. Bitcoin, for example, is based on a decentralized network of computers that keep track of all bitcoin transactions. Ethereum is similar but also allows users to create contracts and programs within the Ethereum network.\n\nResearch\n\nYou need to decide which currency you want to invest in. There are numerous different cryptocurrencies available, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Make sure to research each one to find the one that suits your needs best.\n\nAccount setting\n\nYou need to open an account with a reputable exchange where you can buy and sell cryptocurrency. Coinbase is a popular option for those looking to invest in Bitcoin or Ethereum. Once you\u2019ve set up your account, you\u2019ll be able to buy and sell currency pairs like BTC/USD or ETH/USD.\n\nCaution\n\nLast but not least, it\u2019s vital to remember that cryptocurrency prices are highly volatile. This means that they can fluctuate rapidly in value, so it\u2019s important to monitor the market closely before making any trades. You should also have a clear exit strategy planned out before buying or selling any Crypto.\n\nThere are plenty of expectations in the crypto market in store for 2023 and the future of Ethereum and Bitcoin looks very bright. However, you will need to carry out your research and be cautious, while continually reading news about the price changes of Cryptocurrencies you want to invest in.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "ZKSync, an Ethereum layer-2 platform designed to scale transaction throughput using zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs and Rollups, has released a new software development kit (SDK) in Swift.\n\nZKSync Releases SDK in Swift\n\nIn a tweet on January 17, ZKSync said the goal is to make their features more accessible to developers and dApps. With a Swift SDK, ZKSync would support more platforms and use cases, especially for teams building iOS and macOS applications on ZKSync 2.0.\n\nWe want to make zkSync 2.0\u2019s features accessible to more developers and applications, so we\u2019ve released a new SDK in Swift. #scalingthemission 1/4 pic.twitter.com/GdH8naXxHI \u2014 zkSync (@zksync) January 17, 2023\n\nSwift is the programming language behind iOS and Mac devices. However, Swift cloud storage software for iOS and macOS enables users to retrieve data through an API. Cloud storage is scalable and designed to store unstructured data that can limitlessly grow.\n\nSDKs in Popular Programming Languages\n\nBesides Swift, ZKSync also supports Python, Java, Android, Rust, and Dart programming languages. Dart, the layer-2 platform explains, is the \u201cunofficial\u201d open-sourced SDK in Alpha. However, the layer-2 portal plans to support more SDKs in various programming languages to cater to their expanding developer community, allowing them to build more solutions addressing multiple problems.\n\nSDKs are critical for developers since they allow the building to be simpler, faster, and standardized. For creators to integrate into existing services, they require kits, which often include necessary documentation, code samples, libraries, APIs, and more, providing guidance when developing blockchain solutions. However, within any developer kit, APIs are critical because they act as an interface for dApps to relay information and coordinate.\n\nScaling Ethereum Using ZKSync v2\n\n\n\nZKSync layer-2 is building a solution for users to quickly transfer ethereum (ETH) and ERC-20 tokens without paying the relatively high fees in the mainnet.\n\nEthereum gas fees often fluctuate depending on on-chain activities. As ETH prices rally, DeFi and NFT activities often expand, leading to high gas fees. With Gas rising on a public, transparent layer, users have to pay more to transfer or execute smart contracts.\n\nETH price at $1,578 | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe layer-2 platform is positioning itself as a better alternative for teams and users, preferring scalability, privacy, and security. Following the launch of the ZKSync 2.0 mainnet, there is a scaling and privacy engine using ZK proofs. Earlier, Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, relayed his confidence in ZK Rollups that dApps on ZKSync leverages. In the co-founder\u2019s assessment, ZK Rollups \u201cwill win out in all use cases.\u201d\n\nZKSync 2.0 Is Live on Mainnet\n\nUsers deploying on the ZKSync 2.0 mainnet, which launched in Q4 2022, enjoy low fees and faster transaction settlement. Developers are free to experiment and add more features.\n\nFor instance, ZKSync supports account abstraction for users to pay fees in other tokens apart from ETH and build smart contracts in Vyper or Solidity. The layer-2 solution also supports Atomic Swaps. It is a feature that ZKSync creators say can benefit cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nNewsBTC reported earlier that Optimism, a general-purpose Ethereum layer-2, and ZKSync competitor, was more Gas efficient despite revenue and assets under its management dropping.\n\nFeatured image by Matter Labs, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "NFT fans will be able to purchase the digital collectibles with their own Amazon account via debit or credit cards. Photo: Joseph Prezioso/AFP (JOSEPH PREZIOSO via Getty Images)\n\nAmazon is set to launch its own NFT marketplace next month, with the option of having digital collectibles linked to physical goods delivered to customers\u2019 doorsteps, according reports.\n\nThe details so far state that the marketplace will have 15 NFT collections available on launch for US-based customers, before expanding worldwide.\n\nNFT aficionados will be able to purchase the digital collectibles with their own Amazon (AMZN) account via debit or credit cards.\n\nThis will allow those who do not have access to a crypto wallet, such as Metamask, the ability to buy NFTs without having to purchase cryptocurrencies like ethereum (ETH-USD).\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAccording to reports the Amazon NFT marketplace could be called either 'Amazon NFT Marketplace' or 'Amazon Digital Marketplace'.\n\nWeb3 media outlet The Big Whale reported a date of April 24 for the launch.\n\nNFTs linked to physical goods delivered to doorsteps\n\nAfter the initiative is launched, Amazon shoppers will be able to purchase fashion-oriented NFTs that are linked to physical clothing, such as jeans, trainers and sweatshirts, according to a report.\n\nThese NFTs will be delivered to customer NFT accounts whilst the physical piece of clothing is being delivered to customer doorsteps.\n\nOne clothing company that has been at the forefront of linking NFTs with their physical produce is Nike.\n\nNike (NKE) acquired the virtual assets company RTFKT in 2021, which was integrated into the new \"Nike Virtual Studio\" to unleash a series of Nike-branded NFTs.\n\nAn example of this is Nike's Dunk Genesis CryptoKicks NFT range that is linked to the apparel retailer's 'real-world' Dunk sneakers.\n\nAmazon NFT initiative has been in development for months\n\nJeff Bezos' tech and online retail multinational has been taking progressive steps towards incorporating more Web3 features into its platforms.\n\nBack in January, crypto news outlet Blockworks reported that the world's largest retailer was launching a digital assets enterprise involving NFTs.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to the January report, four sources told Blockwork's that an Amazon NFT initiative is expected to be made available to consumers worldwide in the spring.\n\nIn the same month Amazon Web Services (AWS) partnered with web3 firm Ava Labs in a bid to accelerate the adoption of blockchain technology.\n\nWe\u2019re joining forces with @Amazon to help enterprises and governments build compliant blockchain solutions. #AWS makes it easier to launch and manage #Avalanche nodes, giving the network more strength and flexibility for developers.https://t.co/vgabB5c6Ya \u2014 Ava Labs \ud83d\udd3a (@avalabsofficial) January 11, 2023\n\nNFT market slump and the FTX collapse\n\nThe launch of digital collectible services on Amazon was delayed following the collapse of Bahamian cryptocurrency exchange FTX in November 2022.\n\nAfter the collapse of FTX the entire crypto ecosystem took a critical hit to its reputation, and the interest from web2 firms and retails in launching NFT marketplaces almost evaporated.\n\nHowever, the interest in NFTs amongst consumers has been slowly picking up pace again. The market for digital collectibles has shown signs of recovery since the beginning of 2023, according to data from DappRadar.\n\nA recent report from DappRadar showed healthier figures for the NFT market as a whole. In January NFT trading volume stood at $946m, up 38% from December 2022.\n\nCompanies such as Gucci, Nike and McDonald\u2019s (MCD) are developing digital collectibles as a promotional strategy to increase interest in their offerings.\n\nGucci is now running its own NFT-based metaverse event in The Sandbox. The Italian fashion label has created the first significant virtual environment on the metaverse platform that incorporates the brand's NFTs, called 'Gucci Vault Land'.\n\nWhat are NFTs?\n\nNFT stands for 'non-fungible token', and can usually be purchased on NFT marketplaces such as OpenSea.\n\nThey are unique digital assets that exist on a blockchain, which is a decentralised digital ledger that records transactions.\n\nThink of NFTs as digital collectibles or artwork that are unique and can't be replicated. They can be anything from a digital image or video to a tweet or a music album, or even a digital piece of clothing that can be used within a virtual world.\n\nWhen someone purchases an NFT, they own a digital certificate of ownership that verifies that they own the original, one-of-a-kind version of the asset.\n\nThis certificate is stored on the blockchain and can't be replicated or altered.\n\nNFTs have become popular in recent years as a way for creators and artists to sell and monetise their digital creations.\n\nThey also provide collectors with a way to own and invest in unique digital assets.\n\nAmazon has been contacted by Yahoo Finance UK, but have yet to reply with comment.\n\nWatch: Ukraine purchasing military equipment with crypto | The Crypto Mile"

        "title": "These Are My Top Risk-Averse Cryptocurrencies - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "After a strong start to the year, the crypto market has been trading sideways recently. There are concerns about the liquidity and ongoing viability of key crypto market intermediaries, as well as a considerable amount of anxiety about further Federal Reserve rate hikes.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, the race is on to find the best risk-averse cryptocurrencies. These are the cryptos that are most likely to hold on to their gains, even if the market starts to move downward. These are also the cryptos that are less volatile when it comes to daily market moves, due to their superior long-term growth prospects.\n\nBitcoin\n\nThe starting point is Bitcoin (BTC 0.86%), which remains the most popular crypto in the market for both retail and institutional investors. At a current price of $22,385, Bitcoin has a total market cap of more than $432 billion, which represents approximately 40% of the market cap of the entire crypto market. For many investors, Bitcoin is the first crypto they ever add to their portfolios, as well as the one crypto they are most likely to buy and hold.\n\nWhile everybody knows about the tremendous gains that Bitcoin is capable of producing, what might not be as well-known is how well Bitcoin has bounced back from previous market meltdowns and crypto collapses. In its history, Bitcoin has staged at least five different comebacks, including one time in 2011 when the price of Bitcoin almost fell to $0.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Bitcoin's decline of 65% in 2022 is not as troubling to longtime crypto investors. Remember: Bitcoin fell by 73% in 2018 but later recovered and eventually soared to an all-time high in 2021.\n\nWhile Bitcoin has been notoriously volatile in the past, it is actually losing much of its famed volatility. Traders now are actually complaining that Bitcoin is not volatile enough, since the crypto has been trading in a relatively narrow trading range since mid-2022. In fact, Bitcoin is starting to trade much more like a large high-tech stock than a risky crypto in 2023.\n\nFinally, Bitcoin is becoming increasingly diversified on an international scale as it becomes an important part of the global economy. Brazil just put into place a comprehensive framework for the use of Bitcoin, while other countries are looking to ramp up the use of Bitcoin within their financial systems. The latest survey on Bitcoin payments highlights the potential for Bitcoin adoption to grow 50% by the year 2025.\n\nEthereum\n\nAnother risk-averse cryptocurrency is Ethereum (ETH 1.46%), which has a massive market cap of $191.6 billion, trailing only Bitcoin in terms of market size. Like Bitcoin, Ethereum has become a popular crypto for both retail and institutional investors, and now accounts for nearly 20% of the entire market cap of the entire crypto industry.\n\nWhat makes Ethereum unique is the size and scope of its ecosystem, which now includes everything from non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to decentralized finance (DeFi). It also includes blockchain gaming, metaverse platforms, and decentralized applications using smart contracts. This provides a tremendous amount of diversification and enables Ethereum investors to diversify away some of the systemic risk found within the crypto market.\n\nEthereum also remains the top Layer 1 blockchain network, giving investors the peace of mind of knowing they are investing in a best-in-class crypto. Back in 2021, it looked like a handful of Layer 1 blockchain upstarts might unseat Ethereum.\n\nHowever, last year Ethereum completed The Merge, which was one of the most celebrated feats ever in the crypto and blockchain industry. As a result, Ethereum is cheaper, faster, and more efficient than ever. And this gives it a tremendous economic moat to fend off potential \"Ethereum killers.\"\n\nShould you buy Bitcoin or Ethereum?\n\nAt the end of the day, Bitcoin and Ethereum both offer an optimal blend of risk and reward. Both are capable of churning out massive upside performance. At the same time, both are relatively less risky than other, more speculative coins in the crypto market. Sure, Bitcoin or Ethereum might not have the stratospheric upside potential of a hot new AI crypto token, but you also don't have to worry about Bitcoin or Ethereum falling to $0 overnight.\n\nI'm bullish both short term and long term on these two cryptos, and I think they should be the building blocks of any diversified crypto portfolio. They are two cryptos you can buy and hold forever."

        "title": "Ethereum Founder Buterin Dumps These Meme Coins, What You Need to Know - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin caused a stir in the crypto community today, but not with a tweet, but with the sale of several unknown meme coins. Both on-chain data provider Lookonchain and blockchain security company PeckShield have reported the transactions.\n\nLookonchain revealed via Twitter on March 7 that Vitalik Buterin is selling off \u201chis free shitcoins.\u201d So far, the Ethereum co-founder has sold 50 billion MOPS for 1.25 ETH (about $2,000), 10 billion CULT for 58 ETH (about $91,000) and 500 trillion SHIK for 380 ETH (about $600,000).\n\nSecurity firm PeckShield Alert reported via Twitter that CULT (Cult DAO) has fallen 13.7% since the dump by Buterin. SHIK (SHIKOKU) has been hit even harder, falling -95.8%. The SHIK address tagged with Vitalik Buterin has netted around 164 ETH (around $260,000) and transferred 214 ETH (around $337,000) to EthDev.\n\nAccording to Etherscan, the address belongs to the Ethereum Foundation and currently has an Ethereum balance of 336,271.54 ETH, worth about $528.18 million.\n\nRemarkably, Buterin has not sold all of his CULT tokens. As crypto Twitter noted, the Ethereum co-founder still owns 10 billion CULT. \u201cDidn\u2019t sell all his CULT tho. Guess he\u2019s holding 10bn as a moon-bag,\u201d one user said.\n\nCrypto Twitter Reacts To Sales From Ethereum Co-Founder\n\nThe crypto community on Twitter has been mostly disappointed by the action of Ethereum mastermind Buterin. The backdrop is that altcoins were largely illiquid cryptocurrencies, and thus the dump had a massive impact on low-value projects and the investors who own them.\n\nOthers are upset with projects sending Vitalik free tokens. Meanwhile, Buterin\u2019s motivations for selling the altcoins are unknown.\n\nOne user stated that this seems like a strange move, as Buterin is well aware that his sales will have a massive impact on prices. One theory is that his accountant warned him that these tokens would count as income on his tax return, which is why he sold the tokens to cover the costs.\n\nAnother theory is that Buterin is fully aware of the impact, as evidenced by the fact that he has done this several times before with other free altcoins. On the Lex Fridman podcast, Buterin explained once that he could put the money to better use elsewhere. In these cases, he has donated the funds, as was the case with Shiba Inu (SHIB), for example.\n\nButerin Reveals His Favorite DEX?\n\nMeanwhile, another user has pointed out that Buterin may have once again revealed his favorite DEX with the transfers. \u201cEveryone is talking about how Vitalik Buterin dumped CULT and SHIB but no one is mentioning that he did it on CoW Swap,\u201d he said, adding:\n\nReady for some real alpha? COW token is at only 7 million market cap, and this is the preferred DEX of Vitalik Buterin.\n\nAt press time, the Ethereum price resembled that of Bitcoin \u2013 moving sideways in a narrow range after dropping sharply on Thursday.\n\nFeatured image from Forbes, Chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has gone on a shitcoin selling spree, exchanging nearly $700,000 worth of tokens previously airdropped to him for Ether (ETH).\n\nAccording to Etherscan, a wallet belonging to Buterin on March 7 offloaded 500 trillion SHIKOKU (SHIK) for 380.3 ETH ($595,448), nearly 10 billion Cult DAO (CULT) for 58.1 ETH ($91,021), and 50 billion Mops (MOPS) for 1.25 ETH ($1,950).\n\nA screenshot of token transactions from Vitalik\u2019s wallet. Source: Etherscan\n\nDue to the low liquidity of the tokens the sales had a huge effect on their prices. The largest price drop from the tokens was SHIK, which recorded an 86% drop following Buterin\u2019s sale according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nThe total circulating supply of SHIK is 1 quadrillion, with the 500 trillion previously held by Buterin representing 50% of the current supply.\n\nIn May 2021 the Ethereum co-founder initiated a similar offload selling tokens such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogelon Mars (ELON) that resulted in price drops of 40% and 90% respectively.\n\nRelated: Ethereum price action and derivatives data confirm bears are currently in control\n\nWhile some within the cryptocurrency community shared their frustration at Buterin\u2019s decision to sell considering the outsized effect it had on the tokens, others suggested it was motivated by the tax implications of receiving airdrops, which are subject to income tax in most countries.\n\nSeems like a strange move, he is more than aware this would tank prices and drain liquidity. My one assumption is that his accountant warned him these tokens would count as income on his tax sheet. Selling to cover the expense \u2014 SecureZero \uea00 (@securezero) March 7, 2023\n\nButerin confirmed he owned the wallet in a 2018 tweet after he was accused of hoarding 75% of the supply of Ether with fellow Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin during the token's pre-mining sale."

        "content": "OKX Ventures invests in Scroll, a community-first zkEVM-based zkRollup which enables builders to make apps that are natively compatible with Ethereum\n\nThe investment is in line with OKX Ventures\u2019 vision of supporting Ethereum\u2019s scalability using off chain solutions with the latest technology\n\nVICTORIA, Seychelles, 14 March, 2023 - OKX Ventures, the investment arm of OKX, the second-largest crypto exchange by trading volume and a leading Web3 technology company, today announced its strategic investment in Scroll, a fully open-source, Ethereum equivalent zkEVM-based zkRollup that enables native compatibility for existing Ethereum applications and tools.\n\nThe investment is in line with OKX Ventures\u2019 vision to support projects that enhance Ethereum\u2019s scalability by using technology like zkEVM zkRollups to alleviate the transaction burden on the existing Ethereum blockchain by processing transactions off-chain, then sending the proofs back on-chain. This results in higher throughput and lower costs in comparison to the Ethereum base layer, making applications easier to use and more scalable for mass adoption.\n\nScroll has an impressive early track record of success, having just launched a permissionless Goerli Testnet last week. Its pre-alpha closed with impressive results of over 600,000 unique addresses with more than 400,000 daily transactions at the end of January.\n\nOff-chain solutions like the kind Scroll is developing are implemented separately from Ethereum\u2019s layer 1 mainnet, and this layer 2 solution requires no changes to the existing Ethereum protocol. Scroll achieves its goals by running computations off-chain and submitting a validity proof to the chain.\n\nWith this architecture, it can be used for token transfers and specialized applications. After pre-alpha and alpha testing, all existing Ethereum Dapps and smart contracts are expected to be able to migrate to it effortlessly. After more development, Scroll will implement general-purpose smart contracts.\n\nScroll Alpha, the last phase before mainnet, is now open to all and has 180,000 unique wallet addresses and over 665,000 transactions completed.\n\nOKX Ventures looks forward to seeing the mainnet launch in four months time after a period of intensive and dedicated development by the Scroll team and the wider crypto community.\n\nAbout Scroll Scroll is a community-first, fully open-source zkEVM-based zkRollup on Ethereum that enables native compatibility for existing Ethereum applications and tools.\n\nLeading the way in cutting-edge research, and building the tools for the future of decentralized applications, Scroll is committed to its vision of scaling Ethereum to a billion users.\n\nAbout OKX Ventures OKX Ventures is an investment institution under the worldwide top trading platform OKX. It focuses on exploring the best blockchain projects on a global scale, supporting the most cutting-edge blockchain technology innovation, promoting the healthy development of the global blockchain industry, and investing in long-term structural value.\n\nOKX Ventures is also committed to helping entrepreneurs who contribute to the development of the blockchain industry build great companies and bring global resources and historical experience to blockchain projects.

        "title": "Ethereum Trading Tips and Tricks: Learn to Be a Better ETH Trader - Coinfomania",
        "content": "Ethereum and its famous creator Vitalik Buterin require no introduction. This leading L2 blockchain continues to make quite a stir in the crypto industry and pushes market participants to buy ETH in volumes never seen before. Why is this happening and what to be mindful of when trading Ethereum is what we are about to cover.\n\nThis is an extremely expansive subject because Ethereum is akin to an internet of blockchains, meaning that it is not only a medium for transactions but also a platform that hosts apps and solutions for practically, everything. What\u2019s even more exciting, is that the best new thing on Ethereum is perhaps not even built yet. And this, once again, moves people to trade, hold, and stake Ethereum.\n\nEthereum and Its ever-growing Popularity\n\nLet\u2019s look at the most obvious deciding factors that move the markets in favor of ETH. Ethereum\u2019s popularity stems from its ability to enable the creation and deployment of decentralized applications (dapps) and smart contracts. The network is designed to be more flexible than other blockchains, which prompted the creation of a wide range of dApps that can be used for everything from finance and gaming to social media and identity management.\n\nThis is the primary reason why Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, Ether, has become a popular investment asset, leading to a thriving market for Ethereum trading and staking. Ethereum\u2019s decentralized and open-source nature also appeals to those who value privacy, transparency, and censorship resistance.\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nEthereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain network that has become increasingly popular in recent years. One of the main uses of Ethereum is for the creation and trading of digital assets, known as tokens or coins. These factors make Ethereum trading extremely profitable, but it requires knowledge, strategy, and patience. With this in mind, we delve into Ethereum trading tips and tricks to help you make the most out of your investments.\n\nTrading Ethereum The Right Way\n\nJust like any other cryptocurrency, it pays to know when to buy and sell Ethereum. What makes ETH different from other crypto assets, is that it boasts much lower volatility. This is explained by the largest market cap out of all L2 blockchains, and an incredibly expansive ecosystem that houses other successful projects with a large following. Here is what you have to keep watch out for when trading ETH:\n\nUnderstand Ethereum\u2019s volatility\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum\u2019s volatility is essential in managing risk and minimizing losses. Make sure you don\u2019t invest more than you can afford to lose, and set stop-loss orders to prevent your trades from becoming disastrous. The latter is, of course, a different subject on its own, so do your research before you set a stop loss that gets triggered as soon as you place it.\n\nUse a reliable crypto exchange\n\nChoosing a reliable crypto exchange is crucial in Ethereum trading. Look for an exchange with a good reputation, high liquidity, low fees, and robust security features. Make sure you read reviews and choose a platform that offers more than just crypto trading. As an example, Gate.io crypto exchange allows you to trade Ethereum, stake it, lend or borrow it, which also means that you can do everything in one single platform easily and safely. Another characteristic to look out for is Proof of Reserves. An established crypto exchange should be able to showcase that it has users\u2019 funds in full and they are not used for trading by the exchange itself.\n\nKeep up-to-date with Ethereum news\n\nStay informed about Ethereum\u2019s developments, partnerships, and any regulatory changes. This will help you anticipate price movements and make informed trading decisions. Join cryptocurrency forums and social media groups to stay up-to-date with the latest news and discussions. Reddit is a great place to start. It accommodates a very large Ethereum following, that can often hint toward the next price move.\n\nIdentify Ethereum price trends\n\nThe Ethereum market is highly speculative, but you can still identify price trends by using technical analysis tools or crypto exchanges such as Gate.io. Understanding Ethereum\u2019s price action will help you identify entry and exit points, and predict the direction of the market. You can use tools like moving averages, trend lines, and oscillators to analyze price trends. Again, these tools are just a share of what you should take into account, meaning that one cannot rely on charting only.\n\nDiversify your portfolio\n\nDiversification is a fundamental principle of trading. Investing in a variety of assets can help you spread the risk and avoid potential losses. Consider investing in other cryptocurrencies, stocks, or commodities to diversify your portfolio.\n\nHave a trading strategy\n\nHaving a trading strategy is essential in Ethereum trading. Determine your risk tolerance, define your trading goals, and set a realistic profit target. Consider using technical and fundamental analysis to identify trading opportunities and make informed decisions.\n\nDon\u2019t follow the hype\n\nCryptocurrency markets are known for hype and FOMO (fear of missing out). Avoid making decisions based on emotions and speculation. Instead, rely on analysis and facts to make trading decisions.\n\nEarn on the ETH You Hold\n\nAnother reason that explains Ethereum\u2019s popularity is staking. It is a process that involves holding and validating transactions on the Ethereum network. Ethereum staking is a way to earn passive income while helping to secure the network. Stakers are required to lock up a certain amount of Ethereum as a security deposit, and in exchange, they receive rewards in the form of new ETH. Staking can be done via a crypto exchange or by running your own node. By combining Ethereum trading and staking, you can diversify your portfolio and earn a steady stream of income.\n\nEthereum trading can be a profitable venture, but it requires knowledge, strategy, and patience. Still, with the vast influx of institutions to the crypto scene and Ethereum\u2019s succession of current developments, we feel that as a blockchain, its future is incredibly bright.\n\nYour crypto deserves the best security.

It's your choice.\u201d\n\nSoleimani provided a demonstration of how Privacy Pools is used:\n\n13/ Our demo is live - https://t.co/Nt4b2Tgx1D\n\n\n\nNow, users have the option to help regulators isolate illicit funds, without revealing their entire transaction history.\n\n\n\nLet's watch a brief video of it in action: pic.twitter.com/An9lWx6jfr \u2014 ameen.eth (@ameensol) March 4, 2023\n\nThe developer hopes the solution will empower \u201cthe community to defend against hackers abusing the anonymity sets of honest users without requiring blanket regulation or sacrificing on crypto ideals.\u201d\n\nWhile Privacy Pools is already live on Optimism, Soleimani noted that the first version of the privacy protocol is still in its \u201cexperimental\u201d stage because the code isn\u2019t complete and has not been audited, but he is \u201cpretty close to having this ready.\u201d\n\nTo see the protocol progress further, Soleimani wants on-chain forensics platforms like Chainlaysis and TRM Labs to conduct tracebacks on deposits so that users of the privacy tool don\u2019t have to manually create their own subset exclusion lists.\n\nIn making the case for on-chain privacy protocols, Soleimani cited what he described as an \u201cexcellent\u201d report by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis in Missouri that examined the trade-offs between on-chain privacy and regulation:\n\n\u201cTheir report proposes to achieve effective regulation by having Tornado Cash users provide receipts to an intermediary, thus revealing their entire transaction history to the intermediary, but still being able to have privacy with respect to other public blockchain users.\u201d\n\nThe developer hopes this can help \u201cstart a conversation\u201d with U.S. regulators on how on-chain privacy can be preserved whilst restricting criminal activity through the use of ZK proofs.\n\nRelated: On-chain privacy is key to the wider mass adoption of crypto\n\nSoleimani\u2019s attempt to create a crypto-friendly on-chain privacy solution comes after the U.S. Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) sanctioned ETH and USDC addresses linked to Tornado Cash on Aug. 8 in response to several alleged thefts by North Korea\u2019s Lazarus Group, who were claimed to have routinely used the privacy mixer to preserve its anonymity.\n\nPhotograph of a #FreeAlex protest. Source: Twitter/ameensol\n\nShortly after the sanction on Aug. 10, Alexey Pertsev, the creator of Tornado Cash, was arrested by authorities in the Netherlands and is currently facing a series of money laundering charges. He remains behind bars and his next hearing will take place in late April."

        "title": "Why Sending 'Free' Coins to Vitalik Buterin May Soon Be Illegal - DailyCoin",
        "content": "ETH founder Vitalik Buterin receives s *** coins daily. Few are worth anything.\n\n*** Projects send out free tokens for marketing purposes or to raise their profile.\n\nUnwanted airdrops may violate securities regulations if they benefit the distributor.\n\nCrypto users have to deal with an incessant amount of spam. As a major name in the industry, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin receives numerous unsolicited token drops daily. Few are worth anything.\n\nOn Monday, Buterin decided to get rid of some of his unwanted tokens. According to data from Etherscan, he sold nearly $700,000 worth of SHIK, CULT, and MOPS tokens.\n\nProjects like Shikoku Inu (SHIK), which gifted Vitalik 50% of the token supply, send unsolicited tokens for several reasons. For one, it helps with marketing. Airdroping to famous people helps raise the profile of a token. Crypto projects that don\u2019t have a lot going for them can claim association with a big name in the industry.\n\nThis strategy is not without its risks. SHIK token dropped 86% after Vitalik dumped all his holdings. However, that risk doesn\u2019t deter most s***coin projects from sending worthless tokens.\n\nOn Tuesday, Buterin\u2019s wallet received 500,000,000 \u201cVitalik Jeeterin,\u201d 4,200,000,000,000 \u201cJeetalik Buter Inu,\u201d and 99,000,000,000,000 \u201cVitalik Dont Sell\u201d tokens. According to Etherscan, these tokens are worth exactly $0.\n\nWill the SEC Crack Down on Airdrops?\n\nWhat could potentially deter s***coin airdrops in the future is tougher securities regulation. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is going after securities offering in crypto. Airdrops are not safe from the SEC crackdown.\n\nAlthough technically free, an airdrop could still violate securities regulations, according to Nirav Gala, CFA at Vivriti Asset Management.\n\n\u201cAs has been held in the case of SEC v. Sierra Brokerage Servs., Inc, as long as the issuer receives some real benefit by disposing of securities, it is considered a sale of securities,\u201d Gala said.\n\nA \u201creal benefit\u201d could be anything from marketing and promotion, getting referrals, increasing traffic to their website, and so on. With a definition so broad, any form of an airdrop could fit the SEC\u2019s definition.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is,\u201d Gala said,\u201d no matter how you structure an airdrop, it will always result in a direct or indirect benefit for the issuer, and thus would be considered a sale of securities by the SEC,\u201d Gala concluded.\n\nIt is unclear how the SEC will enforce a ban on airdrops. In the meantime, crypto users can simply hide unwanted tokens in their wallet interfaces.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nButerin still holds 10,000,000,420 CULT tokens, worth $89,000, according to his wallet data. It\u2019s unclear why the Ethereum founder held on to that amount other than to reference the \u201c420\u201d meme.\n\nThe SEC has been cracking down on segments of the crypto industry ever since the FTX crash.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nToken spam is mostly a nuisance but can also be a serious problem. Scammers will sometimes use spam tokens to steal a person\u2019s wallet information. It\u2019s always best not to interact with these tokens.\n\nRead more about Vitalik\u2019s views on crypto:\n\nEthereum Founder Vitalik Buterin Bashes Governance Token Speculation, Calls it \u201cPathological\u201d\n\nRead more about the SEC crackdown on exchanges:\n\nBinance Leaks Spell Trouble with SEC, \u2018Nuclear Fallout\u2019"

        "content": "RenQ Finance (RENQ), Ethereum (ETH), and Avalanche (AVAX) are ready for a massive stride forward.\n\nDisclaimer: The text below is an advertorial article that is not part of Cryptonews.com editorial content.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is experiencing a bullish trend as many cryptocurrencies are making significant strides. RenQ Finance (RENQ), Ethereum (ETH), and Avalanche (AVAX) are three cryptocurrencies that investors should watch out for as they are set to make a massive stride forward.\n\nRenQ Finance (RENQ) \u2013 An Innovative Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Platform\n\nRenQ Finance (RENQ) is a new and innovative decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that provides solutions to the challenges facing the blockchain industry. RenQ Finance\u2019s mission is to connect isolated blockchain networks and establish a cross-chain exchange network that makes all of these networks relevant and useful via the RenQ platform.

        "content": "Tezos has a different way to upgrade its blockchain. The software automatically updates the chain. Holders of the XTZ token can vote on changes, and once agreed upon, the chain updates itself. This should avoid a fork \u2013 in other words, two chains with two different currencies.\n\n\n\nMany crypto users like to transfer assets from one protocol to another, which is called bridging. Tezos has a couple of bridges that have proven popular for users. Let\u2019s dig in.\n\nAllbridge\n\nAllbridge can bridge digital assets between 18 chains. This includes, of course, Tezos. But also, for example, Avalanche, BNB, Ethereum, Fantom, Near, Polygon, and Solana. So, as you may have noticed, it connects EVM and non-EVM chains. This will include various L2 chains and NFTs as well in the future. Here\u2019s a list of the chains and tokens it supports.\n\nFor Tezos, Allbridge uses Quipuswap, a DEX on Tezos. The easiest asset to transfer is the Allbridge ABR token. On Quipuswap, you can swap this token. It\u2019s the native token to Allbridge, but it\u2019s wrapped on Tezos. Allbridge has an easy-to-understand guide on how to use the bridge. Madfish is the company behind Quipuswap. They made this bridging option possible. For example, they also offer the Temple wallet and other open-source DeFi products.\n\nAs with all bridges, you can now move digital assets around. It saves you having to go through a CEX. Using a CEX can result in extra costs and time.\n\nFrom Polygon, you can bridge USDC. From the BNB chain, it\u2019s BUSD. For all the other blockchains, it\u2019s ABR. However, more tokens are in the pipeline. For instance, BTC, AVAX, SOL, ETH, and NEAR. With Allbridge, you gain access to the Tezos DeFi ecosystem. The picture below shows the Allbridge UI.\n\nSource: Allbridge\n\nPlenty Bridge\n\nPlenty Bridge bridges Ethereum, Polygon, and Ethereum-based tokens to Tezos. Be aware, though, this bridge is still in Beta. This is a rebranded version of the WRAP bridge. Here\u2019s an article we wrote about this bridge. However, now you can bridge tokens in around five minutes. For example:\n\nUSDC\n\nDAI\n\nUSDT\n\nwBTC\n\nwETH\n\nLink\n\nMATIC\n\nAvalanche and BSC bridges are in the pipeline for Plenty Bridge. This bridge is part of the Plenty DEX on Tezos. Here you can swap, pool, farm, and, of course, bridge.\n\nBy using the bridge, you receive bridge tokens. These represent ERC20 tokens on Tezos with a peg to their original token. This is the brainchild of Tezsure, the company behind Plenty.\n\nWhen using the Plenty Bridge, you need to connect to a Tezos and an Ethereum-compatible wallet. On the Tezos side, there are various wallets available. They suit browsers, desktop, or mobile options. On the Ethereum side, it\u2019s any EVM-compatible wallet, like MetaMask or Rabby.\n\nTo make sure that the wrapped ERC20 tokens peg to their original token, Plenty uses a \u201cSigners Quorum.\u201d There are currently seven well-trusted Tezos community members. The members of the Signers Quorum share all bridging fees between them.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe looked into bridging assets between Tezos and other blockchains. Currently, there are two bridges available. Allbridge connects EVM and non-EVM chains. On the other hand, there\u2019s the Plenty Bridge, a rebranding of the WRAP bridge. This bridge connects Ethereum and Polygon to Tezos.\n\nThe current XTZ price is $1.13 with. It has a $1 billion market cap. There\u2019s an infinite total supply, and 921.7 million XTZ tokens circulate.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f For more cryptocurrency news, check out the Altcoin Buzz YouTube channel.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f Our popular Altcoin Buzz Access group generates tons of alpha for our subscribers.

        "title": "Observers Assess Coinbase's Base as A Bold Bet on Ethereum and L2 Infrastructure - Securities.io",
        "content": "Last month, Coinbase announced the launch of its Ethereum layer two network Base in collaboration with Optimism. The platform's launch in the last full week of February aligned with the company's master plan to onboard a billion people into crypto, in this case, by aiming to slash the transaction fees on the Ethereum network to one cent and eventually integrating with other networks such as Avalanche and Solana. America's largest exchange choice to build on Ethereum was an endorsement of the chain and a move expected to stimulate innovation in DeFi and NFTs and attract more institutional investors to the space. The Base offering notably pulled the exchange into a layer-two race that has already been heated for a while now.\n\nThe latest on Coinbase's L2 blockchain\n\nCoinbase described Base as a secure, low-cost, developer-friendly platform for builders to create applications. Leveraging the modular, open-source OP Stack, Base would work with other layer two networks and layer ones like Solana. Following the testnet release, decentralization advocate Chris Blec published a blog post about the new blockchain. Blec explained that in the current dispensation, layer two infrastructure is highly centralized as it uses sequencers to aggregate and batch transactions.\n\nIn the case of Base, Coinbase, as the sole sequencer, will be responsible for aggregating and publishing transactions to the Ethereum layer one. Blec suggested that Base would be obligated to abide by the same demands since the crypto exchange has to comply with certain legal requirements, such as the Bank Secrecy Act. He further pointed out that Base might implement know-your-customer (KYC) requirements and AML, becoming the first layer two platforms to do so and contravening the very essence of decentralization.\n\nTo learn more about Optimism, check out our Investing in Optimism guide.\n\nBase integrates Chainlink\n\nChainlink, which saw its price feeds integrated into the Base testnet and onboarded the layer two platform into the scale program last week, has recently seen some of the largest transactions in the last three months. Market intelligence platform Santiment pointed out that a Chainlink whale moved as much as $79.7 million in a series of transactions late last Friday.\n\nThe on-chain analytics firm observed that in the late hours of Friday, there were three massive whale transactions to the tune of 11.6 million LINK, all completed within 11 minutes. Notably, Lookonchain also noted these transactions, explaining that the same addresses had sent 17.5 million LINK ($124 million) to Binance in August last year and a further 14.55 million LINK ($90 million) in November. Explorer tool Etherscan shows the whale's most recent token transfers came from three distinct non-circulating supply addresses and ended up in Binance, where the LINK could be sold in the open market.\n\nTo learn more about Chainlink, check out our Investing in Chainlink guide.\n\nCEO Brian Armstrong says Base will likely monitor transactions\n\nSpeaking with Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong on Bloomberg Radio recently, Odd Lots podcast host Joe Weisenthal queried what role the crypto exchange would play in terms of compliance as a regulated entity running Base. Armstrong acknowledged that presently, certain components of Base are centralized, but the layer two network would adopt decentralization over time. The exchange executive added that Base would likely feature transaction monitoring and AML requirements for users as part of the responsibility of centralized actors.\n\nArmstrong's statement could have been clearer, as it did not elucidate whether he meant it to refer specifically to centralized actors operating on Base or to all centralized actors. When it first announced Base, Coinbase said that its layer two solution would become progressively decentralized, but that did not mean disregarding regulatory compliance. Moreover, Coinbase said that though Base would be accessible to all developers at launch, it would be a home for Coinbase's on-chain products, meaning any current products that Coinbase incorporates with Base will likely uphold their existing KYC/AML procedures.\n\nEclipse launches Polygon SVM for seamless Solana developer migration\n\nIn related news last week, Polygon Ventures' portfolio company Eclipse announced Polygon SVM, a blockchain compatible with the Solana ecosystem. The news generated excitement in the Solana community, as the upcoming chain will allow Solana developers to easily move their apps to Polygon without rebuilding their code for Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility.\n\nSolana's interoperability with Polygon, outside of the EVM\n\nPolygon SVM leverages optimistic roll-up technology to generate blocks, allowing Rust developers to port their code from Solana to Eclipse and deploy it on the Polygon network. Speaking to The Block, Eclipse founder Neel Somani observed that currently, Solana developers are constrained by the fact that they have to rewrite all smart contract code if they would like to migrate to Polygon. Somani also noted that the introduction of Polygon SVM presents an opportunity for collaboration in areas such as gaming, which have garnered significant interest from the Polygon and Solana communities.\n\nBy running smart contracts and tooling compatible with Solana, Polygon SVM would ultimately proliferate throughput speed and interoperability for sects, including gaming and DeFi in crypto. Decentralized applications (dApps) built for Solana can also migrate or become multi-chain via the SVM, allowing developers from the two communities to exist and grow on different blockchains. Eclipse views the recent launch only as the beginning for scaling and checks out for the rollup-centric future school of thought in helping make base layer ones faster and cheaper. The Solana Foundation grant recipient plans a testnet launch for Polygon SVM in Q1 before a mainnet launch can be scheduled for Q2 this year.\n\nTo learn more, check out our Polygon vs. Solana guide."

        "title": "Like a Blur: Tensor Plans Massive Airdrop for Solana NFT Traders - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Tensor, previously a relatively small contender in the Solana NFT marketplace wars, is quickly capturing market share after taking a page from the playbook of leading Ethereum platform Blur\u2014by targeting \u201cpro\u201d traders and providing \u201cloyalty\u201d rewards for using its marketplace.\n\nThe platform launched its \u201cSeason 1 airdrop\u201d on Monday, letting Solana NFT collectors claim free reward boxes given out in proportion to their trading activity on the blockchain network. Anyone who bought or sold a Solana NFT on any marketplace over the past six months is eligible, and those who did so on Tensor will receive \u201c25x-50x more rewards,\u201d per a tweet.\n\nIt\u2019s extremely close in design, execution, and aesthetic to the model pioneered by Blur, an upstart Ethereum NFT marketplace that debuted last October. In February, Blur rocketed to the top of the charts in terms of Ethereum NFT trading volume as users flipped NFTs en masse to maximize their BLUR airdrop rewards.\n\nHow Much Wash Trading Is Really Happening on Blur?\n\nTensor\u2019s Solana NFT trading volume surged to a new single-day high on Monday, according to public blockchain data collected by analytics platform Dune, reaching 23,351 SOL\u2014about $486,000 worth based on the value of Solana by the end of the day, according to CoinGecko. The platform saw nearly 2,800 NFT trades during that span.\n\nAccording to market-wide data collected by Tiexo, Tensor has facilitated about 19% of all Solana NFT trading volume over the past 24 hours, compared to 60% for market leader Magic Eden. That\u2019s a notable spike, given that Tensor has only accounted for about 6% of Solana NFT trading volume over the past 30 days.\n\nToday, following the surge in trading activity and attention prompted by the airdrop, Tensor announced that it has raised a $3 million seed round led by VC firm Placeholder, with participation from Solana co-founders Anatoly Yakovenko and Raj Gokal along with Solana Ventures, Big Brain Holdings, and MonkeVentures. Notable pseudonymous trader HGE, who also founded rival trading platform Hadeswap, joined as well.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn a Twitter thread, the Tensor team said that it began raising seed funding in November as cryptocurrency exchange FTX\u2014which was closely linked to the Solana ecosystem\u2014started to collapse. The startup said that it struggled with convincing some prospective investors, but it ultimately found interested backers within the space.\n\n\u201cEvery VC started the conversation by asking us when we're leaving Solana,\u201d Tensor wrote. \u201cWe told them we're not, and they proceeded to promptly hang up on us.\u201d\n\nBoth Blur and Tensor use marketplace models designed to provide increased liquidity for traders, making it easy to buy and sell NFTs. Tensor uses automated market maker (AMM) trading pools akin to Sudoswap on Ethereum, while Blur's bidding pools facilitate bulk trades and quick flips. Both offer detailed \u201cpro\u201d interface with additional tools for traders.\n\nMuch as Blur promised traders airdrop \u201ccare packages\u201d with mysterious rewards inside, Tensor is providing traders reward \u201cboxes\u201d that they can claim. Blur ultimately launched its own token for those traders to claim. So far, Tensor has said that the boxes contain \u201cfun things you might like\u201d and suggested that the descriptions hold clues for traders.\n\n\u201cTensor believes in a decentralized Web3 future with the most important protocols owned by the community,\u201d it tweeted. \u201cYOU are the reason Tensor is great and if we ever build anything important, we want YOU to own a piece of it.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Tensor announced the launch of a larger second season airdrop that will only reward trading activity on its own platform, rather than the broader Solana NFT market. Traders will receive rewards based on bidding on or listing NFTs, as well as providing liquidity to pools, with a \u201cloyalty\u201d metric and upcoming points leaderboard gamifying the trading process.\n\nEditor's note: This article was updated after publication to clarify the Blur and Tensor marketplace models."

        "content": "Bridging ADA Cardano\u2019s native token isn\u2019t a hard task. The easiest way to bridge to Cardano would be using a platform that supports Cardano (ADA) and a wide range of other blockchains. What makes bridging ADA fascinating is that Cardano is one of the world\u2019s leading blockchains for enterprise-grade applications.\n\nSo, bridging ADA grants the user access to the benefits offered from Cardano\u2019s scalability, advanced security, and governance features. Furthermore, you\u2019ll also have access to DeFi services and protocols that are only available on Cardano.\n\nWhen we talk about bridging, we mean transferring assets from one protocol to another. Some crypto assets function on one chain based on their design. But, crypto bridges pave the way to move liquidity across chains when needed. Thanks to bridges, platforms like Cardano and Ethereum, which do not see eye to eye, can share assets. Making the most of each market sector requires bridging assets from one chain to another.\n\nWhat Is ADA?\n\nAs mentioned above, ADA is Cardano\u2019s in-house token, and it is located on the Cardano Settlement Layer. ADA has a maximum supply of 45 billion tokens, and these tokens will be minted and distributed over time.\n\nLike other well-known cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), ADA can be kept in cryptocurrency wallets and exchanged for fiat money like the U.S. dollar. Third-party wallet services can store and transfer ADA in addition to native wallet options like Daedalus and Yoroi.\n\nADA and Cardano have an active development and investor community behind them. Interestingly, enthusiasts have gradually begun taking ADA as payment as the cryptocurrency keeps growing in value.\n\nNow, let\u2019s look at some bridges for ADA.\n\nMicrochain\n\nMicrochain provides a more secure cross-chain bridge that is based on Cardano. It provides fully centralized and decentralized cross-chain services, enabling multi-chain and multi-layer functionality. Presently, Microchain offers seamless cross-chain interaction between Milkomeda, Cardano, Ethereum, and Bitcoin. It, however, plans to extend its reach in the coming months.\n\nYou can use Microchain to easily bridge your ADA.\n\nMicrochain which is built on Cardano is out to empower multi-chain & multi-layer with complete centralized and decentralized cross-chain services. Microchain is also bringing mainstream crypto assets into Cardano,which would add tons of value into the Cardano ecosystem. \u2014 Veraaa \u272a (@verah_tee) June 15, 2022\n\nMilkomeda\n\nMilkomeda aims to provide non-EVM blockchains access to EVM features and currently supports the Cardano network. The Milkomeda protocol provides Cardano access to the power of the Ethereum Virtual Machine. It connects the Cardano blockchain with Ethereum, giving you access to the best features of both blockchains, much like a portal between two galaxies. Milkomeda is an EVM-compatible side chain bridged to Ethereum. So users have access to existing smart contracts and DeFi services on Ethereum.\n\n9/n This month we're proud to say that we've successfully unwrapped tokens using only @FlintWallet , allowing users to bridge their Milkomeda assets back to Cardano! We are actively working on Milkomeda DApp Support to make it possible to use EVM Dapps directly from Flint. \u2014 dcSpark (@dcspark_io) March 6, 2023\n\nWe have previously covered how to move tokens between Cardano and Milomeda.\n\nWhere Do You Buy Cardano?\n\nYou can buy ADA on a cryptocurrency exchange like Coinbase or Binance to convert fiat into cryptocurrency. Before selecting an exchange, it is best to be familiar with the costs and accepted payment options.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve decided on the exchange to use and how much ADA you want to buy, the next step is to choose a saving mechanism, such as hot or cold wallets, to keep your cryptocurrency holdings.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f For more cryptocurrency news, check out the Altcoin Buzz YouTube channel.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f Check out our most up-to-date research, NFT and Metaverse buy, and how to protect your portfolio in this market by checking out our Altcoin Buzz Access group, which for a limited time, is FREE.

        "title": "Balancing Established and New Cryptos: Ethereum, Cardano, and The Incredible Potential of SignUp Token - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA), two of the major cryptocurrencies, have been around for a long time and have survived market ups and downs. Yet newer cryptocurrencies, like SignUp Token, provide excellent investment potential. In this article, we\u2019ll look at Ethereum, Cardano, and the brand-new SignUp Token. We\u2019ll have a look at their historical performance, and why it might be a smart idea to mix existing cryptocurrencies with emerging ones in your portfolio.\n\nEthereum \u2013 The Smart Contract Leader\n\nBy market capitalisation, Ethereum (ETH) is the second-largest cryptocurrency behind Bitcoin. By utilising smart contracts, its blockchain technology enables the creation of decentralised apps. Smart contracts are self-executing computer programmes that automatically uphold an agreement\u2019s terms and conditions. Due to this technology, decentralised finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and many more new, creative uses for cryptocurrencies are now possible.\n\nWith price collapses and bear markets, Ethereum has had its fair share of market turbulence. It has, nevertheless, always recovered, demonstrating its tenacity and solid foundation. Investors love this resilience due to Ethereum\u2019s utility and are why this cryptocurrency is so popular. Ethereum has become a significant participant in the cryptocurrency market as a result of the expansion of decentralised apps and the rising use of DeFi platforms. Its core technology has cleared the way for developers to create and release dApps.\n\nCardano \u2013 A Promising Investment\n\nBeing introduced in 2017, Cardano (ADA) is a cryptocurrency that is still relatively fresh. Since then, it has grown to be among the top 10 cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalisation. Cardano employs blockchain technology to power decentralised apps in a similar way to Ethereum.\n\nCardano\u2019s strategy, however, varies from Ethereum\u2019s in several respects. Cardano is created with an emphasis on scalability, sustainability, and interoperability and is constructed utilising a more rigorous scientific methodology. The technology behind Cardano is intended to be more energy-efficient and to support a larger variety of applications, including identity verification, DeFi, and smart contracts.\n\nCardano has demonstrated potential growth and resiliency despite being a new cryptocurrency, particularly during the bear markets. It has succeeded in drawing a burgeoning community of fans and creators, making it a popular long-term investment.\n\nSignUp Token \u2013 Sign Up to Profit BIG\n\nSignUp Token is a brand-new cryptocurrency with a unique concept. Unlike typical tokens that are distributed through an ICO or a presale, the SignUp Token is not a token in and of itself. People sign up using their email address, which is then thoroughly verified to prevent automated signups.\n\nBefore 1 million emails have been registered using SignUp Token, no presale will be offered for the token. The token address and launch time will be included in an email sent to users, giving them the option to purchase the tokens in advance at no extra cost. This serves as the incentive to sign up.\n\nSignUp is a fun project that aims to build a community that can create generational wealth together! Make sure to get involved to become a part of this!\n\nA Portfolio Perfectly Balanced, As All Things Should Be\n\nTo balance risk and reward, investing in both established and emerging cryptocurrencies might be a wise move. Existing cryptocurrencies with a track record of stability and development, like Ethereum and Cardano, make for a relatively secure investment choice.\n\nOn the other hand, thanks to their novel ideas and early-stage investments, emerging cryptocurrencies like SignUp Token have the potential for enormous returns. Diversifying your portfolio is essential for reducing risk and maximising possible profits.\n\nThe cryptocurrency industry is continually changing, with fresh, cutting-edge ideas and new coins appearing daily. From their inception, Ethereum and Cardano have demonstrated their tenacity and solid foundations.\n\nA unique investment opportunity is offered by emerging cryptocurrencies like SignUp Token, giving early adopters the chance to make enormous gains. Combining known and emerging cryptocurrencies can be a profitable investment strategy, but to reduce risk, investors should always do extensive research and diversify their holdings.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Flashbots Wants To Raise $50 Million, But Investors Must Pitch - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Flashbots is seeking to raise $50 million with a $1 billion pre-money valuation, according to The Block, citing sources aware of the deal.\n\nPitch To Flashbots For A Chance to Invest\n\nAs they look to crowdfund, it has been revealed that Flashbots is doing a \u201creverse pitching\u201d where interested investors have to pitch, not the other way around. In this arrangement, investors confident of Flashbots\u2019 prospects must explain, in detail, why they should have a slot in this investment round.\n\nEventually, the goal is to raise between $30 million and $50 million in \u201cequity investment,\u201d pushing the firm\u2019s valuation to unicorn status. Flashbot plans to split this investment round into two.\n\nAlthough Paradigm didn\u2019t respond publicly to the publication\u2019s request for comment or comment on the inquiry, details reveal that the crypto fund was among the first to show interest. They participated in Flashbots\u2019 seed sale in 2020. However, Flashbots didn\u2019t indicate the amount raised in the seed sale.\n\nFlashbots is a research and development organization claiming to negate the effects of maximum extraction value (MEV) in account-based blockchains like Ethereum and the BNB Smart Chain (BSC).\n\nSpecifically, Flashbots focuses on Ethereum, where the costs of MEV can be high considering the high on-chain activity and the impact of gas fees, which is also relatively high versus other more scalable networks, including BSC. Their involvement, Flashbots\u2019s documents explain, avoids the \u201cexistential risks MEV could cause to state-rich blockchains like Ethereum.\u201d\n\nTackling MEV\n\nMEV in blockchains is the maximum value that can be extracted from block production after validators, tasked with confirming transactions and securing the network, include or even re-order transactions in a block.\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, where transaction order is given, in Ethereum and similar networks, ordering is haphazard. It means profit-seeking validators can prioritize transactions tagged with higher fees.\n\nThis explains why whenever the MEV in a block is higher than the network block reward, a validator can decide to re-order transactions in a block, creating vectors for possible centralization and exploitation.\n\nRelated Reading: ViaBTC Capital | Reasons Behind Solana\u2019s Frequent Downtime: Design Flaws in the Gas Economy\n\nFlashbots curbs this problem using MEV Boost. It is software allowing builders to auction blocks to validators, averting MEV centralization. Each party earns a fee for their contribution.\n\nFlashbots\u2019s recent open source tool, Single Unifying Auctions for Value Expression (SUAVE), further decentralizes and avails, to everyone, including competitors, the MEV Boost.\n\nThe reason for open-sourcing SUAVE is novel and meant to help the entire ecosystem grow stronger by proper decentralization.\n\nIn Devcon Bogota, Philip Daian of Flashbots said:\n\n\u201cSo, we\u2019re going to use MEV as this decentralized engine in the long term to make sure the users get the best execution on their trades in a way that will make TradFi look embarrassing very shortly.\u201d\n\nFeature Image by The Block, Chart from Trading View\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Is Crypto Mining Still Profitable in 2023? Know All About It Here - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency mining is still profitable in 2023, but it may not be as rewarding as in the past.\n\nCryptocurrency mining is still profitable in 2023, but it may not be as rewarding as in the past. That\u2019s accurate for a variety of factors, including the fact that cryptocurrency prices were significantly lower than their peaks for the majority of 2022 and into early 2023.\n\nThe majority of cryptocurrencies still have value, but estimating miner profitability can be a little trickier now that mining machinery requires expensive computer gear and software as well as electricity to operate.\n\nBitcoin, which employs a proof-of-work consensus method and is the biggest and earliest cryptocurrency, is one of the primary sources of cryptocurrency mining. Understanding how crypto mining functions and the benefits and drawbacks is crucial before choosing whether mining for Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies is worthwhile.\n\nBitcoin Mining Pools:\n\nThe majority of Bitcoin miners today use what is known as a mining group, as previously stated, due to the high cost and increasing challenge of mining Bitcoin. Today, many believe that joining mining groups is the only way for smaller miners to make any money, and even then, it can be challenging to recover the costs of energy and equipment.\n\nOwners of mining pools frequently charge mining costs to run and use the pool. There are a variety of groups to pick from, each with a unique framework. Additionally, there are Bitcoin cloud mining possibilities available, allowing miners to use processing resources remotely. This method of mining involves hiring other people\u2019s machinery, which is more expensive.\n\nConsiderations to Make When Selecting a mining pool:\n\nA small miner must locate an appropriate mining pool after getting the Bitcoin mining hardware and energy needed for mining.\n\nFees: Most Bitcoin processing groups, but not all, levie fees. The costs, which can be as high as 4%, are deducted from the reward payment.\n\nPool size: Since more hashing power means more blocks being discovered, the possible payout increases with pool size. Because awards are distributed among more recipients, the payments are, however, also smaller. On the other hand, bigger payouts occur less frequently in smaller groups.\n\nSecurity and Reliability: A mining group that miners can rely on that won\u2019t take users\u2019 money or get hacked may be what they\u2019re looking for. Joining pools with a lengthy history could help to lower these dangers.\n\nRequired equipment investment: You\u2019ll also need to supply the pool with electricity. And mining costs more and more money. When Bitcoin was first developed, the computer computing power needed for Bitcoin mining could be handled by a typical notebook computer\u2019s CPU. But the computations have gotten trickier over time. Currently, mining is primarily only possible with sophisticated ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) devices that were made especially for mining Bitcoin.\n\nIs Cryptocurrency Mining in 2023:\n\nThe second-largest participant in the cryptocurrency market is Ethereum. Unfortunately, mining on the Ethereum network is no longer feasible.\n\nThis is due to the implementation of \u201cEthereum 2.0,\u201d which altered Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-work consensus method to proof-of-stake. As a result, mining is no longer used by the network. The only people who will be able to invest their tokens and become \u201cvalidators\u201d are those who possess significant amounts of ETH. The possibilities of receiving the upcoming block rewards are distributed among validators, with those who have pledged the most ETH having the best chances.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

STG\u2019s price went down by more than 9% following Coinbase\u2019s announcement. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that the token went from its daily high of $0.782 to $0.715 at the time of writing.\n\nCoinbase will not support Stargate Finance V2 airdrop\n\nAccording to a Twitter thread from Coinbase, STG will be delisted from the platform on 14 March 2023, on or before 12 pm EST. The delisting comes ahead of the token\u2019s migration to V2, which is slated for 15 March. Stargate Finance will issue STG V2 with a new contact address. As per Stargate Finance\u2019s governance forum, STG V2 will be airdropped to STG holders based on a wallet snapshot that will be taken on the day of the migration.\n\nHowever, Coinbase stated that it will not support any airdrops of Stargate Finance (V1 or V2). The crypto exchange assured users that STG funds will remain accessible and withdrawable at any time. Furthermore, the STG/USD order book has been moved to a limit-only mode.\n\nSTG funds held in a Coinbase.com, Pro, Exchange, or Custody account before, at, or after the planned snapshot will not entitle you to receive any Stargate Finance V2 via potential airdrops.\u201d Coinbase on Twitter\n\nSTG\u2019s massive price drop barely a month after it saw double-digit gains following its partnership with Trader Joe. The partnership with the Avalanche-based DeFi exchange led to a 13% hike in the token\u2019s price last month."

Bitcoin is currently trading between $22,230 and $22,247. If it falls below this range, the next level of support can be found at $19,000. Ethereum is also experiencing a similar trend following Bitcoin's lead. Currently valued at $1,555, the next level of ETH support is $1,450. Traders and investors may need some time to process Powell's hawkish comments and the uncertainties surrounding Silvergate Bank.\u201d\n\nKunji founder Anurag Dixit offered his take, \u201cBitcoin edged above $22,000 again after Fed Chair Powell's comments caused concern among investors and led to a selloff in traditional markets. However, Bitcoin showed resilience. The crypto industry is facing fierce challenges in the short term and macro uncertainty fueling it slightly from time to time. But cryptocurrencies have also shown noticeable decoupling for some medium time frame.\"\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

        "content": "For some time now, the value trend of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) has been very similar.\n\nFocus on the value trend of Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nSince November last year, the two trends have been proceeding almost in unison.\n\nAnalysis of Bitcoin (BTC)\n\nThe market value trend of Bitcoin (BTC) in recent days is rather flat and monotonous.\n\nIn fact, it has been doing nothing but lateralizing within a very compressed range between $22,200 and $22,500 now since Friday 3 March, with only a few brief excursions just above or just below.\n\nIt is as if after the sudden drop from $23,400 to $22,400 last Friday the price has stabilized.\n\nIn fact, that drop was only the latest in a series that began on 21 February, after failing for the fourth time to break the $25,000 mark.\n\nSomething similar had already happened in early February to Bitcoin, after it failed its fourth attempt to break above $24,000 on Thursday 2 March.\n\nThen between late January and early February it tried four times to move steadily above $24,000 without succeeding, at which point it began to fall, stopping eight days later around $21,600.\n\nThereafter, it later lateralized around that figure for four days, only to suddenly break down that wall and head straight for $25,000 on 15 February.\n\nAt that point, it seems to have begun a phase similar to the one that just ended, but at levels $1,000 higher.\n\nIn fact, it tried four times to break above $25,000, only to start falling on 21 February.\n\nThe descent lasted ten days, instead of the eight days of the previous medium-short-term cycle, and it has now been sideways in the very narrow range of $22,200 to $22,500 for four days.\n\nShould it manage to return above $24,000 within a couple of days, or even break through the $25,000 wall, the medium-short-term cycle would have replicated itself in almost the same way.\n\nIt is worth noting that $25,000 seems a much more difficult resistance to break through than $24,000.\n\nAnalysis of Ethereum (ETH)\n\nThe trend in the market value of Ethereum (ETH) has been very similar, although at different levels.\n\nIt was again on Friday 3 March that the price of ETH fell to $1,560, and since then it has continued to lateralize within a very compressed range between $1,560 and $1,580.\n\nThis trend seems identical to that of Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nPreviously, while Bitcoin tried unsuccessfully four times to move steadily above $25,000, Ethereum tried unsuccessfully to move above $1,700, although for three days, from 17 to 19 February included, it seemed to have succeeded.\n\nThe decline began on 21 February, at the same time as Bitcoin\u2019s.\n\nIn contrast, between late January and early February, when Bitcoin was trying four times to exceed $24,000, Ethereum\u2019s price had remained almost consistently above $1,600.\n\nFrom this difference it seems to emerge that at this stage Ethereum\u2019s price trend is influenced by Bitcoin\u2019s, and not vice versa.\n\nIt is worth noting that another difference concerns percentage movements.\n\nFor example, after the four failed attempts to get back above $24,000, BTC then lost 11% in eight days, while ETH lost 13% in five days.\n\nAnd after the failure of the fourth attempt to get above $25,000, BTC lost 11% again, while ETH lost 9%, this time both in ten days.\n\nThe comparison between Bitcoin and Ethereum: value trend, regulation and market\n\nThus what seems to be dragging the trend of Ethereum\u2019s market value during this period is the trend of Bitcoin\u2019s market value, with small differences that make it clear how the two trends actually move independently, but with the latter heavily influencing the former.\n\nExtending the comparison to the whole of 2023 shows that Bitcoin since late 2022 has gained 34%, while ETH has gained 30%. And extending it to November 2021, when all-time highs were touched, BTC loses 67% while ETH 68%.\n\nThus, there are more differences in this early 2023 in favor of Bitcoin than there have been since the highs were touched.\n\nSpecifically, in the past 30 days, Bitcoin\u2019s price has lost 3.5% while Ethereum\u2019s has lost 5%.\n\nIt is possible that this difference is affected by the words of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler recently, whereby he suggests that only Bitcoin is a commodity, while Ethereum, like other cryptocurrencies, should actually be considered securities."

        "title": "Gasless Layer 1 Blockchains: Can They Beat Their Gas-Paying Competitors? - Crypto News Flash",
        "content": "As blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies continue to garner widespread popularity and adoption, the persistent fluctuation and spike of gas fees on layer 1 blockchains like Ethereum have become worrisome to developers and users.\n\nHowever, with numerous existing blockchain projects, the terms \u201cLayer 1\u201d and \u201cgas fees\u201d can be confusing if you lack some background knowledge or context. So, in this piece, we discuss Layer 1 blockchains and their gas fees.\n\nWhat is a Layer 1 Blockchain?\n\nLayer 1 blockchains or base layer chains or mainnets are standalone blockchain protocols. That is, they are not built on any other blockchain network and provide the foundational layer for a blockchain ecosystem. Therefore they are responsible for managing the blockchain\u2019s basic functions like consensus, mining, and transaction processing.\n\nThese blockchains are decentralized, secure, and immutable and often feature a native token that rewards validators or miners that maintain the ecosystem. Layer 1 blockchains also support smart contracts, DeFi, and dApps, while providing a secure and transparent approach to storing and exchanging data. Examples include Ethereum, Cardano, Avalanche, Solana, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), etc.\n\nHowever, transactions on these blockchains often incur gas fees, which have become a hot topic in the blockchain space over time.\n\nLayer 1 Gas Fees Explained\n\nGas fee is the amount paid to process a transaction on a blockchain network. Layer 1 gas fees are transaction costs associated with processing transactions on the mainnet of a blockchain ecosystem.\n\nThey are measured in the blockchain\u2019s native currency. For example, gas fees on the Ethereum blockchain are paid in Ether (ETH) and are used to reward validators for processing and validating transactions.\n\nGas fees are calculated based on the transaction\u2019s complexity. The more complex a transaction is, the more gas it requires, summing up to a higher fee. Other factors affecting the fluctuation of gas fees on Layer 1 blockchains include demand for transactions, network congestion, and current gas fee. Gas fees increase with higher demand and congestion and reduce with lower demand. Below is a comparison of the leading Layer 1 blockchains and their current gas fees:\n\nEthereum\n\nEthereum is the leading blockchain network in terms of smart contract functionality. However, its popularity has increased traffic on the blockchain network, leading to notoriously high gas fees, which most users have criticized. Even after its switch from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus to a proof-of-stake (PoS) model, gas fees on the blockchain continue to spike.\n\nAt the time of writing, the average cost to execute a simple transaction on Ethereum ranges between 80-100 Gwei. However, during periods of high congestion, the cost of gas on Ethereum can easily exceed 500 Gwei.\n\nBinance Smart Chain (BSC)\n\nBSC is a Layer 1 blockchain solution that leverages its PoS model to provide faster and cheaper transactions than Ethereum. The blockchain is also popular due to its smart contract functionality.\n\nBSC offers lower gas fees and enhanced throughput, making it appealing to developers and users. At the time of writing, the average gas fee on BSC is between 5 Gwei and 10 Gwei per transaction. However, BSC is criticized because it is more centralized than Ethereum. The blockchain is controlled by Binance, the largest centralized cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nExploring Gasless, More Innovative Layer 1 Solutions\n\nGasless layer 1 blockchains are innovative solutions that do not charge users gas fees to process transactions. While relatively new and not widely adopted, this blockchain model is gradually gaining traction.\n\nFor example, established blockchains like Solana and Avalanche are already implementing gasless transactions to solve the scalability challenges older blockchain solutions encounter. However, they are not alone, as newer Layer 1 blockchains like ReserveBlock and Metatime have already adopted a gasless approach.\n\nReserveBlock\n\nReserveBlock is an open-source, decentralized, autonomous, and peer-to-peer (P2P) layer 1 blockchain governed by validators through on-chain voting. ReserveBlock uses a liquid Proof of Assurance (PoA) consensus to democratize mining without the burdens and frictions associated with the PoW or Proof of Stake PoS consensus models. The network is gasless and has no lockups or holding periods. In addition, the development team has also announced that the project will be listed on MEXC on 10 March 2023.\n\nConclusion\n\nDifferent Layer 1 blockchains have different gas fees. While Ethereum\u2019s gas fees are the highest because of its popularity and network congestion, Avalanche, BSC, aims to offer lower gas fees and faster throughputs.\n\nUsers should avoid using networks during high congestion to significantly lower gas fees. They can also use a gas fee estimator to determine optimal transaction fees. In addition, developers can optimize smart contracts to use resources efficiently, reducing gas fees.\n\nHowever, gasless Layer 1 blockchains offer users a user-friendly, convenient, and cost-effective experience. With these solutions, users do not have to worry about incurring extra transaction fees when transacting on the blockchain. But, being in their earliest stages, these gasless blockchains may have security challenges.\n\nAs with any Layer 1 blockchain, weighing their pros and cons before using them for transactions or applications is critical.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.
