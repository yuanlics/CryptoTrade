        "content": "The Ethereum network is set to undergo a technical revamp on April 12 that will allow users to withdraw tens of billions of dollars of its native token, Ether. Known as the \u201cShanghai\u201d upgrade, it\u2019s a necessary step after the world\u2019s most commercially important crypto platform shifted to a less power-hungry process for ordering transactions. Investors burned by recent turmoil in crypto markets will be wondering if, presented with their first opportunity to withdraw their tokens, some Ether holders will run for the hills.\n\nIt\u2019s a computer network that hosts what are known as smart contracts \u2014 self-executing software agreements in which a chain of actions can flow from defined conditions and contingencies. Since it was introduced by crypto entrepreneur Vitalik Buterin in 2014, it\u2019s become a popular platform for developing apps used for everything from trading to gaming. Transactions on Ethereum and many other crypto platforms known as blockchains are publicly viewable and are built on open source software, so developers can jump in and try to make improvements. Ether\u2019s value tumbled during the \u201ccrypto winter\u201d of 2022 that saw investors pull back from many digital assets. But the appeal of Ethereum\u2019s underlying technology has endured."

        "title": "Ethereum's Scaling Race: Which Layer 2 Crypto Is the Best Buy Right Now? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Over the past few years, it's become clear that Ethereum (ETH 1.64%) has experienced significant growth. But as a result of becoming one of the most popular blockchains in the world, its network has become plagued by slow transaction speeds and costly fees. This extreme congestion has created demand for effective Layer 2 scaling solutions.\n\nLayer 2 scaling solutions are built on top of the Ethereum blockchain to enable faster and cheaper transactions while maintaining the blockchain's decentralization and security features.\n\nThere are currently a handful of Layer 2 scaling solutions that aim to solve Ethereum's issues. But the three front-runners today -- and also those with the most long-term potential -- are Arbitrum (CRYPTO:ARB), Optimism (OP), and Polygon (MATIC 2.14%).\n\nEach of these solutions operates a little differently, and as such have their own pros and cons. Let's see what sets these competitors apart and might be deserving of your hard-earned money.\n\nThe Layer 2 breakdown\n\nTo start, it should be clarified that all these Layer 2 solutions try to accomplish the same thing: Make Ethereum faster and cheaper. For the most part, they all use similar processes but differ slightly in how they actually scale up Ethereum.\n\nThese differences can be highly technical and are likely better saved for a conversation another day, but the key factor to understand is that all of these solutions present trade-offs depending on what they prioritize.\n\nFor example, Arbitrum and Optimism both use rollups, which combine groups of transactions into a single transaction. But Arbitrum does it in a way that is slightly slower, yet dramatically cheaper than Optimism. When looking at Polygon, its method of using a sidechain to process transactions makes it less decentralized than Optimism or Arbitrum.\n\nHowever, Arbitrum and Polygon have robust compatibility with Ethereum, making them great options for developers wanting to create decentralized apps.\n\nEach solution comes with its own benefits and drawbacks, but to truly understand which ones are in the most demand, we can look at some statistics.\n\nBy the numbers\n\nTo quantify each solution, it can be helpful to compare simple metrics such as speed and transaction costs since these are essentially the two reasons there is demand for a Layer 2 solution.\n\nPolygon is able to process as many as 65,000 transactions per second, while maintaining low fees that typically range between $0.1 to $0.5 depending on the transaction size. Arbitrum allows for 40,000 transactions per second, with fees ranging from $0.5 to $0.7. Optimism has the capacity to process up to 2,000 transactions per second, and fees are slightly higher compared to Arbitrum and Polygon, ranging from $0.6 to $0.9.\n\nOther statistics -- such as the number of wallets, number of transactions, and total value locked -- can also help paint a clearer picture of the layer 2 landscape.\n\nWhen it comes to the number of wallets and the number of transactions, the race really isn't even close. Polygon simply dominates. While Optimism lags behind Arbitrum and Polygon significantly, Arbitrum is gaining some ground on Polygon thanks to its newly released token that came out this March.\n\nThe other metric to consider is total value locked (TVL). You could think of this as a way to measure the value each solution supports in decentralized applications. The greater the TVL, the more valuable the solution. Surprisingly, Arbitrum has the highest TVL among these three, coming in at around $2.2 billion. Polygon follows at $1.1 billion, and Optimism is third at $920 million.\n\nThe front-runner\n\nConsidering this combination of statistics, it's clear that Polygon and Arbitrum are providing developers and users with a valuable solution. Both have proven usage, which is reflected in multiple sets of statistics.\n\nAn investment in both could be plausible, but if there is one Layer 2 solution deserving of your money, it is likely Polygon. It has a friendly developer environment, verifiable usage, and the best part: a plethora of partnerships with some of the world's most recognizable brands.\n\nIn the past year or so, companies including JPMorgan Chase, Starbucks, Disney, Nike, and Meta Platforms have all used Polygon in different ways to facilitate new blockchain-based business models.\n\nWith its price still down 62% from its all-time high, Polygon looks to have significant long-term potential, exactly the kind investors should be looking for.\n\nIf there is one downside to Polygon, it would be its higher levels of centralization. If decentralization is a priority, then Arbitrum seems to be the best choice. But with its new token just a few weeks old, I would personally like to see Arbitrum build more of a track record.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "title": "Staked Ethereum Withdrawals Could Take Weeks After Shanghai Upgrade: Analyst - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Ethereum shifted to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake model in September, but there\u2019s still one upgrade that needs to be completed to let users unstake their ETH from the network. It's coming up next week\u2014but the process could ultimately take weeks to complete, an analyst at crypto data platform Nansen told Decrypt.\n\nFollowing September's merge event, Ethereum's transition will conclude with the launch of the Shanghai upgrade on April 12, which is paired with another upgrade called Capella.\n\nThe upgrades are hotly anticipated by users who staked ETH in the network\u2014either as individual validators or through platforms like Lido Finance and Rocket Pool\u2014as they will soon be able to withdraw their assets and accumulated rewards.\n\nWhat the Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade Means for You, ETH, and the SEC\n\nBut Ethereum users may not be able to withdraw their funds immediately, or all at once. According to Andrew Thurman, a data analyst at Nansen, the length of the withdrawal queue could result in users having to wait several weeks to withdraw their funds.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the fundamentals,\u201d Thurman told Decrypt, \u201cwhatever the impact of withdrawals going live is, it's going to play out over a period of weeks and not days.\u201d\n\nThe Ethereum 2.0 upgrade process began in early December 2020 with the launch of the Beacon Chain, a parallel blockchain to Ethereum responsible for managing the staking process. Validators were required to stake 32 ETH to operate their own nodes and ensure the continual supply of blocks by processing transactions and maintaining the network.\n\nIt's happening \ud83c\udf8a Shapella is scheduled on mainnet for epoch 194048, scheduled for 22:27:35 UTC on Apr. 12, 2023 \ud83d\udcc6 Client releases compatible with the upgrade are listed in the announcement below \ud83d\udc47https://t.co/I0hSv9lnjz \u2014 timbeiko.eth \u2600\ufe0f (@TimBeiko) March 28, 2023\n\nTo supplement demand, third-party decentralized platforms such as Lido Finance also let users stake their ETH without the need to manage their own validator nodes. In exchange for depositing ETH into the Lido Finance smart contract, users received a staked version of their ETH\u2014an ERC-20 token known as stETH.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe amount of stETH a user received was equivalent to the amount of ETH they deposited, and the value of stETH remained pegged (albeit with fluctuations) to the value of ETH.\n\nIn the wake of the Shanghai upgrade, Thurman believes that the \u201cvalue proposition of projects like Lido will slightly alter, but ultimately won\u2019t change significantly.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeing able to use your staked ETH as a form of collateral in DeFi is hugely important for anybody who's pursuing any kind of sophisticated interest or yield bearing strategy,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, there's still definitely a role for those tokens. But I think liquidity becomes slightly less important because withdrawals are open.\u201d\n\nHow much is staked?\n\nTo date, more than 18 million ETH\u2014that\u2019s about $33.6 billion worth\u2014has been staked and locked into the Beacon Chain across 564,000 validators. The current annual percentage yield (APR) for validators is 4.4%, providing an interest-like return for stakers.\n\nThurman described Ethereum\u2019s two-year journey to proof-of-stake as a \"monumental event in the history of open source software,\u201d and declared that drawing comparisons to a \u201cplane changing engine midair is not much of an overstatement.\u201d\n\nAs users look towards the withdrawal window opening next week, questions are being raised as to the expected timeline for accessing their funds.\n\nAccording to the Ethereum Foundation, a maximum amount of 16 withdrawals can be processed within a single block, totalling a maximum output of 115,200 per day. Today, there are 564,000 validators on Ethereum\u2019s Beacon Chain.\n\nEthereum, LSD Tokens on the Rise Ahead of Next Week's Shanghai Upgrade\n\nIn theory, it would take about five days to process all withdrawals. Demand requests will almost certainly extend this timeline, however. Coinbase, for instance, announced that it \u201cmay take the protocol weeks to months [to] process unstaking requests.\u201d Lido has said it could be early-to-mid May before it unlocks withdrawals, due to security audits.\n\nAlex Esin, CEO of P2P.org\u2014an institutional staking provider with more than $1.2 billion worth of staked assets\u2014told Decrypt that he\u2019s \u201cnot expecting to see a massive withdrawal spike\u201d following the upgrade.\n\n\u201cMany who have already staked on the Beacon Chain have a high risk tolerance, and are not holding out for the withdrawal date,\u201d he assessed. Esin added that stakers must weigh the prospect of withdrawing \u201cagainst the growth expected from the Ethereum ecosystem and ETH strength expected over the next year.\u201d\n\nEven if there\u2019s a rush to withdraw staked funds, Thurman said that much of that ETH may ultimately be re-staked so that holders can continue earning rewards. Exactly how much may be re-staked, however, is difficult to assess at this point.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like throwing darts,\u201d Thurman said. \u201cThat\u2019s why it's so much fun to debate on Twitter\u2014because people just genuinely don't know.\u201d"

        "content": "27 Ethereum projects have launched MEV Blocker, a solution to reduce maximally extractable value (MEV), or Ethereum's invisible tax. MEV Blocker is a free tool developed to counter MEV bots that hijack transactions and inflate prices for users. It sends at least 90% of profits back to users and can protect them from frontrunning and sandwiching when using any Ethereum DApp.\n\nOver 27 prominent Ethereum projects have come together to launch MEV Blocker, a solution that aims to tackle and minimize the amount of value extracted from their users. MEV, or maximally extractable value, is a tax imposed on decentralized finance (DeFi) users on transactions. MEV bots can hijack transactions midway, such as Ether (ETH) trades, nonfungible token (NFT) purchases, and ENS registrations, and inflate prices for the users.\n\nMEV Blocker was jointly developed by CoW Swap, Agnostic Relay, and Beaver Build as a free and censorship-resistant tool to counter this \"$1.3 billion dollar problem\" persistent across the Ethereum ecosystem. In total, 27 Ethereum projects joined the initiative as launch partners, including Balancer, Gnosis DAO, Shapeshift, and StakeDAO, to name a few.\n\nExplaining the intention behind launching MEV Blocker, Martin K\u00f6ppelmann, CEO of Gnosis stated: \"With the launch of MEV Blocker, users can profit from the backrunning opportunities they create. Today all of that money is taken by the searcher, but why shouldn't it be split with the people who create the value?\"\n\nMEV Blocker can be added as a custom RPC endpoint to a crypto wallet, which, in turn, can protect users from frontrunning and sandwiching when using any Ethereum DApp. According to the official announcement, MEV Blocker sends at least 90% of the profits from winning bids back to users and 10% to validators as a reward \u2014 thus giving \"power back to Ethereum users.\"\n\nThis initiative comes at a time when entrepreneurs are attempting to reduce the taxation on users. Despite this, the excitement around the upcoming Shanghai and Capella upgrades resulted in a bull sprint for ETH. On April 5, Ether breached $1,900 for the first time in over seven months.\n\nWhile MEV Blocker is a step towards mitigating the impact of MEV on DeFi users, it is important to note that the price of ETH dropped sharply following the execution of the Merge on Sept. 15, 2022. This highlights the complexity of the Ethereum ecosystem and the need for ongoing solutions to address the challenges it faces.\n\nIn conclusion, the launch of MEV Blocker by 27 Ethereum projects is a welcome development for DeFi users. It has the potential to significantly reduce the impact of MEV and give power back to Ethereum users. However, it is important to continue developing solutions that address the complexities of the Ethereum ecosystem and ensure its continued growth and success."

        "content": "Some investors question whether rollup tokens use-cases justify their valuations\n\nBy: Owen Fernau \u2022 Loading...\n\nDefiant Premium Story\n\nThe launch of Arbitrum\u2019s ARB has brought the market value of the two biggest Ethereum scaling tokens to more than $2B collectively. Now some investors are raising a seemingly obvious question: What are these tokens for? It turns out the answer isn\u2019t so simple.\n\nRight now, the only function for the ARB and Optimism\u2019s OP tokens is governance, which amounts to the ability to vote on which direction the projects take. And with the kerfuffle surrounding the newly created Arbitrum Foundation, even the ability to vote is less than confirmed.\n\nGovernance is often cited as the key value proposition of many crypto tokens. DeFi\u2019s most valuable token, UNI, is worth $4.7B despite its only unique value being its use in voting on the Uniswap exchange\u2019s governance decisions. ARB has now joined the ranks of billion-dollar governance tokens, but so many other scaling solutions for Ethereum set to launch, investors are beginning to wonder whether these tokens\u2019 valuations are justifiable.\n\nWith governance as the primary use case for rollups\u2019 tokens, Tushar Jain, founding partner of the venture firm Multicoin Capital, asked in an interview, \u2014 \u201cwhat exactly are you governing, how does that governance work, and why is it worth billions and billions of dollars?\u201d\n\n$20B FDV\n\nARB and OP are the digital assets issued by Ethereum scaling platforms based on a cryptographic solution known as optimistic rollups. They are the main vehicles to enable faster and cheaper trasnactions on the second-biggest blockchain network as measured by value deposited in each platform.\n\nARB has a market capitalization of $1.6B, while OP\u2019s is at $704M. The tokens with fully diluted values (FDV) of over $20B between them.\n\nRollup Token Use-Cases\n\nRollups\u2019 tokens neither secure the scaling solutions\u2019 networks nor do users pay for transaction fees denominated in them.\n\nThese are the two largest use cases for tokens associated with blockchain networks, argued Jain, whose Multicoin Capital raised $430M for its latest fund last year.\n\nWith rollups however, ETH, the native token to Ethereum, fills both roles, Jain said. The investor added that a third potential use for rollups\u2019 tokens is to stake them in exchange for the ability to be a validator, but that this hasn\u2019t been enabled yet. A validator is a partcipant in a blockchain system responsible for verifying transactions .\n\nDeFi Alpha Premium Content DeFi Daily | Weekdays\n\nDeFi Alpha Letter | Weekly\n\nDefiant Podcast Transcript | Weekly\n\nInbox Dump | Saturday\n\nWeekly Recap | Sunday Looking for Alpha?

Polygon and Consensus are also developing rollups.\n\nWith the potential for increased competition among Layer 2s, rollups teams will be under even more pressure to substantiate the value of their tokens.\n\nNo Token Needed\n\nWhile Jain isn\u2019t necessarily opposed to Layer 2 tokens across the board, but is skeptical of their current valuations, Tezos blockchain co-founder Arthur Brietman believes the tokens shouldn\u2019t exist at all. When The Block Director of News Frank Chapparo asked on Twitter, \u201cwhy does a Layer 2 need a token,\u201d Breitman said, \u201cit doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nTezos just shipped an upgrade on Mar. 29, called Mumbai, which enables developers to permissionlessly deploy rollups for the blockchain.\n\n\u201cThe rollups are free to use, no special token, no restrictive licensing, no need to be approved by validators,\u201d he told The Defiant. \u201cIt\u2019s completely open.\u201d\n\nNeither the Arbitrum Foundation nor the Optimism Foundation, the companies behind each rollup, immediately responded to requests for comment about their tokens\u2019 valuation.\n\nProfitable Protocols\n\nTo be sure, this isn\u2019t to say there isn\u2019t demand for rollups. L2BEAT, a data provider, shows Layer 2 transactions decisively surpassing those of Ethereum over the course of the last year.\n\nLayer 2 vs. Ethereum activity. Source: L2Beat\n\nNot only do rollups provide utility, but they may also already be profitable. A dashboard developed by Kofi, a former partner at the venture firm 1confirmation, shows the scaling solutions as increasingly profitable since July.\n\nRollup economics. Source: DeFi Llama\n\nCrucially, how tokens access that potential profit is what is still unclear.\n\nThe on-chain costs component of rollups\u2019 profit comes from paying the Ethereum blockchain to post the transactions which happened on the Layer 2.\n\nKofi said in an interview that the dashboard doesn\u2019t include costs not captured on the blockchain. Depending on those off-chain costs, rollups as a whole may or may not be profitable ventures.\n\nThe revenue component comes from two sources both currently captured by a software component called the \u201csequencer,\u201d David Mihal, an engineer who develops the data platform CryptoStats, told The Defiant.\n\nThe sequencer is responsible for taking users\u2019 transactions on a rollup and submitting them to Ethereum\u2019s mainnet. Its two sources of revenue are users\u2019 transaction costs, referred to as \u201cgas costs,\u201d and Maximal Extractable Value (MEV), a complex subfield of the blockchain space whereby validators, or sequencers in this case, reorder, and otherwise remix transactions waiting to be processed.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s lots of money behind MEV,\u201d Mihal said.\n\nDecentralizing the Sequencer\n\nRight now, the sequencers for Arbitrum and Optimism are controlled by the companies which developed the solution, according to each projects\u2019 documentation. In short, they\u2019re centralized.\n\nThe potential to decentralize the sequencer is perhaps the most likely possibility for revenue rollups\u2019 tokens have.\n\nKofi, the developer of the economics of rollups dashboard, said that, were a rollup able to decentralize its sequencer, tokens like ARB and OP could gain additional utility.\n\nA decentralized sequencer would give users the ability to participate in its operations by \u201cstaking,\u201d meaning temporarily locking, rollups\u2019 tokens. This would in turn pass on some of the revenue which comes from the transaction fees and MEV on a rollup to token holders.\n\nBoth Arbitrum and Optimism indicate in their documentation that they plan to decentralize their respective solutions\u2019 sequencer.\n\nJain said the key reason why the two rollups have launched without a decentralized sequencer is that it\u2019s \u201ctechnologically really difficult.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs soon as you try to decentralize the sequencer you run into the same problems that you do [when] scaling a Layer 1,\u201d he said.\n\nRegulatory Risk Protection\n\nCynics may find an additional reason for why Layer 2s are releasing \u201cjust\u201d governance tokens: Crypto has entered an extremely adversarial regulatory environment in 2023. A token with obvious means to accrue value is more likely to attract the attention of regulators.\n\nPolynya, a well-known researcher in the crypto space, said while rollups\u2019 tokens may not be indispensable, they\u2019re at least useful.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t necessarily need a token, but it makes decentralizing governance, ownership and upgrades easier,\u201d they said. \u201cSo I\u2019d expect most L2s to have one.\u201d The researcher added that a foundation can use a token for grants and other incentives as well as helping an L2 to decentralize its sequencer.\n\nLooking forward, Jain sees a world where rollups are going to essentially split off from Ethereum, the blockchain currently responsible for securing the scaling solutions. The investor said this will come from the projects\u2019 own token holders as they try to capture more value through their digital asset.\n\n\u201cI think that that battle\u2019s coming in a year or two is my guess,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce the colony gets big enough they start to want things, like independence.\u201d"

        "title": "All about Cosmos, its latest plans for IBC, and how Ethereum fits the bill - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Cosmos switches gears for the fast lane to mass adoption.\n\nATOM fails to overcome range amid low volatility and limited volumes prevail.\n\nThe blockchain interoperability concept made rounds during the 2021 crypto bull run, and was championed by the likes of the Cosmos network. Unfortunately, they had to pump the brakes when crypto winter came. However, Cosmos is now attempting to revive the hype once again.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Cosmos Profit Calculator\n\nCosmos\u2019s latest announcement revealed its intentions to start pushing towards building and expanding an interconnected internet of blockchains again. The network disclosed that it plans to work on the implementation of IBC with solidity, a move that will make it possible for Ethereum [ETH] to be connected to Cosmos.\n\n1/ 2023 is the year that #IBC will expand to new blockchains, including #Ethereum@datachain_en, an @interchain_io granted team, is working on IBC-Solidity. The Solidity implementation of IBC aims to connect Ethereum to #Cosmos \u269b\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/tPVD6lnl6v \u2014 Cosmos \u2013 Internet of Blockchains \u269b\ufe0f (@cosmos) April 6, 2023\n\nCosmos further noted that IBC-solidity will enable the transfer of data, tokens, and messages to multiple blockchains through IBC. This includes enterprise Ethereum and all the EVM-compatible blockchain networks.\n\nWhy Ethereum is such a big part of Cosmos\u2019 plan\n\nThe Ethereum network can be considered as the most popular blockchain and also the most adopted blockchain network at the moment. Additionally, many networks hope to tap into its robust liquidity. This will become much easier to conduct via the IBC as soon as it gets connected to Ethereum. The overall goal is to facilitate a smoother flow of value across different blockchain networks.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the announcement about Ethereum came just a few days after Cosmos revealed its global expansion plans. From a strategic point of view, onboarding Ethereum before executing a global expansion plan might make Cosmos and the IBC more attractive to other potential prospects.\n\nWhat does the future look like for ATOM?\n\nThe demand for ATOM should go up as more blockchains get connected to the Cosmos hub. This is because the coin is necessary for projects looking to join the Cosmos ecosystem. As far as ATOM\u2019s performance is concerned, at press time, the token was still trading at a slight premium as compared to its December 2022 lows. However, it delivered sideways action for the last 12 days or so.\n\nATOM\u2019s relative strength improved over the last few days and was attempting to push above the 50% Relative Strength Index (RSI) level. This was of course backed by accumulation as indicated by the Money Flow Index (MFI). Furthermore, ATOM could also witness a bullish breakthrough if it manages to break past the RSI mid level. Failure to do so may lend favor to the bears.\n\nHow many are 1,10,100 ATOMs worth today\n\nATOM\u2019s volatility was at its highest four-week peak at mid-March. Volatility has since then been declining since then. This reflected the lack of momentum as seen in the last two weeks. Similarly, weighted sentiment remained low suggesting a lack of confidence in the market.\n\nHowever, there were some positive sentiments such as the growing development activity metric. This combined with the Binance funding rate\u2019s recovery confirmed that demand was recovering in the derivatives segment.\n\nThings may turn out favorably if Cosmos proceeds and succeeds with its plans this year. Such an outcome would certainly boost ATOM\u2019s potential value."

        "content": "A new protocol that allows Ethereum validators and stakers to \u201cre-stake\u201d their assets onto other emerging networks has just launched on testnet.\n\nThe mainnet launch of the EigenLayer protocol is not expected until Q3, however, and testing will be phased in three stages to onboard various participants into the ecosystem. The first stage is using Ethereum\u2019s Goerli testing network.\n\nThe project has some serious backing and announced $50 million in a Series A funding round in late March led by crypto venture firm Blockchain Capital, along with Coinbase Ventures, Polychain Capital, Electric Capital and Finality Capital Partner.\n\nEigenLayer aims to become a decentralized marketplace for Ethereum node operators and validators to earn fees on additional services. It allows them to restake assets they received in exchange for staking Ether on platforms such as Lido (stETH) and RocketPool (rETH). The assets can be reused to validate and secure other networks, such as sidechains or non-EVM blockchains.\n\nAccording to the white paper, EigenLayer also has plans to enable restaking for ETH withdrawn from the Beacon Chain following the Shapella upgrade.\n\n\u201cEthereum validators can set their beacon chain withdrawal credentials to the EigenLayer smart contracts, and opt-in to new modules built on EigenLayer.\u201d\n\nThe protocol aims to address issues with validator economic incentives. EigenLayer founder Sreeram Kannan said that facilitating the moving and re-staking of ETH onto other networks would incentivize validators and stakers with additional yields and allow smaller networks to grow securely.\n\nWe are excited to announce the release of the testnet for the first stage of the EigenLayer protocol, which supports liquid and native restaking.\n\n\n\nPlease read the full details here: https://t.co/1eoriZOcwo\n\n\n\n1/8 pic.twitter.com/xLs3CC2EOK \u2014 EigenLayer (@eigenlayer) April 6, 2023\n\nIn late March, Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin said that \u201c[t]he Eigen Labs team is at the forefront of some of the most exciting work happening in Ethereum.\u201d\n\nRelated: MetaMask Institutional unlocks solo ETH staking marketplace\n\n\u201cEigenlayer is a new paradigm for fostering protocol-centric innovation through a programmatic, decentralized trust marketplace,\u201d he added. High praise, but it\u2019s worth noting that Lubin\u2019s Ethereal Ventures fund has invested in EigenLayer.\n\nThere are currently 17.9 million ETH staked on the Beacon Chain, according to the Ultrasound.Money tracker. At current prices, this is valued at around $33.6 billion, which is more than the entire market capitalization of USDC. It represents almost 15% of the entire Ethereum supply.\n\nMagazine: \u2018Account abstraction\u2019 supercharges Ethereum wallets: Dummies guide"

Discover SCENE\n\nCompared to Yuga Labs\u2019 primary Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs, the grimier, sometimes psychedelic siblings in the later and larger Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) set aren\u2019t considered nearly as valuable or prominent\u2014and their lower floor price has mirrored that sentiment.\n\nBut Novel Labs and Mutant Cartel founder Lior Messika\u2014who\u2019s also a Mutant Ape collector himself and a Yuga Labs investor through his VC firm Eden Block\u2014is leaning into that feeling of being an outcast among outcasts and turning it into Web3 gaming lore, with Serum City.\n\nNovel Labs is working with Faraway\u2014developer of the Solana-based game Mini Royale: Nations\u2014to create a city builder game called Serum City on Ethereum that will use ApeCoin as its primary in-game currency.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a real gap here for Mutants,\u201d Messika told Decrypt in an interview of his perception of the broader Yuga Labs ecosystem.\n\nA screenshot from Serum City. Image: Novel Labs\n\nIn Serum City, Mutant Apes are the main characters, and MAYC is among a few NFT collections that will provide owners access to the game. Bored Ape holders will, as well, along with owners of Novel Labs\u2019 own derivative Genesis Oath and Mutant Hound NFT collections that aren\u2019t official Yuga creations.\n\nOwning one of those NFTs is required to play the game at launch, although a Faraway representative confirmed to Decrypt that Serum City will gradually open up access with each new in-game season of content.\n\nBuilding Serum City\n\nSerum City will continue and expand upon Mutant Cartel\u2019s lore, which Messika has developed and published in the form of comic strips and short video clips over the past 18 months.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just a bunch of nerds coming up with cool stories about our Mutants,\u201d Messika said. \u201cThe cool thing is that we\u2019re now incorporating a lot of our community members, and people who have been playing, into our canon.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Mutant Cartel never sleeps !howl pic.twitter.com/9cbdY0bFEQ \u2014 Mutant Cartel (@mutant_cartel) February 28, 2023\n\nSerum City is set in a dystopian world where Bored Apes are the \u201cruling class\u201d and the Mutant Apes are the underlings, relegated to the fringes of society because they\u2019ve consumed the Serum. The main storyline explores the Mutant Cartel Expanded Universe and the characters Blaksoot and Darkfang, according to a statement.\n\nFaraway co-founder Alex Paley told Decrypt that Serum City will have an \u201cillustrated\u201d or comic book-inspired aesthetic, as seen in the first in-game screenshot embedded above.\n\n\u201cThis is more like a transmedia type of play,\u201d Paley added. \u201cIt\u2019s a game, but it\u2019s also a story.\u201d\n\nFaraway and Novel Labs haven't shared a lot of gameplay details, but Messika has joined other Web3 game devs in attempting to push back against the simplistic and superficial nature of early NFT-based games. He suggests that Serum City will be a richer and more appealing play experience.\n\n\u201cWe believe that, frankly, the reason why a lot of games have not reached the kind of adoption that we all have been hoping for is that many of them were just not that deep,\u201d Messika said. \u201cThey\u2019re just not that fun.\u201d\n\nApe expansion\n\nWhile Yuga Labs is wholly unaffiliated with Serum City, the $4 billion startup lets NFT holders use and commercialize their owned artwork. That open policy towards its IP has enabled countless Ape holders to build brands around everything from packaged goods to restaurants to video games like this one.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in touch with them,\u201d Messika said of his relationship with Yuga Labs. But he added that Novel Labs \u201cdidn\u2019t need to check in\u201d with Yuga before building Serum City, given the license tied to Bored Ape and Mutant Ape NFTs.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA screenshot from Serum City. Image: Novel Labs\n\n\u201cWe are, in a sense, a great example of what permissionless innovation\u2014by Yuga\u2019s standards and vision\u2014really looks like,\u201d Messika said, \u201cand we\u2019re really proud of that.\u201d\n\nWhile Messika is determined to provide players with plenty of lore and narrative, Serum City players will also be able to create their own stories and game assets, and buy in-game (off-chain) currencies like gems using ApeCoin.\n\nSerum City\u2019s developers also see the game as a step towards interoperability\u2014a key selling point that Web3 gaming advocates frequently tout, but has faced skepticism due to few prominent working examples to date.\n\nIn this case, items crafted in Serum City will be NFTs that can be transferred and used in future Novel Labs games in the future. Furthermore, the Faraway Developer Platform potentially opens up expanded interoperability down the line, with a press release claiming plans for \u201ccross-game and cross-universe events\u201d once Serum City launches in August.\n\nA screenshot from Serum City. Image: Novel Labs\n\nThose interoperability plans are also the main reason why Serum City\u2019s assets will be on Ethereum\u2019s mainnet. While some other games have opted for Ethereum scaling networks like Polygon or Immutable X to avoid fees, Faraway and Novel Labs see greater benefit to being on Ethereum proper.\n\n\u201cIt was important for us to make the game on the most interoperable blockchain, which is ETH. So, is it expensive in terms of the gas fees? Definitely,\u201d Paley said. \u201cBut is it worth it to have the ultimate interoperable asset, as a user or a player, [and] for me to say that your asset is interoperable everywhere? I think as a player, the answer is yes.\u201d"

But with 2023 looking like it could be the start of the thaw following crypto winter, let\u2019s look at the best cryptos for day trading.\n\nWhen it comes to ultra-short-term trading, nothing trumps liquidity. In that sense, the best cryptos for day trading are highly liquid and generally well-known. The smaller, low-volume cryptos can work during trending markets over a longer holding period. However, for in-and-out scalps, we need liquid cryptos.\n\nSo, you\u2019re likely to recognize all of the best cryptos for day trading below.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBTC Bitcoin $28,031.86 ETH Ethereum $1,871.62 DOGE Dogecoin $0.08\n\nBitcoin (BTC)\n\nman in glasses holding a coin that has the Bitcoin (BTC-USD) logo\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIn the sense of size and liquidity, how can we not kick off the list with Bitcoin (BTC-USD)? Bitcoin is the largest crypto in the world, with a market cap of around $540 billion. It\u2019s the most well-known cryptocurrency out there, garnering the bulk of the industry\u2019s attention. Over the past three months, its trading volume has averaged $25.8 billion a day.\n\nDay traders focused on cryptos must keep Bitcoin on their watchlist, even if they\u2019re not trading it. That\u2019s because the movement in Bitcoin impacts other cryptocurrencies, similar to the way the movement in stocks like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) can impact the rest of the tech sector.\n\nBitcoin had a stellar first quarter. According to Finbold, \u201cBitcoin\u2019s return on investment (ROI) was 170.32% more compared to the average of five major stock indexes. During the quarter, Bitcoin\u2019s returns stood at 69.4%, while average returns for the indexes stood at 5.5%.\u201d\n\nThe bulls are certainly in charge at the moment, buying the dips and sending the crypto soaring higher. The next important level to watch is $30,000, which is just 7% above where BTC currently trades.\n\nStory continues\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nA concept image of mining an Ethereum (ETH) token.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nEthereum (ETH-USD) also had a great Q1, rallying about 50% in the first three months of the year and more than doubling off of its 2022 low. It is the second-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, with a market cap of about $224.5 billion.\n\nEthereum is also one of the most widely traded cryptocurrencies, with an average daily trading volume of $8.6 billion. That makes the token one of the best cryptos for day trading.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, Ethereum deserves every bit as much attention as Bitcoin gets given that it has such a wide range of applications. It\u2019s faster when it comes to transactions, and its smart contracts offer real-world solutions as technology continues to evolve.\n\nDogecoin (DOGE)\n\nDogecoin Cryptocurrency\n\nSource: Orpheus FX / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs silly as Dogecoin (DOGE-USD) is, it\u2019s on the list of the best cryptos for day trading due to its large following and ample liquidity. After the tethered crypto holdings, Bitcoin and Ethereum, Dogecoin is next on the list for daily trading volume.\n\nIt has traded an average of $604.6 million a day over the past three months and commands a market cap of $11.9 billion. It may have started off as a joke, but its large following isn\u2019t.\n\nIt certainly doesn\u2019t hurt that Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Twitter CEO Elon Musk has a fascination with the cryptocurrency. In fact, he recently integrated the logo into the Twitter platform, adding a quick $4 billion to the token\u2019s market value.\n\nDay traders thrive on volatility and massive moves like this. While I don\u2019t personally believe in the long-term viability of Dogecoin, this one puts together enough moves for day traders to take advantage of.\n\nOn the date of publication, Bret Kenwell did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Hackers were able to gain access to more than $320 million in the first quarter of 2023 alone, according to on-chain data consolidated by blockchain security firm CertiK in its quarterly report.\n\nThe losses were significantly lower than in 2022\u2019s first and fourth quarters, when hackers took around $1.3 billion and $950 million, respectively. According to CertiK, the low amount of losses may be linked to events happening off-chain that had an impact on the crypto industry as a whole, such as the issues with Silvergate Bank and the depegging of USD Coin (USDC) at the height of the Silicon Valley Bank collapse.\n\nOut of the funds stolen within the quarter, over $31 million was lost to 90 exit scams, while more than $222 million was lost in 52 flash loan and oracle manipulation exploits. Regarding incidents and the amount lost per blockchain, CertiK highlighted that BNB Chain had 139 incidents, the greatest number for the quarter. Meanwhile, despite having fewer incidents, Ethereum had $221 million in losses, the most lost in Q1 2023.\n\nNumber of incidents and the amount lost in the first quarter of 2023 by blockchain. Source: CertiK\n\nDespite being much lower than Q1 2022 and Q4 2022, the first quarter of 2023 was still met with hundreds of millions lost, with 60% coming from the recent Euler Finance hack. On March 13, the protocol was hacked through a flash loan exploit, leading to losses of over $195 million.\n\nRelated: Sandwich trading bots lose bread and butter in $25M exploit\n\nWhile the amount lost to hacking looks enormous at a glance, a huge chunk of the funds was recovered through negotiations with hackers. On April 4, Euler Finance announced that it was able to recover around 90% of the lost funds after almost a month of back-and-forth negotiations with the hacker.\n\nThis trend has been witnessed in the space more frequently with other hacks following Euler\u2019s example. On April 6, lending protocol Sentiment also recovered around $870,000 after giving a bounty of $95,000 to those responsible for taking almost a million dollars from the platform.\n\nMagazine: Magazine: Huawei NFTs, Toyota\u2019s hackathon, North Korea vs. Blockchain: Asia Express"

        "content": "Matter Labs, the team behind Ethereum layer 2 scaling solution zkSync, has confirmed that 921 Ether (ETH) worth $1.7 million is currently stuck in one of its new smart contracts, GemstoneIDO.\n\nHowever, the firm claims the funds to be \u201csafe\u201d and to have found an \u201celegant\u201d solution for rescuing the funds, which accumulated during the Gemholic token sale.\n\nInitially stating that the funds wouldn\u2019t be \u201cstuck forever,\u201d Matter Labs said in its most recent tweet that it had found an \u201celegant solution\u201d to \u201cunfreeze\u201d the GemstoneIDO contract and transfer the funds out.\n\n@GemholicECO, who ran into a problem with their smart contract on zkSync Era, has reached out to us for support, which we provided.\n\n\n\nWe'd like to give the community an update and further context on their issue in full transparency, as we always have and always will.\n\n\n\n\u2014 zkSync \u220e (@zksync) April 7, 2023\n\nMatter Labs identified the issue to have stemmed from the .transfer() function in the GemstoneIDO smart contract, which is part of a project run by the GemholicECO ecosystem.\n\nMatter Labs said that the issue could have been prevented had they deployed the contract on a testnet first.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the contracts were deployed on Era mainnet without having been tried on the testnet or local node, which would have immediately caught the problem.\u201d\n\nThe faulty function came from zkSync Era, a new type of Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) zero knowledge proof rollup that executes smart contract much faster than on the base layer.\n\nThe team however stressed that zkSync Era is not EVM-equivalent, meaning that it is compatible with the EVM at a bytecode level. This means some functions work differently in the new environment.\n\n\u201cThis is a deliberate design choice with specific upsides and trade-offs,\u201d they said.\n\nIn justifying its design choice, Matter Labs said zkSync Era could process some transaction types between 10 to 1,000 times cheaper than other EVM rollups.\n\nNontheless, Matter Labs held themselves accountable for the mistake and assured members of the zkSync ecosystem that they'll continue resolve similar issues relentlessly.\n\n\u201cWith this comes great responsibility and inevitably the occasional friction and today was one of these instances. When there are problems our team will continue to be on alert and be relentless in resolving issues.\u201d\n\nzkEVMs are complex systems that are in the process of maturing. Even though zkSync Era is still in Alpha, we\u2019ve already got a thriving ecosystem. \u2014 zkSync \u220e (@zksync) April 7, 2023\n\nSeveral members of the CryptoCurrency subreddit, however, expressed their frustration on the matter:\n\n\u201cAnother example of why a chain shouldnt be rushing its mainnet launch. Always remember this guys, EVM compatible =/= EVM equivalent.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m all in for seeing Zero Knowledge tech becoming more and more relevant in the crypto space. However, these chains also have to take into consideration the fact that people\u2019s funds are at stake,\u201d said another.\n\nRelated: zkSync Era launches with Uniswap and Sushi \u2014 First zkEVM on mainnet\n\nTransaction failures of the GemstoneIDO contract can be seen on the zkSync explorer page, which also shows the 921 Ether is stored in its smart contract.\n\nMatter Labs confirmed that GemstoneIDO, a smart contract in the broader Gemholic.ECO ecosystem, was the contract at concern. Source: zkSync Explorer\n\nMatter Labs launched zkSync Era on mainnet last week, promising that decentralized exchanges Uniswap and SushiSwap would be live in a matter of days. That hasn\u2019t happened yet, however, projects including Argent, Celer Network and MetaMask are live on the network now.\n\nUpdated 1:37am UTC time on April 7: This article has been updated to add comments from Matter Labs most recent post on the incident.\n\nMagazine: Ethereum is eating the world \u2014 \u2018You only need one internet\u2019"

        "content": "Ethereum re-staking protocol EigenLayer has initiated its testnet launch, aiming to establish a decentralized marketplace where Ethereum node operators and validators can maximize their staking rewards and provide additional services.\n\nWith a mainnet release anticipated for Q3, EigenLayer will undergo a phased, three-stage testing process, initially utilizing Ethereum's Goerli testing network.\n\n\u201cEthereum validators can set their beacon chain withdrawal credentials to the EigenLayer smart contracts, and opt-in to new modules built on EigenLayer,\" the project's whitepaper details.\n\nThe project recently secured $50 million in a Series A funding round, led by crypto venture firm Blockchain Capital and with participation from Coinbase Ventures, Polychain Capital, Electric Capital, and Finality Capital Partner. Such a suite of high-profile financial backing highligfts the growing interest in the innovative re-staking protocol.\n\nEigenLayer intends to enable Ethereum validators and stakers to re-stake their assets onto emerging networlks, such as sidechains or non-EVM blockchains. By reusing assets acquired through staking Ether on platforms like Lido (stETH) and RocketPool (rETH), validators can support the growth and security of other networks. Furthermore, the protocol plans to facilitate re-staking for ETH withdrawn from the Beacon Chain following the Shapella upgrade.\n\nEigenLayer's primary goal is to address the economic incentive issues faced by validators. Founder Sreeram Kannan believes that enabling the transfer and re-staking of ETH onto other networks will provide additional yields for validators and stakers, while promoting the secure growth of smaller networks.\n\nLubin's Ethereal Ventures fund has also invested in EigenLayer, further undersdcoring the project's potential impact on the Ethereum ecosystem.Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin recently praised the EigenLayer project, stating:\n\n\"The Eigen Labs team is at the forefront of some of the most exciting work happening in Ethereum.\"\n\n\n\nCurrently, approximately 17.9 million ETH are staked on the Beacon Chain, valued at around $33.6 billion, which surpasses the entire market capitalization of USDC. This figure represents nearly 15% of the total Ethereum supply.\n\nAs EigenLayer's testnet launch unfolds, the team will focus on refining the protocol and gathering feedback from users and developers. The mainnet release, anticipated for Q3, promises a more streamlined and rewarding staking experience for Ethereum users while bolstering network security and stability.\n\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Shanghai (Shapella) ready - Coinbase",
        "content": "Market View\n\nEthereum\u2019s Shapella (Shanghai+Capella) Fork will be a major focus next week as the upgrade is scheduled for activation on April 12 at 10:27pm UTC. The network upgrade will enable validators to withdraw their staked ETH, some of which has been dormant on the Beacon Chain since the consensus layer went live in December 2020. The big question is how much selling pressure could materialize once withdrawals are enabled, as there are numerous variables involved in estimating both the supply that could be unlocked as well as the amount that could reasonably be expected to be sold.\n\nWe previously laid out our thesis in a report published February 14 ( \u201cStaked ETH withdrawals: new math\u201d ) that a sell-off on the back of this event should be relatively limited. Our revised estimates are that ETH selling directly from this source could amount to only around 1-2% of total average daily ETH volumes, and we\u2019re biased towards the lower end of that range.\n\nChart 1. ETH/BTC cross has moved in ETH\u2019s favor ahead of Shanghai Fork\n\nNevertheless, in our view, ETH performance around the Shanghai Fork will be less strictly dependent on technicals and more contingent on what risk actually does at that time. That is, if the trading environment sees risk assets selling off, people may decide to unstake and sell ETH just to de-risk, while institutions may not step in as aggressively on the buy side. Mid-April holidays may also constrain liquidity, while a lower stablecoin dominance ratio (of 11.2% of the total crypto market cap) suggests a lot of conversion into other tokens already took place in March.\n\nThere are however some mitigating factors that could limit the amount of ETH that could be immediately unlocked after the upgrade takes place. First, only 44% of validators have set their withdrawal credential prefixes to 0x01, which is necessary for both partial and full withdrawals to be enabled and funds unlocked. (Note: some of these address changes can only occur once the Shanghai Fork is activated.) Second, full withdrawals are rate limited to 8 validators per epoch at the moment or 1800 validators per day, given that there are around 563k validators at the moment. This figure changes as the total number of validators increases or decreases by 65,536.\n\nThird, staking platform Lido, which represents almost 23% of all staked ETH, has said that their withdrawal functionality will be ready no sooner than early May as they are still preparing their v2 upgrade. Crypto exchange Binance has also set daily ETH redemption quotas for its users with withdrawals only supported one week after the Shanghai Fork takes place. All of this could drag out the timeline for when staked ETH balances could actually be withdrawn. (Incidentally, if users want to unstake their ETH on Coinbase, they will be able to do so soon after the upgrade is complete \u2013 waiting periods will be determined by the protocol.)\n\nThere\u2019s also the separate but related issue of why people may actually sell the staked ETH that\u2019s deposited into their accounts and how much could make its way onto the market. Pressure on this front could be alleviated by the fact that more than 67% of all staked ETH is currently staked through third-party entities, and a lot of those could use those released rewards to set up new validators. Moreover, around 51% of all staked ETH was locked up at prices higher than they are today, which diminishes the risk of ETH selling to meet tax liabilities.\n\nChart 2. Amount of ETH staked per price level (ETH/USD)\n\nFinally, we are only considering the withdrawal side of the equation here. But as people withdraw, the base rewards on staked ETH increases which over time should also encourage people to stake ETH. The current staking participation rate in Ethereum is currently only 15% of total ETH circulating supply compared to an average of 65% across the top alternative layer-1s by market cap. That suggests that there is a very big opportunity to grow here, even if the ultimate staking ratio is still under 65% because of the relative amount of organic Ethereum usage."

As a result, many of them have been selling off their stocks and looking for alternative investments, such as cryptocurrencies.\n\nOverview of RenQ Finance (RENQ) and Ethereum (ETH)\n\nRenQ Finance and Ethereum are two popular cryptocurrencies in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. While both are built on blockchain technology, they differ in their approach and offerings.\n\nRenQ Finance, launched in 2023, is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that offers liquidity solutions for the crypto market. The platform\u2019s main focus is to provide a secure and reliable way for users to exchange and trade digital assets.\n\nRenQ Finance uses advanced AI technology to provide users with the best possible price for their assets and offers a variety of features such as staking, lending, and borrowing. With its recent success in its presale stages and innovative use of AI technology, RenQ Finance is a promising investment opportunity for those interested in decentralized finance.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, and it is known for its smart contract capabilities. The platform allows developers to build decentralized applications (DApps) on top of its blockchain, making it a popular choice for the DeFi space. Ethereum also offers its native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), which is used as a means of payment for transactions on the network.\n\nOne of the key differences between the two is their approach to scalability. Ethereum has been facing scalability issues due to its limited transaction processing capacity, leading to higher gas fees and slower transaction times. However, Ethereum has recently upgrade its network to Ethereum 2.0, which aims to improve its scalability and efficiency.\n\nRenQ Finance, on the other hand, uses a multi-chain approach, allowing users to access financial products across different blockchains. This approach enables RenQ Finance to provide more scalability and interoperability, making it easier for investors to diversify their portfolios and take advantage of opportunities in different markets.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Advancements and Potential\n\nEthereum has been a popular choice among institutional investors due to its recent advancements and potential for future growth. The Ethereum 2.0 upgrade improves the scalability and efficiency of the network, making it more attractive to investors.\n\nAdditionally, the development of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications on the Ethereum network has led to increased adoption and use cases, further driving up the price and demand for ETH.\n\nRenQ Finance\u2019s Unique Value Proposition\n\nRenQ Finance is another cryptocurrency that has caught the attention of institutional investors. RenQ Finance\u2019s unique value proposition lies in its use of advanced AI technology to provide users with the best possible price for their assets, offering features like staking, lending, and borrowing.\n\nAdditionally, its interoperability allows users to access various financial products across different blockchains, making it easier for investors to diversify their portfolios.\n\nThe Future of the Stock Market and Crypto Market:\n\nThe recent shift in institutional investors from stocks to cryptocurrencies like ETH and RENQ may signal a broader trend toward adopting crypto as a legitimate investment class.\n\nThe potential for higher returns and the diversification benefits that crypto provides are likely to attract more institutional investors in the future. This could lead to increased demand and higher prices for cryptocurrencies, which may cause a further shift away from traditional investments like stocks.\n\nClick Here to Buy RenQ Finance (RENQ) Tokens.\n\nVisit the links below for more information about RenQ Finance (RENQ):\n\nWebsite: https://renq.io\n\nWhitepaper: https://renq.io/whitepaper.pdf\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "EigenLayer Protocol Allows Restaking of Ethereum Assets on Emerging Networks - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "The EigenLayer protocol, which aims to become a decentralized marketplace for Ethereum node operators and validators to earn fees on additional services, has launched on testnet. The protocol allows ETH validators and stakers to \u201cre-stake\u201d their assets onto other emerging networks. Testing will be phased in three stages to onboard various participants into the ecosystem, with the first stage using Ethereum\u2019s Goerli testing network. The mainnet launch of the EigenLayer protocol is expected in Q3.\n\nRestaking Assets to Incentivize Validators and Stakers\n\nEigenLayer founder Sreeram Kannan said that facilitating the moving and re-staking of ETH onto other networks would incentivize validators and stakers with additional yields and allow smaller networks to grow securely. According to the white paper, EigenLayer also has plans to enable restaking for ETH withdrawn from the Beacon Chain following the Shapella upgrade. The protocol aims to address issues with validator economic incentives.\n\nEigenLayer has serious backing, having announced $50 million in a Series A funding round in late March led by crypto venture firm Blockchain Capital, along with Coinbase Ventures, Polychain Capital, Electric Capital, and Finality Capital Partner. Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin has also praised the project, stating that \u201c[t]he Eigen Labs team is at the forefront of some of the most exciting work happening in Ethereum. Eigenlayer is a new paradigm for fostering protocol-centric innovation through a programmatic, decentralized trust marketplace.\u201d\n\nCurrent State of Ethereum Staking\n\nThere are currently 17.9 million ETH staked on the Beacon Chain, according to the Ultrasound. Money tracker. At current prices, this is valued at around $33.6 billion, which is more than the entire market capitalization of USDC. It represents almost 15% of the entire Ethereum supply. The high level of staked ETH on the Beacon Chain highlights the importance of the staking mechanism in the Ethereum network. However, there are concerns about the economic incentives for validators and stakers, particularly as the Ethereum network transitions from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake.\n\nThe Role of EigenLayer in the Ethereum Ecosystem\n\nEigenLayer aims to address some of these concerns by providing a decentralized marketplace for ETH node operators and validators to earn fees on additional services. The ability to restake assets received in exchange for staking Ether on platforms such as Lido (stETH) and RocketPool (rETH) on other networks could incentivize validators and stakers with additional yields. This, in turn, could encourage more participation in the Ethereum network, as well as other emerging networks.\n\nEigenLayer\u2019s plans to enable restaking for ETH withdrawn from the Beacon Chain following the Shapella upgrade could also provide additional incentives for validators and stakers. The ability to restake withdrawn assets could encourage more participation in the Ethereum network, as well as other networks that use the Ethereum protocol. The protocol aims to become a decentralized marketplace for validator services, with additional modules built on top of EigenLayer. This could create a more competitive marketplace for validator services, potentially leading to better economic incentives for validators and stakers.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe launch of the EigenLayer protocol on testnet represents a significant development for the Ethereum ecosystem. The ability to restake assets received in exchange for staking Ether on other networks could provide additional incentives for validators and stakers. This, in turn, could encourage more participation in the Ethereum network, as well as other emerging networks. EigenLayer\u2019s plans to enable restaking for ETH withdrawn from the Beacon Chain following the Shapella upgrade could also provide additional incentives for validators and stakers."
