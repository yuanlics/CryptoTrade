        "content": "Choosing a promising cryptocurrency amid thousands can be daunting. Indeed, most investors look at top options such as Bitcoin (BTC-USD) or Ethereum (ETH-USD), with these cryptos usually providing enough diversification over the long term.\n\nKeep in mind that both Bitcoin and Ethereum are massive in size. While that doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t grow immensely from here, those with a more growth-oriented market view may want to look for the so-called \u201cnext Ethereum\u201d or the \u201cEthereum killers\u201d.\n\nSo, where to start? Investors have plenty of smart contract-enabled blockchain projects from which to choose. Here are three of the best-known Etheruem alternatives I think could have a shot of taking market share away from the incumbent over time.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSolana (SOL-USD)\n\nMacro shot of a physical coin from the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL-USD)\n\nSource: Rcc_Btn / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmidst crypto giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum, Solana (SOL-USD) emerges as a promising star, challenging Ethereum\u2019s dominance. Despite a tumultuous journey from $260 to around $25, Solana\u2019s potential remains significant.\n\nSolana is evolving as the \u201cVisa for digital assets\u201c with institutional adoption and scalability advantages. Positioned as an \u201cEthereum challenger,\u201d it excels in decentralized finance and NFTs, making it a crypto contender to watch.\n\nRanked in the top 10 by market cap, Solana holds less than 1% market share. Despite its performance in 2023, its technicals present an appealing case. Overcoming the $27 resistance could trigger substantial upside potential, targeting $32.40 and potentially $40-plus gains in 2023.\n\nAvalanche (AVAX-USD)\n\nAvalanche AVAX symbol.

AVAX-USD\n\nSource: FellowNeko / Shutterstock\n\nAvalanche (AVAX-USD) gains prominence as a pioneering blockchain with scalability and DeFi focus. Partnerships, transaction growth, and innovation highlight its resilience and potential in the crypto landscape.\n\nAVAX, Avalanche\u2019s native token, serves as a unit of account, pays network fees, and supports blockchain security through staking. Avalanche and Solana are fast, scalable blockchain platforms with distinct differences. This includes both platforms support DeFi and dApps. However, Solana emphasizes decentralized exchanges, attracting notable DeFi projects.\n\nStory continues\n\nAvalanche\u2019s Q2 2023 DeFi metrics are mixed: daily active addresses doubled, but Total Value Locked (TVL) fell 19%, raising concerns. Despite this, Avalanche remains in the asset tokenization trend, with a $50 million program to acquire tokenized assets, showing potential for growth.\n\nCardano (ADA-USD)\n\nA concept token for Cardano with a trading chart in the background.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCardano (ADA-USD) stands out among numerous altcoins due to its thoughtful long-term strategy and emphasis on proof-of-stake technology, which sets it apart as an eco-conscious crypto opportunity.\n\nCardano is not only eco-friendly but also aims to connect diverse blockchains through interoperability. Led by the Cardano Foundation, a consortium of cryptography and software development experts, Cardano focuses on scalability, security, and practical use cases.\n\nCardano\u2019s deliberate development pace contrasts with rapid-growth approaches, affecting its short-term price. Yet, this approach may lead to substantial value creation in the future. The project\u2019s affordability appeals to investors aligned with its development philosophy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald has a LONG position in ETH, SOL.

        "title": "Choose AWS Graviton and cloud storage for your Ethereum nodes infrastructure on AWS | Amazon Web Services - AWS Blog",
        "content": "The first question that comes up for everyone who wants to manage their own Ethereum nodes on AWS is how to select the right compute and storage. To answer this question, we ran a series of tests and observed how popular Ethereum Execution Layer (EL) clients go-ethereum with LevelDB (Geth) and Erigon work on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances powered by AWS Graviton processors and with Amazon Elastic Block Storage (Amazon EBS) type gp3 and io2 as well as Amazon FSx for OpenZFS. We used Lighthouse as accompanying Consensus Layer client in both cases, but focused our tests on JSON RPC API exposed by EL clients as the most important for the end user experience. First, we benchmarked the EL clients to compare the performance of different EC2 instance types and used EBS io2 volumes with 64,000 operations per second (IOPS) to avoid storage bottlenecks. Then we ran similar tests but now with different storage configurations and high CPU and memory EC2 instance size to isolate the performance comparison of different storage options. Based on the data we gathered, we identified the set of configurations most suitable for nodes that sync with the rest of the network and serve JSON RPC requests.\n\nTesting EC2 instances powered by AWS Graviton\n\nAWS Graviton is an ARM-based CPU designed by AWS to deliver the best price performance for workloads running in Amazon EC2. Multiple versions of the AWS Graviton processor family were released since 2018. AWS Graviton 3 processors are the latest in the AWS Graviton processor family.\n\nWe compared the performance of running two of the most popular EL client configurations, Geth in full node type and Erigon in the only possible for it archive node setup. We tried them on c6g.2xlarge (AWS Graviton 2) and c7g.2xlarge (AWS Graviton3) EC2 instance types and chose the 2xlarge size to follow the recommended minimum of 16 GB RAM for both Geth and Erigon.\n\nFor performance testing, we used the K6 load testing tool by Grafana Labs to generate the load from AWS Cloud9 instances. During the tests, we were initiating as many read transactions as possible for the specified time, typically 20\u201330 minutes. For both Geth and Erigon, we tested two scripted scenarios:\n\nScenario 1 \u2013 We called a single JSON RPC method, eth_estimateGas, which has high CPU utilization and is therefore ideal for testing the processor. To make sure we prevented the EL clients from caching responses, we created a pool of thousands of Ethereum addresses and picked them randomly during the test.\n\n\u2013 We called a single JSON RPC method, eth_estimateGas, which has high CPU utilization and is therefore ideal for testing the processor. To make sure we prevented the EL clients from caching responses, we created a pool of thousands of Ethereum addresses and picked them randomly during the test. Scenario 2 \u2013 We triggered the mix of commonly used JSON RPC methods invoked with the same weight: eth_gasPrice , eth_blockNumber, eth_getBalance , eth_getCode , eth_gasPrice , eth_estimateGas , eth_getBlockByNumber , eth_getTransactionByHash , eth_getTransactionReceipt , and eth_getLogs . We also randomized the data used in requests by choosing random block numbers and picking from a pool of thousands of transaction hashes and addresses for every transaction.\n\nTo make sure the tests were consistent between runs, we used the same operating system (Amazon Linux 2) and the same versions of Geth (v1.10.26) and Erigon (v2.34.0) clients across all instance types. We also used the same storage configuration powered by Amazon EBS type gp3 with 16,000 disk operations per second (IOPS), 1000 MB/s throughput, and capacity of 2 TB for Geth and 3 TB for Erigon. For the duration of the tests, we stopped blockchain synchronization on all clients to prevent unpredictable interference from the syncing process. Finally, we used m5.4xlarge instances for AWS Cloud9 generating JSON RPC requests with the K6 tool and placed it in the same subnet within the same Availability Zone with all target nodes to avoid possible bottlenecks in compute and network.\n\nThe following tables show the max iterations per second we got for both scenarios.\n\nThe first table summarizes the results for Scenario 1 (single JSON RPC method eth_estimateGas ).\n\nInstance Erigon Max Iterations/Sec Geth Max Iterations/Sec c6g.2xlarge 10466.6637 10051.32125 c7g.2xlarge 13931.81629 13875.40971\n\nThe second table summarizes the results for Scenario 2 (mix of commonly used JSON RPC methods).\n\nInstance Erigon Max Iterations/Sec Geth Max Iterations/Sec c6g.2xlarge 5190.03825 325.32374 c7g.2xlarge 6358.26578 488.86294\n\nIn both scenarios, c7g.2xlarge showed the highest maximum iterations per second across Geth and Erigon. Our observation of the efficiency of AWS Graviton-based instances is also similar to Polygon, the Ethereum based scaling platform, which also experienced better performance and lower cost with AWS Graviton for EVM-compatible nodes. You may also notice that Erigon showed higher than Geth with LevelDB performance in Scenario 2 with the mix of commonly used JSON RPC methods. We have fund that for disc-intensive methods, such as eth_getBlockTransactionCountByNumber , Erigon can show six to thirteen times more iterations per second than Geth with LevelDB, while for CPU-intensive methods like eth_estimateGas the performance is about the same.\n\nEven though C7g costs about 6% more than C6g powered by AWS Graviton 2, from the \u201cperformance for cost\u201d measure it still comes as a leader.\n\nChoosing the storage\n\nBlockchain nodes need storage that can be directly mounted to the file system and sustain a high number of IOPS with low latency. Based on these requirements, we tested Amazon EBS with volume types gp3 and io2 and FSx for OpenZFS. We decided to skip the tests of EC2 instances with an instance store for now because although the data on an instance store is preserved between instance reboots, it doesn\u2019t persist if the instance is stopped, hibernated, or deleted. That adds operational overhead for the nodes because they have to spend up to multiple hours copying the state data from elsewhere before they get operational. Nevertheless, it\u2019s a popular option among those who run nodes for high-throughput blockchain networks, so we will come back to this option when we start analyzing those.\n\nBoth Amazon EBS gp3 and io2 provide single-digit millisecond latency, but io2 has more consistent performance and therefore lower tail latencies than gp3. Tail latency is the duration of the small percentage of response times from a system that take the longest in comparison to the rest of the response times. However, in our observations for Geth and Erigon, there is no noticeable difference between the performance of io2 and more cost-efficient gp3 when configured with up to 16000 IOPS. That amount of IOPS is usually sufficient for nodes that need to follow the chain head and serve 10\u201315 JSON RPC requests per second. For more performant nodes that need to serve hundreds of JSON RPC requests per second, multiple EBS gp3 volumes can be combined together with RAID 0 to serve 32000 IOPS (two gp3 volumes) or 64000 IOPS (four gp3 volumes). This configuration will be more cost-effective than using a single EBS io2 volume, but with slightly lower performance and more operational overhead.\n\nFSx for OpenZFS can be mounted to the nodes\u2019 file system over a Network File System (NFS) protocol. It showed performance similar to both mentioned Amazon EBS options, but with slightly higher latency. Its advantage is fast provisioning of new volumes on the same file system. The built-in volumes cloning concept allows you to save time of copying state data during initialization and get new nodes up and running quickly. It also helps to save space because new volumes are created as children of older volumes and file reads will be served from parent blocks until the data on them is changed. Only when the data is changed it is copied to the new volume. Unfortunately, Erigon can\u2019t work with disk volumes through NFS protocol, so in our tests, FSx for OpenZFS only worked for Geth. Considering the costs of FSx for OpenZFS, if you don\u2019t need to provision new nodes as quickly as possible and accept about 30 minutes to 1 hour of initialization time, then Amazon EBS gp3 is still the more cost-effective option.\n\nChoosing the configurations\n\nThe goal of our analysis was to find the combinations of Graviton-powered EC2 instances and storage that will be cost-effective and performant. Most Ethereum clients combine functions of syncing with other nodes in the blockchain network and serving the JSON RPC API to decentralized applications (dApps). Processing JSON RPC requests takes more resources than just syncing the data, but at the same time not everyone needs the nodes for dApps. Some use nodes only as the reliable feed of blockchain network data for analytics systems or locally-stored snapshots. Therefore, we came up with multiple configurations based on the role the node plays.\n\nConfigurations for sync nodes\n\nThe purpose of the sync node is to catch up with the chain head. In addition to stress tests that we ran to identify better-suited compute and storage, we also left sync nodes running for a week and then let AWS Compute Optimizer advise us on the sizes for compute and storage. Finally, we ran those setups for a few more days. The following table summarizes the final configurations.\n\nEL + CL Combination Instance Type EBS Volume Geth + Lighthouse/Prysm r6g.2xlarge GP3 \u2013 3000 IOPS, 200 MBps throughput Erigon + Lighthouse r6g.4xlarge GP3 \u2013 5900 IOPS, 125 MBps throughput Nethermind + Teku r6g.2xlarge GP3 \u2013 3000 IOPS, 125 MBps throughput Besu + Teku m6g.4xlarge GP3 \u2013 3000 IOPS, 125 MBps throughput\n\nConfigurations for RPC nodes\n\nRPC nodes serve requests from dApps while also staying in sync with the rest of the Ethereum network. The configurations in the following table assume the nodes with Erigon will handle below 30 requests per second of storage-intensive trace_block RPC method, while still following the chain head.\n\nEL + CL Combination Instance Type EBS Volume Geth + Lighthouse/Prysm m7g.4xlarge GP3 \u2013 16000 IOPS, 1000 MBps throughput Erigon + Lighthouse m7g.4xlarge GP3 \u2013 16000 IOPS, 1000 MBps throughput\n\nFurther tests also showed that the Erigon with Lighthouse combination can sustain about 300 RPC requests per second on m7g.16xlarge and 4 EBS gp3 volumes with 16000 IOPS and 1000 Mbps throughput configured as RAID 0 volume. We also found that from a performance perspective on a mixed JSON RPC test scenario, one Erigon-powered node can be used as a replacement of two Geth-powered nodes on a similar setup.\n\nConsiderations\n\nThe analysis and the recommendations in this post assume that you run Ethereum nodes for your own needs. Those who provide nodes as a service to others, like node operators, might consider building more sophisticated architectures and end up with different configurations. For example, you may consider using EC2 instances types with an instance store to get the storage performance at the levels of EBS io2 and benefit from compute savings plans to pay less for both compute and storage. If you\u2019d prefer to get new nodes up and running as fast as possible, you might still use FSx for OpenZFS to benefit from fast volume provisioning.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this post we shared the configurations of compute and storage that we found suitable for running Ethereum nodes on AWS. Through our tests and observations, we found that AWS Graviton-based instances, particularly the C7g and M7g instance types demonstrated good performance and cost-effectiveness for popular EL clients like Geth and Erigon. The M7g has more memory than C7g and that helps to both serve JSON RPC requests and follow the chain head.\n\nAs for the storage, both Amazon EBS with gp3 and io2 volume types and FSx for OpenZFS provided suitable options. Although io2 volumes offer more consistent performance, gp3 volumes configured with sufficient IOPS proved to be a cost-effective choice. FSx for OpenZFS also showed good results, especially for speeding up horizontal scaling, although it\u2019s not compatible with the Erigon client.\n\nOur recommended configurations vary based on the node\u2019s role, whether it\u2019s a sync node or an RPC node serving dApps. The suggested instance types and EBS volumes provide a good balance between performance and cost-effectiveness, enabling nodes to synchronize with the network and handle RPC requests efficiently.\n\nAs the Ethereum ecosystem continues to evolve rapidly, it\u2019s essential to stay informed about new developments and updates that may impact node configurations in the future. Regular monitoring and evaluation of performance and cost-efficiency are necessary to ensure optimal node operation and maintain a reliable service for the Ethereum network and dApps.

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nBitstamp to terminate staking service in the US on September 25.\n\nStaking is viewed as an unregistered security within SEC crypto crackdown.\n\nCryptocurrency exchange Bitstamp will stop offering Ethereum (ETH) staking services to users in the United States in a month.\n\n\u201cCustomers will continue earning staking rewards up until September 25, 2023, and after that, all staked assets will be unstaked. Rewards, along with the principal, will be credited to users\u2019 main Bitstamp account balances,\u201d explained Bobby Zagotta, U.S. CEO and global CFO at Bitstamp.\n\nZagotta also added it could take a few days for the modifications to appear on users\u2019 balances.\n\nIn addition, Bitstamp stated that customers\u2019 primary account balances would be rewarded with incentives such as the initial amount deposited. It also said that, depending on the state of the network, this process could take several days.\n\nChanges Linked to Regulatory Pressures\n\nBitstamp website states that a 15% commission is applied to all staking payouts \u2013 the monthly return for staking Ethereum is 4.50%; in contrast, the monthly payout for staking Algorand is 1.60%.\n\nWith thIS change, the us will now join Canada, Japan, Singapore, and the UK in not offering Bitstamp staking services.\n\nBitstamp choice was made in response to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) moves to examine websites providing staking services.\n\nIn litigation SEC launched against cryptocurrency businesses in June, it asserted that staking services provided by Coinbase and Binance constitute securities.\n\nAs part of a $30 million settlement , US regulator also ordered Kraken to stop providing its staking service in the US in February. Any of those activities might have had an impact on Bitstamp\u2019s choice to disable Ethereum staking for users in the States.\n\nBitstamp To Delist 7 American Tokens\n\nIn response to changes in American regulation, Bitstamp earlier announced on August 8 that it will stop trading seven cryptocurrency coins in the United States.\n\nUpdate for our US users \ud83d\udce2 Starting August 29: AXS, CHZ, MANA, MATIC, NEAR, SAND, and SOL trading will be halted after evaluating recent market developments. Execute any open trades. Holding and withdrawing tokens afterwards will be unaffected. More info:\u2026 \u2014 Bitstamp (@Bitstamp) August 8, 2023\n\nAccording to recent legal developments in the US, at least seven alternative currencies would no longer be available in the nation. Solana, Decentraland, Polygon, Near, Axie Infinity, Chiliz (CHZ), Chiliz (CHZ), and The Sandbox were interested by this move.\n\nSEC declared all seven tokens will be unregistered securities in June as part of its legal actions against cryptocurrency exchanges Binance and Coinbase, despite a lack of explanation for the suspension of trade.\n\nThe decision appeared to be a response to the ongoing SEC lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase stated above, even though Bitstamp did not specifically reference the developments in question.\n\nBy August 29, 2023, US customers will not be able to trade these coins.\n\nETH Staking In the Rise\n\nDespite last week crypto market collapse, on-chain data for the second-largest digital asset globally indicate a rising resilience.\n\nEven though there were worries that the Shanghai-Capella fork would have the opposite effect on price, it has merely boosted demand for ether (ETH). Instead, utility and demand have skyrocketed, as others correctly expected.\n\nTotal Value Staked for the asset has risen steadily, reflecting an underlying demand. According to data , the amount increased from 26.3 million ETH to 27.8 million, up by 5.7% on a monthly basis.\n\nInvestors are encouraged to pay less attention to short-term volatility as a result of the expansion of liquid staking tokens (LSTs).\n\nEther Mostly Referred to As a Commodity\n\nThe native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, Ether, is second in terms of market capitalization to Bitcoin.\n\nWhether to classify ETH as a security or a commodity is a key concern in the current regulatory landscape in the U.S.\n\nWhile SEC Chair, Gary Gensler, stated at an April hearing that Bitcoin was a commodity but didn\u2019t say whether ETH could be classified as a security, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has consistently referred to Ether as a commodity."

        "content": "PancakeSwap v3, a popular multi-chain DeFi exchange, announced its launch on the Ethereum layer 2 network Linea on Aug. 24.\n\nThe exchange\u2019s deployment on Linea introduces two new features. The first is improved capital efficiency, which will allow liquidity providers to focus their capital within specific price ranges where maximum trading occurs. This feature is intended to help participants increase their earnings. PancakeSwap claims that liquidity providers can achieve a capital multiplier up to 4000 times greater on v3 than v2.\n\nThe second feature that Linea will facilitate is enhanced trading features. PancakeSwap said the launch will provide multi-tier fee structures, allowing traders to access low trading fees. Fee tiers will range from 0.01% to 1%, and users will be able to choose a fee structure that is best for their trading activities and liquidity pool of choice.\n\nPancakeSwap also advertised a promotional activity called \u201cTraverse the Treasure Islands\u201d and said users can earn rewards by participating in activities. This campaign presents an opportunity to earn loyalty points and gain access to commemorative NFTs, further indicating the platform\u2019s engagement with its community.\n\nPancakeSwap added that if it receives Linea incentives, it will partially distribute those rewards to stakeholders who stake its CAKE token and other project contributors and community members. However, it said Linea has not announced any such rewards.\n\nThough today\u2019s announcement marks its mainnet launch, PancakeSwap noted that it previously deployed on Linea as a testnet ecosystem partner.\n\nProjects populate DeFi ecosystem\n\nLinea is a layer 2 network for Ethereum. Like most layer 2 networks, it intends to improve transaction efficiency by increasing transaction speeds and reducing fees. The platform is developed by ConsenSys and was formerly known as ConsenSys zkEVM.\n\nPancakeSwap itself is available on several different blockchain networks. The project originated on Binance Smart Chain (now known as BNB Chain). Other supported networks include Ethereum, Aptos, Polygon zkEVM, zkSync Era, and Arbitrum. PancakeSwap v3 went live on BNB Chain and Ethereum in April 2023.\n\nPancakeSwap is currently the 13th largest DeFi platform by total value locked (TVL), with $1.4 billion of crypto locked by users at present. Its native token (CAKE) is among the 130 largest cryptocurrencies and has a market cap of $273 million."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Could See \u201cLiftoff\u201d if It\u2019s Able to Clear One Crucial Level - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum price is recovering above the $1,650 resistance against the US Dollar. ETH could rise further if there is a clear move above the $1,700 resistance.\n\nEthereum is moving higher above the $1,650 and $1,660 levels.\n\nThe price is trading above $1,670 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance near $1,660 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could continue to rise if it clears the $1,700 and $1,720 resistance levels.\n\nEthereum Price Eyes Steady Recovery\n\nEthereum\u2019s price formed a support base above the $1,580 and $1,600 levels. ETH started a recovery wave and was able to rise above the $1,650 resistance, like Bitcoin.\n\nThere was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance near $1,660 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The pair is now struggling to clear the $1,700 resistance zone. A high is formed near $1,698 and the price is consolidating gains.\n\nEther is trading above $1,670 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. It is also near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent increase from the $1,580 swing low to the $1,698 high.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nOn the upside, the price might face resistance near the $1,700 level. The next resistance is near the $1,720 zone. A successful close above the $1,700 and $1,720 levels could start a fresh lift-off. The next major resistance is near the $1,780 level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $1,820 resistance.\n\nAnother Drop in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,700 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,670 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThe first major support is near the $1,550 zone. The next key support is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent increase from the $1,580 swing low to the $1,698 high at $1,640. If there is a downside break below $1,640, there could be more losses. The next major support is near the $1,600 support level. Any more losses might send the price toward the $1,580 level or even to a new low below $1,550.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,640\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,700\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "A closely followed crypto strategist believes that Ethereum (ETH) has already carved a bear market bottom.\n\nPseudonymous analyst Credible Crypto tells his 345,900 followers on the social media platform X that Ethereum has likely printed a price floor after last week\u2019s marketwide correction.\n\nAccording to the trader, he expects Ethereum to break out from an ascending triangle pattern as long as ETH\u2019s immediate support at around $1,440 holds.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s worth pointing out that on this latest dip, we hit the high timeframe zone that I previously said would be a \u2018fantastic buy\u2019 if we get there back in May, and my opinion on that hasn\u2019t changed.\n\nIf I\u2019m right about BTC, then I\u2019m likely right about ETH too, and that green zone below us was likely our bottom.\n\nAs long as it holds, I expect this ascending triangle-like structure to actually play out.\u201d\n\nLooking at the trader\u2019s chart, he appears to predict that Ethereum will consolidate between $1,600 and $2,000 for the rest of the year before igniting a parabolic surge in early 2024.\n\nCredible Crypto holds the contrarian view that Bitcoin (BTC) will print a new all-time high before this year expires.

        "content": "Similarities Between Bitcoin and Ethereum: A Comprehensive Comparison\n\n\u200dCryptocurrencies have revolutionized the financial landscape, and two of the most prominent players in this space are Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nWhile they have their unique characteristics, they also share several similarities.\n\nIn this article, we will explore the similarities between Bitcoin and Ethereum, shedding light on their decentralized nature, blockchain technology, digital currencies, limited supply, and cryptographic protocols.\n\nBy understanding these similarities, newcomers and enthusiasts alike can gain a deeper understanding of how these giants differ from one another.\n\nAlso read: Is Ether the Same as Ethereum?\n\nSimilarities Between Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nDecentralization: The Backbone of Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum operate on a peer-to-peer network without the need for a central authority or intermediary.\n\nThey are decentralized, meaning that they are not controlled by any government, bank, or financial institution.\n\nThis decentralized nature is one of the core principles of cryptocurrencies, as it ensures that no single entity has control over the network.\n\nBoth Bitcoin and Ethereum rely on a network of nodes spread across the globe to validate and record transactions.\n\nBlockchain Technology: Similarities Between Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nBoth Bitcoin and Ethereum utilize blockchain technology to maintain a transparent and immutable ledger of transactions.\n\nThe blockchain serves as a public record that verifies and stores every transaction made on the network.\n\nThis technology ensures the integrity and security of the network by eliminating the need for a central authority to validate transactions.\n\nInstead, a consensus mechanism involves a network of nodes validating transactions.\n\nSource: Inventiva\n\nCryptographic Protocols: Ensuring Security and Authenticity\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum employ cryptographic protocols to secure their networks and ensure the validity and authenticity of transactions.\n\nThese protocols use advanced mathematical algorithms to encrypt and verify transactions, making them secure and resistant to tampering.\n\nCryptographic protocols play a crucial role in maintaining the trust and security of both Bitcoin and Ethereum networks.\n\nAlso read: Will Dogecoin realistically sponsor this Formula 1 team?\n\nDigital Currencies: The Future of Transactions\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are digital currencies that exist solely in a digital form.\n\nThey can be used to buy goods and services, making them a viable alternative to traditional currencies. Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency to gain widespread recognition, and it paved the way for the emergence of other digital currencies, including Ethereum.\n\nBoth Bitcoin and Ethereum offer fast and secure transactions, making them attractive options for individuals and businesses alike.\n\nLimited Supply: Scarcity and Value\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum have a limited supply, which adds to their value and scarcity.\n\nBitcoin has a maximum supply hard cap of 21 million coins, while Ethereum does not have a hard limit but has a maximum limit of 18 million new Ethereum tokens per year.\n\nThis limited supply guarantees the preservation of these cryptocurrencies\u2019 value over time, much like the valuation of precious metals such as gold and silver.\n\nName Recognition and Reach\n\nSource: CNN\n\nWhen it comes to name recognition and reach, no other cryptocurrencies come close to Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nAs the two most valuable cryptocurrencies, they receive vastly more exposure than others, and their respective communities are also growing rapidly.\n\nBitcoin, created by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto, has become synonymous with the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nEthereum, created by Vitalik Buterin, has gained significant traction as a platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts.\n\nCommunity Growth and Focus\n\nThe communities surrounding Bitcoin and Ethereum have distinct focuses and goals.\n\nThe Bitcoin community is primarily focused on financial privacy, autonomy, and cutting out the middleman. Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized nature and limited supply align with the community\u2019s desire for independence from traditional financial systems.\n\nConversely, the Ethereum community concentrates on crafting a decentralized, open-source platform that developers can use to construct applications.\n\nEthereum\u2019s smart contract functionality and programmability make it an attractive option for developers seeking to create innovative solutions.\n\nTransaction Speed: A Comparison\n\nTransaction speed is an important factor to consider when comparing cryptocurrencies. Ethereum is generally faster than Bitcoin in terms of transaction speed.\n\nThe Ethereum network can handle up to 15 transactions per second, while Bitcoin can only handle up to 5.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that Ethereum\u2019s faster speed comes at the cost of higher fees, as the increased transaction throughput puts additional strain on the network.\n\nProgramming Language: Turing-Complete vs. Limited Scripting\n\nEthereum and Bitcoin differ in terms of their programming languages.\n\nEthereum uses a Turing-complete programming language, allowing developers to write any program on the Ethereum network. This flexibility enables the creation of complex decentralized applications and smart contracts.\n\nIn contrast, Bitcoin uses a limited scripting language primarily used for simple transactions. While Bitcoin\u2019s scripting language is less versatile, it is sufficient for its intended use as a digital currency.\n\nCreator: Satoshi Nakamoto vs. Vitalik Buterin\n\nSource: Bitcoin.com\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum have distinct creators with different levels of visibility.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto, an individual or group using a pseudonym, brought Bitcoin into existence, and their actual identity remains undisclosed.\n\nNakamoto\u2019s invention of Bitcoin revolutionized the financial industry and laid the foundation for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nEthereum, on the other hand, was created by Vitalik Buterin, a well-known figure in the cryptocurrency community. Buterin\u2019s vision for Ethereum as a decentralized platform for applications has garnered significant attention and support.\n\nConclusion: Similarities Between Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nIn conclusion, Bitcoin and Ethereum are both valuable cryptocurrencies with unique features and use cases. While they share similarities such as decentralization, blockchain technology, and limited supply, their differences in technology, use cases, and communities set them apart.\n\nPeople primarily use Bitcoin to store value and exchange goods, while Ethereum functions as a platform for creating decentralized applications and executing smart contracts.\n\nAs the cryptocurrency space continues to evolve, Bitcoin and Ethereum will continue to play essential roles in driving innovation and adoption.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in investing in Bitcoin or Ethereum, it\u2019s important to research and understand the risks involved.\n\nCryptocurrencies are highly volatile and can experience significant price fluctuations. It\u2019s advisable to consult with a financial advisor or do thorough research before making any investment decisions."

        "content": "There\u2019s three ways to buy Ethereum with Paypal in 2023. If you\u2019re in the United States, you can buy ETH directly on the PayPal platform. Otherwise, you can use PayPal to buy Ethereum on a cryptocurrency exchange, or use eToro.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll show you the three methods of buying Ethereum with PayPal, and explain the pros and cons of each method. Let\u2019s get started.\n\nMethod 1: Buy Ethereum directly on PayPal\n\nThe most straightforward way to buy Ethereum with PayPal is to simply buy ETH on the PayPal app directly. However, please keep in mind that this feature is only available for customers in the United States and United States Territories (excluding Hawaii).\n\nPayPal made waves back in 2020 when it first offered its customers to buy crypto directly on the PayPal platform. PayPal\u2019s selection of cryptocurrencies is quite limited but it does include Ethereum, which is the second-largest cryptocurrency on the market.\n\nThe fees for buying Ethereum directly on PayPal depend on how much ETH you\u2019re buying. In addition to the fee, PayPal also charges a spread on each cryptocurrency purchase or sale. You\u2019ll be informed about all the additional costs that will apply before you buy or sell a cryptocurrency on PayPal. Here\u2019s a breakdown of PayPal\u2019s crypto fees as of August 2023:\n\nValue of purchased or sold crypto Fee $1 - $4.99 $0.49 $5 - $24.99 $0.99 $25 - $74.99 $1.99 $75 - $200 $2.49 $200.01 - $1,000 1.8% $1,000.01 and above 1.5%\n\nThese fees are quite high compared to most cryptocurrency exchanges. However, if you already have a PayPal account and don\u2019t want to create an account on a cryptocurrency exchange, the convenience might be worth the higher fees.\n\nAfter you buy Ethereum on PayPal, you can hold it, sell it, use it to make purchases, send it to another user with a PayPal account, or send it to an external cryptocurrency wallet.\n\nMethod 2: Buy Ethereum with PayPal on a crypto exchange\n\nThe two cryptocurrency exchanges where you can buy Ethereum with PayPal are Coinbase and Bitstamp. Both are considered as very safe and reliable exchanges, but please keep in mind that they charge substantial fees on crypto purchases made via PayPal.\n\nCoinbase\n\nCoinbase is a solid cryptocurrency exchange to use if you are looking to buy crypto with PayPal, especially if you\u2019re based in the United States. If you\u2019re a United States user, you can deposit funds to your Coinbase account via PayPal. Otherwise, you can still buy cryptocurrency with PayPal on Coinbase, but you won\u2019t be able to make a deposit.\n\nIt\u2019s worth keeping in mind that Coinbase also gives users the option to cash out to their PayPal account.\n\nIn order to use PayPal with Coinbase, go to your account\u2019s \u201cSettings\u201d section and then select \u201cPayment Methods\u201d. The next step is to select \u201cLink a New Account\u201d and choose PayPal from the list of payment options. You will then be guided through the process of linking your Coinbase account with your PayPal account.\n\nHowever, using PayPal to buy Ethereum on Coinbase comes with considerable fees. If you\u2019re directly purchasing crypto on Coinbase with PayPal, the transaction is subject to a 3.99% fee. Meanwhile, USD deposits via PayPal to Coinbase come with a 2.5% fee.\n\nFor more information about using PayPal with Coinbase, please refer to the exchange\u2019s PayPal FAQ.\n\nBuy Ethereum on Coinbase\n\nBitstamp\n\nBitstamp is one of the most trusted cryptocurrency exchanges in the market, as it has been operating successfully since 2011. In 2022, Bitstamp added support for PayPal as a payment method, which makes it possible for their customers to buy Ethereum with PayPal.\n\nAfter creating an account on Bitstamp, you\u2019ll need to link your PayPal account to Bitstamp. When making a cryptocurrency purchase, choose PayPal as your payment method. Then, you will be redirected to the PayPal website where you will be able to authorize linking your PayPal account and Bitstamp.\n\nThen, you will be able to buy any cryptocurrency listed on Bitstamp using your PayPal account. However, you must keep in mind that you will be charged a considerable 4% fee on your purchase when buying crypto on Bitstamp with PayPal. You can buy up to $2,500 worth of crypto with PayPal on Bitstamp per day, or $20,000 per month.\n\nBuy Ethereum on Bitstamp\n\nMethod 3: Buy Ethereum with PayPal on eToro\n\neToro is a very popular trading platform where users can trade stocks, commodities, forex markets, and also cryptocurrencies. eToro supports PayPal deposits, so you can fund your account with PayPal and then use the balance to purchase Ethereum.\n\nWhen it comes to buying cryptocurrency on eToro, it\u2019s important to mention one caveat. You cannot directly withdraw cryptocurrency to an external wallet of your choice, as you have to first withdraw the coins to the eToro Money crypto wallet.\n\neToro charges a fee when transferring crypto from the main eToro platform to the eToro Money wallet. The fee is 2% of the value of the transferred cryptocurrency. The minimum fee you\u2019ll be paying is $1, but it won\u2019t exceed $100 regardless of how much crypto you\u2019re transferring. Of course, you\u2019ll also have to pay the fee that\u2019s required by the blockchain network you\u2019ll be transferring your crypto on.\n\nBuy Ethereum on eToro\n\nThe bottom line\n\nIt\u2019s hard to recommend PayPal as a good method for buying Ethereum because you will likely be paying a significant amount in fees. Probably the best option to buy Ethereum with PayPal is to buy it on the PayPal platform directly, provided that you live in a country where this feature is supported.\n\nTheoretically, you could also buy Ethereum with PayPal using a P2P crypto marketplace that lists Ethereum and allows sellers to use PayPal as a payment method. However, we haven\u2019t been able to find any such examples at the moment except for Bybit\u2019s P2P marketplace, where there wasn\u2019t a single ETH seller that accepted PayPal at the time of writing this article.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for more efficient ways of investing in ETH, make sure to check out our full guide on how to buy Ethereum.\n\nFAQ\n\nHow to buy Ethereum with PayPal?\n\nIf you live in the United States, you can buy Ethereum directly on the PayPal platform. Otherwise, you can use a cryptocurrency exchange that accepts PayPal as a payment method \u2014 examples include Coinbase and Bitstamp. The third option is to use PayPal to make a deposit on eToro and buy ETH there."

The monthly reward rate for staking ETH on the exchange is 4.50%; by comparison, the monthly reward for staking Algorand (ALGO) is 1.60%. With the move, the U.S. joins other countries where Bitstamp staking services aren't available, including Canada, Japan, Singapore and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe decision appears to be related to recent legal developments in the United States. In early August, Bitstamp announced at least seven altcoins would no longer be offered in the country. They were Axie Infinity (AXS), Chiliz (CHZ), Decentraland (MANA), Polygon (MATIC), Near (NEAR), The Sandbox (SAND) and Solana (SOL). While the company didn\u2019t specify why it suspended trading, all seven tokens were deemed unregistered securities by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in June as part of its lawsuits against crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase.\n\nUpdate for our US users\n\n\n\nStarting August 29: AXS, CHZ, MANA, MATIC, NEAR, SAND, and SOL trading will be halted after evaluating recent market developments.\n\n\n\nExecute any open trades. Holding and withdrawing tokens afterwards will be unaffected.\n\n\n\nMore info:\u2026 \u2014 Bitstamp (@Bitstamp) August 8, 2023\n\nEther is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain and the second largest by market cap behind Bitcoin (BTC). A central issue surrounding the ongoing regulatory environment in the U.S. relates to whether ETH could be classified as a commodity or a security. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has repeatedly called Ether a commodity, while SEC Chair Gary Gensler said at a hearing in April that Bitcoin was a commodity but would not specify whether ETH should be deemed a security.\n\nMagazine: Crypto regulation \u2014 Does SEC Chair Gary Gensler have the final say?"

        "content": "Ethereum price is facing many hurdles below the $1,700 resistance against the US Dollar. ETH could extend its decline below the $1,580 and $1,550 levels.\n\nEthereum is still struggling to recover above the $1,700 and $1,720 levels.\n\nThe price is trading below $1,680 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,665 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could start another decline if it breaks the $1,580 support in the near term.\n\nEthereum Price Faces Uphill Task\n\nEthereum\u2019s price failed to climb above the $1,700 resistance zone. ETH started a fresh decline below the $1,650 and $1,620 levels, similar to Bitcoin.\n\nThe price even spiked below the $1,600 support and tested $1,580. A low was formed near $1,580 and the price is now attempting a fresh recovery. There was a move above the $1,600 level. The price is now testing the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,693 swing high to the $1,580 low.\n\nEther is also trading below $1,680 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Besides, there is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,665 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nOn the upside, the price might face resistance near the $1,650 level. It is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,693 swing high to the $1,580 low. The next resistance is near $1,665 or the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average or the trend line.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe main barrier is still near the $1,700 zone. A close above the $1,700 level could start a decent increase in the near term. The next major resistance is near the $1,750 level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $1,820 resistance.\n\nAnother Drop in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,665 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,600 level.\n\nThe first major support is near the $1,580 zone. If there is a downside break below $1,580, there could be more losses. The next major support is near the $1,550 support level. Any more losses might send the price toward the $1,520 level or even to a new low below $1,500.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,580\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,665\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Crypto exchange Bitstamp will end Ethereum (ETH) staking services for U.S. customers within a month, according to a statement on Aug. 23.\n\nThe company said:\n\n\u201cCustomers will continue earning staking rewards up until [Sept.] 25, 2023, and after that, all staked assets will be unstaked.\u201d\n\nBitstamp added that rewards and principal (i.e., the original amount deposited) would be credited to users\u2019 primary account balances. The company also suggested that this process could take multiple days and may be affected by network conditions.\n\nThe alteration in services seems to leave Bitstamp\u2019s U.S. users without any staking options. Though the platform also offers Algorand (ALGO) staking, that feature is already unavailable in the United States. Furthermore, Ethereum and Algorand staking are currently unavailable in Canada, Japan, Singapore, and the U.K.\n\nThe decision comes in the aftermath of actions by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has recently scrutinized platforms offering staking services.\n\nMost notably, the securities regulator claimed that staking services offered by Coinbase and Binance are securities in lawsuits that it filed against each crypto company in June. The SEC also compelled Kraken to stop offering its staking service in the U.S. as part of a $30 million settlement in February. Any of those actions may have influenced Bitstamp\u2019s decision to remove the option from U.S. users.\n\nBitstamp to delist seven U.S. tokens\n\nBitstamp previously said on Aug. 8 that it would halt trading for seven cryptocurrency tokens in the U.S. due to regulatory developments in the country.\n\nThough Bitstamp did not explicitly name the developments in question, the decision seemed to be a reaction to the ongoing SEC cases against Binance and Coinbase mentioned above. Those cases classified the implicated tokens as securities.\n\nThe affected tokens are set to be removed from U.S. users\u2019 trading options by Aug. 29, 2023.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "Why data availability sampling matters for blockchain scaling - Blockworks",
        "content": "On-chain data availability has become an increasingly common topic as Ethereum continues to scale.\n\nToday, Ethereum developers are looking at where and how data should be stored on blockchain networks as they work towards resolving the so-called blockchain trilemma, referring to the tradeoffs between security, scalability and decentralization.\n\nIn crypto, data availability refers to the concept that data that is stored on a network is accessible and retrievable by all network participants.\n\nOn Ethereum layer-1, the network\u2019s nodes download all the data in each block, making it difficult for invalid transactions to be executed.\n\nAlthough this can guarantee security, this process can be relatively inefficient \u2014 asking a network node to verify and store all data in a block can drastically reduce throughput and hinder blockchain scalability.\n\nEthereum layer-2 scaling solutions are designed to resolve this problem.\n\nOne popular solution today is the optimistic rollup, such as Arbitrum and Optimism. Optimistic rollups are \u201coptimistic\u201d in nature as they assume transactions are valid until proven otherwise.\n\nMost rollups today only have one single sequencer, meaning there is a centralization risk, Anurag Arjun, co-founder of modular blockchain Avail, told Blockworks.\n\nThis is not a major problem at present, as rollup solutions must put the raw transaction data on Ethereum using something called calldata \u2014 the cheapest form of storage on Ethereum today, as Arjun notes.\n\nOnce a calldata is submitted to Ethereum mainnet, anyone can challenge whether or not it is accurate within a set period of time, according to Neel Somani, the founder of blockchain scaling solution Eclipse.\n\nIf no one challenges the validity of the rollup, it will be accepted on Ethereum once the period of time is up.\n\nThe problem, Somani notes, is how someone can then prove that a transaction was executed inaccurately if they don\u2019t have the data.\n\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t tell you what I executed, there\u2019s no way for you to possibly prove that it is wrong, so you need to know exactly what I executed in order to fix that,\u201d Somani said. \u201cSo all blockchains must prove data availability in some way, shape or form.\u201d\n\nData availability sampling\n\nAs all blockchains must prove data availability, it can be inefficient to download a full block onto a network, which again invokes the initial data availability problem.\n\n\u201cSo as someone who doesn\u2019t want to download the full block, I still want the confidence that the information on the block is not being withheld,\u201d Somani said.\n\nThe solution, according to Somani, is the use of data availability sampling to gain confidence that the block is actually there.\n\nData availability sampling involves sampling random parts of the block to obtain arbitrarily high confidence that the block is there, Somani explains.\n\nThis technology utilizes polynomials \u2014 a mathematical expression comprising variables, coefficients and exponentiation \u2014 to model relationships between variables in a block.\n\nA common misinterpretation of data availability sampling is that if you sample half the block, you only gain 50% confidence that the information in the block is accurate, Somani said. This isn\u2019t true, he explains, because as with data availability sampling, users must make sure that they have enough points to recover the original polynomial.\n\nProjects like Celestia and Avail are currently building out data availability sampling solutions.\n\n\u201cWhat we sincerely believe is that every base layer is going to be a data availability layer,\u201d Arjun told Blockworks. \u201cThe main directional fight that we are having is wanting to scale data availability at the base layer, and have execution and roll up on the second layer.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

As a result, he thinks an attractive accumulation range for Ethereum will be between $400 and $600.\n\nAccording to Cowen, it is highly probable that ETH will conclude the year with a lower value than its initial price, following the pattern of 2019 when it began at $1,200.\n\nETH is trading at $1,635 at time of writing.

        "title": "This is The Next Target for ETH If the Drop Continues (Ethereum Price Analysis) - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "After a prolonged period of tranquil price activity near the critical level of $1.8K, there has been a significant and rapid downturn at ETH following a notable rejection. This sudden cascade has caused the price to drop below the 100-day and 200-day moving averages (MAs), indicating a bearish signal for the ETH market.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nLooking at the daily chart, a prolonged phase of quiet price action near the $1.8K resistance level led to a sharp downward movement, breaching below the 100-day and 200-day moving averages positioned around $1,835 and $1,800, respectively. The market is typically considered to be in a bearish phase when the price resides beneath the 200-day moving average line, which is widely recognized as a pivotal trend indicator.\n\nThe short-term support at $1,650 is currently managing to hold the price, potentially setting the stage for a bullish rebound and forming a pullback. However, the recent decline has changed the market structure to mostly bearish, increasing the likelihood of a retest of the $1,400 level in the upcoming weeks.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nLooking at the 4-hour timeframe, it becomes evident that the price has breached the static support at $1.8K, leading to a rapid and forceful downward move. This breakdown has deepened the decline, with a prominent wick piercing through the $1,650 level.\n\nNevertheless, the mentioned support level has thus far effectively held the price, and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator has rebounded from the oversold zone, indicating the potential for a short-term consolidation phase.\n\nConsidering the recent price action, it appears likely that a consolidation period will develop between the support at $1,650 and the resistance around $1.8K in the mid-term. This scenario is anticipated before sellers potentially make another concerted push to drive the price to lower levels.\n\nOn-chain Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nAnalyzing the fund holding metric, the chart indicates a significant trend shift for Ethereum since June 2022. While Bitcoin has experienced intermittent periods of price upticks accompanied by various fund distribution zones, Ethereum has witnessed a consistent downtrend in fund holdings and distributions during this period.\n\nInterpreting this chart, it becomes clear that there is a notable decline in the interest of asset management funds (such as ETFs and trusts) to indirectly invest in Ethereum. This contrasts with Bitcoin, where, despite fluctuations, specific periods of increased demand and fund distribution can be identified.\n\nThe consequence of this trend is a gradual reduction in the funds\u2019 market participation, leading to diminished trading liquidity and overall interest in Ethereum. For the market to experience a sustainable price upswing, a steady rise in investment interest from these funds is crucial.\n\nAs of now, this decline in fund engagement necessitates a cautious approach, particularly when viewed in conjunction with other data points. Consistently tracking the trends of this indicator can potentially provide valuable insights into determining the future trajectory of the Ethereum market."

V\n\nBase was unveiled by Coinbase in February of this year as an Ethereum L2 chain built in collaboration with Optimism. Layer 2 networks like Base operate on top of an underlying blockchain, in this case, Ethereum, to offer improved scalability, faster transaction speeds, and reduced gas fees, while maintaining the same level of security and decentralization as the mainnet.\n\nIt was designed to be a developer-friendly platform, offering seamless integration with Coinbase's products, users, and tools.\n\nBase boasts a robust line-up of applications like BaseSwap, SwapBased, and Stargate, contributing to its $193.41 million TVL. Meanwhile, Cardano has its own set of top-performing dApps like Minswap, Indigo, and Liqwid.\n\nIt is worth noting that Cardano's positioning as a \"zombie chain\" by some advocates of competing networks doesn't take into account its broader objectives and ongoing developments."

        "content": "Key Takeaways The ethOS phone supports EVM chains and layer 2s.\n\nSolana's Saga phone saw a 40% price cut this month.\n\nShare this article URL Copied\n\nThe ethOS phone, the first mobile device to support EVM-based chains and layer 2s, has made waves in the Ethereum community after selling out its pre-sale in less than 24 hours. This news comes weeks after another web3 mobile phone, Solana\u2019s Saga, had its price slashed by 40%.\n\nThe ethOS phone is a revamped version of the Android-based Google Pixel 7a running on the Ethereum-native mobile operating system, ethOS. This phone runs a light Ethereum client, allowing it to verify blocks on its own and interact with Ethereum without relying on centralized infrastructure like Infura or Alchemy.\n\nThe ethOS phone comes with a built-in wallet and offers smooth compatibility with other wallets. And while the Pixel 7a is not a hardware wallet itself, it has a special security chip, known as a secure enclave, designed to safely store and encrypt private keys.\n\nOnly 50 phones were available during the pre-sale phase. Interested buyers had to mint an ethOS NFT and burn it to claim their phone. Now, these NFTs are now popping up on the NFT marketplace OpenSea, with some selling for 3 ETH, or roughly $5,000. For perspective, a regular Google Pixel 7A retails for $499 in the U.S.\n\nWhile the ethOS phone seems to be riding a wave of early success, the Solana Saga phone\u2019s sales haven\u2019t lived up to expectations. Since its April 2023 launch, only 2,120 units have been sold, according to data from FlipsideCrypto.\n\nIn a bid to boost sales, Solana Mobile slashed the price of the Saga phone from $1,000 to $599 this month.\n\nWith the ethOS phone\u2019s regular orders set to start this fall and Solana Saga looking to revamp its sales strategy, the competition in the mobile web3 space is bound to intensify."

Meanwhile, older investors tend to be more conservative.\n\nYou might also like: XRP is the leading altcoin in South Korea, report reveals\n\nIt was observed that South Korea\u2019s Gen Z invested more in XRP than BTC and ETH, with the former\u2019s investment being 3.2% higher than the latter. At the same time, they chose periphery altcoins, for instance, Fellaz (FLZ) and Mines of Dalarnia (DAR), which were listed on Bithumb on March 31 and Jan. 27, respectively.\n\nXRP is also preferred by investors in their 30s, 40s, 50s, and 60s. However, the coin is mostly accumulated by Gen Zs and those in their 40s prefer ETH and BTC, meaning that they could be more risk averse. Even so, investors in their 30s have the highest percentage of BTC and ETH investments.\n\nCommenting on the investment choice of people within the 20s age group, Wonderframe CEO Kim Dong-hwan, a domestic expert on virtual assets, said younger investors appear to be targeting short-term gains rather than holding on for longer.\n\nSouth Korea recently launched a special investigations unit to combat crypto-related crimes in the country. The new team will focus on highly volatile coins since it is widely believed that they are ideal for money laundering, tax evasion, illicit trading, and other criminal activities.\n\nRead more: South Korea to launch second phase of virtual asset legislation\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

When he's not analyzing the markets, Sohrab indulges in his hobbies of graphic design, minimal design or listening to his favorite hip-hop tunes.\n\nEthereum, like many altcoins, began the week in the red, experiencing a significant downtrend. The breach of its upward trendline added to the challenges, with the coin\u2019s price showing resilience above the crucial $1600 support level. However, concerns have arisen as the price could potentially decline by 27% to $1,200, with another support at $1,366 likely to slow the fall.\n\nTechnical indicators are aligned with this bearish sentiment. The higher EMA 100 crossed beneath the lower EMA 50, a bearish signal. The daily chart further reveals a drop below $1,750 and the vital 200-day moving average at $1,800.\n\nAnalysts are expressing worries about ETH\u2019s price trajectory, drawing parallels to a similar situation in 2019. A crypto analyst, Benjamin Cowen, highlighted the importance of a broken support line indicated by the Bull Market Support Band indicator. This scenario, reminiscent of four years ago, saw a 48% decline in ETH value over six months, followed by a gradual recovery.\n\nIn 2019, #ETH fell below its Bull Market Support Band in July/August, just as it has in 2023. pic.twitter.com/36v6BEDch1 \u2014 Benjamin Cowen (@intocryptoverse) August 22, 2023\n\nSimilarly, crypto analyst Ali Martinez foresees a significant drop if Ethereum falls below $1,550, projecting a 37% to 45% decrease to $1,000.\n\nDespite the uncertainty, Ethereum\u2019s outlook remains mixed. Vitalik Buterin\u2019s transfer of $1 million worth of ETH to Coinbase and the Ethereum Investment Fund (ETF) may influence the market. The coin\u2019s advanced mechanism system also holds potential. This leaves the market divided between bearish and bullish sentiments, while ETH is currently trading at $1,666."

Unless the MACD line flips above the signal line in blue, the path with the least resistance would remain downward.\n\nAdding credibility to the bearish outlook is the Money Flow Index, which measures the outflow and inflow volume of money in ETH markets. Since the beginning of July, outflow volume has significantly surpassed inflow volume.\n\nA recent report by CoinShares found that Ethereum was the second among the digital assets investment products that saw the highest outflows last week compared to the week before.\n\nCrypto analyst @ali_charts said that \u201clarge holders of Ethereum also called whales, have been \u201creshuffling since February. About 112 whales have adjusted their portfolios, either selling or redistributing their ETH.\u201d\n\nUntil whales throw their full weight behind ETH, the token may continue to struggle to sustain the uptrend, especially above $2,000.\n\nLarge #Ethereum holders with 10,000+ $ETH have been reshuffling since February.

        "content": "Ethereum whale liquidation amidst market volatility raised concerns about dwindling engagement.\n\nDespite whale disinterest, Ethereum saw a surge in non-zero addresses, indicating retail investors\u2019 continued interest.\n\nIn the wake of a significant Bitcoin correction that reverberated through the cryptocurrency market over the past few days, causing price fluctuations across various coins, Ethereum [ETH] also experienced notable impacts.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nDue to these factors, whales started to sell large portions of their ETH.\n\nAccording to Lookonchain, a sizeable whale liquidated a 10,600 ETH valued at $17.2 million, at a price point of $1,622. This transaction incurred a loss of $2.9 million for the whale.\n\nA whale dumped 10,600 $ETH($17.2M) at a price of $1,622 7 hrs ago, with a loss of $2.9M. The whale traded a total of 18 tokens, and only 4 tokens were profitable, with a win rate of 22%.

The said whale ventured into 18 different token trades, with only four of them turning out to be profitable. This translated to a relatively modest success rate of 22%.\n\nAlthough the whale managed to accumulate a profit of $10.8 million from its Ethereum holdings, the situation is not entirely favorable. It also incurred a $3.6 million loss on PDT trades and an additional 1.3 million loss on $MPL trades.\n\nAs whale interest in Ethereum seems to wane, retail engagement tells a different tale. Illustrated by data from Glassnode, the number of non-zero addresses skyrocketed to an all-time high of 104,794,621.\n\nThis suggested sustained interest among individual users despite the ongoing market volatility.\n\nEthereum\u2019s market activity took center stage as the Exchange Inflow Volume surged to a 1-month peak of 9,630.147 ETH. This surge in inflows into exchanges could potentially reflect evolving market sentiment and highlight potential selling pressures.\n\nNevertheless, despite the increase in exchange inflows, Ethereum\u2019s network activity exhibited a divergent trajectory. Low gas usage indicated a reduction in general network activity, particularly in terms of smart contract interactions.\n\nIn contrast, the NFT sector seemed to maintain relatively stable activity levels.\n\nEthereum\u2019s current landscape\n\nDue to the behavior of whales and other factors, Ethereum\u2019s price shifted from $1820 to $1627 over the last week, indicating a noticeable decline. Network growth also experienced a slowdown, suggesting a possible decrease in new user onboarding.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum\u2019s transaction velocity exhibited a decline, hinting at less frequent trading activities.\n\nThe MVRV ratio, a metric used to gauge whether holders are experiencing profits or losses at a given time, offered a mixed perspective for Ethereum. The negative MVRV ratio implied that a significant portion of Ethereum holders were not realizing profits at press time."

And it\u2019s not just that. The Ethereum Mainnet may have also stepped back for Base to take the crown of increased activity and traction.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s OP\u2019s market cap in ETH terms\n\nHow has this come to be?\n\nFriends help Base trump the king\n\nNot to beat around the bush, Base\u2019s Transactions Per Second (TPS) surpassed that of Ethereum on 22 August, according to L2 Beat. As per the chart below, Ethereum\u2019s TPS was 12.05 while Base was 15.88.\n\nThe data revealed that Base\u2019s TPS had increased by 73.56% in the last 24 hours. Ethereum, on the other hand, decreased by 1.47% within the same timeframe. However, there was one particular reason that Base was able to achieve the milestone and its name\u2014 friend.tech.\n\nfriend.tech is a mobile application built on Coinbase L2. While it prides itself as the \u201cmarketplace for your friends,\u201d friend.tech provides an avenue for users to tokenize their identity. And, in turn, can sell shares of themselves to their followers or anyone interested in their community.\n\nDespite being launched only recently, friend.tech has experienced rapid growth and adoption. According to Dune Analytics, the application has amassed 97,316 unique traders. These traders have been involved in over one million transactions, valued at 39.195 ETH.\n\nBut besides Ethereum, Base has also pegged back the dominance of Arbitrum [ARB] and Optimism [OP]. Previously, AMBCrypto had reported how Base\u2019s emergence had disrupted the L2 flow.\n\nThe daily transactions reflect the usage rate of the network on a day-to-day basis. Therefore, the hike in transactions suggested optimism around Base. If it stays the same or increases further, the project might completely overtake its predecessors.\n\nMoreover, the integration of projects like Compound [COMP] and Aave [AAVE] also ensured that the \u201con-chain summer\u201d leader attracted more users. Now, the shift has extended to transactions.\n\nL2 standings have changed\n\nAccording to Delphi Digital, daily transactions on Base have outstripped those of Optimism and Arbitrum combined.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nAt the time of writing, over $253 million had been bridged on Base. Based on Dune\u2019s data, ETH led the cohort of assets that have appeared on the network. This was followed by stablecoins Tether [USDT] and DAI.\n\nAlso, Base\u2019s Total Value Locked (TVL) has risen to $185.32 million, DefiLlama revealed. The surge in TVL implies that participants have come to trust Base despite a series of scams appearing on the network before its public Mainnet launch."

        "content": "A recent Twitter update from Santiment blockchain analytical platform has revealed a surge on the Ethereum (ETH) network amidst recent price volatility conditions that caused the cryptocurrency to drop to the $1,650 dollar mark.\n\nThe Ethereum Whale Growth\n\nSpecifically, Santiment noted that the number of whales holding between 10 and 10,000 ETH has experienced a resurgence, climbing back up to a count of 355,000.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThis increase in the number of whales suggests that there has been a renewed interest among larger holders of Ethereum, potentially indicating their confidence in the asset even in the face of price fluctuations.\n\nAdditionally, the update points out that transactions involving sums of $100,000 and above have also witnessed a surge. This uptick in high-value transactions indicates that despite the volatile price conditions, there are entities willing to transact substantial amounts of Ethereum, a trend that is vital in sustaining the positive network outlook.\n\nIt is worth noting that Ethereum whales, entities holding significant amounts of the cryptocurrency, have always played a crucial role in shaping the market dynamics. These large holders can exert influence over prices through their trading decisions, impacting both short-term volatility and long-term trends.\n\nThis pattern suggests that despite the price turbulence, these well-capitalized players are finding opportunities in Ethereum\u2019s market. Such activity could be interpreted as a sign of institutional interest or strategic maneuvering by experienced market participants who see potential value in the asset at its current price level.\n\nImplications for the Future\n\nThe surge in Ethereum whale counts raises intriguing questions about the cryptocurrency\u2019s future trajectory.\n\nWhile the immediate implication is a potential increase in market stability due to the presence of strong-handed investors, it also underscores the evolving dynamics within the crypto space.\n\nAs Ethereum continues to develop its ecosystem with upgrades like Ethereum 2.0 and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) innovations, the role of these whales could have far-reaching implications on price discovery, network governance, and adoption.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum is changing hands at a price of $1,649, down by 2.19% in the past 24 hours."

        "content": "The Cosmos and Ethereum-focused scaling startup Dymension has achieved another key milestone on its roadmap with the launch of its incentivized testnet. With the launch, Cosmos and Ethereum developers can now start experimenting freely with one of the most promising Web3 scaling solutions to emerge thus far.\n\nDymension bills itself as a modular blockchain network and is aiming to build on the success of the Cosmos ecosystem by giving developers easy access to a unique rollup-based scaling solution it calls RollApps.\n\nRollApps are different from traditional monolithic blockchains such as Ethereum, which handle consensus, data availability, transaction execution and settlement on a single network. The monolithic design, although simple, has led to serious scaling problems, resulting in slow transaction processing and higher network fees for decentralized applications in DeFi, GameFi and other industries.\n\nDymension does things differently. With its modular RollApps, it effectively outsources some of the main functions of a blockchain. The Dymension Hub is solely responsible for handling consensus and settlement, while RollApps execute the transactions and data availability is outsourced to the Celestia and Avail networks.\n\nBy separating these components into three distinct chains, Dymension enables dApps to scale with optimal performance, strong settlement layer security, and greater access to liquidity thanks to its compatibility with the Cosmos and Ethereum ecosystems. Security is inherited from Dymension\u2019s settlement layer, which implements a fraud-proof mechanism to minimize trust in the RollApp sequencer. Meanwhile, Dymension communicates with IBC-enabled chains using the Inter-RollApp Communication Protocol, which is a customized version of the IBC protocol. This enables it to access liquidity via an embedded, native AMM.\n\nNow Dymension is making its RollApps more accessible with the launch of its incentivized testnet. Cosmos and Ethereum developers will be able to deploy RollApps using Roller, a command-line interface tool, using their virtual machine of their choice, such as EVM or CosmWasm. This represents another key benefit, because developers were previously limited to choosing the favored VM of the ecosystem they are building in.\n\nEarlier this year, Dymension launched its initial devnet for early participants. That limited launch saw more than 500 RollApps deployed, with full interoperability enabled by the IBC. With its testnet, Dymension is hopeful that it will see hundreds more RollApps deployed by developers from the wider Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems.\n\nDymension said users will be able to interact with RollApps via its new portal, which provides an overview of its ecosystem\u2019s usage data and provides a way to bridge over IBC using MetaMask.\n\nAlthough Dymension is competing against dozens of other scalability layers, such as Polygon, Boba Network, Caldera, zkSync, OpStack and others, it believes its native IBC connectivity will help it to stand apart from those competitors, providing unlimited scale for dApps as well as widespread interoperability.\n\nThese were some of the advantages cited by Dymension\u2019s backers earlier this year, when it closed on a $6.7 million funding round led by Big Brain Holdings, Stratos and others. They believe Dymension\u2019s vision of a network of modular blockchains can potentially accelerate Web3\u2019s transition away from Ethereum, helping dApps to achieve the scale needed to support widespread adoption."

Notably, the SEC has initiated legal actions against major crypto exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase for allegedly offering unregistered securities and violating securities laws.\n\nEarlier, the US SEC imposed a $30 million penalty on Kraken for offering staking services in February.\n\nThe exchange later had to halt its crypto-staking services for US customers.\n\nThis decision by Bitstamp adds another layer of complexity, particularly as staking has gained traction within the booming Decentralized Finance (DeFi) sector.\n\nUS Regulators Struggle to Provide Clear Crypto Regulations\n\nCentral to the regulatory conundrum is Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, Ether. The question of whether Ether should be classified as a commodity or a security remains a pivotal concern.\n\nWhile the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has consistently labeled Ether as a commodity, the characterization of Ethereum\u2019s cryptocurrency has yet to be conclusively defined.\n\nThe discontinuation of Ethereum staking for US users underscores the pressing need for clearer regulatory guidelines, ensuring a balanced approach that fosters innovation while safeguarding investor interests."

There's also a new player called Everlodge, bringing good vibes to the market. Let's check out these changes, and understand what they're about.\n\nJoin the Everlodge presale and win a luxury holiday to the Maldives\n\nCardano (ADA) Moves Forward\n\nCardano (ADA) has introduced a new and better Hydra scaling solution. Additionally, this improvement could make Cardano (ADA) more valuable. Furthermore, the upgrade's goal is to help Cardano's (ADA) system work faster, and handle more transactions without any issues. The newest version is called Cardano (ADA) Hydra v0.12.0, and is available now.\n\nThe upgrade works well with the Cardano (ADA) Node v8.1.2 software, and the Mithril protocol. It also helps APIs, which are tools that make it easier for Web 3.0 developers and researchers to use better scaling solutions. These changes show that Cardano (ADA) is committed to the future of apps that can work without relying on a central authority.\n\nCardano (ADA) is currently trading at $0.27, as a result, it is 91.26% below its all-time high of $3.10.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Sees a Boost\n\nEthereum's (ETH) price has surged by 11%, reaching a new high of $1,700. This is due to the potential approval of Ethereum Futures Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe approval of Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) ETFs would be a significant development in the regulatory landscape for digital assets. Firstly, it would signal the growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies by traditional financial institutions. Secondly, it could lead to increased investment in the sector. Finally, it would be a major step toward the mainstream adoption of digital assets.\n\nBesides the ETF news, more people have been trading Ethereum (ETH) recently. This has made Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) trading volume surge by 185%. The current Ethereum (ETH) price is $1,659.73. Ethereum (ETH) has decreased by 0.64% in the last 24 hours.\n\nEverlodge (ELDG) Makes Property Investment Easier and Smarter\n\nEverlodge is a new way of using technology to change how we invest in property.

        "title": "Crypto Spotlight: Ethereum, Shiba Inu, and Bitgert Performance Review | Mint - Mint",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is always evolving and introducing new projects that capture the attention of investors. Among the latest trends are three tokens, the giant, Ethereum (ETH), the meme coin, Shiba Inu (SHIB), and the innovative, Bitgert (BRISE). Here is a comparative analysis of their performance, features, and prospects.\n\nEthereum: Why are Whales Bidding Adue to Ethereum?\n\nEthereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, after Bitcoin. Ethereum is also the most popular platform for smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). Ethereum has undergone a major upgrade with Ethereum 2.0. Ethereum 2.0 aims to improve its scalability, security, and efficiency. Ethereum 2.0 transitioned Ethereum from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake (PoS) one. Ethereum 2.0 will reduce its energy consumption and environmental impact.\n\nEthereum has also been benefiting from the growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which are mostly built on Ethereum network. Ethereum has a market capitalization of $197.61 billion USD. However, presently, traders are gradually leaving the Ethereum market. The current open interest stands at its lowest point in the past 13 months, indicating a cautious retreat by traders to safeguard themselves from potential losses on the Ethereum network. A large whale sold off 10,600 Ethereum (equivalent to $17.2 million) at a rate of $1,622, resulting in a loss of approximately $2.9 million. As of August 23, 2023, Ethereum was trading at $1,644 USD.\n\nShiba Inu: Shibarium\u2019s Launch Hiccup & The Reconciliation Upgrade\n\nAlongside the crypto giant Ethereum, we have Shiba Inu on the list. Shiba Inu is a meme-based cryptocurrency that was launched in August 2020 as a \"Dogecoin killer\". Shiba Inu is named after a Japanese breed of dog Shiba Inu that is also the mascot of Dogecoin. Shiba Inu has a total supply of one quadrillion tokens. Half of Shiba Inu tokens were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin as a gesture of trust. Buterin later donated most of his Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens to various causes, such as Covid-19 relief in India and animal welfare.\n\nShiba Inu is also the native token of ShibaSwap. ShibaSwap is Shiba Inu\u2019s decentralized exchange that allows users to swap, stake, and farm Shiba Inu (SHIB) and other tokens. Shiba Inu\u2019s ShibaSwap also features a governance system that lets SHIB holders vote on proposals and changes to the platform. Shiba Inu recently launched its own blockchain called Shibarium. Shiba Inu\u2019s Shibarium is based on Ethereum's layer-2 solution Arbitrum. Shiba Inu\u2019s Shibarium aims to enhance Shiba Inu's speed, scalability, and security while enabling more DeFi and NFT applications.\n\nAs of August 23, 2023, Shiba Inu was trading at $0.00000786 USD, with a 24-hour trading volume of $4.32 billion USD. Shiba Inu was up 5.67% in the last 24 hours and 18.43% in the last week. Shiba Inu had a market capitalization of $3.1 billion USD, which accounted for 0.14% of the total crypto market cap.\n\nBitgert: Investors Eying on The Array of Developments Under Bitgert\u2019s Sleeve\n\nAlong with Ethereum and Shiba Inu, we have Bitgert on the list. Bitgert, a crypto engineering project founded in July 2021, offers blockchain products and auditing solutions. Bitgert is a newcomer that's swiftly capturing the attention of traders. Bitgert aims to deliver cost-free, high-speed blockchain interactions while consistently rewarding its robust community. BRISE is the native token of Bitgert platform. Initially based on BNB Chain, it shifted to the BRC20 blockchain in 2022, known for low gas fees and high-speed cross-chain transactions. The BRISE Wallet DApp is central, providing secure crypto asset management, while the BRISE token supports BUSD rewards through staking. The ecosystem employs a 5% transaction fee for buyback, enhancing the BRISE token's value. The Bitgert dApp Wallet features a P2P service for secure and fee-free transactions between buyers and sellers.\n\nAs of August 23, 2023, Bitgert was trading at $0.00000022 USD, with a 24-hour trading volume of $24.14 million USD. Bitgert was up 3.19% in the last 24 hours and 27.91% in the last week. Bitgert had a market capitalization of $203 million USD. Unlike Ethereum, investors have been eyeing on Bitgert for its developments and roadmap. Bitgert is also preparing to launch its own peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange, which will allow users to buy and sell Bitgert (BRISE) and other cryptocurrencies directly with each other, without intermediaries or fees. Bitgert P2P exchange will also offer more liquidity, security, and privacy to Bitgert users. Bitgert P2P exchange launch is expected to boost Bitgert's price and popularity, as more users will be able to access and trade Bitgert (BRISE) tokens easily and efficiently.\n\nTo buy Bitgert, you need to have an account on a cryptocurrency exchange that supports BRISE trading, such as Phemex or Uniswap. You can then use your preferred payment method to purchase Ethereum or another cryptocurrency that can be swapped for BRISE. You can then transfer your ETH or other crypto to your BRISE wallet address and exchange it for BRISE tokens on the BRISE platform or ShibaSwap.\n\nEthereum, Shiba Inu, and Bitgert are three cryptocurrencies that have different features and goals but share a common enthusiasm in the crypto community. While networks like Ethereum, and Shiba Inu have already saturated the market, newer projects like Bitgert are securing a strong foothold in the space.

        "title": "Comparing Binance, Ethereum, and Bitgert: Features, Performance, and Investor Opportunities | Mint - Mint",
        "content": "Binance, Ethereum, and Bitgert are three of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the market today. They have different features, performance, and prospects that can benefit investors looking for opportunities in the crypto space. Here is a brief overview of each coin and what they offer.\n\nBinance:\n\nBinance is the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume and one of the most influential players in the industry. Binance Smart Chain is a fast and low-cost blockchain network that hosts many decentralized applications (DApps) and tokens. Binance has its own native token, Binance Coin (BNB), which is used to pay for fees, access various services, and participate in token sales on the Binance platform. Binance Coin has performed well in 2023 despite Binance\u2019s regulatory tiffs throughout the year. Binance\u2019s BNB is also the base currency for the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). BNB is used to pay for trading fees on Binance, as well as to access various services and products on the Binance ecosystem, such as Binance Smart Chain, Binance Launchpad, and Binance NFT. BNB also benefits from the buy-back and burn program, which reduces its supply over time. Binance (BNB) holders can benefit from the growth of the Binance ecosystem and its innovations.\n\nEthereum:\n\nEthereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and the most widely used platform for smart contracts and DApps. Ethereum enables developers to create various applications that run on a decentralized network, such as decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), gaming, and more. Ethereum transitioned to Ethereum 2.0 in earlier months of 2023 to improve its scalability, security, and energy efficiency. Ethereum 2.0 moved the Ethereum network from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake (PoS) one, which will allow Ethereum (ETH) holders to stake their coins and earn rewards for securing the network. Ethereum has seen a cautious retreat in 2023, dropping from its peak to around $1,700 in August. However, some analysts believe that Ethereum is undervalued and has strong fundamentals that will support its long-term growth.\n\nBitgert:\n\nAlongside Binance and Ethereum, we have a newcomer that can be investors' favorite, Bitgert. Bitgert (BRISE) is a crypto engineering project launched in 2021. Bitgert's ecosystem includes a zero-fee blockchain network that can process up to 100,000 transactions per second (TPS), a decentralized exchange (DEX) that allows users to trade any token without intermediaries, a metaverse platform that enables users to create and explore virtual worlds, and an NFT marketplace that connects artists and collectors. Bitgert also plans to launch its own peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange soon, which will allow users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies directly with each other, without any third-party involvement. Bitgert claims that its P2P exchange will pump the price of BRISE hard, as it will increase the demand and utility of the token.\n\nHow to buy Bitgert (BRISE):\n\nOne of the easiest ways to buy Bitgert (BRISE) is through Binance or Coindesk. You can use your credit card or bank transfer to buy Ethereum (ETH) on Binance and then swap it for Bitgert (BRISE) on the Bitgert DEX or any other DEX that supports BRISE. Alternatively, you can use Trust Wallet, a popular mobile wallet app that supports Bitgert (BRISE) and other cryptocurrencies. You can buy Ethereum on Trust Wallet using your credit card or bank transfer and then swap it for Bitgert (BRISE) on the Bitgert DEX or any other DEX that supports Bitgert (BRISE).\n\nAs you can see, Binance, Ethereum, and Bitgert are three cryptocurrencies that have different features, performance, and prospects that can benefit investors who are looking for opportunities in the crypto space. While Binance and Ethereum may not show exponential growth, a project like Bitgert, being in its early stage, has the potential for massive growth, especially after the announcement of its P2P exchange. So hold on to your Bitgert (BRISE) until then.

        "title": "Exploring zkEVM: Bridging ZKP Technology & Ethereum's Virtual Machine - CryptoTvplus",
        "content": "When the Ethereum network was first proposed in 2014, the original developers did not take ZKP (Zero-Knowledge Proof) technology into account. However, in recent years, ZKP has gained significant attention and is expected to play a more prominent role in the blockchain space. Consequently, there has been an intensified effort to combine ZKP technology with Ethereum\u2019s virtual machine.\n\nTo understand what a zkEVM (Zero-Knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine) is, let\u2019s briefly review its two underlying concepts: zk-rollups and EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine).\n\nWhat are zk-rollups?\n\nA rollup is a scaling solution that aggregates multiple transaction executions outside the main chain and sends the data back to the main network as a single transaction. This process increases throughput while reducing the cost of executing these transactions.\n\nOn Ethereum, transactions within a rollup are compressed and submitted to the Ethereum mainnet, with the cost of verifying a single transaction. The Ethereum mainnet provides settlement and verifies the transaction data contained in the rollup.\n\nA zk-rollup is a type of rollup that utilizes ZKP technology. ZKP is a cryptographic technique that allows the verification of information\u2019s validity without revealing the information itself. Unlike other rollup solutions, zk-rollups only need to publish state differences (such as changes in user account status) and validity proofs, significantly lowering gas fees.\n\nThe security of zk-rollups relies on ZKP cryptography, where cryptographic methods are employed to verify proofs and achieve trustlessness. This differs from other rollup solutions like optimistic rollups, which rely on economic game theory for security, where bad actors are discouraged by potential losses and challengers are motivated by incentives.\n\nWhat is EVM?\n\nThe EVM is a state machine where Ethereum\u2019s account system and smart contracts run. Every execution of a smart contract triggers the EVM to transition from an old state to a new state. The EVM defines rules for calculating new and valid states from one block to another.\n\nState is a critical concept in Ethereum. It refers to a Merkle Patricia Trie data structure that represents Ethereum\u2019s current state and enables anyone to trace transaction information from the current block back to the genesis block.\n\nAll nodes participating in maintaining Ethereum ensure continuity and consensus, enabling each node to observe the exact current state. The EVM plays a critical role in maintaining this consistency.\n\nHow does zkEVM work?\n\nBy default, the EVM does not support ZKPs. However, zkEVM aims to ensure Ethereum\u2019s state continuity while providing proof of the correctness of all information. This ensures that the various factors involved in the computation of these processes are verified while maintaining security and privacy.\n\nzkEVM accomplishes this by replicating the Ethereum environment as zk-rollups. It takes the initial state, performs all the transactions, and outputs a newly updated state along with an accompanying ZKP. This proof is submitted to a verifier smart contract that verifies the correctness of both the initial and new states\u2019 output without having to individually verify all the transactions.\n\nDue to zkEVM\u2019s basis on the EVM, developers can easily port Ethereum DApps and smart contracts to zkEVMs without the need for ZKP development work. In other words, zkEVMs allow zk-rollups to execute smart contracts, expanding beyond token swaps and payments supported without zkEVMs.\n\nThe compatibility feature of the EVM enables developers to build new products using existing EVM tools and programming languages such as Solidity, while benefiting from the enhanced security provided by zkEVM. Users can also continue using the same DApps and familiar tools while enjoying added security and privacy.\n\nEVM Compatibility versus EVM Equivalence\n\nWhen we refer to a blockchain as EVM-compatible, it means that it provides an environment where DApps written in the Solidity programming language can be deployed. Solidity is specifically designed for developing smart contracts that run on the Ethereum network.\n\nEthereum developers can easily copy and paste the code of existing DApps from Ethereum and deploy them on other EVM-compatible chains with minimal modifications. For users, any EVM-compatible chain address functions the same as their Ethereum address.\n\nThis compatibility ensures that addresses can be used with mainstream wallets such as MetaMask and Trust Wallet. Currently, major EVM-compatible chains include BNB Chain, Avalanche C-Chain, and Polygon.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important not to confuse EVM compatibility with EVM equivalence. EVM equivalence means that, from the perspective of DApp developers, Layer 2 rollups are nearly identical to Layer 1 Ethereum.\n\nTo use an analogy with operating systems, EVM equivalence is like restoring files and settings through Apple Cloud if a user\u2019s previous computer and new computer both run on Apple\u2019s operating system.\n\nIn contrast, EVM compatibility means that if a new computer switches to a Windows system, the original files need to be downloaded through cloud storage and converted to recover preferred settings and old files.\n\nDifferent Types of ZkEVMs\n\nGenerating and verifying ZKPs directly using the EVM is extremely slow because Ethereum was not originally designed to support ZKP technology. In some cases, it could take several hours. However, striking a balance between EVM compatibility and ZKP efficiency is important.\n\nEthereum founder Vitalik Buterin categorized zkEVMs into four types, each with different trade-offs between ZKP performance efficiency and EVM compatibility.\n\nType 1: Consensus-level equivalence \u2014 zkEVM that is completely equivalent to Ethereum\n\nAt the consensus level, a Type 1 zkEVM, also known as an enshrined rollup, is equivalent to Ethereum. The zkEVM chain state and transactions are identical to those of Ethereum. They can mutually verify blocks and be directly used with Ethereum execution clients.\n\nType 1 zkEVMs make Ethereum itself more scalable and can be introduced directly onto the Ethereum mainnet. The drawback is that ZKP efficiency is extremely poor and requires a significant amount of computation for verification. Future solutions could involve using large-scale parallel validators or specialized integrated circuits for zk-SNARKs.\n\nType 2: Bytecode-level equivalence \u2014 completely equivalent to EVM\n\nType 2 zkEVMs are fully equivalent to the EVM but not Ethereum. They differ from Ethereum in terms of data structures (such as block structure and state tree) and eliminate some stack operations that are not ZK-friendly.\n\nType 2 zkEVMs are fully compatible with Ethereum\u2019s existing DApps, debugging tools, and developer infrastructure. While they can improve prover times to some extent, they are expensive and have low and expensive efficiency in terms of ZKP.\n\nType 2.5: Similar to Type 2 but with modifications to gas fees\n\nType 2.5 zkEVMs share the advantages and disadvantages of Type 2 but have slightly lower gas fees.\n\nType 3: Bytecode-level equivalence \u2014 nearly equivalent to EVM\n\nBuilding upon Type 2, Type 3 zkEVMs sacrifice compatibility for improved ZK efficiency. They eliminate functions that are difficult to implement on zkEVM, such as precompiles, which may require rewriting some code used in DApps that rely on these functions.\n\nType 4: Development language-level equivalence \u2014 high-level language equivalent to EVM\n\nType 4 zkEVMs offer the highest ZK performance but relatively subpar compatibility compared to other types. They provide an equivalent high-level language to the EVM.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe primary goal of implementing zkEVM is to enable the integration of ZKP computation into smart contract execution, thereby extending the reach of DApps to all EVM-compatible protocols. However, the applications of ZKP technology extend beyond this point.\n\nZKP technology has the potential to be compatible with Web2 use cases as well. By combining ZKP with various Web2 applications, Web3 applications can become more seamless and user-friendly. This integration would allow users who are already familiar with traditional Internet browsers to access Web3 and, as a result, accelerate the adoption of Web3 technology."

        "content": "Arthur Hayes believes that Bitcoin ETFs from BlackRock, Fidelity, etc. would harm decentralization.\n\nHayes recently stated that ETFs from TradFi giants could interfere with crypto mining firms.\n\nThe crypto entrepreneur projected that BTC will continue to hover around the $25,000 level in Q3 2023.\n\nHayes added that the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s policies would eventually trigger a crypto rally.\n\nArthur Hayes, the visionary entrepreneur behind crypto exchange BitMEX, believes that the traditional finance sector\u2019s increasing interest in Bitcoin ETFs will end up harming the broader crypto industry by bringing down decentralization. The BitMEX founder added that the United States Federal Reserve will play a considerable role in triggering the next crypto rally.\n\nArthur Hayes: Bitcoin To Hover Around $25k In Q3 \u20182023\n\nIn a crypto trader digest published earlier today, Arthur Hayes warned readers that traditional finance giants, including BlackRock, Vanguard, and Fidelity are not bothered about decentralization in the crypto space. According to the crypto entrepreneur, their bid to offer an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the price of Bitcoin is an attempt to centralize assets on their balance sheets.\n\nAs per Hayes, in the event that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approves the several spot BTC ETF applications submitted over the past few months, banks and other financial regulators could restrict in kind restrictions of any crypto financial products offered. He added that the crackdown by U.S. regulators on crypto was aimed at discouraging small operators from offering crypto products.\n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to say is that crypto itself was never the problem \u2013 this issue is who owns it.\u201d Arthur Hayes\n\nArthur Hayes stated that once TradFi players start offering ETFs that track an index of publicly listed crypto mining firms, they will assume control of large voting blocks of the companies\u2019 stocks. The asset management giants would then be able to interfere with management decisions, which would affect the ethos of the broader crypto industry.\n\nHayes believes that the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy in the face of the current economic landscape in the United States will eventually add cash to the economy. He added that cash would need a \u201chome in finite-supply financial assets like crypto,\u201d which could induce a crypto rally. As for Bitcoin, Hayes projected that the flagship cryptocurrency would continue to hover around $25,000 in Q3 \u20182023."

        "title": "How ICP's AstroX ME Enhances Interoperability with the Ethereum Ecosystem - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "Numerous cryptocurrency wallets exist only as browser-only plugins, which lack compatibility with the demands of modern mobile lifestyles. However, requiring users to be stationed at a computer, and installing a specific browser to access a wallet, would introduce significant inconvenience. In addition, the evolution of wallets is inevitably geared toward widespread adoption, necessitating a user experience that rivals or even surpasses that of Web2 products.\n\nFurthermore, intelligent wallets should harness cryptographic methods to establish the credibility of transactions on blockchain networks. AstroX ME envisions a redefinition of wallets, emphasizing security and transactional ease.\n\nThe AstroX ME wallet represents a multi-chain smart wallet fortified by cutting-edge cryptography, delivering a seamless interactive encounter reminiscent of Web2 applications.\n\nThe ME wallet employs biometric technologies such as fingerprints and facial recognition, departing from conventional private key management. This innovative approach facilitates wallet restoration on new devices without using seed phrases. The wallet extends its support to numerous chains and a variety of cryptocurrencies.\n\nHow does the AstroX ME wallet work?\n\nDrawing from the conceptual comprehension of identity and wallets, the AstroX ME wallet has been meticulously designed to distinguish between the concepts. Users will initially establish a decentralized identity using the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) and then utilize the associated wallet. Here\u2019s a video on how to use \u00c5strox ME.\n\nAstroX Me Wallet Mobile App Interface\n\nThis approach carries two significant implications:\n\nPrimarily, users only need to recall their identity to oversee all the associated data, akin to how registering for a Google account permits access to numerous applications and services.\n\nSecond, users can oversee their wallets using a singular identity (username), enabling fluid asset transfers within wallets. Upon logging into a third-party DApp using a username, users can seamlessly switch between wallets, emulating the payment experience in our day-to-day lives. In essence, the essential data of all DApps, including account levels and operational records, are exclusively linked to the identity (username), enabling users to conveniently switch wallets for various transactions.\n\nOnce the user creates their AstroX ME wallet they can receive and send tokens of ICP, EXT, ICRC-1, DIP20, XTC, Origyn, and DRC20 standards and collectibles of EXT, DIP721, Origyn, GIGA, ICPunks, CCC, C3, Departure Labs, and IC Naming Standards. All they need to do is click on \u201cManage Token\u201d to enable their token of choice from the available token list.\n\nICP Token Wallet Interface\n\nManage Token Interface\n\nServing as the conduit between users and DApps, the AstroX ME wallet introduces innovation in its authorization mechanism design, presenting three distinct authorization login modes with varying privacy levels:\n\nOrdinary\n\nPseudonymous\n\nAnonymous\n\nThis empowers users to determine whether third-party DApps can track behavioral data within or across applications.\n\nAstroX ME leverages the ECDSA Threshold Signature of Dfinity, an L1 public chain, for signature completion. Notably, this signature process necessitates no intermediary servers for verification, relying on the Dfinity blockchain\u2019s consensus mechanism for security and efficiency.\n\nThe Threshold ECDSA, an advancement over ECDSA technology, incorporates support for BIP 32-derived standards. This widely utilized ECDSA signature in the blockchain industry empowers smart wallets with ECDSA public keys for transaction signing. Through Threshold ECDSA, wallets can hold BTC and ETH while executing transactions. Collaboration among nodes in creating Threshold ECDSA signatures enables key sharing, ensuring signature completion even if a portion of nodes face issues.\n\nThe dynamically evolving Threshold ECDSA, regularly updated to mitigate the risk of secret leakage, remains operational even if 1/3 of the nodes experience disruptions, attesting to its reliability.\n\nAstroX ME adopts an account abstraction mechanism with smart contracts executed in a WebAssembly container, with permissions verified in the protocol stack. User account ownership resides within user-bound devices, each of which functions as a hardware wallet. Users enjoy the flexibility to add or remove devices at their discretion.\n\nIn contrast to numerous smart contract wallets relying on Solidity compiled EVM, which demands pre-unlocking of contracts and can be hampered by network congestion and L1 limitations, AstroX ME employs the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) high-performance protocol. Boasting a block speed of 30 blocks per second and 2-second finality, it aligns with Harmony\u2019s performance standards.\n\nBy scripting smart contracts in a WebAssembly-supported language, ME facilitates intricate custom logic and contract upgrades, offering ample room for addressing diverse user requirements.\n\nKey AstroX wallet features\n\nAstroX is committed to crafting the ME wallet with an array of robust features, designed to enhance user convenience, security, and accessibility across various devices and platforms.

        "content": "Important crypto news for Ripple (XRP), which recently overtook Ethereum in terms of preference in South Korea, becoming the favorite altcoin of investors, according to a tweet from Whale:\n\nXRP Surpasses Ethereum as South Korea\u2019s Most Popular Altcoin \u2014 Whale | Dinobet.io (@WhaleChart) August 23, 2023\n\nSee below for all the details.\n\nThe Ripple (XRP) crypto triumphs over Ethereum in South Korea\n\nAs anticipated above, the fifth crypto in the global rankings, Ripple (XRP), now reigns as the favorite in South Korea in the altecoin sphere, overtaking even Ethereum.\n\nSpecifically, it is attested that Ripple (XRP) has gained the top spot among the most popular altcoins in South Korea. This report shows that South Korean cryptocurrency traders have embraced XRP as their top choice in comparison with other cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn addition, it is worth mentioning that Ripple has shown a growth of about 2% over the past few hours. South Korea-based cryptocurrency trading platform Bitsum shared a study highlighting investment trends among different age groups.\n\nEmerging from this are traders in their 20s as the most active in the country. Moreover, the same study confirms XRP as the most sought-after cryptocurrency in this age group, with more than 20% of young people preferring this token.\n\nThere is no denying the obvious growth and development that the cryptocurrency market has experienced in recent years. And the central role played by the younger generation in the stimulating evolution of this sector is indisputable.\n\nThis generational shift in preferences eloquently demonstrates the unique features that XRP can offer.\n\nSome data regarding the Ripple (XRP) crypto\n\nWe also see that, based on the report provided, it appears that 82.5% of investors in the 20-year age group have allocated their investments to altcoins.\n\nAmong these, Ripple stands out as the most popular altcoin, boasting a 20.7% share.\n\nThis marks a relevant triumph of Ripple on the cryptocurrency scene, even surpassing the mainstays of the industry, namely Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nAlthough the latter are key figures in the cryptocurrency landscape, XRP\u2019s expansion in South Korea bolsters investor confidence. We also note that several elements have fueled the meteoric growth of the Ripple ecosystem.\n\nThese include XRP\u2019s practical uses, technological advancements, and strategic alliances. In addition, Ripple\u2019s remarkable triumph in a legal battle against the US SEC has further solidified XRP\u2019s position.\n\nIn making further strides, XRP experienced a considerable jump of about 60% in value immediately after the verdict in Ripple\u2019s favor in the legal case.\n\nCurrently, Ripple\u2019s price stands at around $0.5286, accompanied by an increase of more than 1.72% in the past 24 hours.\n\nHowever, according to CoinMarketCap, there is evidence of a decline in the magnitude of daily trading volumes for XRP, registering a release of 18.29%.\n\nSEC and XRP Conflict: Ripple\u2019s Garlinghouse Initiative\n\nThe dispute between the US Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple Labs, the crypto company, continues to move forward and Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, is further solidifying his defense.\n\nDuring the day on Tuesday, two renowned attorneys from the respected law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP announced their decision to participate in the litigation currently pending in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York.\n\nAttorney Michael A. Schulman formally filed a motion for Pro Hac Vice, a legal procedure that allows a lawyer to practice in a jurisdiction where they are not licensed.\n\nIn addition, attorney Caleb J. Robertson has formally taken the position of representing Garlinghouse in the same court proceeding. The input of lawyers of such caliber from a renowned law firm underscores the significance and complexity of the case.\n\nAs is well known, the charges brought by the SEC against Garlinghouse and co-founder Chris Larsen involve the sale and issuance of the digital asset XRP.\n\nAs previously reported by U.Today, the judge overseeing the SEC\u2019s civil case against Ripple Labs planned to begin a jury trial in the second quarter of 2024, specifically between April and June.\n\nAlthough Judge Analisa Torres has previously ruled that the XRP coin does not constitute a security with regard to transactions on digital marketplaces, Ripple and its executives may still face other violations.\n\nIn fact, the SEC recently took legal action to challenge this decision, but the outcome of that attempt remains to be seen."

        "content": "On Monday, August 21, Vitalik Buterin, one of the co-founders of Ethereum (ETH), was observed transferring 600 ETH, which is valued at around $1 million, into a wallet on the Coinbase exchange. Usually, transfers to exchange are translated to mean an intention to sell.\n\nAccording to on-chain data from Etherscan, a wallet controlled by Vitalik Buterin transferred the assets on August 21. At the time of writing (August 23, 2023), the wallet still holds 3,933 ETH worth approximately $6.5 million.\n\nThis occurrence is not the initial instance of Buterin moving assets to a crypto exchange. In an earlier instance this year, in March, the co-founder of Ethereum transferred 200 ETH to Kraken. Around the same time, Buterin also divested several unsolicited alternative cryptos (referred to as \u201cshitcoins\u201d) in exchange for 439.25 ETH.\n\nButerin has made a series of transactions amid the recent market downturn that has been flagged by several crypto observers. On Sunday, he repaid 251,000 Rai Reflex tokens on Maker and subsequently liquidated 1,000 worth around $1.6 million according to data from lookonchain.\n\nEthereum Price Declined 13% After Vitalik Sold In April\n\nLarge transactions from recognized high-net-worth holders and influential figures like Vitalik Buterin often influence the markets significantly. Historical data culled from Arkham Intelligence shows how Ethereum\u2019s price sank by 13% barely a week after Vitalik made a significant outflow in April.\n\nAs shown in the chart above, Vitalik had moved out $283 million worth of ETH on April 19. Interestingly, ETH price began to wobble within just 48 hours and later declined 13% from $2,102 to $1,840 by the close of April 25.\n\nAlso, back in 2021, Vitalik\u2019s alternate 0Xabf address, which currently holds 248,027 ETH (~$415 million), exhibited a similar premonitory pattern.\n\nOn November 5, 2021, Vitalik moved out a total of 19.5 billion worth of ETH over an eventful period of two weeks. That period coincided with Ethereum losing its all-time high of $4,890, which it hasn\u2019t reclaimed ever since.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Price, Market Cap, and Trading Volume\n\nEthereum\u2019s Price Chart: According to Coingecko\n\nThe price of Ethereum (ETH) as of the time of writing, is $1,663.22 today with a 24-hour trading volume of $5,742682,763.82. This represents a -0.53%price decline in the last 24 hours and a -9.66% price decline in the past 7 days. With a circulating supply of 120 Million ETH, Ethereum is valued at a market cap of $200,045,386,947."
