        "title": "Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade will dump huge sums of Ether into the market. Here\u2019s everything you need to know - Fortune",
        "content": "April 12 marks the end of one of the most patient waits in blockchain history. From then on, Ethereum investors can finally withdraw a $31 billion stash of ETH that started piling up at the tail end of 2020. That\u2019s due to Ethereum\u2019s latest upgrade, dubbed Shanghai, which unlocks close to 18 million so-called \u201cstaked ETH\u201d from the blockchain\u2014about 15% of all that\u2019s in circulation.\n\nThe giant token unlock marks the completion of Ethereum\u2019s most significant upgrade to date\u2014the Merge. Most significantly, the Merge cut ties with warehouses of crypto miners by combining the old blockchain with a new network that runs on an environmentally friendly transaction-validation mechanism called proof of stake.\n\nThe new proof-of-stake method gives out freshly minted ETH as a reward for those who \u201cstake\u201d (lock up) their crypto in Ethereum smart contracts. The more ETH a blockchain validator stakes, the more likely the Ethereum network will pick that validator to process a transaction, increasing the chance the validator will earn newly issued ETH.\n\nTo encourage validators to support proof of stake, Ethereum has since late 2020 offered interest rates up to 5% to anyone who parked huge amounts of ETH in its smart contracts. The ploy worked, and Ethereum developers implemented the Merge without a hitch last September, but there was one catch for investors: Those who staked ETH couldn\u2019t withdraw it fund until the developers gave permission.\n\n32 ETH\n\nShanghai is that permission. The upgrade grants about half-a-million validators\u2014each had to provide at least 32 ETH (now about $57,000)\u2014the right to withdraw their funds. So far, stakers have earned about a million ETH in rewards\u2014about 0.9% of Ethereum\u2019s total market capitalization.\n\nThe total number of individual stakers is far higher than that half-a-million figure; plenty of them pooled ETH from regular investors who couldn\u2019t afford to meet that 32 ETH requirement, staking the funds on their behalf in return for a cut of the nearly 5% annual rate. Right now, Lido, the largest decentralized finance protocol that allows for the delegation of ETH, holds about 31% of all staked ETH, according to crypto analytics site DeFiLlama.\n\nWhat else does Shanghai do?\n\nShanghai adds a host of other upgrades, known as Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs). The most important ones, EIP-3651, EIP-3860, and EIP-3855, restrict transaction costs for technical applications, which could go some way to reducing fees on the otherwise expensive Ethereum blockchain.\n\nAnd Shanghai only concerns upgrades to the execution layer of Ethereum\u2014the part that handles smart contract and protocol rules. Another set of upgrades, called Capella, will apply to Ethereum\u2019s consensus layer, the part of the network that ensures that Ethereum\u2019s validators are following the rules set forth by the execution layer.\n\nConfusingly, developers are calling the upgrades Shapella\u2014a portmanteau of Shanghai and Capella\u2014despite the proximity to the upgrade. Ethereum\u2019s Merge also changed its name close to completion from Ethereum 2.0 to the all-encompassing \u201cEthereum upgrades.\u201d\n\nShanghai is scheduled for the end of April 12, the date the network is expected to process the 6,209,536th \u201cslot.\u201d Ethereum applications shouldn\u2019t feel much of a pinch; although earlier Ethereum upgrades have been beset by delays, often by several years, a series of successful test-nets provide ample reason to believe Shanghai is firmly locked in.\n\nWill prices crash?\n\nExpect to witness a flood of ETH into the market. This is, after all, the first time investors have been able to cash out staked ETH for actual ETH. Before Shanghai, investors could only withdraw tokens that represented staked ETH on platforms like Lido, the equivalent of derivatives claims on ETH. They also could access fees earned during block proposals, such as tips paid to validators during each transaction, but not the newly issued ETH.\n\nJim McDonald, CTO of London staking firm Attestant, expects the price of Ethereum to dip sharply right after Shanghai as about 50% to 70% of early withdrawers cash out\u2014the price of ETH has more than quadrupled since December of 2020, and there are profits to be had. He said he expects the sell pressure will be worsened by the paucity of new ETH dripping into the market, a consequence of an old upgrade that burned ETH after every transaction.\n\nBut McDonald also predicts ETH\u2019s price will rebound quickly as stakers reenter the fray, perhaps after reshuffling providers or reevaluating their positions. New stakers also will join, he thinks, namely institutions that previously had feared staking derivatives services like Lido or RocketPool could burn to ashes, or that Shanghai would be delayed in perpetuity, locking away their funds forevermore.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re swapping your Ether for magic beans,\u201d McDonald said of Lido. \u201cNow, they\u2019re pretty well-tested magic beans, but trying to sell that to your CFO can be tricky. But after Shanghai, he added, institutions can \u201cretain control\u201d while staking. \u201cYou\u2019re not arguing with the taxman that you\u2019ve sold your Ether and swapped it for magic beans.\u201d\n\nA panel of top liquid-staking derivatives protocols also expect that the upgrade will bring institutions into the fold since they can add and remove funds at will, making Ethereum staking a whole lot more like an interest-bearing savings account than buying shares in a private company pre-IPO. Konstantin Lomashuk, a trader and contributor to Lido who appeared on the panel, told Fortune that Shanghai won\u2019t dent ETH\u2019s price while the wider banking crisis bears its weight on the crypto market.\n\nHow will withdrawals work?\n\nTwo types of investors are likely to withdraw: validators, and their 32-plus ETH, and regular investors who delegated funds to these validators. Yet there are reasons to believe that its effect on the market might be muted; Shapella sets some limitations as to how much ETH validators can withdraw at once, and it would take about 18 months for validators to withdraw everything.\n\nOnly 1,350 full validators can withdraw their entire holdings each day (the initial 32 ETH investment, plus any accrued rewards), or 43,200 ETH out of a total pot of 17.6 million. It\u2019d be far quicker to remove the cream on the top of the 32 ETH; about 110,000 validators can withdraw their rewards each day. McDonald, of Attestant, expects that about 1.1 million ETH (about $2 billion) will hit the market in the first week after Shanghai.\n\nLomashuk told Fortune that staking will almost double to 30 million ETH within a year, and that no more than 20% of stakers will withdraw their funds for good. Validators may not want to withdraw their ETH if the variable return rate, currently 4.6%, still beats returns elsewhere. That will grow the Ethereum network, he said, with the increase in transactions burning more ETH, and therefore raising the price \u201csignificantly.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nMore upgrades are on the way. One of the next major upgrades, Cancun, will introduce \u201cproto-danksharding,\u201d a method of speeding up the blockchain as it accommodates more users by running the network on several smaller chains at once.\n\nMichael Anderson, cofounder of the DeFi-focused VC fund Framework Ventures, told Fortune that proto-danksharding could be even more significant than Shanghai. \u201cA successful implementation could significantly reduce transaction costs on L2s,\u201d he said, referring to layer-2 protocols, \u201cenhancing the average user\u2019s experience and creating a huge competitive risk for a lot of the \u2018Ethereum killers\u2019 that dominated the conversation in the last market cycle.\u201d\n\nBut those upgrades will have to compete with Arbitrum and Optimism, as well as rival blockchains, that have eaten away at Ethereum\u2019s market share in the past few years. And while Shanghai is great for Ethereum, the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s ongoing crypto crackdown might put the kibosh on what early investors can do with their unstaked ETH.\n\nAn earlier version of this story stated the price of Ethereum had quadrupled since December. It has been updated to say the increase has occurred since December of 2020."

        "title": "What's a Better Buy: Bitcoin or Ethereum? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The debate between Bitcoin (BTC 0.96%) and Ethereum (ETH 1.61%) as a better investment has been a hot topic in the cryptocurrency community for years. Both are popular and established cryptocurrencies, but there are key differences between them that make Bitcoin a better investment. The reason for this belief can be boiled down to three simple reasons.\n\n1. The market cap difference\n\nMarket capitalization, or \"market cap,\" refers to the total value of a company or asset. In the case of cryptocurrencies, it is calculated by multiplying the total number of coins in circulation by the current market price of each coin. As of April 1, 2023, Bitcoin has a market cap of over $545 billion, while Ethereum's market cap is just under $220 billion.\n\nEssentially what this means is that Bitcoin is currently a more established asset than Ethereum and makes up a disproportionate amount of value in the entire crypto asset class. As of today, Bitcoin accounts for more than 45% of all the value in crypto.\n\nIts higher market cap indicates that it has more adoption and more trust among investors. Additionally, it suggests that Bitcoin is less volatile than Ethereum, as it would take a larger amount of money to move its price significantly.\n\n2. Increasing scarcity\n\nOne of the most significant differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum is their supply. Bitcoin has a hard cap of 21 million coins, which means that there will never be more than 21 million bitcoins in circulation. Currently, there are around 19.3 million circulating, with the remaining 1.7 million yet to be mined. Even better, though, these remaining 1.7 million bitcoins will be released at a diminishing rate for the next 117 years until the last bitcoin is mined.\n\nCurrently, Bitcoin's inflation rate is a minimal 1.7%. However, due to the gradual decrease in the rate of new coins being created, it is estimated that by 2056, this number will fall below 0.1%. By the year 2100, Bitcoin's inflation rate will be somewhere around 0.000001%. No matter the asset, an inflation rate this low helps to ensure that prices are not only maintained but grow as demand competes for a more limited supply.\n\nEthereum, on the other hand, has no hard cap. While it does have a mechanism known as burning to remove ether from circulation, there is, technically, no overall limit on the number of ether which could enter the market. Unlike Bitcoin, this means that Ethereum is subject to unknown levels of inflation, which can decrease the value of each individual coin over time.\n\n3. Decentralization and security\n\nFurthermore, Bitcoin has a stronger track record when it comes to security and decentralization. Bitcoin's blockchain is the most secure and decentralized of any cryptocurrency, with thousands of nodes and miners around the world helping to verify transactions and maintain the network. This makes it less susceptible to hacking or manipulation than Ethereum, which has had several high-profile security incidents in the past. Additionally, Bitcoin's decentralized nature means that it is not subject to the same level of centralization or regulation as Ethereum, which has been criticized for being too closely tied to its founders and developers.\n\nIn addition, Bitcoin has a more established and secure network than Ethereum. Bitcoin's network has been operating securely for well over a decade, and its underlying proof-of-work technology has proven to be reliable and resistant to attacks. Ethereum, on the other hand, has had some security issues in the past, including a major hack in 2016 that resulted in the loss of millions of dollars worth of ether. While Ethereum's security has improved over time, it still lags behind Bitcoin in terms of reliability and security.\n\nKeep it simple\n\nWhile Ethereum might be deserving of a spot in your portfolio, Bitcoin provides investors with a safer and more dependable option. Likely the greatest advantage Bitcoin has over Ethereum is its simplicity. Bitcoin's value proposition is clear and easy to understand: it is a highly decentralized and secure digital store of value that provides holders with reliability.\n\nEthereum, on the other hand, has a more complex value proposition that is tied to its smart contract functionality and decentralized applications. While this complexity can be appealing to some investors, it also makes Ethereum more difficult to understand and evaluate as an investment, as many of these use cases are in their beginning stages.\n\nFor investors looking to keep it simple and wanting to invest in cryptocurrency, look no further than the original digital asset, Bitcoin."

        "content": "Ether (ETH) dropped by over 7.5% in its Bitcoin (BTC) pair in 2023. But ETH/BTC may wipe its year-to-date losses entirely in April, as Ethereum\u2019s long-awaited Shanghai hard fork is just days away.\n\nThe upgrade is set for April 12, enabling Ethereum stakers to withdraw around 1.1 billion ETH in rewards \u2014 worth over $2 billion as of April 8.\n\nETH price undergoes key technical bounce\n\nMany experts see the hard fork as bullish for Ether in the long term. For instance, the Shanghai buzz has helped Ether outperform Bitcoin in April.\n\nAs a result, the ETH/BTC pair has risen by about 4.75% month-to-date to reach 0.066 BTC as of April 8, a nearly 8% rebound since March 20.\n\nThe bounce was largely expected, particularly as ETH/BTC dropped to its historical ascending trendline support.

Source: TradingView/CrediBULL Crypto\n\nEthereum vs. U.S. dollar outlook\n\nThe ETH/USD pair has rallied by more than 50% in 2023, primarily due to similar uptrends elsewhere in the crypto market.\n\nA weakening dollar, lower U.S. Treasury yields and expectations of a Federal Reserve pivot on interest rate hikes have helped cryptocurrencies rise across the board in Q1.

        "content": "The Ethereum network is set to undergo a technical revamp on April 12 that will allow users to withdraw tens of billions of dollars of its native token, Ether. Known as the \u201cShanghai\u201d upgrade, it\u2019s a necessary step after the world\u2019s most commercially important crypto platform shifted to a less power-hungry process for ordering transactions. Investors burned by recent turmoil in crypto markets will be wondering if, presented with their first opportunity to withdraw their tokens, some Ether holders will run for the hills.\n\nIt\u2019s a computer network that hosts what are known as smart contracts \u2014 self-executing software agreements in which a chain of actions can flow from defined conditions and contingencies. Since it was introduced by crypto entrepreneur Vitalik Buterin in 2014, it\u2019s become a popular platform for developing apps used for everything from trading to gaming. Transactions on Ethereum and many other crypto platforms known as blockchains are publicly viewable and are built on open source software, so developers can jump in and try to make improvements. Ether\u2019s value tumbled during the \u201ccrypto winter\u201d of 2022 that saw investors pull back from many digital assets. But the appeal of Ethereum\u2019s underlying technology has endured."

        "title": "Staked Ethereum Withdrawals Could Take Weeks After Shanghai Upgrade: Analyst - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum shifted to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake model in September, but there\u2019s still one upgrade that needs to be completed to let users unstake their ETH from the network. It's coming up next week\u2014but the process could ultimately take weeks to complete, an analyst at crypto data platform Nansen told Decrypt.\n\nFollowing September's merge event, Ethereum's transition will conclude with the launch of the Shanghai upgrade on April 12, which is paired with another upgrade called Capella.\n\nThe upgrades are hotly anticipated by users who staked ETH in the network\u2014either as individual validators or through platforms like Lido Finance and Rocket Pool\u2014as they will soon be able to withdraw their assets and accumulated rewards.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut Ethereum users may not be able to withdraw their funds immediately, or all at once. According to Andrew Thurman, a data analyst at Nansen, the length of the withdrawal queue could result in users having to wait several weeks to withdraw their funds.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the fundamentals,\u201d Thurman told Decrypt, \u201cwhatever the impact of withdrawals going live is, it's going to play out over a period of weeks and not days.\u201d\n\nThe Ethereum 2.0 upgrade process began in early December 2020 with the launch of the Beacon Chain, a parallel blockchain to Ethereum responsible for managing the staking process. Validators were required to stake 32 ETH to operate their own nodes and ensure the continual supply of blocks by processing transactions and maintaining the network.\n\nIt's happening \ud83c\udf8a Shapella is scheduled on mainnet for epoch 194048, scheduled for 22:27:35 UTC on Apr. 12, 2023 \ud83d\udcc6 Client releases compatible with the upgrade are listed in the announcement below \ud83d\udc47https://t.co/I0hSv9lnjz \u2014 timbeiko.eth \u2600\ufe0f (@TimBeiko) March 28, 2023\n\nTo supplement demand, third-party decentralized platforms such as Lido Finance also let users stake their ETH without the need to manage their own validator nodes. In exchange for depositing ETH into the Lido Finance smart contract, users received a staked version of their ETH\u2014an ERC-20 token known as stETH.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe amount of stETH a user received was equivalent to the amount of ETH they deposited, and the value of stETH remained pegged (albeit with fluctuations) to the value of ETH.\n\nIn the wake of the Shanghai upgrade, Thurman believes that the \u201cvalue proposition of projects like Lido will slightly alter, but ultimately won\u2019t change significantly.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeing able to use your staked ETH as a form of collateral in DeFi is hugely important for anybody who's pursuing any kind of sophisticated interest or yield bearing strategy,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, there's still definitely a role for those tokens. But I think liquidity becomes slightly less important because withdrawals are open.\u201d\n\nHow much is staked?\n\nTo date, more than 18 million ETH\u2014that\u2019s about $33.6 billion worth\u2014has been staked and locked into the Beacon Chain across 564,000 validators. The current annual percentage yield (APR) for validators is 4.4%, providing an interest-like return for stakers.\n\nThurman described Ethereum\u2019s two-year journey to proof-of-stake as a \"monumental event in the history of open source software,\u201d and declared that drawing comparisons to a \u201cplane changing engine midair is not much of an overstatement.\u201d\n\nAs users look towards the withdrawal window opening next week, questions are being raised as to the expected timeline for accessing their funds.\n\nAccording to the Ethereum Foundation, a maximum amount of 16 withdrawals can be processed within a single block, totalling a maximum output of 115,200 per day. Today, there are 564,000 validators on Ethereum\u2019s Beacon Chain.\n\nIn theory, it would take about five days to process all withdrawals. Demand requests will almost certainly extend this timeline, however. Coinbase, for instance, announced that it \u201cmay take the protocol weeks to months [to] process unstaking requests.\u201d Lido has said it could be early-to-mid May before it unlocks withdrawals, due to security audits.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAlex Esin, CEO of P2P.org\u2014an institutional staking provider with more than $1.2 billion worth of staked assets\u2014told Decrypt that he\u2019s \u201cnot expecting to see a massive withdrawal spike\u201d following the upgrade.\n\n\u201cMany who have already staked on the Beacon Chain have a high risk tolerance, and are not holding out for the withdrawal date,\u201d he assessed. Esin added that stakers must weigh the prospect of withdrawing \u201cagainst the growth expected from the Ethereum ecosystem and ETH strength expected over the next year.\u201d\n\nEven if there\u2019s a rush to withdraw staked funds, Thurman said that much of that ETH may ultimately be re-staked so that holders can continue earning rewards. Exactly how much may be re-staked, however, is difficult to assess at this point.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like throwing darts,\u201d Thurman said. \u201cThat\u2019s why it's so much fun to debate on Twitter\u2014because people just genuinely don't know.\u201d"

        "title": "Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR): Nothing Like a Traditional Blockchain - DailyCoin",
        "content": "Like all blockchains in the cryptocurrency industry, Hedera Hashgraph promises fast, cheap transactions and unmatched security in DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology). It\u2019s nothing we haven\u2019t heard of before, but the Hedera network brings a unique twist to Web3.\n\nIt\u2019s not technically a blockchain.\n\nAt face value, Hedera Hashgraph serves all the same purposes as traditional blockchains like Ethereum (ETH) or Cardano (ADA). You can store digital assets, use dApps and trade NFT collectibles. Despite the similarities, the Hedera Network is built differently under the hood.\n\nWhat exactly is a hashgraph? How is it different from a blockchain, and why does it enable the Hedera Network to charge a flat transaction fee of just $0.0001?\n\nWhat Is Hedera Hashgraph?\n\nHedera Hashgraph is a decentralized public ledger and cryptocurrency ecosystem. Unlike Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum, which are blockchains, the Hedera Network stores and transmits data on a directed acyclic graph.\n\nFor the end user, this doesn\u2019t make much difference to how we experience the network. Hedera Hashgraph smart contracts are mostly written in Solidity, the same as Ethereum. Hedera Hashgraph is EVM-compatible, meaning if you are familiar with Ethereum, you\u2019ll be right at home on Hedera.\n\nHow Does Hedera Hashgraph Work?\n\nHedera Hashgraph claims its unique hashgraph consensus algorithm is faster, safer, and more secure than traditional blockchain infrastructure. This is crucial for a public network, as it means that the Hedera network should be able to support thousands of users worldwide.\n\nThe Hashgraph \u2013 A Directed Acyclic Graph\n\nThe Hashgraph network is a type of directed acyclic graph. But how is a DAG different from a blockchain? Traditional blockchains form a line of interconnected blocks, or units of data. In a blockchain, network nodes or miners reach a consensus and validate new blocks using data from the previous block.\n\nIn a DAG, nodes can reference data from any block in the chain\u2019s lifespan, allowing them to verify information and confirm transactions faster. This is one of the main reasons behind the Hedera Network\u2019s high throughput of transactions.\n\nThe Hashgraph takes this one step further. It actively registers the timestamp of every transaction and digital signature in real-time, as well as the last hash sent and received by each node in the network. Hedera calls this phenomenon the gossip about gossip protocol, which helps put transactions in order on the network and ensures that all nodes are \u2018telling the truth\u2019 and reaching consensus.\n\nSource: Hedera Hashgraph\n\nThe gossip about gossip protocol is powered by a Proof-of-Stake mechanism. HBAR coins are staked to the network by node operators to secure the network and validate the hashgraph consensus.\n\nThanks to the hashgraph consensus, Hedera Network achieves asynchronous byzantine fault tolerance, or ABFT. This is a fancy crypto jargon term that means nodes agree with network transactions. ABFT isn\u2019t foolproof because it only requires 66% of nodes to agree for a consensus to be reached. Anyone controlling over 34% of the network might be able to get away with malicious behavior.\n\nHBAR \u2013 The Hedera Token\n\nHBAR is the native cryptocurrency of the Hedera hashgraph network. The use cases for HBAR are similar to other Layer-1 altcoins. HBAR is required to pay transaction fees on the mainnet and secure the Hashgraph through the PoS consensus.\n\nA Hedera crypto wallet and HBAR tokens let you explore the range of permissionless dApps, like decentralized exchanges on the hashgraph. HBAR is also the exchange currency in which Hedera non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, are priced.\n\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning Hedera Hashgraph\u2019s impressive network services and performance metrics. According to the team, the Hedera Network can process over 10,000 transactions per second. This significantly outperforms existing blockchain technologies like Ethereum, which struggle to clear 20 transactions per second.\n\nSource: Hedera Hashgraph\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the hashgraph enables the network to charge a flat fee of $0.0001 for network transactions, regardless of network congestion and HBAR price.\n\nHedera Governing Council\n\nThe Hedera Governing Council is an elite group of up to 39 international companies that oversee the growth and development of the Hedera Hashgraph ecosystem. The Council was formed to ensure the Hedera network would always enjoy decentralized governance and network stability and is made up of some of the world\u2019s largest companies, including IBM, Google, and Boeing.\n\nSource: Hedera Hashgraph\n\nIs Hedera Hashgraph Truly Decentralized?\n\nOne of the Hedera Governing Council\u2019s unique responsibilities is to decide who is and isn\u2019t allowed to operate a validator node and secure the hashgraph. This raises some questions about whether or not Hedera Hashgraph is truly as decentralized as they promise to be.\n\nIn contrast, anyone with sufficient ETH can launch a node on the Ethereum network. Whether or not you\u2019re allowed to operate a network node on Hedera Hashgraph is decided by a centralized source. This is expected to change as the Hedera network finds its feet in the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nMoreover, when Hedera Hashgraph initially launched, its codebase was not open-source. This was done to prevent the chain from being forked but raised concerns about whether or not the Hedera Network was operating in the true spirit of decentralization. Developers needed a license from Hedera before building applications on the network.\n\nFortunately, the Hedera Governing Council followed through on their promise to make their infrastructure open source in 2022.\n\nHedera Hashgraph History & Founders\n\nHedera Hashgraph was launched by co-founders Leemon Baird and Mance Harmon in 2018. The Hashgraph itself is actually a product of Baird and Harmon\u2019s software company Swirlds, which they founded together in 2015.\n\nSwirlds is a key player in the Hedera Ecosystem. The company has patented the hashgraph software and is guaranteed a place on the Hedera Governing Council for the entire lifespan of the Hedera ecosystem.\n\nPros and Cons of Hedera Hashgraph\n\nThe ins and outs of directed acyclic graphs and asynchronous byzantine fault tolerance are dense and complicated. To bring things back to earth, let\u2019s bypass the complex jargon and clarify the simple pros and cons of the Hedera Network.\n\nPros\n\nFast \u2013 Hedera Hashgraph can process over 10,000 transactions per second, making it one of the most performant Layer-1 networks available\n\n\u2013 Hedera Hashgraph can process over 10,000 transactions per second, making it one of the most performant Layer-1 networks available Affordable \u2013 Every transaction on the Hedera network will cost the user less than a penny, regardless of network congestion and HBAR price\n\n\u2013 Every transaction on the Hedera network will cost the user less than a penny, regardless of network congestion and HBAR price Energy efficient \u2013 The Hedera Hashgraph network uses significantly less power than traditional blockchains and has implemented carbon offsetting initiatives to go fully carbon negative\n\n\u2013 The Hedera Hashgraph network uses significantly less power than traditional blockchains and has implemented carbon offsetting initiatives to go fully carbon negative Sustained growth \u2013 There have been over 1.9 million accounts created on the Hedera mainnet, with more being added every day\n\n\u2013 There have been over 1.9 million accounts created on the Hedera mainnet, with more being added every day Accessible \u2013 The Hedera network is EVM-compatible, meaning its user experience will be familiar to anyone who\u2019s used Ethereum before. What\u2019s more, developers can easily port over Ethereum-based dApps to the Hedera network with minimal friction.\n\nCons\n\nHedera is not as decentralized as it appears \u2013 The Hedera Governing Council still controls who is allowed to operate a node on the network. It could also be argued that Swirlds, the company that invented the hashgraph has greater control, power, and influence over the fate of network.\n\n\u2013 The Hedera Governing Council still controls who is allowed to operate a node on the network. It could also be argued that Swirlds, the company that invented the hashgraph has greater control, power, and influence over the fate of network. Undeveloped ecosystem \u2013 Despite its position as a top 50 cryptocurrency in terms of market cap, few decentralized applications are built on the Hedera network. According to DeFiLlama there are only six DeFi apps on the network.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, Hedera Hashgraph is a fascinating network with excellent growth potential. However, it will struggle to attract users until it has a more developed ecosystem.\n\nThe Hedera network is not the only cryptocurrency network that uses a directed acyclic graph. Other layer 1s like Fantom Opera also use this technology and have attracted far more users and developers.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nThe Web 3 world is expanding beyond simple blockchain systems. Projects like Hedera Hashgraph prove there are always creative new ways to improve network infrastructure and drive innovation in the crypto industry.\n\nFAQs"

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s developer call tackled new areas in development for the ETH network.\n\nSentiment towards Ethereum remained positive.\n\nThe Ethereum [ETH] network is known for being a dynamic and constantly evolving ecosystem, and its developers are always working to improve it. Recently, on 7 April, the network\u2019s consensus developers held their weekly call to discuss several pressing issues related to Ethereum\u2019s functionality and performance.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nWhat\u2019s new with Ethereum?\n\nIn the call, Ethereum\u2019s developers discussed the Deneb upgrade progress and MEV-Boost software releases on their weekly call. The Deneb upgrade is the next upgrade after Capella.\n\nMeanwhile, the Capella upgrade, set for 12 April, will enable staked ETH withdrawals. The Shanghai upgrade will activate simultaneously on the mainnet. The developers also launched their third mainnet shadow fork. This would to test the final client software versions for both upgrades. Fortunately, it went smoothly.\n\nChris Hager from the Flashbots team gave an update on the MEV-Boost releases, which were created in response to a rogue validator stealing MEV from searchers. Two significant changes were pushed to the MEV relay software, causing an increase in the number of orphaned blocks.\n\nThe developers agreed that more monitoring and collaboration with relay operators were necessary to identify and analyze data. The developers also stated that more security research on the MEV-Boost codebase was needed, and a coordinated bug bounty program was suggested.\n\nThe sentiment around ETH\n\nAmidst all the uncertainty before the upcoming Shanghai/Shapella upgrade, the sentiment around Ethereum remained positive at press time. On 7 April, Crypto exchange firm OKX conducted a survey amongst crypto users, according to which 63% of respondents predicted that ETH would hit a record high of over USD5,000 by the end of 2023.\n\nThis positive sentiment around ETH may help in gauging retail behavior in terms of ETH in the future.\n\nWhat\u2019s at stake?\n\nAs the Shanghai Upgrade gets closer, the behavior of users who have staked their ETH on the beacon chain will impact Ethereum.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nAccording to data provided by Flipside Crypto, there\u2019s 19.2 million ETH locked in the beacon chain. Out of which, a majority of stakers hold between 0-2 ETH. In the last 24 hours, each validator on the beacon chain has earned an APY of 3.7%.\n\nOnly time will determine how these stakers will react after they unstaking their holdings following the Shapella Upgrade."

        "title": "Ethereum's Scaling Race: Which Layer 2 Crypto Is the Best Buy Right Now? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Over the past few years, it's become clear that Ethereum (ETH 1.64%) has experienced significant growth. But as a result of becoming one of the most popular blockchains in the world, its network has become plagued by slow transaction speeds and costly fees. This extreme congestion has created demand for effective Layer 2 scaling solutions.\n\nLayer 2 scaling solutions are built on top of the Ethereum blockchain to enable faster and cheaper transactions while maintaining the blockchain's decentralization and security features.\n\nThere are currently a handful of Layer 2 scaling solutions that aim to solve Ethereum's issues. But the three front-runners today -- and also those with the most long-term potential -- are Arbitrum (CRYPTO:ARB), Optimism (OP), and Polygon (MATIC 2.14%).\n\nEach of these solutions operates a little differently, and as such have their own pros and cons. Let's see what sets these competitors apart and might be deserving of your hard-earned money.\n\nThe Layer 2 breakdown\n\nTo start, it should be clarified that all these Layer 2 solutions try to accomplish the same thing: Make Ethereum faster and cheaper. For the most part, they all use similar processes but differ slightly in how they actually scale up Ethereum.\n\nThese differences can be highly technical and are likely better saved for a conversation another day, but the key factor to understand is that all of these solutions present trade-offs depending on what they prioritize.\n\nFor example, Arbitrum and Optimism both use rollups, which combine groups of transactions into a single transaction. But Arbitrum does it in a way that is slightly slower, yet dramatically cheaper than Optimism. When looking at Polygon, its method of using a sidechain to process transactions makes it less decentralized than Optimism or Arbitrum.\n\nHowever, Arbitrum and Polygon have robust compatibility with Ethereum, making them great options for developers wanting to create decentralized apps.\n\nEach solution comes with its own benefits and drawbacks, but to truly understand which ones are in the most demand, we can look at some statistics.\n\nBy the numbers\n\nTo quantify each solution, it can be helpful to compare simple metrics such as speed and transaction costs since these are essentially the two reasons there is demand for a Layer 2 solution.\n\nPolygon is able to process as many as 65,000 transactions per second, while maintaining low fees that typically range between $0.1 to $0.5 depending on the transaction size. Arbitrum allows for 40,000 transactions per second, with fees ranging from $0.5 to $0.7. Optimism has the capacity to process up to 2,000 transactions per second, and fees are slightly higher compared to Arbitrum and Polygon, ranging from $0.6 to $0.9.\n\nOther statistics -- such as the number of wallets, number of transactions, and total value locked -- can also help paint a clearer picture of the layer 2 landscape.\n\nWhen it comes to the number of wallets and the number of transactions, the race really isn't even close. Polygon simply dominates. While Optimism lags behind Arbitrum and Polygon significantly, Arbitrum is gaining some ground on Polygon thanks to its newly released token that came out this March.\n\nThe other metric to consider is total value locked (TVL). You could think of this as a way to measure the value each solution supports in decentralized applications. The greater the TVL, the more valuable the solution. Surprisingly, Arbitrum has the highest TVL among these three, coming in at around $2.2 billion. Polygon follows at $1.1 billion, and Optimism is third at $920 million.\n\nThe front-runner\n\nConsidering this combination of statistics, it's clear that Polygon and Arbitrum are providing developers and users with a valuable solution. Both have proven usage, which is reflected in multiple sets of statistics.\n\nAn investment in both could be plausible, but if there is one Layer 2 solution deserving of your money, it is likely Polygon. It has a friendly developer environment, verifiable usage, and the best part: a plethora of partnerships with some of the world's most recognizable brands.\n\nIn the past year or so, companies including JPMorgan Chase, Starbucks, Disney, Nike, and Meta Platforms have all used Polygon in different ways to facilitate new blockchain-based business models.\n\nWith its price still down 62% from its all-time high, Polygon looks to have significant long-term potential, exactly the kind investors should be looking for.\n\nIf there is one downside to Polygon, it would be its higher levels of centralization. If decentralization is a priority, then Arbitrum seems to be the best choice. But with its new token just a few weeks old, I would personally like to see Arbitrum build more of a track record.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The upgrade will complete the network\u2019s transition to a proof-of-stake system, which started in October 2022 with the Merge.\n\nAround 18 million ETH will be available for withdrawal following Shanghai. According to Raman, that may lead to some selling pressure on ETH\u2019s price in the short term.\n\nHowever, in the long run, the ability to unstake Ether will \u201cde-risk the ETH investment in a tremendous way,\u201d he pointed out. In particular, institutional investors that couldn\u2019t get involved earlier in staking will feel more comfortable once ETH can be unstaked. More capital entering ETH staking will improve the Ethereum network in the long run.\n\n\u201cThe more native proof-of-stake asset that\u2019s staked, the higher the cost to attack the chain,\u201d Raman pointed out.\n\nTo find out more about the implications of the upcoming Ethereum upgrade, check out the full interview on our YouTube channel and don\u2019t forget to subscribe!\n\nMagazine: \u2018Account abstraction\u2019 supercharges Ethereum wallets: Dummies guide"

Although the growth was not without challenges, the chain backed by crypto exchange Binance has been able to cut a significant part of the market share.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 BNBs worth today?\n\nAmong both blockchains, Ethereum is the one that has been around longer. But according to Token Terminal, daily active users on the BNB Chain were also three times that of Ethereum. The metric measures users that interact with a protocol during a designated time interval.\n\nThe choice to prefer the faster and cheaper chain only\u2026\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s active users were around 435,200, BNB Chain\u2019s outpaced it with a record of 1.2 million. Although the Ethereum L1 blockchain is less centralized than BNB, this rise implied that users would rather opt for the network with faster transactions and cheaper fees.\n\nHowever, BNB Chain\u2019s dominance in the aforementioned aspect did not translate to supremacy in every other area. Based on the data from the blockchain financial aggregator, the trading volume of tokens on the Ethereum blockchain was far above those registered on the BNB Chain.\n\nAs of 6 April, the volume on the BNB Chain was $601.1 million while Ethereum\u2019s volume was over $11 billion. This large spread means that there have been more tokens traded via the Ethereum network than BNB\u2019s.\n\nETH stays ahead of the game in\u2026\n\nMoreover, it seemed that the overall Ethereum ecosystem was hand down beating BNB apart from the user count. According to Santiment, Ethereum\u2019s development activity witnessed a rise and stood at 51.21. The metric tracks the work done in a project\u2019s public GitHub repositories, signaling upgrades on the project\u2019s network.\n\nThe Ethereum rise in this regard came as no surprise. Lately, the blockchain had passed the Sepolia and Goerli Testnets, as the Shanghai upgrade aimed at enabling staking withdrawals is only days away.\n\nFor BNB, it was an entirely different situation. At the time of writing, the chain\u2019s development activity was flat out at 0.048. This suggested that developers were not actively contributing, despite its recent announcement to improve the chain\u2019s security.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s BNB\u2019s market cap in ETH\u2019s terms\n\nHowever, several large ETH transactions have been making rounds with whale accumulating, and some moving into exchanges. According to Lookonchain, a whale who held 900ETH in Tornado Cash address sent all of it into a Bitfinex wallet on 5 April.\n\nThere was another whale who has been accumulating the altcoin since 15 January. As of 6 April, this same whale added another $2.4 million bought from Binance, to his bag."

The first stage is using Ethereum\u2019s Goerli testing network.\n\nThe project has some serious backing and announced $50 million in a Series A funding round in late March led by crypto venture firm Blockchain Capital, along with Coinbase Ventures, Polychain Capital, Electric Capital and Finality Capital Partner.\n\nEigenLayer aims to become a decentralized marketplace for Ethereum node operators and validators to earn fees on additional services. It allows them to restake assets they received in exchange for staking Ether on platforms such as Lido (stETH) and RocketPool (rETH). The assets can be reused to validate and secure other networks, such as sidechains or non-EVM blockchains.\n\nAccording to the white paper, EigenLayer also has plans to enable restaking for ETH withdrawn from the Beacon Chain following the Shapella upgrade.\n\n\u201cEthereum validators can set their beacon chain withdrawal credentials to the EigenLayer smart contracts, and opt-in to new modules built on EigenLayer.\u201d\n\nThe protocol aims to address issues with validator economic incentives.

        "title": "What is Shibarium, and what does it mean for Shiba Inu? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "What is Shibarium? Shibarium is an upcoming layer-2 (L2) blockchain network built on Ethereum for Shiba Inu. It will transform Shiba Inu, a memecoin, into a complete ecosystem. Ryoshi, the anonymous creator of Shiba Inu, proposed the Shibarium project in a now-deleted blog post in May 2021. The project intends to build a blockchain layer-2 solution on the Ethereum blockchain. The expansion will transform Shiba Inu from a memecoin into a comprehensive ecosystem that includes a decentralized exchange (DEX), a metaverse and blockchain games, such as Shiba Eternity. Memecoins are cryptocurrency tokens depicted with comical or animated internet memes. Generally highly volatile, these coins are largely driven by pop culture and have an ample supply leading to high inflation. Shiba Inu (SHIB) itself has a total supply of 1 quadrillion, which equals 1,000 trillion. The Shibarium portal is aimed at reorganizing Shiba Inu as a multi-project and a stable ecosystem. Shibarium developers haven\u2019t yet released a launch date for the project. An alpha preview of SHIB metaverse, a part of the project, however, was on display at SXSW 2023 from March 13 to 15. The release was originally planned for February 2023 but was delayed because the developers were keen on launching an error-free version after thorough testing through various phases.\n\nWhat does Shibarium mean for Shiba Inu? The advantages of using Shibarium include higher transaction speeds, lower fees, increased token utility and seamless decentralized application (DApp) development. Despite its upgrade to a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain through the Merge, the Ethereum blockchain still struggled with scalability, despite its robust security layer. Shibarium is also a PoS project, which will help Shiba Inu to scale while keeping it hooked to Ethereum blockchain. Shibarium is expected to stabilize the value of SHIB and transform Shiba Inu into a value-added project with long-term prospects. Let us see below how Shibarium will unlock the potential infused in the memecoin. Better transaction speeds Adding layer 2 to the Shiba Inu ecosystem, Shibarium will increase throughput, enabling the project to handle significant growth. Shibarium is expected to boost the transaction speed considerably, though users will have to wait a bit more for precise information on throughput. Lower fees High transaction fees have been a problem for anyone performing a transaction on Ethereum. Sometimes, the fee is higher than the transaction amount. For instance, one might need to pay a steep fee of $50 worth of Ether (ETH) for a small transaction of $10 in value. The introduction of the Shibarium layer-2 solution is likely to make gas fees negligible. Complete ecosystem Contrary to being a mere memecoin, the Shibarium ecosystem will be comprehensive, comprising several projects, including SHIB metaverse, ShibaSwap DEX and blockchain games. The metaverse and games are expected to pull in users, while the DEX will provide better liquidity. Token utility The abundant supply of SHIB, despite the burning of more than 40% of the tokens, has been a huge hindrance to its growth. Shibarium handles this by introducing BONE as the native coin. When Shibarium takes off, validators on the network will get paid in BONE for securing and validating transactions. Moreover, in the new ecosystem, every transaction will consume SHIB, a mechanism to control the hugely inflated supply of SHIB. DApp development DApps are decentralized applications with backend code executing on a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) network. The memecoin, however, simply did not have the wherewithal to act as a native coin of DApps. Shibarium intends to develop a robust ecosystem comprising a layer-2 solution in conjunction with Ethereum. It will provide the technical ability to create DApps within the ecosystem.\n\nHow will Shibarium work? Shibarium will take away a large chunk of transactions off of the Ethereum blockchain, resulting in quicker throughput without compromising on security. The mechanism to burn tokens will help keep inflation in check. The upcoming Shibarium will function by handling transactions while retaining the security layer of Ethereum. As most network activities are handled by Shibarium itself, Ethereum will be relieved of the sheer volume of transactions that might swamp it. This will result in faster yet secure transactions. Before adopting PoS, the low throughput of Ethereum resulted in network congestion and pushed up gas fees to an astronomical $50\u2013$80 per transaction. The Merge boosted the throughput of the network and brought down fees. Still, L2 solutions are required, as the base blockchain has to handle a stream of projects that slows it down. To stem the inflation of the SHIB coin and set its prices in an upward motion, the Shibarium portal will have a mechanism to burn SHIB tokens paid as fees for executing transactions. This will bring down the coins in circulation and stabilize the price of tokens. Coin burning is a mechanism to send tokens to one-way wallets that accept the tokens but never release them. These coins are lost forever. Over time, the continual burning of coins keeps inflation at bay in cryptocurrency projects.\n\nWhich coins will make up the Shibarium ecosystem? The Shibarium ecosystem will have several coins with different roles. Shibarium will have a drastically different look compared to Shiba Inu. The new ecosystem, however, will have several digital tokens, all named in line with the dog theme: SHIB: An ERC-20 token that fuels Shiba Inu, SHIB has been around since August 2020. Its price has always fluctuated and never crossed the $1 mark per token.\n\nBONE: A governance token on ShibaSwap, BONE is now also a utility token in Shibarium. Developers are paid in BONE. The token\u2019s supply is capped at 230 million coins.\n\nLEASH: With its supply limited to 107,646 tokens, LEASH is staked by holders to earn rewards. Rewards include xLEASH tokens that users can mint after unstaking.\n\nTREAT: Designed as a reward token, TREAT will be paid to validators and developers along with BONE after reaching a certain threshold. It will also incentivize liquidity pools on ShibaSwap.\n\nSHI: The Shibarium ecosystem will have the SHI stablecoin as well. The purpose of SHI is to counter and balance payments while staving off market fluctuations. Related: How and why do stablecoins depeg?"

        "content": "Hackers were able to gain access to more than $320 million in the first quarter of 2023 alone, according to on-chain data consolidated by blockchain security firm CertiK in its quarterly report.\n\nThe losses were significantly lower than in 2022\u2019s first and fourth quarters, when hackers took around $1.3 billion and $950 million, respectively. According to CertiK, the low amount of losses may be linked to events happening off-chain that had an impact on the crypto industry as a whole, such as the issues with Silvergate Bank and the depegging of USD Coin (USDC) at the height of the Silicon Valley Bank collapse.\n\nOut of the funds stolen within the quarter, over $31 million was lost to 90 exit scams, while more than $222 million was lost in 52 flash loan and oracle manipulation exploits. Regarding incidents and the amount lost per blockchain, CertiK highlighted that BNB Chain had 139 incidents, the greatest number for the quarter. Meanwhile, despite having fewer incidents, Ethereum had $221 million in losses, the most lost in Q1 2023.\n\nNumber of incidents and the amount lost in the first quarter of 2023 by blockchain. Source: CertiK\n\nDespite being much lower than Q1 2022 and Q4 2022, the first quarter of 2023 was still met with hundreds of millions lost, with 60% coming from the recent Euler Finance hack. On March 13, the protocol was hacked through a flash loan exploit, leading to losses of over $195 million.\n\nRelated: Sandwich trading bots lose bread and butter in $25M exploit\n\nWhile the amount lost to hacking looks enormous at a glance, a huge chunk of the funds was recovered through negotiations with hackers. On April 4, Euler Finance announced that it was able to recover around 90% of the lost funds after almost a month of back-and-forth negotiations with the hacker.\n\nThis trend has been witnessed in the space more frequently with other hacks following Euler\u2019s example. On April 6, lending protocol Sentiment also recovered around $870,000 after giving a bounty of $95,000 to those responsible for taking almost a million dollars from the platform.\n\nMagazine: Magazine: Huawei NFTs, Toyota\u2019s hackathon, North Korea vs. Blockchain: Asia Express"

        "content": "Matter Labs, the team behind Ethereum layer 2 scaling solution zkSync, has confirmed that 921 Ether (ETH) worth $1.7 million is currently stuck in one of its new smart contracts, GemstoneIDO.\n\nHowever, the firm claims the funds to be \u201csafe\u201d and to have found an \u201celegant\u201d solution for rescuing the funds, which accumulated during the Gemholic token sale.\n\nInitially stating that the funds wouldn\u2019t be \u201cstuck forever,\u201d Matter Labs said in its most recent tweet that it had found an \u201celegant solution\u201d to \u201cunfreeze\u201d the GemstoneIDO contract and transfer the funds out.\n\n@GemholicECO, who ran into a problem with their smart contract on zkSync Era, has reached out to us for support, which we provided.\n\n\n\nWe'd like to give the community an update and further context on their issue in full transparency, as we always have and always will.\n\n\n\n\u2014 zkSync \u220e (@zksync) April 7, 2023\n\nMatter Labs identified the issue to have stemmed from the .transfer() function in the GemstoneIDO smart contract, which is part of a project run by the GemholicECO ecosystem.\n\nMatter Labs said that the issue could have been prevented had they deployed the contract on a testnet first.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the contracts were deployed on Era mainnet without having been tried on the testnet or local node, which would have immediately caught the problem.\u201d\n\nThe faulty function came from zkSync Era, a new type of Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) zero knowledge proof rollup that executes smart contract much faster than on the base layer.\n\nThe team however stressed that zkSync Era is not EVM-equivalent, meaning that it is compatible with the EVM at a bytecode level. This means some functions work differently in the new environment.\n\n\u201cThis is a deliberate design choice with specific upsides and trade-offs,\u201d they said.\n\nIn justifying its design choice, Matter Labs said zkSync Era could process some transaction types between 10 to 1,000 times cheaper than other EVM rollups.\n\nNontheless, Matter Labs held themselves accountable for the mistake and assured members of the zkSync ecosystem that they'll continue resolve similar issues relentlessly.\n\n\u201cWith this comes great responsibility and inevitably the occasional friction and today was one of these instances. When there are problems our team will continue to be on alert and be relentless in resolving issues.\u201d\n\nzkEVMs are complex systems that are in the process of maturing. Even though zkSync Era is still in Alpha, we\u2019ve already got a thriving ecosystem. \u2014 zkSync \u220e (@zksync) April 7, 2023\n\nSeveral members of the CryptoCurrency subreddit, however, expressed their frustration on the matter:\n\n\u201cAnother example of why a chain shouldnt be rushing its mainnet launch. Always remember this guys, EVM compatible =/= EVM equivalent.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m all in for seeing Zero Knowledge tech becoming more and more relevant in the crypto space. However, these chains also have to take into consideration the fact that people\u2019s funds are at stake,\u201d said another.\n\nRelated: zkSync Era launches with Uniswap and Sushi \u2014 First zkEVM on mainnet\n\nTransaction failures of the GemstoneIDO contract can be seen on the zkSync explorer page, which also shows the 921 Ether is stored in its smart contract.\n\nMatter Labs confirmed that GemstoneIDO, a smart contract in the broader Gemholic.ECO ecosystem, was the contract at concern.

        "content": "Cosmos switches gears for the fast lane to mass adoption.\n\nATOM fails to overcome range amid low volatility and limited volumes prevail.\n\nThe blockchain interoperability concept made rounds during the 2021 crypto bull run, and was championed by the likes of the Cosmos network. Unfortunately, they had to pump the brakes when crypto winter came. However, Cosmos is now attempting to revive the hype once again.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Cosmos Profit Calculator\n\nCosmos\u2019s latest announcement revealed its intentions to start pushing towards building and expanding an interconnected internet of blockchains again. The network disclosed that it plans to work on the implementation of IBC with solidity, a move that will make it possible for Ethereum [ETH] to be connected to Cosmos.\n\n1/ 2023 is the year that #IBC will expand to new blockchains, including #Ethereum@datachain_en, an @interchain_io granted team, is working on IBC-Solidity. The Solidity implementation of IBC aims to connect Ethereum to #Cosmos \u269b\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/tPVD6lnl6v \u2014 Cosmos \u2013 Internet of Blockchains \u269b\ufe0f (@cosmos) April 6, 2023\n\nCosmos further noted that IBC-solidity will enable the transfer of data, tokens, and messages to multiple blockchains through IBC. This includes enterprise Ethereum and all the EVM-compatible blockchain networks.\n\nWhy Ethereum is such a big part of Cosmos\u2019 plan\n\nThe Ethereum network can be considered as the most popular blockchain and also the most adopted blockchain network at the moment. Additionally, many networks hope to tap into its robust liquidity. This will become much easier to conduct via the IBC as soon as it gets connected to Ethereum. The overall goal is to facilitate a smoother flow of value across different blockchain networks.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the announcement about Ethereum came just a few days after Cosmos revealed its global expansion plans. From a strategic point of view, onboarding Ethereum before executing a global expansion plan might make Cosmos and the IBC more attractive to other potential prospects.\n\nWhat does the future look like for ATOM?\n\nThe demand for ATOM should go up as more blockchains get connected to the Cosmos hub. This is because the coin is necessary for projects looking to join the Cosmos ecosystem. As far as ATOM\u2019s performance is concerned, at press time, the token was still trading at a slight premium as compared to its December 2022 lows. However, it delivered sideways action for the last 12 days or so.\n\nATOM\u2019s relative strength improved over the last few days and was attempting to push above the 50% Relative Strength Index (RSI) level. This was of course backed by accumulation as indicated by the Money Flow Index (MFI). Furthermore, ATOM could also witness a bullish breakthrough if it manages to break past the RSI mid level. Failure to do so may lend favor to the bears.\n\nHow many are 1,10,100 ATOMs worth today\n\nATOM\u2019s volatility was at its highest four-week peak at mid-March. Volatility has since then been declining since then. This reflected the lack of momentum as seen in the last two weeks. Similarly, weighted sentiment remained low suggesting a lack of confidence in the market.\n\nHowever, there were some positive sentiments such as the growing development activity metric. This combined with the Binance funding rate\u2019s recovery confirmed that demand was recovering in the derivatives segment.\n\nThings may turn out favorably if Cosmos proceeds and succeeds with its plans this year. Such an outcome would certainly boost ATOM\u2019s potential value."

Such a suite of high-profile financial backing highligfts the growing interest in the innovative re-staking protocol.\n\nEigenLayer intends to enable Ethereum validators and stakers to re-stake their assets onto emerging networlks, such as sidechains or non-EVM blockchains. By reusing assets acquired through staking Ether on platforms like Lido (stETH) and RocketPool (rETH), validators can support the growth and security of other networks. Furthermore, the protocol plans to facilitate re-staking for ETH withdrawn from the Beacon Chain following the Shapella upgrade.\n\nEigenLayer's primary goal is to address the economic incentive issues faced by validators. Founder Sreeram Kannan believes that enabling the transfer and re-staking of ETH onto other networks will provide additional yields for validators and stakers, while promoting the secure growth of smaller networks.\n\nLubin's Ethereal Ventures fund has also invested in EigenLayer, further undersdcoring the project's potential impact on the Ethereum ecosystem.Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin recently praised the EigenLayer project, stating:\n\n\"The Eigen Labs team is at the forefront of some of the most exciting work happening in Ethereum.\"\n\n\n\nCurrently, approximately 17.9 million ETH are staked on the Beacon Chain, valued at around $33.6 billion, which surpasses the entire market capitalization of USDC. This figure represents nearly 15% of the total Ethereum supply.\n\nAs EigenLayer's testnet launch unfolds, the team will focus on refining the protocol and gathering feedback from users and developers. The mainnet release, anticipated for Q3, promises a more streamlined and rewarding staking experience for Ethereum users while bolstering network security and stability.\n\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Once the one-million email subscription goal is reached, the team will send out a single email announcing the launch of the ERC-20 token. The project is attempting something that has not been achieved on a global scale before.\n\nTo ensure the validity of the project\u2019s one million email subscription goal, the team will send out a verification email to confirm that all users added are genuine. The team has not revealed their identities and will not be providing tokenomics about the crypto coin.\n\nBitcoin: A Strong Investment Choice\n\nBitcoin is currently the largest cryptocurrency on the market, and more and more establishments are starting to accept it as a payment method. In Paris, Burger King has introduced power bank rental machines called Instpower, which accept crypto payments such as BTC. These machines are connected to Binance Pay and Alchemy Pay.\n\nThis move by Burger King in Paris is part of a larger trend of companies embracing cryptocurrency payments, highlighting the growing acceptance and legitimacy of digital currencies. With the rise of crypto and the growing demand for alternative payment methods, more businesses will likely start accepting cryptocurrency payments in the near future.\n\nEthereum Holders Await Price Rally\n\nMany Ethereum holders are eagerly anticipating a price rally, as suggested by crypto analyst Justin Bennett. Bennett speculates that Ethereum may face a rally that could liquidate traders facing bearish action on ETH\u2019s platform. The rally at the end of March could hint at the crypto market\u2019s short-term performance.\n\nWhile the crypto market is typically affected by stock market trends, there is often a lag between the two asset classes. If the crypto market takes cues from equities, a resistance level at $1,840 for Ethereum is possible. Therefore, a short squeeze could occur, triggering rallies, as there is a considerable amount of short liquidations over the $2,000 price level.\n\nEmbracing the Future of Finance with Crypto Coins\n\nAs Paris embraces cryptocurrency and recognizes its benefits and potential as an alternative to traditional forms of currency, it may inspire other countries to follow suit. While crypto investments do carry risks due to economic conditions and market volatility, accepting crypto as part of the future of finance can help everyone adapt to the changing landscape of the digital economy.\n\nSignuptoken.com could become the next major crypto coin to launch on an exchange.

        "title": "EigenLayer Protocol Allows Restaking of Ethereum Assets on Emerging Networks - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "The EigenLayer protocol, which aims to become a decentralized marketplace for Ethereum node operators and validators to earn fees on additional services, has launched on testnet. The protocol allows ETH validators and stakers to \u201cre-stake\u201d their assets onto other emerging networks. Testing will be phased in three stages to onboard various participants into the ecosystem, with the first stage using Ethereum\u2019s Goerli testing network. The mainnet launch of the EigenLayer protocol is expected in Q3.\n\nRestaking Assets to Incentivize Validators and Stakers\n\nEigenLayer founder Sreeram Kannan said that facilitating the moving and re-staking of ETH onto other networks would incentivize validators and stakers with additional yields and allow smaller networks to grow securely. According to the white paper, EigenLayer also has plans to enable restaking for ETH withdrawn from the Beacon Chain following the Shapella upgrade. The protocol aims to address issues with validator economic incentives.\n\nEigenLayer has serious backing, having announced $50 million in a Series A funding round in late March led by crypto venture firm Blockchain Capital, along with Coinbase Ventures, Polychain Capital, Electric Capital, and Finality Capital Partner. Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin has also praised the project, stating that \u201c[t]he Eigen Labs team is at the forefront of some of the most exciting work happening in Ethereum. Eigenlayer is a new paradigm for fostering protocol-centric innovation through a programmatic, decentralized trust marketplace.\u201d\n\nCurrent State of Ethereum Staking\n\nThere are currently 17.9 million ETH staked on the Beacon Chain, according to the Ultrasound. Money tracker. At current prices, this is valued at around $33.6 billion, which is more than the entire market capitalization of USDC. It represents almost 15% of the entire Ethereum supply. The high level of staked ETH on the Beacon Chain highlights the importance of the staking mechanism in the Ethereum network. However, there are concerns about the economic incentives for validators and stakers, particularly as the Ethereum network transitions from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake.\n\nThe Role of EigenLayer in the Ethereum Ecosystem\n\nEigenLayer aims to address some of these concerns by providing a decentralized marketplace for ETH node operators and validators to earn fees on additional services. The ability to restake assets received in exchange for staking Ether on platforms such as Lido (stETH) and RocketPool (rETH) on other networks could incentivize validators and stakers with additional yields. This, in turn, could encourage more participation in the Ethereum network, as well as other emerging networks.\n\nEigenLayer\u2019s plans to enable restaking for ETH withdrawn from the Beacon Chain following the Shapella upgrade could also provide additional incentives for validators and stakers. The ability to restake withdrawn assets could encourage more participation in the Ethereum network, as well as other networks that use the Ethereum protocol. The protocol aims to become a decentralized marketplace for validator services, with additional modules built on top of EigenLayer. This could create a more competitive marketplace for validator services, potentially leading to better economic incentives for validators and stakers.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe launch of the EigenLayer protocol on testnet represents a significant development for the Ethereum ecosystem. The ability to restake assets received in exchange for staking Ether on other networks could provide additional incentives for validators and stakers. This, in turn, could encourage more participation in the Ethereum network, as well as other emerging networks. EigenLayer\u2019s plans to enable restaking for ETH withdrawn from the Beacon Chain following the Shapella upgrade could also provide additional incentives for validators and stakers."
