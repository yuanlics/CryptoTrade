        "title": "Will Ethereum Be a Trillion-Dollar Cryptocurrency by 2025? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Currently trading at just under $2,000, Ethereum (ETH 0.42%) has a market capitalization of $227 billion, making it the world's second-largest cryptocurrency. Ethereum now accounts for about 20% of the entire value of the $1.2 trillion crypto market.\n\nSo what would it take for Ethereum to more than quadruple in value to become a trillion-dollar cryptocurrency? For one, it would require Ethereum to continue to find innovative use cases for its blockchain technology. Second, it would most likely require Ethereum to surpass Bitcoin (BTC 0.56%) as the world's most popular cryptocurrency. Let's take a closer look at both of these factors.\n\nPost-Merge roadmap\n\nThe good news is that Ethereum's co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, has plenty of upgrades, changes, and tweaks planned for the cryptocurrency. At the end of November 2022, he released an updated roadmap for Ethereum, and it's impressive. According to Buterin, Ethereum's transformation is still only 55% complete, even after last year's landmark upgrade known as The Merge. There are five big upgrade stages ahead, known as the Surge, Scourge, Verge, Purge, and Splurge.\n\nThe big question, of course, is what types of innovative use cases will emerge from each of these upgrades. In April, we saw the completion of one such upgrade, known as Shapella, which made crypto staking on the platform much more attractive to investors. The next big upgrade, now scheduled for the end of 2023, could lead to Ethereum being able to support 100,000 transactions per second in the near-term future. That type of raw processing speed would make Ethereum much more attractive to both users and developers.\n\nEthereum has a strong track record of innovation, and each new improvement to the blockchain typically leads to a completely unexpected new use case scenario. Thus, if there are five upgrades ahead, that's five new opportunities for new breakthrough innovations. Ethereum's post-Merge roadmap might be incredibly wonky, filled with terms like \"proto-danksharding,\" but I think it could be the key to unlocking this crypto's full valuation potential.\n\nCan Ethereum flip Bitcoin?\n\nIn crypto circles, one hypothetical scenario is known as \"the flippening.\" This is the moment when Ethereum finally surpasses Bitcoin as the world's most valuable cryptocurrency. Throughout its history, Ethereum has always played second fiddle to Bitcoin in terms of market capitalization. At some point, though, Ethereum could eventually \"flip\" Bitcoin.\n\nMost likely, Ethereum will need to surpass Bitcoin for it to become a trillion-dollar cryptocurrency. Until it happens, the math simply doesn't work. Investors can't assume that the entire crypto market is going to increase in value at the same rate as Ethereum. The math only works if Ethereum gains market share from other cryptos such as Bitcoin.\n\nThere are several factors in Ethereum's favor here. A big one is Ethereum's smart contract platform, which gives it much greater utility than Bitcoin. With Ethereum, the number of use cases includes non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, the metaverse, and Web3. And just about every new technological innovation -- such as artificial intelligence -- is better suited to running on Ethereum than Bitcoin. Thus, in the near-term future, it is likely that Ethereum will grow faster than Bitcoin.\n\nMoreover, thanks to The Merge, Ethereum is now a modern proof-of-stake blockchain, while Bitcoin is still an old proof-of-work blockchain. That means Ethereum no longer requires crypto mining, and that makes the blockchain 99.9% more energy efficient. Given the debate on the environment and climate change, this is a big deal. For example, in September 2022, the White House released a detailed study on the harmful environmental effects of Bitcoin mining. As people become more aware of the environmental effects of different cryptos, it might lead to more investors moving their money out of Bitcoin and into Ethereum.\n\nThe path to $1 trillion\n\nWhile Ethereum definitely has a path to a $1 trillion market cap, the road will not be easy. Consider, for example, that only a handful of stocks currently have trillion-dollar market valuations. Getting to this valuation for Ethereum would represent a real milestone, and one that will likely require overcoming a number of regulatory obstacles along the way.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, I'm bullish on Ethereum's medium- to long-term prospects. Within the next few years, it is entirely within the realm of possibility that Ethereum will become a trillion-dollar cryptocurrency as long as it continues to execute on its roadmap for growth."

        "content": "Despite the crypto market\u2019s turn toward a cautiously positive sentiment, things aren\u2019t looking good for Ethereum\u2019s competitors, according to Jonah Van Bourg.\n\nOn the 1000X podcast (Spotify/Apple), Cumberland\u2019s global head of trading says user counts and wallet addresses have plateaued on alternative layer-1 blockchains.\n\n\u201cYour Solanas, NEARs and Polkadots \u2014 and all these other coins \u2014 these ecosystems are dead on arrival at this point.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Ethereum layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism are flourishing, Van Bourg says. According to Blockworks Research, the TVL, or total value locked \u2014 a measure of the monetary value that resides in a blockchain\u2019s ecosystem \u2014 is comparatively low on competing chains.\n\nThe current total value locked in Solana stands at approximately $320 million, a little more than one percent of Ethereum\u2019s TVL, which is currently around $26 billion.\n\nEthereum-based layer-2 chains Arbitrum and Optimism are trending positively and already overshadow Solana\u2019s TVL with values of approximately $2 billion and $900 million, respectively.\n\nChart by Blockworks Research analyst Spencer Hughes\n\n\u201cSo is the multichain thesis still alive for the next cycle?\u201d Van Bourg asks. \u201cI vote no. I think it\u2019s time to write it off.\u201d\n\nThe greed factor\n\nAvi Feldman, GoldenTree\u2019s head of digital asset trading, is quick to disagree.\n\n\u201cGreed is too large to write it off,\u201d he says. \u201cYou get projects that are willing to build on things like Solana and Avalanche and NEAR and all of these other protocols because if they\u2019re a competent, good team, they can win that space.\u201d\n\nIncentive programs will draw value to competing protocols, Felman argues, \u201cwhen the bull market comes back.\u201d\n\nBut incentive programs have been the \u201conly draw\u201d for the competing chains, Van Bourg retorts. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t last forever.\u201d\n\nFelman expects competing chains to experience a \u201crenaissance\u201d due to their novelty and the \u201cgreed factor,\u201d arguing that by onboarding people with incentives, they may potentially reach \u201cescape velocity\u201d to become \u201creal projects.\u201d\n\nReferring to a previous interview with Galaxy Digital\u2019s Mike Novogratz (Spotify/Apple), Van Bourg says the next bull cycle will be the \u201cshow me\u201d stage of crypto, whereby projects need to prove their worth at a practical level.\n\n\u201cWhat computational ability is possible on Solana that isn\u2019t possible on Arbitrum or Optimism at this point?\u201d he asks.\n\nFelman says it\u2019s not so much about the tech itself, but instead a matter of \u201cuse-case fit.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe constraint is not always the tech. The constraint is figuring out what to do with the tech,\u201d he says.\n\nVan Bourg agrees, but suggests that the argument only further proves his point. \u201cIf it isn\u2019t about the tech, what\u2019s the advantage of one shiny alt-L1 versus another versus ETH?\u201d Ethereum, he says, \u201cgives you everything you need right now for today\u2019s limited slate of use-cases.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf ETH was bowling over because of too many people trying to use it or too much throughput,\u201d Van Bourg says, \u201cthen you have an alt-L1 thesis right there.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Ethereum Consolidating For 6 Months. Good Or Bad? - Investing Haven",
        "content": "The price of Ethereum is now consolidating for 6 full months, in a narrow range between 1550 and 1950. In crypto terms, a consolidation of 6 months in a range of some 25% is pretty unusual. ETH is now even less volatile than BTC, which is also pretty unusual. Moreover, so far in 2023, ETH did not really participate to the crypto \u2018golden weeks\u2019 momentum trend(s). Crypto is known to be hyper-volatile. Consolidations tend to occur in a wider range, they also don\u2019t tend to last for long. Is this good or bad?\n\nWell, it\u2019s not about the consolidation that is good or bad, overall the longer the consolidation the better\u2026 it\u2019s really about the chart setup and structure.\n\nTruth to be told, the chart setup of ETH is very different compared to, for instance, XRP. It\u2019s no secret that the long term profile of XRP is amazing, as explained in XRP The Most Beautiful Long Term Crypto Chart Of 2023, and more recently in Our XRP Price Forecast Of 10 USD Is Now Confirmed. On the other hand, XRP holders had to wait for 2 full years to recover from the destructive impact that the SEC had created.\n\nIf we carefully look at the ETH chart, since it hit its ATH, we observe a few things:\n\nThe 6-month consolidation is orderly. We see a series of slightly higher lows, in fact it\u2019s a process that started around year-end. This is good, looks like ETH is gathering energy to create bullish momentum at a later point in time. In terms of resistance, it is blatantly clear how powerful resistance is right at the 50% retracement level (between its ATH and June 2022 lows), see the fine purple line on the chart. In August of 2022 as well as April of 2023, the 50% retracement level was tested. In the former situation, it resulted in a big drop. In the latter situation, we got a much softer drop. Overall, selling pressure is fading. That is, by far, the most important conclusion from this chart.\n\nThe last point is key, as it aligns with the overall rotational dynamics that characterize markets in the last 18 months. Rotation is huge, unusual, across all markets. Crypto is part of this dynamic, whether we like it or not.\n\nWe sense that both BTC and ETH are consolidating, right below their 50% retracement level, waiting in the queue of global markets, until its their turn to create bullish momentum.\n\nWe explained the \u2018golden weeks\u2019 concept in this article Crypto Investing Strategies Should Focus On Timing The \u2018Golden Weeks\u2019. In fact, the \u2018golden weeks\u2019 is the basis for our strategy in our premium crypto investing research service. ETH seems to be waiting, patiently, diligently, gathering steam, for its \u2018golden weeks\u2019 to come.\n\nThe only question, top of our mind, is from which level ETH will start a breakout and when exactly. The downside seems contained. Will ETH be able to break through 2000 USD this summer or this fall? We believe it will be either/or.\n\nIn the meantime, crypto enthusiasts can check out the crypto segment that is set up for outperformance whenever bullish momentum hits the crypto sector.

Discover SCENE\n\nA wallet address containing pre-mined Ethereum worth $116 million in current prices transferred its entire balance of 61,216 ETH to an address associated with the Kraken crypto exchange.\n\nThe wallet had remained dormant for eight years before this transaction took place on July 18, at 11:30 pm UTC.\n\nAs revealed by blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain, the wallet was part of Ethereum's public crowdsale in 2014, with the owner securing their tokens at an ICO price of approximately $0.31 per ETH.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAn Ethereum ICO participant woke up after 8 years of dormancy and deposited all 61,216 $ETH($116M) to #Kraken 2 hrs ago. He received 61,216 $ETH($116M currently) at Ethereum Genesis, the ETH ICO price is ~$0.31.https://t.co/HLSXvqyBDb pic.twitter.com/YWVlIcxN99 \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 19, 2023\n\nThe Ethereum ICO\n\nEthereum's Initial Coin Offering (ICO) is considered one of the most significant events in the history of the crypto industry. The public crowdsale, also known as the Genesis event, took place between July 22, 2014, and September 2, 2014 and was conducted by the Ethereum Foundation, a non-profit organization responsible for developing and promoting the Ethereum platform.\n\nDuring the ICO, the Ethereum Foundation issued a total of 60 million Ether (ETH) tokens to early investors and supporters in exchange for their contributions in Bitcoin, raising $18.3 million. These contributions were used to fund the development of the Ethereum blockchain and its native cryptocurrency, Ether.\n\nThe success of Ethereum's ICO paved the way for many other blockchain projects to raise capital through token sales, leading to the proliferation of ICOs in the following years. However, the ICO boom also brought about regulatory challenges and concerns about scams and fraudulent projects, prompting regulatory authorities to take a closer look at the cryptocurrency fundraising model.\n\nAs for the transaction in question, data from Etherscan also shows that it incurred a remarkably low transaction fee of 0.00168 ETH, or $3.21.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNotably, the sender took a precautionary step by conducting a test transaction of 0.05 ETH to the Kraken address. This test transaction likely served as a way to verify the accuracy of the recipient address and ensure that the transfer process would be successful without any mistakes or errors that could lead to the loss of funds.\n\nThe wallet owner\u2019s identity, as well as their reason for moving the funds, remain unknown, but the latter could be due to a number of factors\u2014such as a shift in investment strategy or simply grabbing an opportunity to cash in on Ethereum\u2019s price increase.\n\nThis is not the first time this year when whales\u2014as the holders of large amounts of cryptocurrencies are otherwise known\u2014have moved funds that were sitting dormant for years.\n\nIn February, a Satoshi-era Bitcoin address that was inactive since 2012 moved 412 BTC worth $9.6 million. Another notable transaction occurred in May, when 139 BTC obtained back in 2011 and worth $3.75 million were sent to a newly-created address.\n\nAlso in May, an Ethereum whale identified as a participant in Ethereum\u2019s ICO that had lain dormant for more than two years, decided to stake as much as 4,032 ETH, or approximately $7.4 million."

        "title": "Pre-Mined Ethereum Worth $116M Moves After 8 Years: Is A Major Price Dip Imminent? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "A pre-mined stash of Ethereum, dormant for nearly eight years and now valued at roughly $116 million, has been moved abruptly. This transaction raises questions about potential market implications and whether it could trigger a notable price dip for Ethereum.\n\nEight years ago, during Ethereum\u2019s pre-mine period, the wallet accumulated a total of 61,216 ETH. Back then, the value of the tokens was around $18,976, but due to Ethereum\u2019s exponential growth, the value has now escalated over a thousandfold.\n\nStirring From Dormancy\n\nThe ETH in question, stashed in a single wallet address, has remained untouched since it was pre-mined. But in an unexpected move, all 61,216 ETH were transferred to an address associated with the Kraken crypto exchange. This transfer marks the end of an eight-year-long dormancy.\n\n\ud83d\udca4 \ud83d\udca4 \ud83d\udca4 \ud83d\udca4 \ud83d\udca4 \ud83d\udca4 \ud83d\udca4 \ud83d\udca4 \ud83d\udca4 \ud83d\udca4 A dormant pre-mine address containing 61,216 #ETH (116,396,127 USD) has just been activated after 8.0 years!https://t.co/f79T0fYa7b \u2014 Whale Alert (@whale_alert) July 18, 2023\n\nRewinding to June 2014, the Ethereum network staged a unique sale event. As the network was yet to begin generating tokens autonomously, this event served as an opportunity for early team members and co-founders to accumulate pre-mined ETH.\n\nAt this point in time, ETH was trading at the price of $0.31, thus valuing this particular collection of 61,216 ETH at an estimated $18,976. Fast forward to the present day, and the value of these same tokens has skyrocketed to approximately $116.9 million.\n\nThis dramatic surge in ETH\u2019s price over the years underscores the substantial growth and adoption of Ethereum\u2019s network. Consequently, the recent movement of this significant ETH stash has piqued the interest of the crypto community, eager to understand the potential implications of this action.\n\nMajor Ethereum Dip Imminent?\n\nTypically, large transfers of a cryptocurrency to an exchange can indicate an intent to sell, and this can potentially put downward pressure on the price if the amount being sold is significant compared to the overall trading volume.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that not all large deposit into the exchange means a potential fall for the crypto being transferred as the person or entity transferring the ETH might not sell immediately or might decide to sell gradually to minimize market impact.\n\nRelated Reading: Ethereum Price Is Showing Early Signs of Fresh Increase, But This Resistance Is Key\n\nAlso, it is worth analyzing how the whale ended up depositing its pre-mined ETH into the exchange. Etherscan data verifies the transaction, which occurred on July 18. The operation of moving is $116.9 million in ETH and required a negligible fee of $1.68 and 25.475673161 Gwei in gas price.\n\nThe identity of the wallet owner remains a mystery and their cautious approach is noteworthy, as they ensured to avoid human errors that could result in substantial loss. They did this by first sending a small test transaction of 0.05 ETH to the Kraken address before moving the entire lot.\n\nThe transaction has also highlighted the value of HODL-ling, a strategy that emphasizes the long-term accumulation of crypto tokens. It underscores how patience can lead to significant gains in the volatile world of crypto.\n\nNonetheless, Ethereum price is up 0.7% in the past 24 hours, indicating that the whale might be yet to make any move with its deposited ETH. The second largest asset currently trades at a price of $1,910, at the time of writing with a 24-hour trading volume of $7.4 billion\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, Chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

The shifting comes while the ETH price declines slightly in the mentioned timeframe.\n\nAccording to data provided by Whale Alert, the latest transaction, 15,000 ETH, was sent to the California-based crypto exchange Gate.io. The address still has $859 worth of cryptocurrencies left.\n\nMoreover, the remaining three transactions \u2014 each containing 21,266 ETH, 21,296 ETH and 21,338 ETH \u2014 were sent to the Coinbase exchange over the past 24 hours, Whale Alert\u2019s data shows.\n\nPer the data provider, the total amount of the assets moved in these four transactions is worth roughly $150.3 million.\n\nThe movements come while the ETH price slightly declines over the past 24 hours, falling by 0.23%.

        "title": "Decentralized? Ethereum and Lightning Network both at the mercy of cloud computing giants - CoinGeek",
        "content": "In the digital currency industry, the term \u2018decentralization\u2018 has taken on almost religious overtones. Its fiercest adherents are dead-set on limiting Bitcoin\u2019s potential and capabilities so as not to give a single inch of ground to the dreaded \u2018centralization,\u2019 and no project in the space can survive or thrive without giving decentralization at least a mention.\n\nYet, a recent story from DLNews and an announcement by Google Cloud about its partnership with \u2018Lightning as a Service\u2019 firm Voltage lay bare the lies at the heart of the decentralization myth.\n\nHow Ethereum and Lightning rely on AWS and big cloud companies\n\nWhen it comes to Ethereum, a staggering 2,439 of Ethereum\u2019s 6,810 nodes are hosted on AWS, with 1,395 of them in a single data center in Virginia. While the overall number of Ethereum nodes hosted on cloud computers has decreased by 10% since 2020, consolidating the remaining ones into a single provider\u2014AWS\u2014is concerning. Large Ethereum infrastructure companies like Consensys also continue to rely heavily on Amazon Web Services (NASDAQ: AMZN).\n\nIn such a situation, an outage or refusal of service could have catastrophic consequences for the Ethereum blockchain and staked ETH, yet, most Ethereum enthusiasts are oblivious to these risks. What could cause a firm like AWS or other cloud computing firms to refuse service to Ethereum nodes or applications? Something like a legal order from the U.S. government would probably do it. Those who dismiss such possibilities should ask Kim Dotcom of Mega Upload how Uncle Sam can take down a global network of criminal activity if he puts his mind to it.\n\nAs for the Lightning Network, which is often touted as BTC\u2019s scaling solution, it\u2019s not much better. Recently, Voltage, a Lightning as a Service (LaaS) company, announced it was partnering with Google Cloud (NASDAQ: GOOGL) to expand its hosting capabilities and attempt to scale to enterprise levels. This partnership will allow customers to spin up Lightning and BTC nodes globally but will further make a mockery of BTC \u2018nodes\u2019 and the network\u2019s quest to become truly outside the control of authorities like governments and their legal systems.\n\nOpinion: Let\u2019s stop worshiping the false idol of decentralization\n\nThe misunderstanding of what decentralization means is one of the most pervasive and harmful blockchain myths. Nothing has held the industry back more than attempting to solve the false trilemma, making networks scale while keeping them in line with some \u2018crypto anarchist\u2019 cyberpunk notion of what decentralization means.\n\nThe original Bitcoin, as Satoshi Nakamoto designed it, could scale unboundedly, and he said in his very first public post it was \u201ccompletely decentralized\u201d the way he released it. That\u2019s only possible if Satoshi meant something completely different by decentralization than is commonly understood today, something like being able to send micropayments (electronic cash) to anyone purely peer to peer, anywhere in the world instantly, without ever going through a trusted (central) third party just like physical in person cash transactions.\n\nIt is a cruel irony that Ethereum, BTC, and other blockchains had come to rely on AWS and other large cloud computing firms when the original Bitcoin was designed to challenge them, creating a truly distributed, robust network that could send payments and host/serve data, preventing the sort of outages and takedowns that Ethereum, BTC, and others must now live in fear of because of their reliance on these centralized services.\n\nAs for the notion of decentralization in the way BTC and Ethereum maximalists use it, what is the point if, to scale and make the blockchains work, you are ultimately reliant on large corporations subject to the very laws you seek to avoid by creating such a network?\n\nThe fact that such a large number of Ethereum nodes, and now the Lightning Network itself, are dependent on the services of publicly traded corporations, which are subject to the laws of governments in the jurisdictions they operate in, should cause thinkers to pause and realize that decentralization has become little more than a hypnotic mantra, an unattainable end in itself, and one that will never deliver on the promises its loudest proponents claim for it because it can\u2019t.\n\nOf course, Satoshi Nakamoto told us all of these years ago, and he has explained in detail how Bitcoin can act as a global distributed network to provide an alternative to these large cloud computing companies and why the law is ultimately unavoidable.\n\nLet\u2019s put the false notion of decentralization to bed, embrace the BSV blockchain, and work on giving Google Cloud, AWS, and other data monopolies a real challenge!\n\nFollow CoinGeek\u2019s Crypto Crime Cartel series, which delves into the stream of groups\u2014from BitMEX to Binance, Bitcoin.com, Blockstream, ShapeShift, Coinbase, Ripple,\n\nEthereum, FTX and Tether\u2014who have co-opted the digital asset revolution and turned the industry into a minefield for na\u00efve (and even experienced) players in the market.\n\nNew to blockchain?

Buterin discussed the latest Ethereum Improvement Proposal, a change that could allow users to create non-custodial wallets as programmable smart contracts. If successful, this upgrade could potentially improve global web3 adoption by making crypto wallets as easy to use as an email account.\n\na16z Web3 has the potential to fix social media and consumer applications, Sriram Krishnan, general partner of a16z crypto, said during a keynote presentation. He believes now is the time to build \u201clarge-scale crypto consumer social media marketplace applications.\u201d Chris Lyons, general partner of web3 media at a16z, talked about \u201chiding the wires\u201d and how that can be the biggest opportunity in crypto to grow to 100 million users.\n\nReddit Mirela Spasova, Reddit\u2019s senior engineer manager for collectible avatars, shared the platform\u2019s primary mission to onboard millions of users into digital collectibles, like it did last year. Today Reddit has onboarded more than 8 million users to its wallets and digital collectibles and made over $1 million in revenue for 30 to 100 creators, she noted.\n\nChainlink Sergey Nazarov, Chainlink co-founder, discussed Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), which recently launched on mainnet on the Avalanche, Ethereum, Optimism and Polygon blockchains. The launch of CCIP aims to focus on creating a \u201csecure and reliable internet of contracts,\u201d Nazarov noted. \u201cThe better the applications you build, the more attractive this whole blockchain thing will be, for all the people with money whether they\u2019re big banks, individuals or asset managers.\u201d\n\nCoinbase\u2019s Base Jesse Pollak, lead for Base and head of protocols at Coinbase, talked about the layer-2 blockchain\u2019s plan to become decentralized. \u201cIf you look at the pre-internet area, if you were a developer you had a hard time building products for the world.\u201d Then the internet came around and opened up the ability to build applications, Pollak said. The online era will be replaced by the onchain worlds through blockchain technology, Pollak believes. \u201cNow we\u2019re on the precipice of that changing with us moving from an online platform to an onchain platform.\u201d Also next week, Optimism, an Ethereum-focused layer-2 project, will release an \u201copen neutrality framework\u201d with a focus on decentralization guidelines, Pollak said, and Base will follow it, too. The framework plans to provide principles for networks that aim to be decentralized.\n\nAave Stani Kulechov, CEO of Aave Companies, announced the launch of Lens Protocol V2, an upgrade to the web3 product aimed at creating a decentralized social networking ecosystem. The new iteration will have upgrades like \u201copen actions\u201d that connect onchain elements to social content so web3 experiences can become social ones, Kulechov noted. \u201cEffectively we\u2019ll have an internet that benefits all and people-powered social networks where you\u2019ll have a say in how the network will evolve in the future.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis week in web3\n\nThe latest pod\n\nOn our latest episode, Jacquelyn interviewed Maria Shen, a general partner on the investment team at Electric Capital, an early-stage venture firm focused on crypto, blockchain, fintech and marketplaces.\n\nBefore Electric Capital, Maria was the CTO and co-founder of Bambify, a startup that helped small to medium-sized businesses create more efficient supply chains with manufacturers globally. Prior to that, she worked at Microsoft.\n\nIn March 2022, the firm announced that it closed $1 billion for a pair of crypto funds \u2014 a $400 million vehicle for making equity investments in startups and a $600 million fund intended to invest directly in crypto tokens. Its website currently showcases a portfolio with about 75 investments with crypto startups like Magic Eden, ConsenSys and Bitwise, to name a few.\n\nMore recently, Electric Capital put out a report that showed the number of blockchain developers in the U.S. has declined every year since 2017, dropping to 29% last year from 40% in 2017. We dove into what that report really means and how it will affect the growth of developers domestically and internationally.\n\nWe discussed which crypto sectors Maria is watching for investments, why she\u2019s betting big on NFTs and the general venture capital market sentiment.\n\nWe also talked about:\n\nU.S. regulatory impact on investments\n\nThe bear market\n\nTrends she\u2019s following\n\nAdvice for founders\n\nSubscribe to Chain Reaction on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or your favorite pod platform to keep up with the latest episodes, and please leave us a review if you like what you hear!\n\nAlso check out Jacquelyn as a guest on Boys Club, where she dives into her backstory, what it\u2019s like covering crypto, the state of the industry, trends she\u2019s following and more.\n\nFollow the money\n\nP0x Labs, the team behind Mantra Network, raised $25 million at $500 million valuation Binance Labs invested $10 million into lending and borrowing protocol Radiant Capital RISC Zero raised $40 million to bring blockchains more advanced cryptographic tools Web3 infrastructure provider Cosmic Wire raised $30 million in a seed round AI and metaverse-focused Futureverse raised $54 million in a Series A round\n\nThis list was compiled with information from Messari as well as TechCrunch\u2019s own reporting.\n\nWhat else we\u2019re reading\n\nWant to branch out from the world of web3?

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price rally has slowed down in recent weeks. The price has yet to break above the $2,000 level, which is making many market participants worried.\n\nEthereum Price Technical Analysis\n\nBy: Edris\n\nThe Daily Chart:\n\nOn the daily timeframe, the price has been forming higher highs and higher lows since rebounding from the 200-day moving average earlier in June.\n\nHowever, there is a clear lack of bullish momentum, as the ETH price keeps pulling back towards the 50-day moving average located around the $1,900 mark. In case it breaks, there are two close support levels available: the $1,800 static level and the 200-day moving average close to the same price mark.\n\nTherefore, while the momentum is seemingly fading, there is still hope that a rebound from either of these levels would initiate the next rally higher.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart:\n\nRecent PA developments become clearer on the 4-hour chart.\n\nThe ETH price has broken above the $1,930 resistance level a couple of times since the beginning of July but has failed in both instances, as it has rapidly dropped back below the level.\n\nCurrently, the price is seemingly targeting the $1,850 short-term support level once again, with the $1,750 level available as the next target in line in case the former level fails to hold. The RSI indicator, while previously signaling the potential fake breakout and drop, is offering little insight at the moment, as it is oscillating around the 50% value. This behavior confirms the indecisiveness of the market participants and the equilibrium in momentum.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nBy: Edris\n\nEthereum Coinbase Premium Index\n\nEthereum\u2019s price has remained relatively stagnant over the past few months, consolidating around the $2,000 level. However, interesting activity has been going on in the background.\n\nThe chart displays the Ethereum Coinbase premium gap, which is calculated based on the gap between ETH\u2019s price on Coinbase and Binance, two of the largest exchanges in the world. This metric shows whether US investors are buying or selling on aggregate compared to other investors. Positive values indicate buying pressure from the United States.\n\nAs the image demonstrates, there has been a significant shift in the US market sentiment, as the premium gap index has mostly been positive. Considering that many US investors are wealthy individuals or institutions, this could be a positive signal for ETH, pointing out that it might be in the accumulation phase at the beginning of a new bull market."

        "content": "Buy and sell Bitcoin the easy way Start your crypto portfolio today! Get started\n\nsteady value rise in the world\u2019s most influential blockchain, Ethereum (ETH), has spotlighted the altcoin market. Here, we have Celo and the lesser-known VC Spectra (SPCT). Yet, the latter will gradually become a household name among the likes of Ethereum (ETH) and Celo.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the price implications for each project and see how VC Spectra (SPCT) beats them all.\n\n>>BUY SPCT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nCelo Set To Return To Its Roots By Being An Ethereum L2 Again\n\nThe latest news for Celo is a return to being an Ethereum-based layer-2 solution after being an independent blockchain. After months of deliberation, the developers proposed to transition back to its predecessor on Celo\u2019s governance forum.\n\nThis has been well-received by Celo\u2019s community, resulting in a minor 22% boost in value on July 17, 2023, from $0.50 to $0.61. Yet, it quickly dropped to $0.52.\n\nStill, Celo faces stiff competition as it\u2019s ranked far lower in market cap rankings. This also means it\u2019s a riskier investment than its predecessor, Ethereum (ETH), but could grow more under the right circumstances.\n\nMany predictions have pegged Celo to be worth a maximum of $1, almost double its current value.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Barely Breaks The $2,000 Level\n\nEthereum\u2019s (ETH) price has yet to confidently breach the $2000 level on several occasions of late. Data from Lookonchain reveals that a \u2018whale\u2018 recently sold $2.78 million of ETH. This was when the value got boosted after the favorable outcome in the SEC vs. XRP lawsuit.\n\nStill, investors are confident the price will eventually break the $2000 mark as a blockchain that experiences new developments. The latest is the launch of the multi-collateral stablecoin, GHO, on Ethereum (ETH) via the Aave Protocol.\n\nWith all this in mind, predictions peg Ethereum (ETH) to be worth a maximum of $2500 by 2024.\n\nCelo isn\u2019t the blockchain looking to leverage the power of Ethereum (ETH). VC Spectra (SPCT) is also built atop the latter to deliver next-generation asset management.\n\n>>BUY SPCT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nVC Spectra\u2019s (SPCT) Price Set To Leapfrog 627%\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT) is a novel crypto-based asset management and trading platform for expert-vetted blockchain and technology start-ups. The platform utilizes the power of smart contracts to provide freedom and autonomy for investors.\n\nUsers have custody over their assets, manage their portfolios in real-time, and automatically receive profits from the invested projects without human intervention.\n\nAside from seeking alpha, VC Spectra (SPCT) is committed to impacting the world positively. Thus, it will fund companies that are socially responsible and sustainable.\n\nThe Spectra token (SPCT) is the icing on the cake for users. One of the benefits of a decentralized platform is that participants can govern it. Just as Celo\u2019s community had a say in the recent proposal, the same applies to VC Spectra (SPCT).\n\nSPCT offers voting power where the more tokens one holds, the more influential their vote becomes. Moreover, it provides other benefits like quarterly dividends and entry into exclusive discounted pre-ICOs.\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT) achieved a new milestone by entering Stage 2 of its presale. SPCT, available on the ERC20 and BRC20 networks, is trading at $0.011. This is predicted to increase value by 81.81% in the next stage to $0.02.\n\nYet, it gets better as experts believe the token should be worth $0.08 when VC Spectra (SPCT) launches, representing a 7.27x gain for those buying at $0.011.\n\nLearn more about the VC Spectra presale here:\n\nBuy Presale: https://invest.vcspectra.io/login\n\nWebsite: https://vcspectra.io\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/VCSpectra\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/spectravcfund\n\nDisclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the author should not be considered as financial advice.

        "title": "Polyhedra Network \u2013 Proving full node of Ethereum in ZK - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Proving full nodes for Ethereum PoS is essential for security\n\nCompared to Ethereum light clients, the approach of proving Ethereum full nodes has much higher security guarantee. Ethereum light clients operate on a distinct algorithm, and their security relies entirely on a committee known as the \"sync committee.\" However, the sync committee's size is merely 512, rotating roughly daily (i.e., about 27.3 hours). The total staked assets amount to as few as 16384 ETH (calculated as 512 * 32), a figure quite negligible in comparison to the daily transactions volume on cross-chain bridges connecting Ethereum ecosystem with other networks.\n\nAnother issue is that the sync committee does not always sign the block. (e.g., block 17239413 and block 17239414). Statistics show that 1.6% blocks are not signed by the supermajority of the sync committee.\n\nSystem overview for proving Ethereum full nodes\n\nIn order to rectify these issues, Polyhedra Network has decided to get rid of the sync committee and utilize the full PoS consensus of the Ethereum blockchain, which has been deployed since the merge. This will incorporate more than 20,000 signatures (a 40-fold increase from the 512 sync committee) within a single block on Ethereum mainnet.\n\nTo manage the 40-times increase in workload, Polyhedra Network has employed its unique proof system\u2014deVirgo. This system boasts unrivaled processing capabilities, thanks to its theoretical enhancements and significant engineering advancements. deVirgo protocol theoretically eliminates the need for very large FFT or MSM, making the proof generation linear time to the number of signatures. The protocol has been deployed on zkBridge and supports parallel and distributed computation.\n\nExperiments on the proof system with a billion-size circuit revealed a proof generation time of less than 10 seconds, which matches the pace of Ethereum block generation, without increasing the proof size or verification time.\n\nEfficient proof system for proving Ethereum full nodes\n\nTo enable fast prover time for proving Ethereum full nodes, Polyhedra Network uses its efficient proof system, deVirgo. Devirgo is the distributed version of the Virgo protocol, and is designed to parallelize the GKR protocol by distributing the computation across multiple machines. With deVirgo, zkBridge can support swiftand flexible interoperability between different blockchains without relying on external trust assumptions. zkBridge also uses recursive proof to prove that the previously generated proof by deVirgo proves the corresponding block headers. The proof recursion reduces the on-chain verification cost to about 220K gas on any EVM-compatible blockchain network.`\n\nThe key insight of deVirgo is to explore the nature that the verification of Ethereum full consensus can be represented as a data-parallel circuit. Suppose there is a data-parallel arithmetic circuit \ud835\udc36 as well as N machines. The deVirgo proof system can divide the data-parallel circuit into N sub-circuits, with each machine computing only one sub-circuit. Verification of Ethereum full consensus is such a data-parallel circuit, and it can contain more than 30k of identical signature verification algorithms and hashes.\n\nCentral to deVirgo is a technique to distribute the sumcheck. In deVirgo, the sumcheck protocol is divided into two phases. In Phase 1, each machine processes their own sub-circuit and collectively generates one aggregated proof. The remaining work will be small enough for a single machine, which executes Phase 2 that concludes the distributed sumcheck.\n\nPerformance evaluation for proving Ethereum full nodes\n\nTo evaluate the implementation on BLS signature aggregation, Polyhedra Network measured the running time of the deVirgo prover and recursive verifier using two AMD EPYC\u2122 7763 CPUs. The result is summarized in the following list:\n\nPolyhedra Network has deployed Ethereum full-nodeproof system on zkBridge. zkBridge sets Ethereum as the sender chain, and other networks such as BNB Chain and Avalanche as the receiver chain. The result shows that zkBridge can generate the Ethereum full-node proofs and verify the block header on BNB Chain and other networks within 12 seconds including the delays of all the components.\n\nPolyhedra Network will continue optimizing the implementation. GPU acceleration is planned in the near future, which can lower the up-front cost for better decentralization. Nevertheless the current zkBridge proof system is efficient enough to catch up with the block time of Ethereum.\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nThrough the implementation of proving the Ethereum full nodes, Polyhedra Network enables fully trustless, efficient, and secure interoperability using zkBridge, to connect Ethereum ecosystems (both L1 and L2s) with other networks.\n\nzkBridge is the first trustless, efficient, secure, and universal cross-chain bridge with advanced zero-knowledge proof technology. zkBridge uses zero-knowledge proofs to efficiently convince the receiver chain that a certain state transition happened on the sender chain. With zero-knowledge proofs, zkBridge offers both strong security and a significant reduction in on-chain verification cost, without relying on external assumptions.\n\nFurthermore, zkBridge also allows transmission of current and historical Ethereum data, including the blockheader and transaction data, to be accessible by any other blockchain ecosystems and applications. This will enable any smart contract on any blockchain to trustlessly access Ethereum data and compute on top of the Ethereum data. All the security will be guaranteed by proving Ethereum PoS full nodes by using the efficient proof system of zkBridge."

        "content": "Bitcoin, XRP, and Ethereum \u2014 three of the cryptocurrency market\u2019s most dominant coins \u2014 are about to simultaneously form a 3-day golden cross.\n\nThis signal is rare, happening only a handful of times in the past in each individual asset. However, never have all three of these major cryptocurrencies triggered this signal all at the same time. What exactly does this mean, and what are the results of the 3-day golden cross?\n\nBitcoin, XRP, & Ethereum Lead Market Recovery\n\nThe crypto market outlook is a lot less bleak than it was just weeks ago, between BlackRock and other institutions seeking to launch Bitcoin ETFs and the massive win for XRP and Ripple against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nEven the technical environment is starting to show signs of a possible uptrend brewing. Notably, several top cryptocurrencies are inching closer to a golden cross on the 3-day timeframe, which has only occurred a handful of times in the past.\n\nThis is about to happen in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP, simultaneously, for the first time in their history. Previously, these signals arrived at different phases of previous bull markets. It wasn\u2019t until all three coins golden crossed that a stronger rally began.\n\nThree top crypto assets \u2014 #Bitcoin, Ethereum, and #XRP \u2014 are on the brink of a golden cross on the 3-day timeframe All three firing at the same time has never happened before It will also be the third in history for BTC and XRP, second ever for Ether pic.twitter.com/bzVfK3ZpBp \u2014 Tony \u201cThe Bull\u201d (@tonythebullBTC) July 19, 2023\n\nWhat Is A Golden Cross In Crypto?\n\nA golden cross occurs when a higher timeframe moving average, typically a 200-period MA, crosses above a lower timeframe moving average, usually a 50-period MA, from below. In contrast, a death cross happens when the two cross down from from above.\n\nThese crossovers generate a buy or sell signal in a moving average-based trading system. Such systems are designed to capture the majority of a trend, but tend to miss much of the early part of a rally as it awaits confirmation.\n\nThe 3-day golden cross throughout the years | BTCUSD on TradingView.com\n\nMoving Average Crossover: How Does The Signal Stack Up?\n\nThe only time the signal suffered a drawdown was in Bitcoin in 2019. In all other instances, the buy signal using nothing more than a simple moving average crossover, was wildly profitable with limited downside. In 2015, the BTCUSD 3-day golden cross yielded over 2,000% ROI before crossing back down and giving the corresponding sell signal. XRP\u2019s golden cross to death cross kept more than 9,000% of the uptrend\u2019s gains. Ethereum never fired a signal back then, however, due to insufficient price history.\n\nCome 2019, Bitcoin had its misfire where the buy signal then sat through a long drawdown. Neither XRP nor Ethereum triggered a signal until 2020, when the entire crypto market began to rally together. The 2020 ETHUSD golden cross held onto over 1100% ROI before the death cross closed out the position. XRP failed to set a new all-time high, but the golden cross still clocked in 200% ROI.\n\nEven though Bitcoin fired early in 2019 and sat through a drawdown, the buy signal was still ultimately effective and retained 550% ROI by the time a death cross caused the position to close. Across the five historic buy signals, there was an average of 2,570% ROI when a golden cross occurred. While such returns aren\u2019t likely in the future, this does suggest the signal is effective.\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nCanadian crypto miner HIVE Digital Technologies wants to use Ordinals in one of its AI initiatives, inscribing generative art on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain with the help of old Ethereum mining rigs.\n\nHIVE CEO Aydin Kilic described the project as an exercise in technical prowess for one of crypto\u2019s largest miners. He told Decrypt that Ordinals provides a new way for the firm to use its fleet of data-center-grade Nvidia GPUs, which it\u2019s been using to mine altcoins after Ethereum switched to proof-of-stake during the \u201cmerge\u201d and made miners obsolete.\n\n\u201cWe will create generative AI art with our own GPUs, on our own fine-tuned model of Stable Diffusion, [...] and then use our hash power on the Bitcoin network to inscribe those on the Bitcoin blockchain,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOrdinals launched earlier this year, and the buzzy Bitcoin protocol has led to a wave of innovation with crypto\u2019s oldest coin. As a way for people to create NFT-like assets on Bitcoin by \u201cinscribing\u201d data on individual satoshi, equal to 1/100,000,000 of a whole Bitcoin, Ordinals has also been a significant windfall for Bitcoin miners that benefit from elevated transaction fees.\n\nEven though Bitcoin transaction fees from Ordinals inscriptions have cooled over the past couple of months\u2014fervor surrounding BRC-20 tokens, which are built on top of Bitcoin using Ordinals, sent them sky high\u2014Kilic said HIVE is definitely \u201cstill leaning into them.\u201d\n\nKilic compared the initiative to jet fighter squadrons like the Blue Angels who show off their skills by flying in tight formations. He described HIVE\u2019s project as ambitious because it taps so many different segments of HIVE\u2019s business, including its cloud computing platforms and custom versions of AI models like Stable Diffusion.\n\n\u201cWe want to do a soup-to-nuts AI and Ordinals project that\u2019s fully integrated,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a reflection of our core competencies as a technology leader in the AI and Bitcoin space.\u201d\n\nAside from creating a digital art pipeline, Kilic said HIVE is working with its custody providers to start transacting uncommon sats found through Ordinals. Uncommon sats, which are valued at a premium, are the first sat of each Bitcoin block. Kilic said HIVE has 272 of them. Sat is a common abbreviation for satoshi, the smallest denomination of Bitcoin that data is inscribed on.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen Ethereum shifted to proof-of-stake last year, it changed the way that transactions are verified on the network and greatly reduced its energy consumption. With Bitcoin, miners use large amounts of energy to verify transactions through proof-of-work.\n\nAfter Ethereum\u2019s transition to proof-of-stake, HIVE said it was exploring alternatives to Ethereum mining. Developing a generative art pipeline using new technologies fits into HIVE\u2019s overall corporate strategy of maximizing resources, Kilic said.\n\nHIVE went public in 2017 and trades on the TSX Venture Exchange in Canada under the HIVE.V symbol. It has also traded on the Nasdaq since 2021 under the HIVE symbol. Shares of HIVE currently change hands at $5.66, and the company has a market capitalization of around $477 million.\n\nEchoing comments made by MicroStrategy co-founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor, who said Ordinals holds potential in the realm of app development, Kilic said the protocol enables companies like HIVE to experiment with Bitcoin in previously unimagined ways.\n\n\u201cI think that it\u2019s unleashing a whole new era,\u201d Kilic said. \u201cWe're all super supportive of it.\u201d"

        "content": "Crypto die-hards like to say \u201cwe\u2019re early\u201d amid the peaks and valleys of the market, but what really feels early much of the time is the tooling.\n\nCymbal, which bills itself as the first \u201chuman readable\u201d Ethereum block explorer, aims to move that forward, launching in beta today.\n\nBlockchain explorers like Etherscan are essential tools for builders and traders alike, but they\u2019re densely packed with data and very difficult for the average user to navigate, let alone understand. That's where Cymbal sees an opening.\n\nIt takes the same kind of public blockchain data that\u2019s flowing through standard explorers and turns it into a feed that\u2019s not only visual and easily understandable at a glance, but also social.\n\n\u201cToday, tools like Etherscan are the best in class for looking at the blockchain\u2014but they resemble command line interfaces. We want to get to the GUI,\u201d Cymbal CEO and co-founder Eric Feng told Decrypt, alluding to the past computing shift from text-based navigation to graphical user interfaces.\n\nCymbal looks more like a social network than a pure data resource, serving up dashboards that take transaction details and wrap them up with NFT artwork\u2014from the Bored Ape Yacht Club and other top collections\u2014along with data trends, public information on known wallet owners, relevant news stories from media outlets, and more.\n\nIt also runs that data through an AI tool to generate a conversational summary of transactions and trends, to make things even more understandable for the average user. Feng said that Cymbal is running the tool through OpenAI\u2019s GPT large language model.\n\nCymbal is launching with a focus on NFTs, but Feng said that richer data regarding cryptocurrency and token transactions will be added in time, as his team works to \u201cbuild out a full Etherscan replacement.\u201d Support for the Solana blockchain is coming in a matter of weeks, he added, with Ethereum scaling network Polygon not far behind.\n\nFeng said that Cymbal started with NFTs for a couple of reasons. The tokens are often tied to artwork, which makes them visual in nature\u2014ideal for this kind of platform. NFTs are also often the first way that people are onboarded into the crypto space these days, he added, and that accessibility layer also played a role in Cymbal\u2019s decision-making.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cWe consider NFTs to be the gateway to Web3,\u201d he told Decrypt.\n\nA screenshot of the Cymbal interface. Image: Cymbal\n\nCymbal looks like a social network, and it can be used like one too. Users can follow wallets and projects, plus wallet owners can claim their own page and then personalize it to become a \u201cWeb3 profile\u201d of sorts, Feng said. He suggested potential messaging, content publishing, and other social features to come in time.\n\nThe startup has raised a total of $18.5 million to date with notable investors in the mix, including Coinbase Ventures, Solana Ventures, CAA Connect, UTA Ventures, Shima Capital, and Google Ventures (GV). Notable angel investors include Kleiner Perkins\u2019 John Doerr, Dapper Labs co-founder Roham Gharegozlou, and outgoing Polygon Labs president Ryan Wyatt.\n\nFeng\u2014a former CTO at Hulu and veteran of Meta and Microsoft\u2014said that Cymbal sees revenue-generating opportunities with targeted advertising based on wallet data, along with selling its curated data to app builders via API access. He said it\u2019s akin to business models used by other block explorers, as well as crypto price trackers.\n\nOpepen PFPs Are Taking Over NFT Twitter\u2014Here's What's Going On\n\nCymbal is positioned as a way to not only help the average NFT and crypto user better understand the blockchain space, but also help expand the industry as more accessible tools come online.\n\n\u201cThere is a subset of hardcore crypto people that can read Etherscan, just like there's people in \u2018The Matrix\u2019 that could look at the green squiggly lines and understand what's going on,\u201d Feng told Decrypt. \u201cGreat. This is not for them.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt's for the masses,\u201d he added. \u201cIt's not the tens of thousands of hardcore crypto people right now. It's for the tens of millions of people that hopefully will come into the ecosystem if we can create better tooling for them.\u201d"

Sometimes, it is just the owner forgetting about it and then deciding that now could be a good time to sell after finding it again.\n\nThe Ethereum ICO raised $18 million in two stages between July and September of 2014. One Bitcoin was set to buy 2,000 Ether at the beginning of the sale. According to September 2014 Bitcoin values, this meant that one ETH was worth 0.0007479 Bitcoin, or roughly 30 cents.\n\nThis type of cryptocurrency issuance is known as a \"premine,\" as the coins are created before the network begins to produce tokens on its own. Later, in July 2015, the Ethereum blockchain was launched."

        "content": "Featuring Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559, the London hard fork introduced significant changes to Ethereum\u2019s transaction fee mechanism. Users now pay a base fee that is subsequently burned, effectively removing ether from circulation forever.\n\nThis approach significantly impacted the token\u2019s supply, resulting in a monthly burn rate of approximately 146,000 ETH.\n\nThe London Hard Fork And Its Deflationary Impact\n\nIntegrated into the Ethereum network on August 5, 2021, the London hard fork brought a paradigm shift in the cryptocurrency\u2019s transaction fee structure.\n\nThrough the EIP-1559, the network introduced a unique mechanism that involved the burning of a significant portion of transaction fees, known as the \u201cbase fee.\u201d This innovative approach aimed to counterbalance Ethereum\u2019s inflation while providing block rewards and priority fees to miners.\n\nAs a result, the base fee is permanently removed from circulation, leading to a deflationary effect on the token\u2019s supply.\n\nThe scale of the burn has been enormous, with over 3.46 million ETH, worth $6.68 billion, annihilated since the London hard fork\u2019s enforcement. This translates to an average monthly burn rate of more than 146,000 ETH over the 710-day period that followed the upgrade.\n\n146,000 ETH burned per month | Source: Beaconcha.in\n\nEthereum\u2019s deflationary path effectively offset the issuance of new tokens, curbing its supply growth by approximately 0.1% annually.\n\nLeading Contributors To The Ethereum Burn\n\nThe principal factors driving Ethereum\u2019s burn phenomenon include regular ETH transfers, non-fungible token (NFT) transactions on Opensea, and activities on the decentralized exchange Uniswap.\n\nRegular ETH transfers accounted for the most substantial reduction in supply, leading to the incineration of nearly 300,000 ETH.\n\nUniswap v2 follows closely, with $56.5 million worth of ETH burned since the hard fork, while transfers of Tether stablecoins contributed to the destruction of $50.5 million worth of ETH.\n\nETH price struggles to hold $1,900 support | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nBlockchain gaming platform Axie Infinity and Uniswap v3 each burned $32 million and $30 million worth of ETH, respectively.\n\nAt the same time, the number of ETH staked in the Ethereum Beacon contract has also been on the rise. It is now sitting at over 26.87 million ETH, translating to a dollar value of $51.35 billion.\n\nWith the Ethereum supply sitting at 120.2 million, it means that over 11% of its supply is currently locked up while the burn continues to take coins out of circulation.\n\n\n\nBoth of these developments combined could see the circulating supply of the digital asset reduce drastically, leading to a rise in the price of ETH as time goes on.\n\nETH is currently trading at a price of $1,903 at the time of this writing, representing a 0.72% increase in the last day.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "The History And Evolution of Ethereum Classic (ETC) Mining: An Analysis - The Crypto Basic",
        "content": "The Ethereum Classic platform is a decentralized blockchain system and digital currency. Like its sibling Ethereum, ETC allows developers to construct and implement self-executing contracts, known as smart contracts, which activate inside the blockchain when specific pre-established conditions are fully met.\n\nUnderstanding the history of the Ethereum Classic mining pool is no simple task, as the relevant information is scattered and elusive, making it challenging for newcomers to grasp. Recognizing the need for a comprehensive resource, we documented the important aspects of ETC\u2019s past. Organizing the information into four distinct chapters, we invite you to delve into the intricate chronicle of Ethereum Classic, the ETC mining pool nitty gritty.\n\nWhat are Ethereum Classic & ETC Mining?\n\nIn response to the hack, which resulted in the loss of 3.6 million Ethereum tokens, the Ethereum blockchain underwent an update to rectify the erroneous transactions. However, not all members of the Ethereum community agreed with this course of action, leading to the creation of Ethereum Classic. By utilizing the unaltered Ethereum ledger that preserved the hacked transactions, Ethereum Classic distinguished itself as a blockchain platform.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nSo the real question is \u2014 how to mine Ethereum Classic? Mining ETC involves a process wherein computer networks compete to validate transactions and earn rewards through ETC tokens. The ETC coin mining supply is finite, with mining gradually shifting from rewards to transaction fees. The average mining time for a new ETC mining block is 11.6 seconds.\n\nThe Beginning of ETC Mining Pools\n\nWhere did ETC mining pool possibilities come from? In 2016, Ethereum Classic (ETC) was created due to a split from Ethereum triggered by the launch of the decentralized autonomous organization called the DAO.\n\nBacked by $150 million in crowdfunding, the DAO suffered a code flaw that enabled hackers to steal $50 million from its funds.\n\nThe Ethereum community was divided on how to address the hack. Some proposed reversing the ETH blockchain to reimburse the affected users, while others believed in preserving the immutability of the blockchain.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nFollowing a vote, the pro-fork side gained over 85% support, resulting in the fork that gave birth to Ethereum Classic. At the same time, the minority retained the original Ethereum blockchain as Ethereum Classic.\n\nEthereum Classic mining pool operates its blockchain, utilizing the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), supporting smart contracts, decentralized applications (dapps), and its unique cryptocurrency, ETC.\n\nEvolution of ETC Mining Pools Over Time\n\nMiners subsequently shifted their focus to the Ethereum Classic mining pool, significantly increasing its hash rate by 280%. This surge was primarily driven by staking pools operated by centralized companies, enabling ETH holders to pool their tokens for validator status.\n\nBefore the split, the U.S. Treasury sanctioned Tornado Cash, a virtual currency mixer accused of facilitating money laundering, highlighting concerns with Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake mechanism.\n\nThis conflict highlights the ideological divergence between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic, with purists favoring a decentralized model while pragmatists lean towards Ethereum\u2019s adaptability. That\u2019s a brief overview of the ETC mining pool evolution.\n\nCase Study: Hiveon.net ETC Mining Pool\n\nMining pools play a vital role in the competitive crypto-mining landscape. Infrastructure quality and payout structure are among the factors to consider when choosing the best ETC mining pool. To simplify the process, let\u2019s focus on Hiveon.\n\nHiveon, built on HiveOS, aims to provide favorable conditions for mining ETC. With over 10,000 active miners, it offers a user-friendly experience for both novice and experienced miners. The platform supports global mining farms, attracting a diverse community.\n\nKey features:\n\nCommission-free Hiveon pool.\n\nHiveon pool pays all transaction fees.\n\nPPS+ payout model: Hiveon pool rewards members for legitimate shares regardless of when they joined.\n\nLow payout threshold: 0.1 ETH ensures shorter wait times.\n\nThe Hiveon pool contains servers across Europe, Russia, North America (CA, US East, US West), and Asia for the best mining performance.\n\nAdditionally, Hiveon ETC pool offers a convenient iOS and Android app for easy currency management. The interface includes step-by-step tutorials, ensuring a seamless experience for Ethereum Classic mining. Hive OS also helps reduce costs, making it an attractive option for many miners.\n\nThe Profitability of ETC Mining\n\nGiven the high expenses and increasing difficulty of ETC mining, many miners now rely on mining pools to maximize profitability. This strategy is vital for smaller miners who struggle to recover equipment and electrical expenditures.\n\nIndividual miners join mining pools to increase their chances of mining a block and collecting rewards. These rewards are then distributed among participants based on their contributed hashing power.\n\nTypically, mining pool operators charge fees for pool maintenance and participation. Multiple pools with varying structures are available to choose from.\n\nAdditionally, there are opportunities for generating an ETC mining profit, enabling miners to utilize internet-based computing resources. However, this method incurs additional costs as miners essentially rent others\u2019 equipment.\n\nTo optimize profitability in ETC mining, Hiveon.net offers valuable solutions. Miners can maximize profits using Hiveon ETC pool profitability tools, including the ETC mining profitability calculator and support.\n\nThe Future of ETC Mining Pools\n\nThe evolving e-currency landscape presents new developments and challenges for the ETC mining pool. Technological advancements in mining hardware can significantly improve pool performance and efficiency in ETC mining.\n\nMining pool operators must adapt to regulatory changes and shifts in the broader financial landscape to thrive in this dynamic environment. Monitoring market trends and making strategic adjustments are essential for survival and success in the crypto market.\n\nAdopting an agile approach, embracing emerging technologies, and testing new extraction techniques are vital for the prosperity of mining pools. Strong partnerships within the crypto community further contribute to their long-term sustainability.\n\nETC extraction pools must maintain proactive and adaptable operational methods to navigate the shifting landscape successfully. Embracing innovation in the Ethereum Classic mining pool and timely responses to emerging challenges are crucial driving forces behind their achievements.\n\nIt is important to recognize that the future of ETC extraction pools is intertwined with broader developments in the crypto sphere, emphasizing the need for continuous innovation and effective adaptation.\n\nConclusion and Call to Action\n\nVarious ETC mining pool options have greatly influenced the growth and decentralization of the Ethereum Classic mining pool network. Joining an extraction pool like this increases mining profitability and strengthens security and stability in the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nAmong the many options available, Hiveon ETC pool is a reputable and highly regarded choice favored by ETC miners.

The confusion also extends to the Ethereum (ETH) price camp where gloom continues to spread. Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) remains nostalgic for the July 13 trade, and now bulls want to relive it.\n\nAlso Read: Traders ask how high heavens could be for Bitcoin price as SEC sets down eight BTC ETF applications.\n\nBitcoin price on the fence\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is on the fence, bordering between falling back into the consolidation range or breaking below and extending south. The $29,872 support level remains critical for BTC, pivoting the price action to determine which way next.\n\nAfter a brief break below the crucial support, an influx of buyer momentum restored Bitcoin price within the range. This is indicated by the Relative Strength Index (RSI) attempting to make a decisive bend north and stay above 50. A strong foray north by the RSI could compel Bitcoin price to extrapolate to the upside, potentially breaching the $31,500 range high and recording a new local high.\n\nWith the right trigger, buying pressure could catapult Bitcoin price to the $31,500 level, denoting a 20% climb from the current level.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-Day Chart\n\nOn the other hand, if buying pressure reduces, bears could seize the opportunity to pull Bitcoin price lower. A daily candlestick close below the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of $29,286 would spell doom for BTC, making a retracement to the $27,500 level likely.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price stays above $30,000; Cathie Wood assures increased confidence in BTC.\n\nEthereum price slips below crucial support\n\nEthereum (ETH) price has slipped below the uptrend line in a move that threatens investors' profit prospects. Unless ETH restores above this bullish trendline, the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) token faces a breakdown below the 50- and 100-day EMAs at $1,871 and $1,835, respectively, to tag the July 7 lows of around $1,824.\n\nThe Awesome Oscillators (AO) bolster the case for the bears, as the histograms of this momentum indicator are flashing red in huge volumes to show bears fastening their grip on ETH.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, if more bulls approach the scene, the ensuing buying pressure could pull Ethereum price back above the uptrend line. A sustained move above this bullish consolidation trendline could see ETH hit $1,959 soon.\n\nIn a highly bullish case, the largest altcoin by trading volume could shatter the psychological $2,000 level and target the $2,120 range high next. Such a move would see ETH holders rake in up to 10% profits.\n\nAlso Read: Axie Infinity, Space ID, Euler brace for volatility over imminent $25.91 million worth in cliff token unlocks.\n\nRipple price will not yield.\n\nRipple (XRP) price is recovering from the dip recorded after the dissipation of hype following Ripple Lab's partial win against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on July 13. At the time, the remittance token recorded an intra-day high of $0.938 before returning to a daily close of $0.818.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ripple price is trying to shatter this local peak and extend a neck north. An increase in buying pressure could see this strategy pan out, clearing the path for a possible rally to the $0.938 range high. Such a move would constitute a 15% climb.\n\nThe RSI at 77 is still rising, suggesting increasing momentum that could bode well for Ripple price. While others may interpret this RSI range as overbought, it is worth mentioning that Welles Wilder only confirms an actual sell signal when the RSI crosses the 70 mark to the downside. As long as the RSI is northbound \u2013 even if it is above 70 \u2013 the asset could record more gains backed by significant buyer momentum.\n\nThe AO indicator also bolsters the case for the bulls, recording deep green histograms in the positive territory to show that bulls are in control.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-Day Chart\n\nIf profit-taking begins, Ripple price could pull back with a potential revisit of the $0.697 range before another foray north.\n\nAlso Read: Ripple price races to $1.0, records the largest crypto asset hourly volume as chatter to list XRP intensify"

        "content": "Starknet has announced a comprehensive Appchain framework that will enable developers to build custom blockchain protocols for specific decentralized applications (dApps). This follows a recent announcement from the project that its latest protocol upgrade has enabled Starknet to process more transactions per second than any comparable layer-2.\n\nStarknet, a scalability solution for Ethereum, uses Rollups to reduce transaction costs and increase transaction throughput. Starknet\u2019s Appchains could further improve dApp performance by enabling applications to \u201ctailor an instance of Starknet to achieve better control over the specs, lower running costs, enhance scalability, and deliver opt-in privacy.\u201d\n\nBy building custom Appchains, developers can alter fee market logic, consensus mechanisms, and other key functions of Starknet. This helps to deliver a more suitable environment for custom-built dApps to operate in.\n\nStarknet Stack: A powerful SDK that powers Starknet\u2019s Appchain Framework\n\nAppchains will be built using a comprehensive software development kit known as Starknet Stack. This includes STARK Proofs, which ensure Rollup security; the Cairo programming language, which enables developers to build smart contracts; and Account Abstraction, which makes it easier for users to interact with Starknet using smart contracts instead of private keys.\n\nStarknet\u2019s powerful Appchain infrastructure has been used privately in the past by popular dApps such as DyDx and SoRare. Both platforms are run using custom blockchain environments that were made using StarkEx\u2019s development stack. Collectively, StarkEx\u2019s Appchain infrastructure has already processed over $1 trillion in transaction volume.\n\nThe announcement of Starknet Stack will now bring decentralized access to Starknet\u2019s Appchain infrastructure. The toolkit is being open sourced to make complex dApp ecosystems more widely accessible to the community.\n\nStarknet Quantum Leap: A high-performance upgrade to the Starknet ecosystem\n\nLast week, Starknet announced that an upgrade to the protocol is now live on mainnet. The upgrade, known as Starknet Quantum Leap v.0.12.0., has significantly improved Starknet\u2019s performance. The blockchain now has the highest transactions-per-second (TPS) compared to all extant layer-2s in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nWhen is the Starknet Token (STRK) launch date?\n\nStarknet has announced that it will be launching a token to drive progress for the ecosystem. The token, STRK, will be used for transaction fees, governance, and as an incentive for developers who are building applications on the network.\n\nThe STRK token was initially revealed in May 2023 by former Three Arrows Capital co-founder Su Zhu. The token is rumored to be launched in September 2023.\n\nToken allocations have already been decided by StarkWare, as detailed in a blog post released by the team. 17% has been allocated to StarkWare investors, 32.9% has been allocated to core contributors, and 50.1% has been allocated to the StarkWare Foundation.\n\nOf the 50.1% allocation for the Foundation, a portion will be allocated to the earliest users of the network. However, StarkWare announced its intention to prevent gamification of the ecosystem with the expectation of a community airdrop, and all snapshots of usership predate the announcement of the token.\n\nEthereum price prediction\n\nETH is currently the native token for the Starknet blockchain. The price prediction for ETH is bullish, as the CoinCodex price prediction algorithm forecasts a 5% upwards move over the coming 5-day period."

        "content": "Thu 20 Jul 2023 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Ariela R.\n\nAt the Ethereum Conference (ETHCC) in Paris, Vitalik Buterin presented a bold vision of crypto wallets. According to the Ethereum co-founder, account abstraction could make managing Ethereum wallets as easy as sending an e-mail.\n\nVitalik Buterin Explains How Ethereum Plans to Make Crypto Wallets as Simple as Email\n\n\u25ba https://t.co/QB9f5FnhFo https://t.co/QB9f5FnhFo \u2014 Decrypt (@decryptmedia) July 18, 2023 Ethereum wallets as simple as e-mail\n\nEthereum wallets on the move: towards unprecedented simplicity\n\nSince 2015, Ethereum developers have been working on account abstraction. This is an innovative concept aimed at replacing external wallets with contract-based smart wallets. This development would enable users to store their starting phrases in smart contracts, making it easier to retrieve private keys.\n\nIn his speech, Vitalik Buterin focused on the latest version, which would represent a major step forward. This is EIP-4337, or Account Abstraction Using Alt Mempool.\n\nA promising future for smart wallets\n\nAccording to Vitalik Buterin, EIP-4337 would open up new possibilities for Ethereum users. In particular, it would enable the creation of non-depository crypto wallets as programmable smart contracts. Naturally, the wallets would then feature advanced functionalities:\n\neasy wallet recovery\n\nsignature-free transactions,\n\nteam wallets.\n\nThis upgrade could be an essential catalyst for Web3 adoption. It would enable blockchains to distribute funds to users prior to registration.\n\nVersatile wallets for a better user experience\n\nAccording to Vitalik Buterin, account abstraction would introduce \u201cpaymasters\u201d. These would enable Ethereum users to pay transaction fees with any token used in transactions.\n\nDecryption: no need to convert to ETH. The result: a smoother user experience!\n\nAnd that\u2019s not all! The integration of signature aggregators would also enable data compression, reducing transaction costs by up to 86 times.\n\nFor Ethereum, account abstraction is a giant step towards mass adoption of blockchain technology. By making crypto wallets as simple as an e-mail, Ethereum is opening the door to new users. This simplification would also enable Ethereum to become the basis for many Web3 projects, reinforcing its leading role in the crypto ecosystem.

        "content": "An Ethereum whale has reactivated a dormant wallet that has been holding ETH tokens since the ICO in 2014. After purchasing 61,216 ETH tokens nine years ago, the early Ethereum investor has now decided to move the entire holding to the Kraken exchange.\n\nMoving cryptocurrency from cold storage to an exchange is often a sign that the holder intends to sell. The whale\u2019s 61,216 ETH tokens are worth $116,555,264 at the current market price.\n\nThe whale\u2019s nine-year-long investment in ETH has certainly produced a good return. From the Ethereum ICO price, which was just $0.31, the whale has enjoyed 614,224% gains from an initial $18,976 investment.\n\nThe wallet used to transfer the funds to the Kraken exchange had been untouched since Ethereum's genesis. There were a total of 2910 days between transactions, during which time the total cryptocurrency market capitalization (TCAP) rose from $6 billion to over $1 trillion.\n\nCould the whale\u2019s transaction impact the ETH price?\n\nWhile the Ethereum whale\u2019s transfer of funds from cold storage to Kraken may be alarming for short-term traders, the 61,216 ETH tokens are unlikely to influence price action to any significant degree. The whale\u2019s $116.5 million transfer equates to only 2% of the total daily volume, with over $5.26 billion worth of ETH being traded so far today.\n\nWhile such a large transfer of value is certainly noteworthy \u2014 especially when a long-dormant wallet has been activated \u2014 liquidity levels in the ETH/USD markets are deep enough to soak up the sell pressure for this particular transaction.\n\nThe price of ETH remains steady, with the price up less than 1% on the daily timeframe. The CoinCodex price prediction algorithm predicts a 5% upwards move from ETH over the next 5 days."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nFloor, which lets users track their NFT holdings, is about to try something pretty novel: sell exclusive NFT artwork solely through its iOS and Android apps.\n\nOn Wednesday, July 26, Floor will debut the first of 10 planned NFT drops in Icons: Series One with a new work by Vinnie Hager, an artist known for his doodle-centric art style showcased in Letters, a 2021 NFT project that has generated $10 million worth of trading to date.\n\nHager\u2019s new Icons piece, titled \u201cGround Level Garden\u201d will sell for $29.99 via the app using typical mobile payment methods, and it will be an open edition drop\u2014so there\u2019s no limit on how many can be minted during the set timeframe. After purchase, the Ethereum NFT will be airdropped to the user\u2019s specified wallet, so buyers won\u2019t need to pay for network gas fees.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHager's artwork (center) plus the skinned Floor app (left) and custom app icon (right). Image: Floor\n\nFloor co-founder and CEO Chris Maddern wouldn\u2019t reveal the additional artists lined up for the ten successive weekly art drops, but said that they all have a \u201cpretty strong following in Web3 today.\u201d Each will be priced between $19.99 and $49.99. It\u2019s not yet confirmed whether all will be open edition drops.\n\n\u201cMobile is a platform where we've gotten very used to discovering, exploring, and transacting in bite-sized snacks,\u201d Maddern told Decrypt. \u201cThis concept of bite-sized discovery, along with an affordable price point with payment rails that customers are familiar with, makes our phones the perfect place to browse, explore, and take the first small jump into collecting in Web3.\u201d\n\nApp and game developers can sell NFTs via their iOS and Android apps, but there\u2019s a hitch: they have to pay Apple or Google a cut of any in-app purchase on the App Store or Play Store, respectively, which is as much as a 30% fee on the sale price.\n\nA look at the buying flow for Floor Icons NFTs. Image: Floor\n\nThat fee may be limiting the adoption of NFTs on mobile platforms thus far, in part because they are incompatible with the decentralized ideals of the Web3 world, including the ability for users to sell their assets via secondary marketplaces. Most marketplaces charge a single-digit percentage fee on peer-to-peer NFT trades; 30% is a massive upcharge.\n\nHowever, some app developers are choosing to soak up the fee to enable mobile NFT sales. Dapper Labs launched a beta version of NBA Top Shot on mobile earlier this year, with plans to sell packs of NFT collectibles. And the move-to-earn game Stepn on iOS has a secondary marketplace, albeit with NFT prices boosted to cover Apple\u2019s cut of each sale.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMaddern confirmed that Floor will also pay a cut to Apple and Google with each NFT sale, and Floor says it worked closely with both tech giants, \u201cleveraging their evolving policies\u201d in this new mobile NFT initiative. Just last week, Google said that it will change its policies later this year to enable increased NFT integration in Android apps and games on the Play Store.\n\n\u201cOur experience over the past several months has been extremely positive as we've worked to both understand the rules and collaborate actively with Apple and Google on making the best possible experience, while ensuring it's compliant in every way,\u201d Maddern told Decrypt.\n\n\u201cWe found very progressive thinking while acknowledging the precedents they're setting, and the caution that needs to be shown when introducing hundreds of millions of users to new dynamics, as well as the effects on their broader developer ecosystems,\u201d he added. \u201cIt's left us hopeful that there will be a strong future for Web3 on both mobile platforms.\u201d\n\nFloor is selling Ethereum-based artwork, but the Icons pieces also have utility within the app. Owners will be able to customize the look of both the app itself and the home screen icon based on each Icons NFT in their wallet, adding extra perks to the purchase.\n\nThe startup, which raised $8 million in June 2022 and pulled in former Robinhood Crypto COO Christine Hall as co-founder and CEO, was built around mobile. Floor\u2019s founders believe that\u2019s the place where widespread Web3 adoption will eventually come from.\n\n\u201cMobile has the users, tools, time spent, and importantly the mindset of \u2018This is a place I go and explore,\u2019\u201d said Maddern. \u201cAlmost everything important starts by simply being fun and interesting, and the next wave of growth in Web3 has to embrace that, lower the barriers, and meet people where they are\u2014on their phone.\u201d\n\nEditor's note: This article was updated after publication to update the name of the artwork, which had changed since the information was originally provided to Decrypt."

        "title": "9 Industries That Blockchain Will Disrupt in Future - Simplilearn",
        "content": "Blockchain is already becoming popular, as you know. But it\u2019s also beginning to challenge practices in business sectors, too. In fact, many industries are finding blockchain technology better than current use measures for completing important elements of work. Let\u2019s look at the five major sectors blockchain technology is affecting.\n\n1. Banking Pretend you send $100 to your friend through a conventional bank. The bank charges you a $10 fee, so, in fact, you\u2019re only sending her $90. If she\u2019s overseas, she\u2019ll get even less because of transfer rates and other hidden fees involved. Overall, the process is time-consuming and expensive \u2013 and isn\u2019t guaranteed to be 100% secure. Blockchain, on the other hand, disrupts the commercial banking system by providing a peer-to-peer payment system with high security and low fees. No central authority exists, so you don\u2019t have to pay one. How cool is that? This eliminates the need for a third party to make a transaction using a cryptocurrency, like Bitcoin or one of the many others. Your transaction to your friend is recorded in a ledger that is viewed and reviewable by any of the cryptocurrency users \u2013 giving you true autonomy over your transaction. For example, a cryptocurrency application called Abra provides peer-to-peer money transfers. With Abra, users can store, transfer, and receive digital money on their PCs, tablets or smartphones. A recipient can withdraw cash via an Abra teller. Users don\u2019t need to have a bank account! As you can see, then, the use of cryptocurrencies instead of banks truly disrupts the personal finance market, endangering the latter \u2013 as it should be. Why pay fees and fear safety when blockchain can complete transactions quickly, freely, and without worry?\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program 2. Cybersecurity Cyberattacks are the top threat to our digital world. Look what happened to our data when Equifax announced its gigantic data breach in 2017 that affected 143 million consumers \u2013 we went crazy. Blockchain technology can end such nightmares. It can secure our data against unauthorized access and tampering. Because blockchain is a decentralized system, it\u2019s ideal for environments where high security is involved. Here, all the information stored on a bitcoin or other blockchain network is verified and encrypted using a cryptographic algorithm \u2013 which leads to no SINGLE point of entry for a wide-scale attack. Also, you can easily identify malicious data attacks with blockchain due to peer-to-peer connections, where data cannot be altered or tampered. And, by eliminating a central authority, blockchain provides a secure and transparent way of recording transactions without disclosing private information to anyone. One example of a company successfully using cybersecurity this way is Guardtime. Because of its success, we expect that many companies will follow, further disrupting this industry, too.\n\n3. Supply Chain Management Blockchain technology can trace all the steps of a supply chain, so that, let\u2019s say, you placed an order for food, had the food delivered, and found the food disgusting. The owner of the company from whom you ordered it could go back through his blockchain ledger and find out where in the supply chain the order went wrong to displease you. For example, he can go from the farmer to the producer, to the distributor, to the retailer, then to you, the purchaser. In other words, in supply chain management, blockchain provides permanent transparency and validation of transactions shared by multiple supply chain partners. All transactions are permanent and verifiable, making it easy for an owner or a customer to view each record. It can be used for any type of verification \u2013 for example, seafood verification, where it can track the seafood from ocean to market. The Pacific Tuna Project uses blockchain to manage fishing information, exporting/importing details, and purchasing details to track tuna fishing. This prevents illegal fishing. In other words, using blockchain for supply chain management work allows you to fish for the information you need and reel in the right answers every time.

Healthcare Let\u2019s face it. Today, myriad problems exist in the storage of people\u2019s health data. Anyone can have access to this very private information because it is all contained in centrally located files. When someone asks someone else for a person\u2019s information, it can take hours for that person to locate the right file, offering opportunities for data breaches, theft or losses. That\u2019s why blockchain technology in this industry is so important. Blockchain technology here eliminates the need for a central authority and enables rapid access to data. Here, each block is connected to another block and distributed across the blockchain nodes, making it difficult for a hacker to corrupt the data. Keeping personal medical file information private is of the utmost concern, so blockchain technology makes the most sense, no? Another healthcare concern revolves around counterfeit medication and blockchain technology can control this, too. The problem is that, often, counterfeit medications are difficult to distinguish from real ones. Blockchain technology solves this problem by using supply chain management protocols where the medicine provenance can be traced. United Healthcare has improved its privacy, security, and interoperability of medical records using blockchain technology. It\u2019s seen its operations improve dramatically as a result. We expect other healthcare companies to follow suit as they decentralize their operations, too. Basics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\n5. Government Blockchain technology can end voter fraud. In a traditional voting process, most voters stand in line to cast votes or send in mail votes. Then, the votes must be counted by a local authority. Online voting is possible in this scenario, too, but as with all other industries we\u2019ve discussed, because a central authority is used, problems of fraud arise. Using blockchain technology thus becomes the wisest choice. Here, people can vote online easily without revealing their identities. Using blockchain, officials can count votes with absolute accuracy, knowing that each ID can be attributed to only one vote. Fraud cannot occur because it is next to impossible with blockchain technology. And, once a vote is added to a ledger, it cannot be changed or erased. One blockchain voting platform is MiVote, a token-based platform like a digital ballot box. Voters vote through a smartphone and their votes are registered into a blockchain ledger. Safe, secure, reliable. Other applications for government include digital asset registries, wherein the fast and secure registry of an asset such as a car, home or other property is needed; notary services, where a blockchain record can better verify the seal\u2019s authenticity; and taxes, in which blockchain technology can make it easier to enable quicker tax payments, lower rates of tax fraud and have faster, easier audits. Overall, blockchain can increase transparency and security in governmental bodies. In fact, by 2020, Dubai wants to become 100% reliant on blockchain technology for all its governmental functions, making all its government services available on the blockchain. As you can see, then, these are five large industries the blockchain is already disrupting. Here are a few more where its influence is growing. A Few More Because blockchain technology never relies on a centralized authority, it will also disrupt these industries:\n\nInsurance With blockchain technology\u2019s decentralized system, insurers can identify false claims and prevent forgeries.\n\nTransportation Utilizing blockchain technology enables traceability in the transportation industry, where the shipment of goods can be easily tracked.\n\nCloud Storage Storj is a decentralized blockchain cloud storage system. By eliminating servers, Storj uses blockchain to store data in the cloud. With high speed and low cost, users can earn money by sharing their storage space on Storj."

        "content": "Amid the growing popularity of layer-2 scaling solutions based on zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, decentralized finance liquidity protocol Symbiosis has added support for Linea, a zkEVM-based scaling solution for cross-chain swaps developed by ConsenSys.\n\nSymbiosis said in a statement that Linea is a developer-ready zkEVM rollup, which means it is Ethereum-compatible and thus lets developers reuse a lot of existing infrastructure for creating multi-asset solutions. Linea comprises 100+ protocols, developer tools and decentralized applications, making it a potentially helpful scaling tool for developers in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nSymbiosis broke into the mainstream in March 2022 with its stablecoin liquidity solution. Since then, the cross-chain liquidity provider has integrated several other layer-2 scaling solutions.\n\nIn April, the protocol integrated zkSync, a ZK-rollup developed by Matter Labs. The integration helped the protocol provide one-click swaps from Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, BNB Chain, Telos and other blockchains to zkSync and back. Since April, the cross-chain liquidity protocol has added other popular L2 solutions, including Polygon\u2019s zkEVM, Optimism and Arbitrum.\n\nCointelegraph contacted Symbiosis co-founder Nick Avramov to get insight into the protocol\u2019s experience with L2 solutions, why it chose Linea and how the solution compares with other L2s. Avramov said that Linea perfectly aligns with the protocol\u2019s strategy to support the most popular L2s and that the decision to integrate it was based on community feedback and requests from partners such as OpenOcean, OKX DEX and more, which are using Symbiosis software development kit/API.\n\nOn the rise of ZK-rollups as a prominent L2 force, Avramov said:\n\n\u201cZK-rollups have better user onboarding capabilities, as they are targeting new domains like GameFi, Social, etc., to engage more people without security sacrifice, as most of these new domains rely on Ethereum and cost less.\u201d\n\nHe said ZK solutions are a natural evolution of rollups, adding, \u201cI believe, at some point, optimistic rollups will cease to exist.\u201d\n\nRelated: ConsenSys zkEVM set for public testnet to deliver secure settlements on Ethereum\n\nAvramov believes that ZK-rollups are the true L2 solution and can potentially resolve the cross-chain/multichain dilemma, an issue that Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin raised in January 2022.\n\nSymbiosis said the integration of ZK-rollups has already helped it scale and increase its transaction throughput by 300% month on month, with cross-chain trading volume soaring past $500 million. The liquidity provider believes that with the integration of Linea, cross-chain swaps can surpass $1 billion in volume in the coming months.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: Crypto audits and bug bounties are broken: Here\u2019s how to fix them"

        "title": "NFTs, Where did the buyers go? - Forkast News",
        "content": "Huge supply, high prices, similar products, little innovation, and a straight-up lack of liquidity. You could pick any of the above as reasons for the continued struggles of the non-fungible token (NFT) market. In the past, traders have typically not let these stop them from buying NFTs, but now, one in particular has become an issue. Liquidity is the elephant in the room and while there are plenty of people holding Ether in their wallets, they seem to have tightened their belts this year.\n\nLet\u2019s start by looking at how liquidity has affected this week\u2019s global trading numbers compared to last week.\n\nSource: CryptoSlam\n\nMeasuring liquidity is tricky, but there are some ways to gain insight into traders\u2019 holdings. Glassnode data shows the number of Ethereum wallets holding 1 Ether or more, and from that we see the number has remained nearly stagnant in 2023, following two years of \u201cup only.\u201d\n\nIf you didn\u2019t have more than 1 ETH before this year, you\u2019re probably not going to be holding it now, and if Ethereum holdings aren\u2019t growing that could be a sign that NFTs aren\u2019t selling. Obviously not everyone holding Ether is trading NFTs, but there\u2019s certainly a correlation here.\n\nAt a glance, we can also see that the Ethereum blockchain\u2019s utilization for NFT primary sales has fallen to 2021 levels. This is just another indicator of the NFT market losing its appeal as traders fail to find profits and are no longer willing to support new mints.\n\nIn the NFT market, transactions are declining and buyers are drying up, highlighted this past Sunday with just 194,689 total global NFT transactions. This is the lowest single day of global NFT trading volume since December 24, 2022, when we saw 156,344 total global transactions.\n\nFocusing on Ethereum trading we see 13,994 total transactions on Sunday, which is the lowest in almost two years. You have to look all the way back to July 24, 2021 to find a lower daily number when we saw 13,560 transactions.\n\nUnique buyers still hasn\u2019t reached a yearly low point, but we have only dipped below 10,000 unique buyers a few times this year. July 2021 is the last period of time with sustained buyers around that level, and that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m expecting to see over the next few months.\n\nAugust through December is typically the slowest part of the year for NFT sales, with trading action slowing down the further we get in the calendar year. With the market about to enter that period again, it\u2019s time to brace for potentially a very rough time in NFTs.\n\nNone of this is concerning for collectors and long term holders. NFT buyers are still here and watching, and are probably smarter than given credit for. I suspect they\u2019re on the sidelines, holding their ETH tightly waiting for a sign that it\u2019s time to buy again. It probably won\u2019t be this year, and maybe not even next, but watch the crypto markets. That\u2019s where we\u2019ll see a catalyst for mass adoption to crypto, and after that it will be time for these buyers to come back to NFTs.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at what\u2019s moving the charts during this slow time for NFTs.\n\nPeep the charts\n\nBitcoin\u2019s $FRAM still can\u2019t be dethroned with its US$8 million in seven day volume.\n\nstill can\u2019t be dethroned with its US$8 million in seven day volume.

        "content": "Ethereum layer-2 scaling network Starknet has now crossed a milestone of over $100 million in total value locked (TVL) on its platform. The latest breakthrough follows a recent network upgrade.\n\nWhat is Starknet?\n\nStarknet is a general-purpose scaling solution developed by Israeli software company StarkWare. The layer-2 network allows developers to deploy their decentralized applications (dApps) on its platform. It operates as a zero-knowledge rollup (validity rollup), a technology that speeds up transactions.\n\nThe network achieves this by bundling transactions into one transaction and sending them to the layer-1 Ethereum network. The benefits include high throughput, low gas fees, and high security common to Ethereum.\n\nStarknet\u2019s smart contracts are primarily written in Cairo language, a Turing programming language built for STARK proofs.\n\nStarknet Crosses $100M\n\nThe latest milestone represents a 34.5% increase since Starknet deployed its recent v0.12.0 upgrade.\n\nStarknet\u2019s \u201cQuantum Leap\u201d upgrade was deployed two weeks ago on its Goerli testnet faucet. During this time, the network recorded up to 90 transactions per second (TPS) severally, though the TPS was consistently at 37, according to StarkWare.\n\nA community vote ensued, with 97.91% of voters agreeing that the Quantum Leap be deployed on the mainnet. On July 12th, Starknet proceeded to launch the upgrade on its mainnet, increasing the number of TPS and reducing the confirmation time for each block.\n\nSince then, the daily average TPS has reached a record high of 3.29 as of today. The network\u2019s latency has also reduced from over 500 seconds to only around 15 seconds. Transaction time, on the other hand, has dropped from more than 700 seconds to about 30 seconds. The StarkWare team believes that Starknet\u2019s TPS will increase to three digits following its upgrade to Quantum Leap.\n\nStarkware CEO Uri Kolodny commended Starknet\u2019s performance, saying:\n\n\u201cWe said this upgrade would deliver potential TPS of hundreds within Q3, and only hoped from the stress test to check we\u2019re on target. A few dozen TPS at this early point would have left us excited \u2013 but we got more than we bargained for.\u201d\n\nYour crypto deserves the best security.

With the introduction of Solang, Solana Labs aims to make the Solana ecosystem more accessible to Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) developers.\n\nSolana and Ethereum: the Need for Solidity Compatibility\n\nThis exciting development marks a significant step towards bridging the gap between the two blockchain ecosystems, allowing developers to build Solidity-based smart contracts on Solana\u2019s network.\n\nadvertisement\n\nTraditionally, Solana development has relied heavily on computer languages such as Rust or C to create smart contracts. However, with the introduction of Solang, Solana Labs is expanding the platform\u2019s capabilities and appealing to a broader range of developers familiar with Solidity.\n\nBy leveraging Solidity, the most widely used language in Ethereum (ETH), Solana is enabling Ethereum developers to seamlessly transition to the Solana ecosystem, bringing their expertise and projects to a high-performance blockchain with unparalleled scalability.\n\nAdditionally, the team noted that Solana has also expanded its developer reach with a multilingual ecosystem. The availability of multiple programming languages for building on Solana attracts developers with diverse skill sets, fostering innovation and growth within the Solana ecosystem.\n\nIn the past year, the introduction of Seahorse enabled developers to write Solana smart contracts in Python, the world\u2019s most popular programming language. Today\u2019s announcement builds upon this progress, continuing the mission to broaden the scope and accessibility of the Solana ecosystem.\n\nSolang Vs EVM\n\nAccording to the announcement, Solang enables developers to call other Solana smart contracts directly from their Solidity code. This feature promotes seamless integration and interoperability within the Solana ecosystem, allowing developers to leverage existing contracts and build complex decentralized applications with ease.\n\nAdditionally, Solang provides support for Solana SPL (Solana Program Library) tokens. Developers can create and interact with SPL tokens, which are native to the Solana blockchain, through their Solidity-based smart contracts.\n\nAlso, Solang integrates seamlessly with Anchor, a framework for building Solana smart contracts. Anchor simplifies the development process by providing high-level abstractions and tooling for Solana contract development. Overall, these features help to grow the Solana ecosystem by giving developers more flexibility and options for developing novel decentralized applications and services."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nA recent survey by the online cryptocurrency portal CryptoVantage focused on American attitudes toward cryptocurrencies and produced some intriguing findings. According to the study, 78% of respondents think Bitcoin will surpass its previous record high, but only 23% think it will peak in the upcoming year, and 47% think it will happen over the next five years. Only 8% of people believe Bitcoin will never hit its all-time high again.\n\nInterestingly, 21% of respondents think Dogecoin (DOGE) has the highest chance of ever outpacing Bitcoin in market value, while 46% of Americans think Ethereum (ETH) has the best chance.\n\nThe \u201cQ2 2023 Signals Report\u201d from Fidelity Digital Assets, which was released on July 18, 2023, also contained some intriguing data on the development and prospects for Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nAccording to the research, Bitcoin and Ether have a solid growth path ahead. With a gain of about 85% year-to-date (YTD), Bitcoin has maintained significant price levels as on-chain indicators stabilize post-speculative activity. With a YTD increase of almost 62%, Ether displays potentially positive price signals and growing on-chain metrics.\n\nThere has been a net decrease in the supply of more than 700,000 Ether since the eagerly anticipated \u201cMerge\u201d in September 2022, suggesting less issuance. The growing number of Ethereum addresses performing their first transaction indicates a healthy network adoption.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdditionally, there were 15% more active Ethereum validators in the second quarter, indicating a rise in network security awareness.\n\nGrowth Beyond 2023\n\nHowever, a lot is happening in the Ethereum ecosystem regarding new developments, and the community is eagerly anticipating significant changes predicted to increase platform usage and user interest. Two crucial actions that will soon be implemented and are projected to improve the Ethereum ecosystem considerably are the adoption of EIP4844 and the launch of the base mainnet.\n\nThe much-anticipated improvement EIP4844, which is expected to be operational by the end of the year, seeks to significantly lower costs related to rollups. To boost Ethereum\u2019s transaction throughput while retaining its security, rollups are a layer 2 scaling solution. This change will probably improve user experience and entice more developers to the platform by lowering rollup expenses.\n\nWith the potential to bring millions of additional users to the ecosystem, launching the basic mainnet is another crucial milestone for Ethereum. The mainnet\u2019s extension will enable easier onboarding and participation in the Ethereum network as the popularity of decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain applications soars. This improved accessibility may lead to a major rise in the acceptance and usage of Ethereum.\n\nEthereum\u2019s rollup solutions are undergoing general enhancements in addition to these essential ones, which will help users and developers. These improvements are anticipated to improve the platform\u2019s layer 2 solutions\u2019 general performance, effectiveness, and usability, encouraging more usage and innovation within the ecosystem.\n\nAdditionally, the Ethereum community is anticipating the vibrant growth of new applications on rollups, layer 2s, and layer 3. Through these developments, novel DeFi platforms, autonomous worlds, and the tokenization of physical assets are all predicted to emerge. It is anticipated that the Ethereum ecosystem will experience a surge of innovative and disruptive applications as developers explore the potential of these new capabilities."

        "content": "The assessment revealed that NEAR Protocol was over 200,000 times more carbon efficient than Bitcoin, primarily due to the adoption of PoS over PoW.\n\nNEAR Foundation, the non-profit that supports and funds ecosystem development on NEAR Protocol, a leading open-source and climate-neutral blockchain, has announced it signed up to the Ethereum Climate Platform. The move demonstrates the foundation\u2019s commitment to sustainability in Web3 \u2013 and to working collaboratively with globally recognised leaders to minimise the environmental impact of Web3 ecosystem development.\n\nThe Ethereum Climate Alliance (ECA), convened by ConsenSys and climate tech firm Allinfra, was announced at COP27. ECA is a group of technology companies aligned around the mission to accelerate decarbonization and scale climate action. It achieves this by deploying the best-in-class technology and funding the development of digital environmental assets that will mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and deliver positive environmental and social impact for years to come.\n\nInspired by the Ethereum Merge, ECA is launching the Ethereum Climate Platform (ECP) \u2013 an initiative designed to collaboratively build a blockchain-based technology platform that will engage a decentralised community to accelerate climate finance at scale. The platform is committed to redress and counteract the historical Ethereum-based carbon footprint, dating back to the network\u2019s launch in 2015, and accelerate the launch partners\u2019 own decarbonization strategies.\n\nThe NEAR Foundation\u2019s move to join the platform signals its intention to act as a sustainability model to the broader tech and business community. The collective includes a still-growing list of prominent stakeholders from the Web3 ecosystems, including including Laser Digital (Nomura), Microsoft, Polygon, The Climate Collective, Celo, Aave, Filecoin, and UPC Capital Ventures, as well as civil society leaders, all committed to mitigating human-driven climate change.\n\nNEAR Foundation\u2019s environmental stewardship is an integral part of its ethos. From its inception, NEAR has focused on a computational alternative to PoW. In this system, known as Proof-of-Stake (PoS), there are no miners. Instead, validators stake a given token amount to allow themselves to take part. PoS blockchains incentivise communities to own and control the network. Only then can they validate blocks and collect a block award. Functionally, NEAR\u2019s PoS, called Nightshade, allows the platform to realise its ambition of being simple, scalable, and secure.\n\nNEAR Foundation CEO, Marieke Flament, commented: \u201cFrom the outset, we\u2019ve been dedicated to bringing a billion users into a more open web. We recognised early on that sustainability would be a cornerstone of our approach to facilitating the widespread adoption of Web3 technologies. By aligning with the Ethereum Climate Platform and implementing our Blockchain Operating System (BOS), we\u2019re not just enhancing the user experience \u2014 we\u2019re creating a paradigm shift in the blockchain industry that respects and supports our global environment.\u201d\n\nBill Kentrup, Executive Director of ECP added: \u201cHaving NEAR Foundation onboard this endeavour strengthens our joint mission significantly. Through persistent collective effort, we can bring to market climate finance tools that will accelate capital into climate-aligned assets and in turn, significantly mitigate greenhouse gases. As a fellow pioneer in the Web3 space, their participation is invaluable, and we\u2019re sincerely excited about the potential this partnership holds for the future.\u201d\n\nOn a social and ecological level, sharding allows NEAR Foundation to deliver on its carbon-neutral commitment. In 2021, NEAR Protocol was awarded the Climate Neutral Product Label, and its developers have been leading the charge in this era of extraordinary energy efficiency, creating an infrastructure that is lightning-fast, remarkably secure, and capable of accommodating millions of Web3 users.\n\nNEAR Protocol has achieved this after enlisting South Pole, a globally recognised climate solutions provider based in Zurich, Switzerland, to evaluate NEAR\u2019s carbon footprint, find ways to reduce it and counterbalance the remaining emissions with CO2 offsetting initiatives. The assessment revealed that NEAR Protocol was over 200,000 times more carbon efficient than Bitcoin, primarily due to the adoption of PoS over PoW.\n\nReforestation projects offset the minimal environmental impact of NEAR, thus rendering the NEAR Blockchain carbon neutral. Performing transactions on NEAR contributes to tree-planting initiatives in Colombia, Zimbabwe, and the United States via these carbon-offsetting projects.\n\nNEAR Foundation\u2019s mission since its inception has been to onboard 1 billion users to a more free, fair, and open web. The first step in the journey was to focus on building a best-in-class L1 blockchain that was easy to build on and use in a sustainable way. With the launch of the NEAR Blockchain Operating System \u2013 an industry first \u2013 anyone can create their own frontends and customise them to work with the blockchain of their choice."

Ethereum is the second-largest blockchain and a pioneer in the DeFi and smart contracts world, so it naturally has the high ground. After Ethereum, BSC and Tron have the highest TVL, with BSC holding 9.86% of TVL and Tron holding 9.68%.\n\n(Statista)\n\nThe growth of the DeFi market is estimated to happen at a CAGR of 42.5% until 2030.\n\nThe DeFi industry\u2019s size was estimated at $11.9 billion in 2021 while it\u2019s expected to reach $231.19 billion in 2030. With further adoption of digital financial services and acceptance of services enabled by blockchain, the young industry is expected to keep expanding its services.\n\n(Grand View Research)\n\nIn Q3, DeFi\u2019s growth amounted to 31% compared to Q2 2022.\n\nWith its connection to the Ethereum network, it\u2019s unsurprising that DeFi bounced back in Q3 along with it. The fastest-growing DeFi segment in this quarter was liquid staking, with an exceptional 271% growth in market cap compared to Q2.\n\n(CoinGecko)\n\nThere are about one million daily transactions on the Ethereum network, compared to over a billion via credit cards alone.\n\nAlthough DeFi is growing and attracting the attention of individuals and institutions alike, one of the top DeFi facts is that it\u2019s still incredibly small compared to traditional finance. To illustrate further, the commercial banking market is estimated at $2.7 trillion, while DeFi was worth around $11.9 billion according to the latest DeFi statistics. These statistics don\u2019t include other sectors such as insurance and investing, however, the discrepancy in size is just as prominent.\n\n(YCHarts, Nilson, IBIS World)\n\nThe most popular DeFi coin at the moment is stETH.\n\nstETH or Lido Staked Ether is ETH used on the popular liquid staking platform. With liquid staking tripling in Q3 2022, following its development will be pretty interesting.\n\n(CoinGecko)\n\nStats on DeFi Segments\n\nDEXs are the by far largest DeFi segment at 44.5% of the market cap share.\n\nWith a market cap share of 44.5%, DEXs remain the largest segment in the decentralized finance world. Oracles (systems that enable the implementation of hybrid smart contracts, vital for the development of Web 3.0) are the second-largest segment with 18.5% of the market cap, while Lending takes up 15.8% of the market cap in Q3 2022.\n\n(CoinGecko)\n\nThe trading volume on decentralized exchanges has reached $952 billion in the last 12 months.\n\nAt around $1 billion in volume per day, the world\u2019s largest DEX Uniswap accounts for most of this volume. What\u2019s more, it has around 70% of the DEX market share. DODO, Curve, and Sushiswap are next on the list below Uniswap when it comes to market share. However, with market shares peaking at around 12% for the biggest, DODO, they are still far behind.\n\n(Dune)\n\nThe market cap of DEXs increased by 36.8% in Q3 2022.\n\nThe latest statistics on DeFi show the market cap of DEXs climbed to $10.9 billion in Q3. Oracles grew by 18.9% to $4.52 billion, while Lending grew by 16.7% to $3.86 billion. The only segment that fell during this quarter is Asset Management, which dropped by 63.3%.\n\n(CoinGecko)\n\nDeFi Users By Country\n\nBetween July 2021 and June 2022, the country that received the highest value in DeFi is India.\n\nIndia ranks first when it comes to the value of DeFi transactions for individuals and when it comes to retail-sized transactions. Moreover, in India, ETH accounts for about 40% of the total received crypto value. One reason for this is that India receives a lot of remittances that are more easily and more affordably sent as cryptocurrency. Lebanon has the second-highest value received through DeFi protocols.\n\n(Chainalysis)\n\nThe US is the second in the world according to retail DeFi value received.\n\nWith India and Lebanon leading the way when it comes to DeFi transactions, the United States is the country with the highest number of interactions with DeFi of all developed markets. Its interactions with decentralized finance are driven by interest in innovation and investment, as it\u2019s among the better-known facts on DeFi that many key players such as Uniswap originate from the US. When it comes to smaller-sized DeFi transactions, the US ranks third.\n\n(Chainalysis)\n\nDeFi made up 37% of all North American crypto transaction volume between July 2021 and June 2022.\n\nDeFi statistics show North America has the highest participation of DeFi in crypto transactions globally. It\u2019s followed by Western Europe with 31%, which the report explains with the fact investing and speculation are more likely in markets with higher purchasing power. Other regions have significantly lower DeFi activity compared to overall crypto transaction volume.\n\n(Chainalysis)\n\nEurope\u2019s most prominent DeFi player is the United Kingdom.\n\nAs Western, Northern, and Central Europe stand out as the region with the largest crypto economy in the world, it\u2019s not surprising that the region is strong when it comes to DeFi, too. And in the DeFi sector, the UK is the leader. The country drives almost 20% of the entire region\u2019s web traffic to both NFT and DeFi lending websites.\n\n(Chainalysis)\n\nDeFi Statistics: FAQ\n\nWhat is DeFi? DeFi or decentralized finance refers to an industry that seeks to decentralize services including remittances, lending, insurance, investing, and saving through the use of blockchain. It focuses on enabling services without the need for a central authority like a bank to ensure safety. What is the DeFi market worth? The latest DeFi revenue estimate equaled $11.9 billion (2021). However, the total value locked in the industry is significantly higher, reaching $55.9 billion as of November 6, 2022. How many people are in DeFi? The number of DeFi users in the world is estimated at 4.8 million in 2022 (July data). This number refers to unique accounts rather than people. With 660,000 new users in the first seven months of 2022, the growth in the number of users decreased by about one-half compared to the same time the previous year. What are the most popular DeFi coins? The most popular DeFi coins as of November 2022 are stETH (or Lido-Staked Ether), DAI (a Maker-issued US-pegged stablecoin), and UNI (Uniswap\u2019s native token).\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nDeFi is the most innovative segment in crypto, offering opportunities for many services present in traditional finance as well, including investing, saving, exchanges, lending, sending remittances, and insurance. The DeFi market is still tiny compared to traditional finance, but it\u2019s growing at a 42.5% CAGR, and recovering even in a difficult year for all global markets.\n\nDeFi statistics show there are still fewer than five million unique accounts as of July 2022. However, the DeFi sector is making waves in countries that have high purchasing power such as the UK and the US, and in countries with lower and middle incomes such as India and Lebanon, where it\u2019s useful as a transaction path.\n\nSources:\n\nHere Are More DeFi Guides"

        "title": "What\u2019s The Minimum Amount of ETH You Can Buy? - Crypto News Flash",
        "content": "If you\u2019re new to the world of cryptocurrency investing, you might be wondering if Ethereum is a good investment. Investing in ETH can pay off big time, but it carries some degree of risk.\n\nA responsible approach is key to a successful trading experience because it protects you from undesired outcomes and unexpected market events.\n\nEthereum remains one of the strongest players in the field, with a market cap of $214.40B USD, offering distinct advantages like smart contracts, NFTs, and the metaverse. At present, you can buy Ethereum with credit card after creating and verifying your account.\n\nTo buy Ethereum, all you have to do is to enter the symbol of Eth in your crypto exchange\u2019s \u201cbuy\u201d field and select the amount you want to buy. It doesn\u2019t take thousands of dollars to invest in Ethereum. In case you didn\u2019t know, ETH is made up of smaller units known as Wei, meaning you can buy small amounts of Ethereum. Maybe you don\u2019t have enough money in your account for a full coin. In that case, you can purchase a fractional share of ETH \u2013 a Wei amounts to 0.000000000000000001 ETH. Wei isn\u2019t the only measure of value of small amounts of Ethereum. The most commonly used demonization when discussing ETH transactions is the Gwei, equivalent to 1 million Wei; it\u2019s used to pay for gas fees.\n\nThe Easiest Way to Buy ETH Is Via a Centralized Exchange\n\nWhether you\u2019re looking to buy Ethereum or parts of an ETH coin, the simplest way to go about it is via an online exchange. A cryptocurrency exchange is a platform offered to traders and investors to execute transactions in a networked environment. You can buy, sell, and exchange digital assets with low fees. In real-world terms, $1,782.62 is a lot of money, so if you want to get involved in the global network, buy fractions of Ethereum. A centralized exchange offers various payment methods, including bank transfers, credit/debit cards, PayPal, and so forth. Attention must be paid to the fact that each platform has different stipulations regarding credit card use. If your credit card is MasterCard, there\u2019s a chance it won\u2019t be accepted.\n\nYou\u2019ll want to do some research on the crypto exchange\u2019s history, team, vision, and goals, not to mention its community and social media presence. The preferred currency is the US dollar, even if most centralized exchanges accept the euro; a small number of crypto exchanges accept the British pound sterling and Japanese yen. To create an account, you must provide some basic information, such as your name, email address, date of birth, and country of residence. Once your account is verified, you can start depositing funds and trading cryptocurrencies. Instant sign-up is possible on some exchanges, while others may take some time to get you verified.\n\nYou Can Interact with Defi Apps on The Ethereum Blockchain\n\nDeFi, short for decentralized finance, is based on secure distributed ledgers identical to those used by cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. DeFi applications don\u2019t rely on a central computer to send and receive information, having many use cases, of which mention can be made of predictions markets, lending, games, etc. DeFi protocols are automated and executed via smart contracts, which run when predetermined conditions are met, eliminating the need for intermediaries and enhancing efficiency. You\u2019ll need less than 1 ETH to pay for gas fees for popular dApps, so convert your fiat to crypto without delay.\n\nDue to decentralization, there\u2019s no powerful company or government body to influence your actions, but you need to purchase or earn its utility token. The Ethereum blockchain currently leads the pack as the ideal platform to build dApps as a result of the maturity of its ecosystem. Threat actors can\u2019t tamper with the records on the blockchain, developers can create cryptographic tokens by coding smart contracts, and various tools and resources are available (Solidity, Vyper, Remix IDE). dApps can be accessed from a mobile device, as most of them have a responsive user interface and are easy to access. Just so you know, you\u2019ll need a Web3 browser and a tool like MetaMask.\n\nWhere Will You Store Your Newly Acquired ETH?\n\nThe most straightforward approach to storing Ethereum or fractions of ETH is an externally owned account, which is nothing more than an asymmetric key pair (a public key and a private key). Ethereum tokens can be stored in a smart contract that is associated with a code and, once deployed on the blockchain, executes the function for which it\u2019s written. Smart contracts can act as wallets and store ETH, but they need a payable function; you can send what you want and the rest is stored in the contract. The records are stored on the blockchain, and you\u2019ll interact only with the blockchain to enable transactions.\n\nAn alternative to privately-owned wallets is the custodial wallet. Centralized exchanges like Binance create a wallet for you, so you can manage your funds directly from the web browser. You trust the service provider to securely store your coins and implement strong security measures to prevent unauthorized measures. Approximately 95% of the digital assets are stored in cold storage, and the crypto exchange goes beyond standard precautions to ensure everything is alright. By contrast, a non-custodial wallet enables the user to retain full control of their holdings, so they can manage their private key and handle transactions.\n\nWrapping It Up\n\nEthereum has proved to be a good investment, but it\u2019s not for the faint of heart. Officially, Ethereum has a minimum fractional number called a Wei, facilitating transactional operations on the blockchain network. Binance has a minimum of 0.001 ETH for any trade. In the technical documents, there are other denominations of Ethereum, such as Gwei, Kwei, Mwei, etc. Figure out what sum of money you want to invest and split up the investment into several chunks. The Ethereum wallet ecosystem has limited options right now, so be wise in choosing one if you want your funds to be safe. A hardware wallet will definitely cost you a lot more.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum might be the two top cryptocurrencies by market cap, but according to a \u201cparabolic\u201d high timeframe signal, Litecoin and XRP could soon lead the market higher.\n\nThe lack of the technical tool being triggered in BTC and ETH suggests that these two front runners could lag behind the lower-ranked altcoins. Here\u2019s a closer look at why.\n\nExplaining The Parabolic SAR In Crypto\n\nCryptocurrencies are known for their impressive, parabolic rallies, that later causes prices to reach extreme overvaluations. When the parabola breaks down, the trend tends to reverse into a brutal bear market. Understanding when these trend changes occur is the key to being profitable in the crypto market.\n\nCertain tools are designed for just this purpose. For example, the Parabolic SAR tells a trader when a trend has \u201cstopped\u201d and \u201creversed.\u201d It was created by J. Wells Wilder, Jr., who is the father of several popular technical tools, such as the Relative Strength Index, Average True Range, and more.\n\nUsing this tool on the 1M timeframe across top crypto assets ranging from Litecoin to XRP, and Bitcoin to Ethereum, shows that only LTCUSD and XRPUSD have tagged the Parabolic SAR. Based on the tool\u2019s design, this should mean that the downtrend in these assets has stopped and reversed.\n\nWill LTC and Ripple lead?| LTCUSD on TradingView.com\n\nWhy Litecoin And XRP Could Lead Bitcoin And Ethereum\n\nLitecoin and XRP leading the crypto market recovery is unusual. Bitcoin and Ethereum each set dramatic new all-time highs in 2021, while LTC and XRP didn\u2019t. This could be contributing to the signal being triggered earlier than in BTC and ETH.\n\nLTC and XRP sellers could be significantly more exhausted having suffered through a much longer drawdown from all-time highs. Each of the two altcoins drastically outperformed Bitcoin and Ethereum in 2017, so the scenario is not impossible \u2014 it just isn\u2019t something we\u2019ve seen in six years.\n\nFor Bitcoin and Ether to trigger the same signal BTCUSD will need to reach nearly $42,000 per coin, while ETHUSD will need to trade above $3,300. These targets are still a distance away, compared to Litecoin and XRP which have already caused the SAR to move below price action.\n\nAt this point, the tool can be used to set a trailing stop loss, placing a stop loss order at the SAR indicator. When tagged, it stops the trader out at a point where there is a higher probability the trend has stopped and reversed."

        "content": "There is considerable speculation within the cryptocurrency market regarding Ethereum\u2019s potential to surpass Bitcoin in terms of popularity and value. Recent reports indicate that long-term investors are showing a preference for Ethereum over other cryptocurrencies. According to a survey by CryptoVantage, out of 1,000 North American investors who have invested in cryptocurrencies over the past five years, 46% of respondents see ETH as the primary candidate to outshine Bitcoin. Dogecoin also garnered some interest, with 20.8% of investors believing it could challenge BTC. Other cryptocurrencies like Binance Coin, Solana, and Cardano were mentioned on the list, but their chances of overtaking Bitcoin were considered low.\n\nEthereum has maintained its popularity among investors due to various reasons. However, it\u2019s worth noting that Bitcoin still holds a dominant position in the cryptocurrency industry. In the last quarter, Bitcoin\u2019s dominance increased significantly by 3.2%, reaching 47.9%, which was last observed in Q2 2021. In contrast, ETH experienced a modest surge of 1% during the second quarter of 2023. Despite the growing interest in Ethereum, Bitcoin\u2019s dominance remains strong.\n\nFurthermore, in the last quarter, Bitcoin recorded a price return of 6.9%, and Ethereum followed closely with a 6% increase during the same period. These figures indicate that ETH may encounter difficulties in catching up to Bitcoin\u2019s dominant position in the market. However, it is important to consider that short-term price movements might not accurately reflect long-term trends.\n\nAs of the current moment, Bitcoin\u2019s price stands at $30,012, with a market cap of $583.35 billion. On the other hand, Ethereum\u2019s market cap is noted at $229.54 billion, and its price hovers around $1,909.\n\nEthereum Holds Steady in the Institutional Arena\n\nAccording to a recent survey conducted by CoinShares among prominent asset managers, Bitcoin is widely regarded as the cryptocurrency with the most promising growth potential. Institutional investors have significantly influenced the cryptocurrency market by offering substantial support to Bitcoin. Despite this, ETH still holds the largest share in the portfolios of these asset managers. This underscores the enduring confidence and optimism surrounding Ethereum\u2019s future prospects, leading to the belief that it has the potential to surpass Bitcoin in the long run.\n\nHowever, there are challenges to overcome in order to surpass Bitcoin\u2019s current dominant position. As the crypto market constantly evolves, only time will tell whether Ethereum can narrow the gap and firmly establish itself as a leading cryptocurrency."

        "content": "Solana announced on its official Twitter handle on July 19, 2023 the launch of Solang, a powerful compiler aimed at facilitating the integration of Ethereum developers into the Solana ecosystem.\n\nWith Solang, developers proficient in Ethereum\u2019s Solidity programming language and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) can now create and deploy smart contracts on the energy-efficient Solana network, significantly expanding the platform\u2019s potential developer base and fostering compatibility between the two blockchain giants.\n\nEnhancing Solidity Compatibility On The Solana Network\n\nSolana Labs\u2019 release of the Solang compiler marks a significant milestone in the realm of blockchain development. Prior to this, Solana\u2019s smart contracts were predominantly written in Rust or C languages, which presented a barrier for Ethereum developers accustomed to Solidity. Solang\u2019s introduction changes the game by offering a smooth transition for Ethereum developers seeking to explore the Solana network.\n\nWith Solang\u2019s support for Ethereum Solidity 0.8 and native integration with Solana SPL tokens, developers can now leverage familiar tools while enjoying access to the inherent advantages of the Solana ecosystem. Additionally, Solang enables developers to call other Solana smart contracts, expanding the possibilities for decentralized applications on the network.\n\nWhile Solang and Neon EVM share the common goal of onboarding Ethereum developers to Solana, they are considered complementary approaches rather than direct competitors. Solang acts as a bridge between EVM developers and the Solana ecosystem, facilitating a smooth transition by providing Solidity compatibility.\n\nSOL price sitting at $25 | Source: SOLUSD on TradingView.com\n\nIn a tweet, Austin Federa, Solana\u2019s Head of Strategy, likened the relationship between Neon EVN and Solang to running a program built for Windows on a Mac, emphasizing their collaborative efforts in embracing Ethereum developers. Neon EVM, on the other hand, adds a smart contract layer on top of Solana, enabling the deployment of EVM code and allowing Ethereum applications to leverage Solana\u2019s native features, such as parallel transaction execution.\n\nImpact On Ecosystem And SOL\u2019s Performance\n\nAs Solana Labs continues its efforts to expand its ecosystem by introducing innovative tools like Solang and Neon EVM, the performance of its native cryptocurrency, SOL, has seen substantial improvement.\n\nIn just one month, SOL\u2019s trading price leaped from $16 to over $25, a testament to the growing interest and confidence in the Solana network.\n\nThe introduction of Solang and Neon EVM has played a pivotal role in strengthening the network\u2019s appeal to developers and investors alike, highlighting Solana\u2019s commitment to attracting Ethereum developers and fostering compatibility between the two prominent blockchain ecosystems.\n\nFeatured image from Guarda Wallet, chart from TradingView.com"

For a full disclaimer, please click here.\n\nCoinbase recently imposed limitations on Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) staking operations within four US states: California, New Jersey, South Carolina, and Wisconsin. Meanwhile, VC Spectra (SPCT) has made headlines with its global expansion, targeting promising blockchain and technology startups.\n\nLet\u2019s delve into how the actions of Coinbase will affect Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), as well as VC Spectra\u2019s (SPCT) unique proposition.\n\n>>BUY SPCT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nEthereum (ETH): The Aftermath of Restricted Staking\n\nCoinbase\u2019s restrictions on Ethereum (ETH) staking have significant implications for the cryptocurrency community and the overall Ethereum (ETH) ecosystem.\n\nFirst, the restrictions reduce the options available to investors looking to stake their Ethereum (ETH) holdings and earn rewards through the staking process.\n\nMoreover, there could be a reduction in liquidity for Ethereum (ETH) staking on the Coinbase platform. As a result, there may be a decline in staking activity and a significant reduction in ETH tokens being locked in the staking process.\n\nUltimately, the restrictions will cause a shift in investor behavior as many are likely to seek alternative platforms or methods to stake their tokens.\n\nDue to the recent developments, Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) price plunged by 5.1% in the past four days, from $2,020 to $1,915. According to experts, Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) price may plunge by another 4.6% in the coming weeks, from $1,915 to $1,826.\n\nUncovering the Effects: Solana (SOL) Contemplates Restricted Staking\u2019s Aftermath\n\nJust like with Ethereum, Coinbase\u2019s restrictions will affect the Solana (SOL) ecosystem and the crypto world in general.\n\nGranted, Coinbase\u2019s decision to restrict Solana (SOL) staking in specific states likely stems from regulatory considerations. By imposing these limitations, Coinbase aims to ensure compliance with local regulations, mitigating potential legal risks. However, this move highlights the challenges faced by cryptocurrency exchanges while navigating the complex regulatory environment.\n\nFor Solana (SOL), the limitations could also indicate a need for more precise and uniform regulations regarding staking activities across different states. This may prompt regulatory authorities to revisit and provide more explicit guidelines, potentially leading to a more standardized approach to staking regulations in the future.\n\nAnother probable impact of the restriction on Solana (SOL) staking is that it may influence market sentiment, potentially leading to increased volatility or adversely affecting Solana\u2019s (SOL) price in the short term.\n\nIn the wake of Solana\u2019s (SOL) challenges, the token dropped by 11.2% in four days, from $29.46 to $26.16. Analysts indicate Solana (SOL) may slump by 5% in the coming weeks, from $26.16 to $24.84.\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT) Moves Towards Expanding Globally\n\nWhile Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) wriggle through regulatory restrictions, VC Spectra (SPCT) is taking steps in the right direction. As a decentralized hedge fund, VC Spectra (SPCT) employs a thorough selection process to identify promising opportunities within the blockchain space.\n\nFurthermore, VC Spectra (SPCT) incentivizes investors with quarterly dividends and buybacks tied to investment performance. As a frontrunner in the blockchain space, VC Spectra (SPCT) leverages AI to optimize returns and mitigate possible risks.\n\nMoreover, VC Spectra\u2019s native token (SPCT) operates on the Bitcoin blockchain and follows the BRC-20 protocol. SPCT\u2019s deflationary model fosters scarcity, amplifying VC Spectra\u2019s (SPCT) value over time.\n\nCurrently trading at $0.008 in Stage 1 of its public presale, VC Spectra (SPCT) is expected to surge to $0.011 in Stage 2, representing a 37.5% ROI. Expert projections further suggest an extraordinary 900% increase, driving VC Spectra\u2019s (SPCT) price to $0.08 once it launches on major platforms.
