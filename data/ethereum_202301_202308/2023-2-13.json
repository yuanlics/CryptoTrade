        "content": "As the race to deploy zero-knowledge (zk) technology intensifies, Polygon reveals that it will launch its zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) Mainnet Beta on March 27.\n\nHailed by Vitalik Buterin as the future of Ethereum scaling, the layer-2 scaling solution first revealed its zkEVM in July last year \u2014 promising faster transaction speeds than optimistic rollups.\n\n\u201cWe are delighted to share the launch date for the Polygon zkEVM Mainnet Beta which is coming in the first quarter of 2023 as promised,\u201d Sandeep Nailwal, co-founder of Polygon Technology told Blockworks.\n\nPolygon\u2019s zkEVM mainnet will be the first \u201cfully EVM equivalent\u201d zk rollup to reach Ethereum mainnet, Nailwal said.\n\n\u201cThis represents a huge step towards scaling Ethereum and bringing Web3 to the masses,\u201d he said.\n\nZk rollup technology moves transaction verification off-chain and then batches them so they can be settled on Ethereum. The process uses a \u201cprover\u201d that determines if a dataset is true or false \u2014 all while maintaining user privacy.\n\nBlockworks research analyst Sam Martin noted that \u201czkEVM race is well underway, with stiff competition amongst zkSync, Polygon, Scroll, Taiko, and others.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll teams are taking different approaches, but Polygon\u2019s zkEVM has been classified as a Type-3 by Vitalik Buterin given its near EVM equivalence and choice to forgo the use of precompiles,\u201d he said.\n\nType-3 zkEVMs are \u201calmost EVM-equivalent\u201d \u2014 but require a few sacrifices before it meets the golden standard of Type-1, the fully Ethereum equivalent EVM.\n\n\u201cIt is possible that the first zkEVM to launch on mainnet without any limitations could garner significant traction with a first-mover advantage, so keeping a close eye on developments in this space throughout 2023 will be important.\u201d\n\nOver the next couple of weeks, Polygon Labs, the team behind Polygon \u2014 will be revealing more details about the Mainnet Beta.\n\n\u201cSecurity is the highest priority, which is why Polygon zkEVM has been run through a gauntlet of tests and audits,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cUsers and devs can expect full transparency about the security measures that will protect the Ethereum community during Mainnet Beta.\u201d\n\nAt the time of writing, Polygon\u2019s MATIC token is trading at $1.23, up by over 4% over the past 24 hours.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "The percentage of Ethereum blocks complying with orders set by the United States Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) has now fallen to 47% \u2014 the lowest level since Oct. 11.\n\nThe latest milestone in reversing censorship comes nearly three months after the percentage of OFAC-compliant blocks peaked at 79% on Nov. 21.\n\nOFAC-compliant blocks are those that exclude transactions involving parties sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control.\n\nA fall in compliant blocks could be seen as a win for those who oppose censorship within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nPercentage of OFAC-compliant blocks following the Ethereum Merge on Sept. 15. Source. MEV Watch.\n\nBlockchain consulting firm Labrys, the creator of MEV Watch, said in a statement thathe fall may be attributed to more validators opting to use MEV-boost relays that do not censor transactions in accordance with OFAC requirements.\n\n\u201cIn particular, the BloXroute Max Profit relay, Ultrasound Money relay and Agnostic Boost relay have picked up most of the change in market share.\u201d\n\nMEV-boost relays act as trusted mediators between block producers and block builders, which enables Ethereum validators to outsource their block production to other block builders.\n\nLachlan Feeney, the CEO of Labrys, said in a Feb. 14 statement that he\u2019s happy with how the Ethereum community has responded to the censorship issue since it first surfaced post-Merge.\n\nHe noted the recent fall in censorship-compliant blocks was particularly notable given it was achieved without a user-activated soft fork (UASF). He noted that \u201cmany members\u201d of the Ethereum community had called for the soft fork prior to the Merge to combat censorship.\n\n\u201cI am incredibly proud of the Ethereum community for the progress we have made with this issue,\u201d said Feeney, adding:\n\n\u201cWhen we released the MevWatch tool drawing attention to a flaw within Ethereum, the community did not stick its head in the sand but instead rose to the occasion and made significant progress addressing the issue.\u201d\n\nHowever, \u201cthere is still more work to be done,\u201d Feeney stressed.\n\nRelated: Ethereum at the center of centralization debate as SEC lays claim\n\nOFAC most notably sanctioned Ether (ETH) and USD Coin (USDC) wallet addresses that transact using the Ethereum-based privacy mixing tool Tornado Cash on Aug. 8.\n\nA visualization of the last 100 blocks showing which are OFAC-compliant.

MEV Watch\n\nAfter the first 24 hours of Ethereum under its new proof-of-stake consensus mechanism on Sept. 16, only 9% of blocks were OFAC-censored.\n\nHowever this figure sharply increased over the next two months, peaking at 79% on Nov. 21.\n\nThe percentage of OFAC-compliant blocks then hovered around the 68-75% range until Jan. 29 when it was 66%. Since then, it has steadily decreased despite a few minor spikes."

        "content": "Join the most important conversation in crypto and web3! Secure your seat today\n\nAfter the U.S. government blacklisted Tornado Cash transactions for U.S. people in August, there was a swift response by validators on the Ethereum blockchain to exclude sanctioned transactions. For many in the crypto industry, such moves were decried as censorship \u2013 directly counter to the vision of a decentralized network free from government interference.\n\nNow, however, the trend is going the other way, and more blocks with Tornado Cash are going through even if they\u2019re not compliant with U.S. Treasury Dept. sanctions.\n\nAccording to an MEV watchdog site, just 49% of blocks that made it onto the Ethereum blockchain over the past 24 hours were OFAC-compliant, meaning the blocks excluded transactions that have been sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control.\n\nThis is a significant decrease in censorship from Ethereum\u2019s past. Ethereum hit an all-time high for censorship on Nov. 21, when 79% of blocks relayed on Ethereum excluded OFAC-sanctioned transactions. The last time that Ethereum\u2019s censored blocks were below 50% was Oct.16.\n\nPut another way, that means that more than half of the blocks that made it onto the Ethereum blockchain over the last 24 hours are non-OFAC compliant.\n\nSo what has reversed Ethereum\u2019s censorship course?\n\nPost-Merge OFAC Compliant Blocks (mevwatch.info)\n\nMEV-Boost contributed to Ethereum\u2019s censorship problem\n\nSince Ethereum changed its consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake in September (known as the Merge), most of the blocks that make it onto the blockchain go through a middleware component known as MEV-Boost, which is a software that allows validators to request pre-made blocks from builders.\n\nMEV-Boost came into existence to help validators earn MEV, or Maximal Extractible Value, which are profits derived from including or reordering transactions within a block.\n\nThe software was built by Flashbots, an Ethereum research and development team, in order to democratize MEV among validators and skirt issues of centralization.\n\nStory continues\n\nFlashbots has succeeded in having MEV-Boost used across the ecosystem, as 96% of validators today have relayed blocks via the middleware. The firm also runs its own relayer, which is used by 68% of validators.\n\nBut a new set of issues, mainly censorship, arose with MEV-Boost after OFAC blacklisted Tornado Cash transactions for U.S. people in August.\n\nAs a result of the sanctioning, relayers using MEV-Boost deliver to their connected validators only pre-built blocks without Tornado Cash transactions included. In other words, MEV-Boost was censoring blocks by default.\n\nRead more: Is Ethereum\u2019s Censorship Problem Taking a Turn?\n\nHas the censorship course reversed?\n\nThe push for validators to connect to other relayers that are not Flashbots\u2019 has been at the center of reversing Ethereum\u2019s censorship course.\n\nToday, 68% of blocks relayed have been done via Flashbots. As recently as December, that number was at 74%. Before Flashbots began censoring Tornado Cash transactions following the Merge, it open-sourced the code so that others could develop their own non-censoring relays.\n\nThere are now seven relayers that are noncensoring. Those include two of BloXroute\u2019s relayers (max profit and ethical), Ultrasound, Agnostic Gnosis, Manifold, Relayoor and Aestus.\n\nRelayers and total market share (mevboost.pics)\n\nMartin K\u00f6ppelmann, a censorship-resistance advocate and the co-founder of Gnosis Chain, which also runs a noncensoring relayer, shared in a tweet that the decline in censorship is partially thanks to BloXroute, Ultrasound and Gnosis since they make up most of the uncensored block space.\n\nWhile this is good news this very much depends currently on just 3 entities: @bloXrouteLabs, @ultrasoundmoney, and @GnosisDAO (those 3 relays make up for 47% of uncensored block space)\n\nSo we still need more systemic solutions \ud83d\udc47https://t.co/xo3zTKqiMu \u2014 Martin K\u00f6ppelmann \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6 (@koeppelmann) February 14, 2023\n\nK\u00f6ppelmann told CoinDesk that he believes this \u201cis good news and I am happy Gnosis is contributing, but I also believe Ethereum censorship resistance should not depend on so few entities.\u201d\n\nRead more: Is Ethereum\u2019s Censorship Problem Taking a Turn?"

        "content": "On-chain data from Santiment shows the Ethereum supply on exchanges has dropped by 37% since the Merge in September last year.\n\nEthereum Supply On Exchanges Has Continued To Decline Recently\n\nAs per the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, ETH continuing to leave exchanges can be good news for the cryptocurrency. The \u201csupply on exchanges\u201d is an indicator that measures the total amount of Ethereum that\u2019s currently sitting in the wallets of all centralized exchanges.\n\nWhen this metric\u2019s value increases, investors transfer a net number of coins to exchanges. Since one of the main reasons holders may deposit their coins to exchanges is for selling purposes, this trend can have bearish implications for the asset\u2019s price.\n\nOn the other hand, the indicator observing a decline suggests that a net amount of supply is leaving these platforms currently. As the exchange supply can be considered a sort of available \u201cselling supply\u201d for ETH, its value decreasing can naturally be bullish for the coin.\n\nNow, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Ethereum supply on exchanges over the last few months:\n\nThe value of the metric seems to have sharply gone down in recent days | Source: Santiment on Twitter\n\nAs shown in the above graph, the Ethereum supply on exchanges measured around 19.12 million ETH back on the 14th of September 2022, the date of the much-hyped Merge, which successfully transitioned the network consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake (PoS) one.\n\nSince then, the indicator has observed a significant decline, leading to the number of exchanges still left today being just 13.36 million ETH. Regarding capital loss, today\u2019s exchange supply is worth about 37% less than it was during the Merge.\n\nAnd in terms of the pure difference in the total number of coins, these platforms today hold about 30% less Ethereum supply than on the date of the PoS upgrade. Santiment thinks this is good news for the Ethereum market, as the available selling supply has continuously shrunk in recent months.\n\nThe chart shows that the most drastic drawdown in the indicator came following the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX. The reason behind that is a known platform like FTX going belly up renewed fear around centralized exchanges among investors, pushing them to take their coins to offsite wallets.\n\nThe price of Ethereum has registered a decline in the past week. Still, as is visible in the graph, the Ethereum supply on exchanges has seen a noticeably sharper decline following this price dip, which may be a sign that investors are accumulating more while ETH is at a \u201cdiscount.\u201d\n\nETH Price\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $1,500, down 8% in the last week.\n\nIt looks like the value of ETH hasn't moved much in the last few days | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Jievani Weerasinghe on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, Santiment.\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Discover SCENE\n\nA valuable digital collectible was permanently removed from circulation over the weekend, as its owner aimed to symbolically shift the asset\u2019s underlying blockchain from Ethereum to Bitcoin.\n\nThe collectible was Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) #1626, an Ape from the most valuable project in the NFT space. Its most recent sale on OpenSea took place last November when it sold for 108 Ethereum\u2014that's nearly $432,000 at the time of the transaction, or around $169,000 at today's prices.\n\nNFTs are digital assets that are provably unique and signify the ownership of an item, often digital art. The ownership of BAYC #1626 is linked to a digital token that is recorded on the Ethereum network, where it could also be traded\u2014that is, up until recently.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDigital tokens can be permanently removed from circulation through a process called burning, which involves sending an asset to a location where it cannot be retrieved. Jason Williams claimed to have burned BAYC #1626 over the weekend, preventing it from being sold ever again, at least on Ethereum\u2019s network.\n\n\u200b\u200b\u201cEssentially throwing a Lamborghini into a trash compactor\u2013It's kind of fun,\u201d Williams told Decrypt. \u201cWhether putting bloated JPEGs on Bitcoin\u2019s base chain is smart or not is a whole 'nother discussion, but I think it's going to be a lot of fun seeing how it plays out.\u201d\n\nWilliams believes his Ape now exists on Bitcoin. That\u2019s because the location to which BAYC #1626 was burned is linked to an Inscription made through Ordinals. Ordinals, created by Casey Rodarmor, is a project that allows content like videos and images to be assigned to individual satoshis\u2014the smallest unit that Bitcoin can be divided into\u2014where they permanently exist on Bitcoin\u2019s network as Inscriptions.\n\nEven though the number of Inscriptions on Bitcoin is approaching 100,000, there are few notable marketplaces for people to trade them, and a significant number of buyers and sellers are linked together currently through Ordinal\u2019s discord server.\n\nThe burn took place using a newly developed feature for Ordinals named Teleburn, which creates a unique location with each new Inscription to which digital assets can be burned. The feature allows users to assign an existing asset from another network to a Bitcoin Inscription while removing it from circulation, effectively transferring the token between chains in the eyes of those who created the new feature.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe idea is that you are one-way, permanently burning an asset on another chain and pointing it to the ordinal that lives on the Bitcoin chain,\u201d said Rob Hamilton, who collaborated with Rodarmor to create the new Ordinals feature.\n\nHamilton approached Rodarmor about developing the Teleburn function last Saturday at Bitcoin Park, a coworking space in Nashville, Tennessee that caters to the Bitcoin community. The two decided to work together after Hamilton pointed out that Williams wanted to burn his Ape, who had responded to one of Rodarmor\u2019s Tweets.\n\nHelp me. \u2014 Jason A. Williams (@GoingParabolic) February 11, 2023\n\n\u201cLet's go write some code right now,\u201d Rodarmor said, according to Hamilton, adding that the prospect of burning an Ape got Rodarmor \u201creally excited.\u201d\n\nRodarmar did not respond to requests for comment from Decrypt. However, the two can be seen developing Ordinal\u2019s Teleburn function in a recent Tweet, according to Hamilton.\n\nBurning BAYC #1626 wasn\u2019t the first time that Ordinal\u2019s Teleburn function was used. Rodarmor first tested the new feature out on an ENS domain he owned, rodarmor.eth. Then the pair oversaw Williams as he burned the ape.\n\nThe term Teleburn was coined by Rodarmor, as a combination of the words teleport and burn, said Hamilton. Rodarmor referenced the function\u2019s hasty development with Hamilton in a recent tweet.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHamilton believes the Teleburn function will catch on as a way for people to bridge their digital collectibles, noting that Rodarmor plans to extend Ordinal\u2019s Teleburn support to assets on other chains aside from Ethereum, such as Tezos and Solana.\n\n\u201cThis has now set the standard of representing an asset across the chain,\u201c said Hamilton. \u201cIt's going to be the way to actually have skin in the game,\u201d pointing out that assets burned are permanently gone from circulation.\n\nA chimp off the old block?\n\nAs news of the Bored Ape burn spread on Twitter Monday, Yuga Labs co-founder Greg Solano weighed in on the matter, stating the Inscription linked to BAYC #1626 is an unlicensed reproduction of the original NFT because Williams no longer maintains its possession on Ethereum\u2019s network.\n\n\u201cIf you transfer your ape to an address you no longer control (even if it's the 'burn' address), you have effectively given up your license,\u201d he stated.\n\nSolano also pushed back against the notion that BAYC #1626 is \u201cgone from [Ethereum] forever,\u201d as mentioned in the post\u2019s initial Tweet, because it still exists on-chain, even if people can no longer access it.\n\nIt's not \"gone from ETH forever.\" It's basically the same as any other transfer: If you transfer your ape to an address you no longer control (even if it's the 'burn' address), you have effectively given up your license.\n\nAnd no, before someone asks, that doesn't mean that anyone\u2026 https://t.co/E52b7ZjWbu \u2014 Garga.eth (Greg Solano) (@CryptoGarga) February 13, 2023\n\nA spokesperson from Yuga Labs confirmed to Decrypt the company believes the Inscription of BAYC #1626 is an illegitimate Ape.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"Only NFTs minted from Ethereum contract: 0xBC4CA0EdA7647A8aB7C2061c2E118A18a936f13D are legitimate BAYC NFTs,\" a Yuga spokesperson said, referencing the smart contract that yielded the collection's 10,000 Apes.\n\nWhether the new Ordinals function could supplant Ethereum\u2019s popularity for hosting digital art is doubtful, according to the CEO of Web3 development platform Hiro Alex Miller. Hiro builds tools for Stacks, a network built on top of Bitcoin that aims to bring smart contract functionality to the underlying network.\n\n\u201cAs much as I am very pro-Bitcoin and think there\u2019s going to be a massive ecosystem there, it's not going to replace Ethereum NFTs tomorrow, or probably at all,\u201d Hiro told Decrypt. \u201cI think it's gonna be interesting to see where this goes.\u201d\n\nMiller said the Teleburn function provides a solution for keeping track of a digital art\u2019s provenance\u2014the record of prior ownership\u2014across blockchains, adding that it\u2019s challenging to establish which digital collectible is the real one if it exists in circulation on multiple chains.\n\nThe Hiro CEO also compared how data is stored on Bitcoin using Ordinals versus Ethereum NFTs. While it\u2019s possible to store assets such as images on-chain using Ethereum, most NFTs point to an asset that is stored off-chain, whether that\u2019s also an image or another type of file. With Inscriptions, the data is stored directly and permanently on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain.\n\nRegardless of whether the Inscription of BAYC #1626 is an unofficial version of its Ethereum-based predecessor, Miller thinks the collectible will \u201ccarry a lot of value\u201d because of its first-of-a-kind nature.\n\n\u201cHe basically turned it into something that is now an ultra-rare [Ape],\u201d Miller said, referencing the categories by which NFTs are often ascribed value based on the rarity of their attributes. \u201cThe market is going to value it as its own unique piece of art.\u201d"

        "title": "Ethereum's $1.5K support weakens as ETH traders turn slightly bearish - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The price of Ether (ETH) declined 10.2% between Jan. 8 and Jan. 10, and has since been range trading near the $1,500 level. More importantly, on a broader time frame, Ether is down 52.5% in twelve months, which partially explains why derivatives metrics were somewhat neutral after Ether\u2019s failed attempt to break $1,700 on Feb. 8.\n\nCurrently, investors\u2019 biggest concerns are the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s lawsuits and enforcement actions against crypto firms, including Kraken\u2019s tanking its staking-as-a-service program and PayPal reportedly pausing its stablecoin project due to regulatory concerns.\n\nA crackdown by the SEC on crypto staking is expected to have unintended consequences for decentralized finance, according to Jacob Blish, the head of business development at Lido DAO. Blish joined a growing number of people in the crypto industry calling for transparency in crypto sector regulation.\n\nOn the bright side, Ethereum developers announced the pre-launch of the Shanghai upgrade on the Zhejiang testnet. According to a blog post on Feb. 10, the transition is required to enable withdrawals from validators\u2019 staking positions. The Zhejiang test network is the first of three testnets that simulate Shanghai, which is expected to go live in March, although a specific date has not been released.\n\nLet\u2019s look at Ether derivatives data to understand if the $1,700 price rejection has impacted crypto investors' sentiment.\n\nETH futures show slowing demand for leverage longs\n\nRetail traders usually avoid quarterly futures due to their price difference from spot markets. Professional traders prefer these instruments because they prevent the fluctuation of funding rates in a perpetual futures contract.\n\nThe three-month futures annualized premium should trade between 4% to 8% in healthy markets to cover costs and associated risks. However, when futures trade at a discount versus regular spot markets, it shows a lack of confidence from leverage buyers, which is a bearish indicator.\n\nEther 3-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe above chart shows that derivatives traders are more bearish because the Ether futures premium moved below the 4% threshold. Consequently, bears can celebrate that the indicator failed to display a modest premium even as ETH tested $1,700 on Feb. 8.\n\nThe absence of demand for leverage longs does not necessarily translate to an expectation of adverse price action. Hence, traders should analyze Ether\u2019s options markets to understand how whales and market makers are pricing the odds of future price movements.\n\nA key options risk metric flirted with the bearish sentiment\n\nThe 25% delta skew is a telling sign when market makers and arbitrage desks are overcharging for upside or downside protection.\n\nIn bear markets, options investors give higher odds for a price dump, causing the skew indicator to rise above 10%. On the other hand, bullish markets tend to drive the skew metric below -10%, meaning the bearish put options are in less demand.\n\nRelated: US lawmakers and experts debate SEC's role in crypto regulation\n\nEther 30-day options 25% delta skew: Source: Laevitas.ch\n\nThe delta skew flirted with the bearish 10% level on Feb. 14, signaling stress from professional traders. That is a stark contrast from late January when the 25% skew index hovered near 2% \u2014 indicating similar upside and downside risks.\n\nUltimately, both options and futures markets point to pro traders moving to a neutral-to-bearish sentiment, displaying moderate discomfort after the $1,700 price rejection.\n\nConsequently, the odds favor Ether bears because the hostile regulatory environment tends to amplify the adverse effects of FUD \u2014 whether or not it directly impacts the Ethereum network\u2019s adoption and use cases.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "The crypto market did not respond well to the SEC's attack on crypto exchange Kraken as Ethereum fell on Monday. Photo: Dado Ruvic/Reuters (Dado Ruvic / reuters)\n\nEthereum (ETH-USD) dropped 9% in value on Monday, after crypto-exchange Kraken agreed to end its crypto staking for US customers and pay $30m (\u00a324.9m) to settle a Security Exchange Commission (SEC) charge.\n\nThe crypto market did not respond well to the SEC's attack on Kraken, as the announcement brought an end to the climb of bitcoin (BTC-USD) and ethereum since the beginning of 2023.\n\nPaxos, which partners with Binance to issue the BUSD stablecoin (BUSD-USD), has also been told by a New York regulator to halt the minting of new coins, according to a Bloomberg report.\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap has digested the latest regulatory attacks on the industry by falling 1.6% in 24 hours to $1.05tn, according to Coingecko.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nEthereum dropped 9% in the past seven days to $1,483, while bitcoin fell 6.2% to $21,537.\n\nWatch: US Senator: 'Digital assets will be as big as the internet itself' | The Crypto Mile\n\nThe decent into the red began in earnest last Thursday when SEC chair Gary Gensler announced he would be charging Kraken with failing to register the offer and sale of its \"staking as a service\" program.\n\nKraken, which is the third largest crypto-exchange in the world after Binance and Coinbase (COIN), had been offering staking services for at least half a dozen crypto tokens, including ethereum. The exchange advertised annual returns of as high as 21% on some staked instruments.\n\nRead more: Crypto live prices\n\nGensler said: \"Today the SEC charged Kraken for the unregistered offer and sale of securities through its staking-as-a-service program. Whether it\u2019s through staking-as-a-service, lending, or other means, crypto intermediaries must provide the proper disclosures & safeguards required by our laws.\"\n\nGensler released a video to explain to the US public why the SEC is taking such a strict stance against platforms that offer staking services.\n\nToday @SECGov charged Kraken for the unregistered offer & sale of securities thru its staking-as-a-service program.\n\n\n\nWhether it\u2019s through staking-as-a-service, lending, or other means, crypto intermediaries must provide the proper disclosures & safeguards required by our laws. \u2014 Gary Gensler (@GaryGensler) February 9, 2023\n\nWhat is 'staking' and how does it relate to Ethereum?\n\nIn the case of ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency in the world, you need 32 ether to create your own staking node and receive \"staking rewards\" in the same currency. This is called Solo Staking.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, most people do not have 32 ethereum to create a node on their own. But, they can instead use a centralised cryptocurrency exchange that offer \"staking as a service\" options.\n\nIn this process they hand over their crypto tokens to the centralised crypto exchange where the tokens are then pooled together and used to help validate transactions on the blockchain. The exchange gets a percentage of the blockchain's staking reward, and so does the customer.\n\nRead more: What is the digital pound and when can you expect it?\n\nThe SEC wants crypto exchanges to register these financial instruments as securities before offering them to customers. This is because staking has risks that are not being articulated to the customer, the SEC said.\n\nOn Saturday Gensler told Andrew Sorkin of the New York Times: \"Investors need to know what Kraken, or any other exhange, is doing with these staked tokens, are they trading against the tokens, or borrowing against those tokens, are they using them for theur own purposes?\"\n\nReferring to November's implosion of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange, Gensler said: \"We have seen this in the crypto field before\".\n\nGensler has said on numerous occasions that the only digital asset that he believes is not a security is bitcoin, which he has conceded should be under the observation of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).\n\nIn his interview with Sorkin, Gensler added: \"What kraken was doing was asking the American public for their coins, and saying that they will give them a return of between 4% and 21%.\"\n\nGensler cited the Howey Test which is used in the US to discern the difference between investing in a security or a commodity, like copper or wheat.\n\nHe said: \"The problem with Kraken was that they were not disclosing to the investing public the risks that they were entering into.\n\nRead more: Crypto: Will UK banks adopt CBDCs and stablecoins?\n\n\"We have a basic bargain in the United States since the 1930s, you can take whatever risk you want, companies like Kraken can offer investment contracts and investment schemes, but they have to have full, fair and truthful disclosure.\n\n\"This puts the investors in a better position, that's are basic bargain. Kraken where not compliing with that basic law.\"\n\nHe said that the charge against Kraken \"should put everyone on notice who operates in the crypto marketplace\".\n\nHe added: \"When these exchanges take you tokens to put them in staking pools and if that exchange goes bankrupt, the customer stands in line at the bankruptcy court.\n\n\"There is a saying in crypto, not your keys not your coins. Those other platforms who offer staking should take note of this and seek to come into compliance and do the proper disclosures, and registration and the like.\"\n\nWhat is a security?\n\nIn the US, a security is a tradable financial asset, including debt and equity securities (common stocks), and derivatives like forwards, futures, options, and swaps.\n\nThe Howey Test in the US is a method of differentiating between a security and a commodity.\n\nIt is is used to determine if a transaction qualifies as an \"investment contract\" and is subject to disclosure and registration requirements under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\n\nIt applies to any contract, scheme, or transaction and determines if there is an \"investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others.\"\n\nThis is important for assessing blockchain and digital currency projects, as some cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs) may meet the test's definition of an \"investment contract.\"\n\nThe Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is the national authority regulating financial markets in the UK, and its definition of \"security\" in the Handbook includes equities, debentures, alternative debentures, government and public securities, warrants, certificates, units, pension schemes, investments, and anything on the Official List.\n\nWatch: Kraken ending its crypto staking services for US customers, former SEC attorney weighs in\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android."

His latest donation was on Feb. 12 for 50 ETH, or approximately $77,000, sent to Anka Relief, according to blockchain security firm PeckShield.\n\nAnka thanked the Ethereum co-founder for his largesse and said that crypto donations had been flowing since the first day.\n\n\u201cSince day 1 of the disaster, we witnessed donations piling in the wallets of a handful of major NGOs. Great that they have attracted and will be attracting more funds,\u201d said the organization.\n\nWe want to thank @VitalikButerin for donating 50 ETH ~$75k to Anka Relief, a crypto aid fund & community to support T\u00fcrkiye after the recent earthquakes. https://t.co/kGwXSGWL8J\n\n\n\nDive into the thread below to better understand our mission and ops\n\n\n\nhttps://t.co/92CkxevI5e \u2014 Anka Relief (@AnkaRelief) February 12, 2023\n\nAnka provided a list of crypto wallets than can be used for donations. The Web3 relief support organization has also spearheaded the Ukraine DAO project to raise crypto donations to support efforts in the besieged country.\n\nThe latest donation adds to another 99 ETH that Vitalik sent in support of earthquake victims. On Feb. 11 the vitalik.eth address sent around $150,000 worth of ETH to Ahbap, a nongovernmental and nonprofit organization dedicated to relief efforts in Turkey.\n\nAhbap has also provided several crypto addresses for various tokens it can accept as donations.\n\nTo date, it claims to have received $4.3 million in crypto donations, with stablecoins being the most popular tokens sent. According to Etherscan, the Ahbap wallet contains 409 ETH, worth $622,000 at the time of writing.\n\nOn Feb. 10, London\u2019s Financial Times reported that crypto donations had been pouring in from across the globe. More than $10 million in crypto had been sent by companies, with Binance alone donating $5 million in support of Turkish relief efforts.\n\nBinance also announced $100 in BNB (BNB) airdrops to those in the hardest-hit areas last week.\n\nRelated: The Web3 community responds to Turkish\u2013Syrian earthquake tragedy\n\nOn Feb. 7, just a day after the devastating quake, Cointelegraph reported how the Web3 community was coming together to arrange crypto donations for NGOs and support.\n\nIt is not the first time crypto has been used for earthquake relief donations. In 2015, Bitcoin donations were sent to relief organizations following a massive quake in Nepal."

Its most recent sale on OpenSea took place last November when it sold for 108 Ethereum\u2014that's nearly $432,000 at the time of the transaction, or around $169,000 at today's prices.\n\nNFTs are digital assets that are provably unique and signify the ownership of an item, often digital art. The ownership of BAYC #1626 is linked to a digital token that is recorded on the Ethereum network, where it could also be traded\u2014that is, up until recently.\n\nDigital tokens can be permanently removed from circulation through a process called burning, which involves sending an asset to a location where it cannot be retrieved. Jason Williams claimed to have burned BAYC #1626 over the weekend, preventing it from being sold ever again, at least on Ethereum\u2019s network.\n\n\u200b\u200b\u201cEssentially throwing a Lamborghini into a trash compactor\u2013It's kind of fun,\u201d Williams told Decrypt. \u201cWhether putting bloated JPEGs on Bitcoin\u2019s base chain is smart or not is a whole 'nother discussion, but I think it's going to be a lot of fun seeing how it plays out.\u201d\n\nWilliams believes his Ape now exists on Bitcoin. That\u2019s because the location to which BAYC #1626 was burned is linked to an Inscription made through Ordinals. Ordinals, created by Casey Rodarmor, is a project that allows content like videos and images to be assigned to individual satoshis\u2014the smallest unit that Bitcoin can be divided into\u2014where they permanently exist on Bitcoin\u2019s network as Inscriptions.\n\nEven though the number of Inscriptions on Bitcoin is approaching 100,000, there are few notable marketplaces for people to trade them, and a significant number of buyers and sellers are linked together currently through Ordinal\u2019s discord server.\n\nStory continues\n\nOrdinals Gain Momentum With 76,000 NFTs Minted to Bitcoin\n\nThe burn took place using a newly developed feature for Ordinals named Teleburn, which creates a unique location with each new Inscription to which digital assets can be burned. The feature allows users to assign an existing asset from another network to a Bitcoin Inscription while removing it from circulation, effectively transferring the token between chains in the eyes of those who created the new feature.\n\n\u201cThe idea is that you are one-way, permanently burning an asset on another chain and pointing it to the ordinal that lives on the Bitcoin chain,\u201d said Rob Hamilton, who collaborated with Rodarmor to create the new Ordinals feature.\n\nHamilton approached Rodarmor about developing the Teleburn function last Saturday at Bitcoin Park, a coworking space in Nashville, Tennessee that caters to the Bitcoin community. The two decided to work together after Hamilton pointed out that Williams wanted to burn his Ape, who had responded to one of Rodarmor\u2019s Tweets.\n\nHelp me. \u2014 Jason A. Williams (@GoingParabolic) February 11, 2023\n\n\u201cLet's go write some code right now,\u201d Rodarmor said, according to Hamilton, adding that the prospect of burning an Ape got Rodarmor \u201creally excited.\u201d\n\nRodarmar did not respond to requests for comment from Decrypt. However, the two can be seen developing Ordinal\u2019s Teleburn function in a recent Tweet, according to Hamilton.\n\nBurning BAYC #1626 wasn\u2019t the first time that Ordinal\u2019s Teleburn function was used. Rodarmor first tested the new feature out on an ENS domain he owned, rodarmor.eth. Then the pair oversaw Williams as he burned the ape.\n\nThe term Teleburn was coined by Rodarmor, as a combination of the words teleport and burn, said Hamilton. Rodarmor referenced the function\u2019s hasty development with Hamilton in a recent tweet.\n\nHamilton believes the Teleburn function will catch on as a way for people to bridge their digital collectibles, noting that Rodarmor plans to extend Ordinal\u2019s Teleburn support to assets on other chains aside from Ethereum, such as Tezos and Solana.\n\n\u201cThis has now set the standard of representing an asset across the chain,\u201c said Hamilton. \u201cIt's going to be the way to actually have skin in the game,\u201d pointing out that assets burned are permanently gone from circulation.\n\nA chimp off the old block?\n\nAs news of the Bored Ape burn spread on Twitter Monday, Yuga Labs co-founder Greg Solano weighed in on the matter, stating the Inscription linked to BAYC #1626 is an unlicensed reproduction of the original NFT because Williams no longer maintains its possession on Ethereum\u2019s network.\n\n\u201cIf you transfer your ape to an address you no longer control (even if it's the 'burn' address), you have effectively given up your license,\u201d he stated.\n\nSolano also pushed back against the notion that BAYC #1626 is \u201cgone from [Ethereum] forever,\u201d as mentioned in the post\u2019s initial Tweet, because it still exists on-chain, even if people can no longer access it.\n\nIt's not \"gone from ETH forever.\" It's basically the same as any other transfer: If you transfer your ape to an address you no longer control (even if it's the 'burn' address), you have effectively given up your license.\n\nAnd no, before someone asks, that doesn't mean that anyone\u2026 https://t.co/E52b7ZjWbu \u2014 Garga.eth (Greg Solano) (@CryptoGarga) February 13, 2023\n\nA spokesperson from Yuga Labs confirmed to Decrypt the company believes the Inscription of BAYC #1626 is an illegitimate Ape.\n\n\"Only NFTs minted from Ethereum contract: 0xBC4CA0EdA7647A8aB7C2061c2E118A18a936f13D are legitimate BAYC NFTs,\" a Yuga spokesperson said, referencing the smart contract that yielded the collection's 10,000 Apes.\n\nWhether the new Ordinals function could supplant Ethereum\u2019s popularity for hosting digital art is doubtful, according to the CEO of Web3 development platform Hiro Alex Miller. Hiro builds tools for Stacks, a network built on top of Bitcoin that aims to bring smart contract functionality to the underlying network.\n\n\u201cAs much as I am very pro-Bitcoin and think there\u2019s going to be a massive ecosystem there, it's not going to replace Ethereum NFTs tomorrow, or probably at all,\u201d Hiro told Decrypt. \u201cI think it's gonna be interesting to see where this goes.\u201d\n\nMiller said the Teleburn function provides a solution for keeping track of a digital art\u2019s provenance\u2014the record of prior ownership\u2014across blockchains, adding that it\u2019s challenging to establish which digital collectible is the real one if it exists in circulation on multiple chains.\n\nThe Hiro CEO also compared how data is stored on Bitcoin using Ordinals versus Ethereum NFTs. While it\u2019s possible to store assets such as images on-chain using Ethereum, most NFTs point to an asset that is stored off-chain, whether that\u2019s also an image or another type of file. With Inscriptions, the data is stored directly and permanently on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain.\n\nRegardless of whether the Inscription of BAYC #1626 is an unofficial version of its Ethereum-based predecessor, Miller thinks the collectible will \u201ccarry a lot of value\u201d because of its first-of-a-kind nature.\n\n\u201cHe basically turned it into something that is now an ultra-rare [Ape],\u201d Miller said, referencing the categories by which NFTs are often ascribed value based on the rarity of their attributes. \u201cThe market is going to value it as its own unique piece of art.\u201d"

        "title": "Can ETH pull off a strong bounce back as exchange balances reach 4-year lows? - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "ETH bears are losing momentum after a strong pullback in the last few days.\n\nETH exchange balances reach 4-year lows as outflows continue.\n\nEthereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency just concluded the week with a sizable bearish pullback. There is more directional uncertainty as a result, but multiple indicators and metrics may offer some much-needed clarity.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETH worth today?\n\nFor perspective, ETH\u2019s $1534 price tag represents a 9% pullback within the last five days.\n\nA couple of things to note about the price action- The pullback puts it within the 50% RSI level and the bears seem to have lost most of their momentum at this level. In addition, the outflows indicated by the MFI are leveling out.\n\nMore importantly, ETH\u2019s 50-day Moving average recently crossed above the 200-day MA from below, forming a golden cross. The latter is a bullish sign, hence this may yield bullish expectations among investors.\n\nDo ETH bulls have a chance to regain dominance?\n\nSome of ETH\u2019s on-chain metrics are leaning in favor of bullish expectations. The latest Glassnode alerts reveal that the cryptocurrency has been flowing out of exchanges. ETH\u2019s balance on exchanges tanked to a 4-year low of 18,946,696.667 ETH.\n\n? #Ethereum $ETH Balance on Exchanges just reached a 4-year low of 18,946,696.667 ETH Previous 4-year low of 18,948,275.315 ETH was observed on 11 February 2023 View metric:https://t.co/1dCpD2ey8E pic.twitter.com/45yugPfDec \u2014 glassnode alerts (@glassnodealerts) February 12, 2023\n\nMost of the ETH flowing out of exchanges is likely headed into DeFi. This may explain the total value of ETH locked in ETH 2.0 deposit contracts just soared to a new ATH.\n\nThis is important because it confirms that ETH holders are more confident in allowing their coins to stay in DeFi. A sign of a favorable shift towards longer-term expectations.\n\n? #Ethereum $ETH Total Value in the ETH 2.0 Deposit Contract just reached an ATH of 15,792,103 ETH View metric:https://t.co/SzbMPqvhlb pic.twitter.com/Ydzv8JmVY5 \u2014 glassnode alerts (@glassnodealerts) February 12, 2023\n\nAssessing the level of ETH demand in the market\n\nThe supply of ETH held by the top 1% of addresses registered a slight increase in the last few days.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of ETH addresses holding over 1,000 coins grew slightly in the last three days as opposed to the downside registered since the start of February.\n\nThis confirms that the bears are no longer in control and the taps causing sell pressure are running dry. But what about the demand situation on the derivatives side of things?\n\nWe did see a drop in open interest in the second half of last week but it is now pivoting in favor of the upside. In other words, open interest is returning as the price is showing bullish signs.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nThe funding rate still has a downward trajectory, likely indicating a lack of strong demand. The above metrics and indicators point toward a possible bullish outcome.\n\nHowever, this is subject to the lack of more FUD potentially triggering another unexpected selloff."

        "title": "Cryptocurrencies To Watch: Week of Feb. 13 - Investopedia",
        "content": "Keep an Eye on These Coins\n\nAfter hints that it was on the verge of breaking into a strong bullish season, the cryptocurrency market has fallen back again to reside in the red over the past week. Investors may be unhappy that the market has still failed to break resistance levels, but at least some tokens have been performing unusually well.\n\nThis week, we focus on Oasis Network (ROSE), Mina (MINA), Hedera (HBAR), Lido DAO (LDO), and Rocket Pool (RPL). In selecting these assets, we have considered several factors, including positive technical developments, significant news events, and noticeable changes in price.\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways Oasis Network\u2019s ROSE token was one of the biggest gainers this week, with a price increase of 35%, probably thanks to stronger open interest.\n\nThe MINA coin also made a sizable jump, of 32%, likely due to improvements in decentralization and security at the Mina network.\n\nHBAR's price went up 21% after Dell joined its governing council. The network\u2019s ecosystem also has been experiencing growth.\n\nThe LDO token's price increased by 16% amid rumors that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may ban staking services offered by centralized crypto platforms.\n\nThe Ethereum staking-focused RPL token also rose, by 15%, as the network\u2019s Shanghai upgrade in March gets closer.\n\n\n\nOasis Network (ROSE)\n\nOne of the biggest gainers of the week, the ROSE token of the Oasis Network, possibly benefited from multiple developments within its ecosystem and network. The primary reason for the price bump of about 35% might be the fact that the team on Feb. 2 released its roadmap for 2023, which described launches and improvements. There has also been a sharp increase in open interest, reaching nearly $30 million at Oasis.\n\nOasis Network is a scalability and privacy-focused network built using the Cosmos software development kit (SDK), which is a set of software tools and programs used by developers to create applications. The ROSE token is now priced at around 0.072 cent after beginning last week at 0.055 cent (see chart below).\n\n\n\nROSE (TradingView)\n\nMina (MINA)\n\nMina (MINA) was the next big gainer this week, with the token rising by about 32% to trade at around 93 cents. (see chart below). The price might have been boosted by the launch in late January of a proof of concept that would allow anyone to run a web node on a browser. A proof of concept is an exercise in which work is focused on determining whether an idea can be turned into reality. The effort may eventually allow anyone to run a lightweight node to help run blockchain applications across Web3 and mobile devices.\n\nThe effort is a part of Mina\u2019s overall ethos of increasing accessibility and being the \u201cworld\u2019s lightest blockchain.\u201d The network makes use of the novel zero-knowledge proofs technology to power its smart contracts.\n\n\n\nMINA (TradingView)\n\nHedera (HBAR)\n\nHeder\u2019s HBAR price increased by roughly 21% after it said that Dell Technologies (DELL) would join the Hedera Governing Council. Dell will run its own node, build its own application, and help automate distributed ledger technology.\n\nHedera\u2019s ecosystem has also posted growth in recent weeks, including the launch of a non-fungible token (NFT) series called Ashfall NFT. It also publicized the arrival of a metaverse fund valued at $1 million that focuses on Africa\u2019s creative industry. The HBAR coin is now valued at about 0.081 cent, after being priced at 0.069 cent last week (see chart below).\n\nHBAR (TradingView)\n\nLido DAO (LDO)\n\nThe price of Lido DAO (LDO) gained by about 16% as users flocked to non-custodial means of staking Ether. Lido is a liquid staking platform for Ethereum and similar assets.\n\nCoinbase (COIN) CEO Brian Armstrong recently tweeted that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission may consider banning staking for retail investors. In reaction to that, crypto users have flocked to self-custodial ETH staking services. LDO now stands at about $2.27. It was priced at about $2.04 last week (see chart below).\n\n\n\nLDO (TradingView)\n\nRocket Pool (RPL)\n\nRocket Pool (RPL) advanced about 15% in price as Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade in March approaches. The Shanghai upgrade for the Ethereum network is a hard fork that will let holders of ether (ETH), Ethereum's native token, unstake the assets for the first time, giving them greater access to their holdings. This week, the RPL token is valued at around $41.06 (see chart below).\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade will be a major milestone for the Rocket Pool network, which is a staking service for Ether that recently crossed $1 billion in total value locked in. Crypto users have increasingly locked funds into Ethereum and are eager to be able to unstake some of those assets."

        "content": "Starlight bridges knowledge and development gap for zero-knowledge applications (zkApps)\n\nDevelopers can now experiment and build privacy-enabled features for solidity smart contracts\n\nThe EY organization contributed to the public domain the functional beta version of zero-knowledge-proof (ZKP) compiler Starlight to enable secure, private business logic on the public Ethereum ecosystem. Starlight supports the needs of complex business agreements where business logic must be shared between parties at the network level but privacy from competitors also remains critical.\n\nPaul Brody, EY Global Blockchain Leader, says:\n\n\u201cStarlight\u2019s beta release is the next step in industrializing blockchain privacy technology. The goal is to help transform how enterprises do business by making B2B integration simple and standardized. With Starlight, developers can migrate complex, B2B business agreements from private portals and point-to-point systems like Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), on to the public Ethereum network all while retaining the privacy and security that enterprises require.\u201d\n\nEY teams first contributed Starlight to the public domain in 2021 as a prototype business logic complier to facilitate the creation of zkApps, or decentralized applications that use ZKP technology. This is not the first time EY teams have contributed to the advancement of ZKP technology. In 2019, EY teams contributed the blockchain privacy-based protocol Nightfall. Then earlier this year, EY teams updated the public domain source code of Nightfall to help enable the development of privacy-focused enterprise blockchain solutions. Nightfall and Starlight were both developed to address concerns around data sovereignty and privacy as enterprises learned how difficult it is to preserve commercial confidentiality on a shared network.1\n\nStarlight is also designed to bridge the knowledge and development gap for zkApps by making it easier for developers to bring and use privacy features in the construction of decentralized applications.\n\nDr. Duncan Westland, EY Global Head of Blockchain Research and Development, says:\n\n\u201czkApps have a steep learning curve, can take weeks or more to build, and require extensive experience with ZKP technology. Using Starlight, developers can easily mark-up standard solidity contracts with the elements and logic that need to be made private and compile them into zero knowledge applications that can be deployed on-chain.\u201d\n\nBrody concludes:\n\n\u201cWith the combination of Starlight and Nightfall, the goal is to make it possible for enterprises to handle both large scale asset, inventory and payment management and multi-party business logic all on the public Ethereum network. Enterprises are still in the early stages of maturing these systems, but the end-state goal is clear: any multi-party business agreement with both shared data and business rules should be manageable on the public Ethereum blockchain, and without the need for a centralized intermediary.\u201d\n\nThe source code for Starlight and supporting tools are in the public domain and are available on GitHub.*\n\n-ends-"

        "content": "\u201cWe want to be the naming system for every digital resource in the world.\u201d\n\nBiography:\n\nNick Johnson started his engineering career in 2001 in New Zealand. He later took a job at Google, where he worked for over seven years across two stints with the firm. In 2016, Johnson was poached for a role with Ethereum. He holds a BSc in computer science from the University of Canterbury.\n\nJohnson has made an impact in the Web3 domain as the founder and lead developer of Ethereum Name Service, which enables decentralized naming for wallets and addresses in the Web3 ecosystem. ENS has multiple other use cases, including simplifying user experience around cryptocurrency transactions as well as storing avatars and profile information. The 2021 airdrop of its native token, ENS, helped establish airdrops as a trend that many other projects have since used as a growth hack, albeit with mixed results.\n\nJohnson\u2019s 2022:\n\nToward the end of 2021, Johnson launched the ENS DAO, which rallied to a $1 billion market capitalization the very next day. ENS names were in high demand in 2022, with Paradigm.eth selling for 420 ETH. Ethereum Name Service also became popular with NFT collectors, with three- and four-digit ENS addresses hitting record-high sales on platforms like OpenSea. ENS NFT volumes in December stood at 116,000 ETH, with a market cap of 57 ETH and nearly 623,000 holders\n\nThe ENS DAO was one of the most active decentralized autonomous organizations in the Web3 world in 2022, with tokenholders voting on 23 governance proposals. The DAO also created \u201csmall grants,\u201d which gave grants to the top five projects (as voted on by ENS tokenholders) to work on their proposal.\n\nJohnson led the creation of Thorin, a React Javascript-based design system for ENS with an improved user experience, speed optimization, and mobile-friendliness. Thorin is still in alpha and offers standards for developers building user experiences on ENS. Furthermore, Johnson and ENS collaborated with Chainlink on its open-source Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) standard for cross-chain communication. CCIP aims to be the universal connection between blockchain networks and will help unlock isolated tokens.\n\nJohnson\u2019s 2023:\n\nAs of the start of 2023, over 2.5 million registered ENS domains are held by over half a million users. This year could turn out to be a decisive year for Johnson, his initiatives and ENS. As the crypto market hopes to recover from one of the worst bear markets, the Web3 ecosystem continues to build more tools to on-ramp users. Johnson and ENS will likely work on upgrading the Thorin design system, which they created to provide an unparalleled user experience. Considering that Thorin is also made available as a standard React library for anyone to use, there should be more work on ENS, and building these libraries should ensure that the open-source community reaps the benefits.\n\nJohnson will also work on scaling ENS with EIP-3668 and EIP-5559 this year. These standards provide a way by which off-chain lookups can be defined within smart contracts and should help achieve storage and transaction cost efficiencies on the Ethereum blockchain. Furthermore, with the ENS DAO starting to take shape, multiple community projects may be set in motion. With the Web3 market maturing, ENS and Johnson will have their hands full in 2023 to attract and retain users by creating better experiences."

        "title": "How to Bridge to Ethereum Layer 2s - Unchained - Unchained",
        "content": "Say goodbye to high gas fees and slow transactions. This step-by-step guide will show you how to bridge your assets and enjoy faster, cheaper, and more efficient transactions on the Ethereum network.\n\nEthereum suffers from a very good problem to have: it\u2019s popular.\n\nBut with so many people using it and many applications being built upon it, users pay the price, literally. High network congestion drives up transaction costs and makes it difficult for the network to scale.\n\nThat\u2019s where layer-2 blockchains come in.\n\nA layer\u20132 blockchain is a protocol built atop a layer-1 blockchain such as Ethereum. They borrow the L1\u2019s security attributes and help reduce congestion (and fees) by ferrying transactions off the mainnet in bulk. After executing the transactions, L2s submit a compressed version of their blocks back to the mainnet.\n\nThus, L2 scaling solutions offer the security of Ethereum with fees that shouldn\u2019t burn through your savings. They\u2019re ideal for most regular users, who are overpaying for security they don\u2019t practically need; L2s are less expensive and almost as secure as Ethereum. Here is how you can start using the L2 ecosystem.\n\nStep 1: Choose an L2 for You\n\nThe L2s operating on Ethereum today differ in how they commit to Ethereum. Users can make the most of L2s by understanding their benefits and associated tradeoffs:\n\nZK rollups: Zero-knowledge (ZK) rollups scale Ethereum by processing transactions off-chain and submitting a lightweight validity proof (calculated off-chain) on the Ethereum chain to finalize the transaction batch. Instead of a trash compactor, it\u2019s a transaction compactor that frees up space on the network. One benefit of ZK rollups is that transactions finalize almost instantly. But users pay the price for this (though fees are still lower than they\u2019d typically be on Ethereum). Two popular scaling solutions, StarkNet and Loopring , use ZK-STARKs and ZK-SNARKs, respectively. Polygon is also working on a ZK-based scaling solution called zkEVM .\n\nOptimistic rollups: Optimistic rollups work similarly to ZK rollups by batching transactions and executing them on the L2 instead of on Ethereum. However, to keep fees low, they assume transactions are valid unless someone proves otherwise. Other users can submit fraud proofs during a challenge period that lasts around a week. The downside is that transactions don\u2019t become final until the challenge period ends, so users must wait to move their funds directly from the rollup back to Ethereum. Arbitrum and Optimism are two popular optimistic rollups on Ethereum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to L2s, there\u2019s one other type of scaling solution worth knowing about:\n\nSidechains: Sidechains are not technically L2s because they do not inherit Ethereum\u2019s security. Instead, they operate with separate validators and consensus processes but connect to the Ethereum chain via a two-way bridge. While very scalable, their bespoke security setups may leave them vulnerable to centralization. Polygon PoS is a popular sidechain.\n\nSelecting a specific scaling design can be overwhelming. In addition to factors such as throughput and fees, users must also consider ease of use and their comfort level with security. Bridging across all L2s follows similar steps, but we have used Arbitrum One to illustrate the steps below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Set Up Your Ethereum Wallet\n\nBefore you can start using an L2, you must first set up your Ethereum wallet. MetaMask is the most popular online wallet for the Ethereum ecosystem, but you may also use others, such as WalletConnect. (The steps below will use MetaMask.)\n\nIf you haven\u2019t already, install MetaMask on your preferred device and create a wallet by setting a password and securely copying the seed phrase. You now have an Ethereum account!\n\nNext, head into your MetaMask settings and add your destination network.\n\nNote that when you add another L2 network, Metamask will do so under the same public address. Add sufficient ETH into your Ethereum wallet to cover the desired amount and gas, which is the unit of transaction fees on the Ethereum network. The gas cost rises as traffic on the Ethereum network increases, and is known to cost anywhere between a few dollars and a few hundred dollars. Because the gas is unaffected by the value of the tokens you transfer, we\u2019d advise transferring all the funds you expect to use on the L2 in one go. It\u2019s the difference between paying a transaction fee just once or a similarly sized fee every time you transfer.\n\nStep 3: Start Bridging\n\nYou have two general choices for bridging. You can use the official gateway (in this case, Arbitrum) or select a third-party bridge such as Multichain or Celer. (Third-party bridges sometimes offer competitive fees and broader network options.) Gas fluctuates frequently, so double-check gas charges before submitting the transaction to ensure you pay the expected amount. If gas gets too high, you can either wait for it to cool down or pay the premium. Once final, the transaction becomes immutable.\n\nAn Arbitrum transaction sample\n\nArbitrum vs. Ethereum fee comparison\n\nStep 4: Verify the Transaction on Etherscan\n\nEtherscan is a blockchain explorer. Since the genesis block, it has stored all publicly available information like gas, block time, and transaction hash for all Ethereum transactions. To make sure your transaction went to the L2, enter the address.\n\nEtherscan sample\n\nStep 5: Use the L2\n\nLayer\u20132 networks are brimming with activity these days. From DeFi to the metaverse, nearly every mainstream application on Ethereum is compatible with leading L2s such as Arbitrum and Optimism. Trade tokens on Uniswap, buy NFTs on OpenSea, or do whatever you would otherwise use Ethereum for \u2014 only with cheaper transactions.\n\nDapps on Arbitrum | Source: DefiLlama\n\nPro tip: If you like to try out new or experimental applications, keep in mind that they could be malicious or untested. Minimize the risk of losing your funds by spreading them across multiple addresses.\n\nYou can manage multiple addresses on MetaMask\n\nStep 6: Head Back to Ethereum\n\nMoving funds back to Ethereum is optional. Some users secure their L2 earnings by sending them to Ethereum, while others never return. If you do choose to bridge back to Ethereum, follow the same steps as before, this time with the L2 as the sender chain.\n\nConclusion\n\nLayer-2 scaling solutions can be nearly as secure as Ethereum at a fraction of the cost. Users can make the most of L2s by finding a rollup design that suits their needs.\n\nL2s are so crucial to the Ethereum ecosystem that an entire phase of the Ethereum improvement roadmap is dedicated to making them more efficient and economical. Dubbed \u201cthe Surge,\u201d this next phase will boost the utility of L2s by enabling transactions to become final in under a second."

        "content": "Ethereum-based investment fund platform, ICONOMI, has set a record by raising the 11th largest crowdsale in history through its Initial Coin Offering (ICO), which was completed last month.\n\nIn September, the Slovenian-based company announced that it had raised more than $8.9 million in operational capital and equity through an ICO, raising $3 million in the last three days. The first funds were presented at Ethereum\u2019s Devcon2 last month in Shanghai.\n\nHowever, this latest news from the company shows that it managed to raise $10,576,227 from nearly 4,000 investors worldwide. This makes it the 11th largest raise in crowdsale history for any category and takes third place as the largest FinTech crowdsale, behind The DAO and Ethereum. Investors can expect to receive their ICN tokens, which function as shares, on October 9.\n\nChanging the Face of Fund Management\n\nThrough the ICONOMI platform, users will have the option to develop their own managed baskets of digital currencies, which can then be invested in by other users around the world.\n\nIt is through this approach that ICONOMI is aiming to change what is currently in place by developing a disintermediated alternative to the multi-billion fund management industry.\n\nDuring the ICO five different currencies were accepted. There were three digital currencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Lisk, and two fiat currencies: U.S. dollars and Euros. In total, just over 6,900 Bitcoins were raised, under 200,000 Ethereum, under four million Lisk, more than $121,500, and less than \u20ac2.4 million were invested.\n\nPlans for the Future\n\nNow that the ICO has closed attention will turn toward how the money will be used in the future.\n\nThe company has announced that they will use the money to increase its development, which will include further hiring, investment in new office space, and the growth of two funds that were revealed during the ICO: ICONOMI.INDEX and ICONOMI.PERFORMANCE.\n\nJani Valijavec, co-founder of ICONOMI, said that the company has a tight timeline to follow as the company focuses on expanding the two funds.\n\nHe said:\n\nICONOMI.INDEX is already up, but we are in the process of transforming the first major index of cryptocurrencies into a formal fund that investors can buy into. To achieve this, the vital functions of the fund management platform must be further developed.\n\nICONOMI\u2019S Funds\n\nWhile ICONOMI.INDEX is a managed fund intended to seek high yields, ICONOMI.PERFORMANCE is focused on looking for the best investments.\n\nTim Mitja Zagar, co-founder of ICONOMI, said that the team behind the fund has extraordinary track records.\n\nHe said:\n\nWe are hard at work conducting thorough research and due diligence on cryptos and have already identified promising investment targets.\n\nThe company is planning on investing all excess ICO proceeds above 10,000 bitcoins into the ICONOMI.PERFORMANCE fund. Through this individual investors will receive weekly dividends from the fund\u2019s management fees.\n\nZagar concluded by saying that ICONOMI\u2019s ICO has attracted more investing interest in cryptocurrency.\n\nHe added:\n\nICONOMI\u2019s ICO has flung open the crowdfunding doors into perhaps the last remaining traditional realm of business: the financial sector. We expect more and more fintech startups to be capitalized by ICO instead of through guidance by banks, VCs and other money representing the old economy. With cryptoassets, we\u2019re reaching a tipping point that will revolutionize everything.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock."

        "title": "\u201cBlockchain is still an incredibly hot technology. We excised some cancers from the body and feel a lot better\u201d - CTech",
        "content": "The blockchain and cryptocurrency sectors have suffered their fair share of blows over the past year. Like every other tech sector, they paid a steep price for the dramatic shift in macroeconomic conditions. But in addition, they also dealt with both the financial and reputational damage caused by a series of extremely hyped collapses, headlined by the debacle at crypto exchange FTX, which is still unwinding in courts these days in bankruptcy hearings and the trial of former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nThe FTX saga came after nearly $2 trillion in value was wiped out from the crypto sector last year and a slump that eliminated key industry players such as Voyager Digital, Three Arrows Capital, and Israeli-founded Celsius Network.\n\nBlockchain and crypto have already been dismissed by many people as a tech fad of the past, but there are those that remain exuberantly positive about its outlook for the future. No one more than Joe Lubin, a co-founder of Ethereum, the decentralized open-source blockchain that dominates the smart contract sector, and the founder of ConsenSys, a Brooklyn-based blockchain technology company that develops decentralized software services and applications that operate on Ethereum.\n\n1 View gallery Joe Lubin. ( Zaza Weissgerber )\n\n\u201cThe internet followed the same trajectory as blockchain. Maybe it wasn't a hot technology in 2001/2002, but that doesn't mean there weren't a huge number of builders, just building out, enabling pieces in enabling layers,\u201d Lubin told CTech last week during his visit to Israel for ETHTLV 2023, a series of events in Tel Aviv aimed at builders in the Ethereum and crypto space. \u201cI think blockchain is an incredibly hot technology. Anybody in the industry thinks the same. I think that we excised some cancers from the body and I think we all feel a lot better about ourselves and a lot lighter. It may not be a hot technology for certain speculators right now, but go to an NFT conference and tell those people that it's not a hot technology.\u201d\n\nA few years ago, when ConsenSys was ConsenSys AG, a software-production studio, it invested in Israeli companies such as StarkWare. In February 2020, ConsenSys AG rebranded to Mesh and announced its plans to spin out ConsenSys Software Inc (now known as ConsenSys). ConsenSys works to build infrastructure, products, and services for the Ethereum ecosystem and other Web3 decentralized technologies. Their two flagship products are MetaMask, a self-custody web3 wallet and Infura, a developer platform. Mesh manages investments, incubated projects, R&D and accelerator activities. The investment in StarkWare has certainly paid off for Mesh to date, with the company that develops scalability and privacy solutions for blockchain technology raising $100 million at a valuation of $8 billion in a Series D round in May 2022.\n\n\u201cI'm not sure I need to point out that Israel is the Startup Nation and is extremely strong technologically,\u201d noted Lubin. \u201cIsrael is a hotbed of cryptographers and so is our ecosystem. The future of our ecosystem is essentially about zero knowledge and other cryptographic techniques.\u201d\n\nLast March, ConsenSys announced that its valuation had more than doubled to over $7 billion after raising $450 million in a funding round that included investments from SoftBank Vision Fund 2 and Microsoft. However, macroeconomic changes still resulted in it announcing plans to cut 11% of its workforce, or 96 jobs, last month. Lubin nevertheless remains optimistic.\n\n\u201cIt's been pretty consistent for us most of the way through. There's certainly ups and downs in terms of the volume of interest in transactions, but the company is operating incredibly well,\u201d he said. \u201cWe've been astonished to read lots of things about our ecosystem, but they're related to things that we've been complaining about for a long time. It has really been mainly about macroeconomic and geopolitical factors. There has been a slowing in our ecosystem and we were affected by that. There was a further slowing in our ecosystem caused by a whole bunch of Centralized Finance (CeFi) companies which I now look back on as a self-limiting process. Basically, they did the same thing that so many companies in traditional finance have done in the past. There are some really corrupt projects and there are some bad projects, and then there's some good actors in CeFi. I'm happy to tolerate those as I think they're a valuable onboarding step, a valuable bridge between the legacy economy and our economy. But essentially it's the same old stuff but applied to a new vulnerable space.\u201d\n\nLubin insists that last year\u2019s crash and the fall of FTX will ultimately prove to be a positive for the industry. \u201cWe have the privilege, and the joy, and the difficulty in trying to build a new web and a new decentralized global economy on live monetary rails which has never been done before. That's hard and that makes things vulnerable. And what ended up happening was in my opinion actually really great for our ecosystem,\u201d he said. \u201cSam [Bankman-Fried] and leaders of some other companies did things that weren't intentional, but ultimately ended up having a positive effect on pointing out in very stark contrast the difference between CeFi mechanisms and DeFi mechanisms.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nLubin believes that the untangling of the FTX mess, which is being done on an open database, can be presented to regulators and politicians as an example of the sector\u2019s mechanisms of transparency and decentralization. \u201cIt's incumbent on us to help leaders of government and regulators and corporations to understand the benefits of our technology, and the weaknesses of that technology. I think it's going to be great going forward.\u201d\n\nAs far as the reputational hit suffered by a sector that for many people was already mainly associated with scams, Lubin has little concern. \u201cThere's always been a trust gap because it's such a complicated technology. So I'm not really worried about where we are. I think we're in a great position. We see waves of innovation and the waves of innovation bring in software developers and they bring in speculators and they bring in new kinds of consumers, like those who are interested in NFTs. The software developers, the builders, stay in our ecosystem. The speculators go crazy. There's a blow-off top. They run away for a little while, and that's fine. They'll be back because they're speculators. We just keep building and each new wave of innovation is bigger than the last one.\u201d\n\nMaking parallels between the rise and adoption of the internet compared to blockchain and crypto is not as popular as it once used to be, but Lubin believes it remains as relevant as ever."

        "content": "Monad Labs, the team supporting the Monad blockchain, has raised $19 million in seed funding led by Dragonfly Capital, it exclusively told TechCrunch.\n\n\u201cMonad is an effort to fundamentally optimize smart contract platforms,\u201d Keone Hon, co-founder and CEO of Monad Labs, said to TechCrunch. \u201cWe\u2019re ultimately building a platform to optimize both consensus and execution [\u2026] which ultimately results in a system that can process a billion transactions per day and 10,000 transactions per second.\u201d\n\nThe Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible layer-1 smart contract platform was co-founded by Hon, Eunice Giarta and James Hunsaker in 2022 to expand throughput on the Ethereum blockchain. The team brings more than seven years of experience in building low-latency, high-frequency trading (HFT) systems at Jump Trading.\n\n\u201cFundamentally, we\u2019re building a platform, so our main clients expand across the board. In some ways you can think of us as pseudonymous with iOS and what the iPhone can provide,\u201d Giarta said. \u201cWe\u2019re allowing devs to build applications like the App Store.\u201d\n\nWhile the platform is not publicly available, it will enter a testnet phase in the coming months with a mainnet launch later this year, it said.\n\nThe round included 70 participants, including Placeholder Capital, Lemniscap, Shima Capital and Finality Capital, as well as angel investors like AngelList co-founder Naval Ravikant. \u201cWe found that building a really broad coalition of supporters has helped us a lot in our journey,\u201d Hon said.\n\nThe capital will be used to double the team to about 24 in the next several months, Giarta said.\n\n\u201cUltimately the problem of limited throughput and high fees are acute challenges in the Ethereum ecosystem,\u201d Hon said. \u201cWe found a number of leaders in the space who want to tackle the problem head-on with fundamental improvements to the overall system in order to build the most optimized system possible.\u201d\n\nIn general and in the crypto space, people assume Ethereum can\u2019t be performant, Hunsaker noted. But Monad aims to focus on performance and fix that problem, he added.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have better performance, you can\u2019t scale to everyday users,\u201d Hunsaker said. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking forward. Apps on blockchains so far have been simple, so to build more complex apps and add natural value they\u2019re going to have to be more complex. We have features planned to expand what blockchain can do, but our primary focus right now is performance because without that, you don\u2019t have anything that\u2019s usable on a wide scale.\u201d\n\nOther blockchains that advertise high performance have \u201cabandoned the Ethereum space and existing chains that are EVM compatible didn\u2019t innovate, but mainly just used what was available to build out their blockchain,\u201d Hunsaker added. \u201cSo we\u2019re re-building the EVM for high performance and trying to stay within the Ethereum ecosystem because we think that\u2019s where most of the innovation has happened and will continue to happen.\u201d\n\nEven though the current market for crypto, and tech in general, has been \u201cchallenging,\u201d the team is focused on improving the Ethereum space, Hon shared. \u201cUltimately we want to grow a vibrant ecosystem of app developers and users. From our perspective, the future is bright.\u201d"

        "content": "Upstart NFT marketplace Blur, the largest rival to market leader OpenSea in recent months, is set to begin its delayed airdrop of BLUR tokens today to reward Ethereum NFT traders.\n\nBlur launched its marketplace last October with the promise of token rewards for traders, and has granted users \u201ccare packages\u201d that represent coming token allotments. Users can finally open up their care packages today and claim the Ethereum-based tokens, with an estimated start around 1:30pm ET following a late morning delay.\n\nThe marketplace has awarded the token allotments in three waves to date. The first wave was offered up to eligible Ethereum NFT traders who used a competing marketplace in the six months prior to Blur\u2019s own launch. The second wave was for Blur users who listed their NFTs for sale on the marketplace through November, while the final wave is for traders who bid on NFTs through Blur.\n\nIT'S TIME FOR $BLUR Care Packages can be opened on Feb 14 at 12PM EST, 1AM HKG, 6PM CET. Make sure the launch announcement comes from our official @BLUR_io account tomorrow and double check all URLs before claiming. pic.twitter.com/tSbOPLqYTW \u2014 Blur (@blur_io) February 13, 2023\n\nBlur initially planned to drop the governance token to eligible users in January, but then delayed the airdrop to today. \u201cWe\u2019re trying new things,\u201d the marketplace tweeted on January 19, \u201cand the extra two weeks will allow us to deliver a launch that hasn\u2019t been done before.\u201d\n\nBilling itself the \u201cmarketplace for pro traders,\u201d Blur raised $11 million in a seed round led by Paradigm and announced in March 2022. Like LooksRare and other marketplaces that have emerged following the rise of the NFT market, Blur is trying to build up an audience by offering potentially valuable token rewards to traders.\n\nStory continues\n\nNFT Sales Jump 38% in January as Bored Apes Drive Trading Surge\n\nAnticipation for the pending token drop has apparently fueled Blur\u2019s rise over the last few months, with the marketplace sometimes topping OpenSea in terms of NFT trading volume.\n\nHowever, the hype around token rewards has also prompted suspicion over how much \u201cwash trading\u201d is taking place on the platform as users potentially manipulate trades to boost rewards. That\u2019s what happened with LooksRare in early 2022, as users traded NFTs back and forth between their own wallets at artificially inflated prices to manipulate the rewards model.\n\nBlur hasn\u2019t yielded billions of dollars\u2019 worth of suspicious-looking trades, however, unlike LooksRare did last year. But data shows that Blur has far fewer active traders and transactions than OpenSea over the past week, despite posting more overall trading volume.\n\nData from analytics platform Dune suggests that about 13% of Blur trades are classified as suspected wash trading, compared to about 2% for OpenSea.\n\nWe\u2019ll see whether Blur\u2019s surging momentum in recent months continues after users stop trading with airdrop incentives in mind. Notable crypto exchanges like Coinbase and Huobi have already announced plans to support the BLUR token once it starts trading today.\n\nEditor's note: This article was updated after publication to reflect the changed airdrop timing."

Around $321 million of Wrapped ETH (wETH) was stolen.\n\nAccording to blockchain security firm PeckShield, the hacker\u2019s associated wallet has become active once again, moving $46 million worth of crypto assets.\n\nThis was made up of around 24,400 Lido Finance-wrapped Ethereum staking token (wstETH), worth approximately $41.4 million, and 3,000 Rocket Pool Ethereum staking token (rETH), worth about $5 million, which was moved to MakerDAO.\n\nThe hacker appears to be seeking yield or arbitrage opportunities on their stolen loot as the assets were exchanged for 16.6 million DAI, PeckShield reported.\n\nThe MakerDAO stablecoin was then used to buy 9,750 ETH priced at around $1,537 and 1,000 stETH. These were then wrapped back into 9,700 wstETH.\n\nOn Feb. 10, an on-chain sleuth observed that the hacker was \u201cbuying the dip.\u201d\n\nHowever, the price of Ether (ETH) has since fallen below those levels over the past few hours. At the time of writing, ETH was down 2.6% on the day at $1,505, according to CoinGecko.\n\nAt the time of the transfers, stETH prices depegged from Ethereum and climbed as high as $1,570. At time of writing, they were trading 2.4% higher than ETH at $1,541. Furthermore, wstETH also had depegged and risen to $1,676, 11.3% higher than the underlying asset.\n\nRelated: Crypto exploit losses in January see nearly 93% year-on-year decline\n\nThe latest funds movement comes only a few weeks after the hacker moved another $155 million worth of Ethereum to a decentralized exchange.\n\nOn Jan. 24, 95,630 ETH was sent to the OpenOcean DEX and then subsequently converted into ETH-pegged assets, including Lido\u2019s stETH and wstETH."

This Ethereum-based mixer was banned by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).\n\nButerin has also donated to various medical causes. For example, the Ethereum co-founder donated $9.4 million in USDC to the University of Maryland last year to fund a research initiative that could prevent future pandemics.\n\nOne of the more memorable of Buterin\u2019s donations is the $100 million in USDC he donated to CryptoRelief, India\u2019s COVID-19 relief fund. Buterin got the $100 million after someone sent him one billion Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens.\n\nButerin later received the $100 million donation back from CryptoRelief because it would be faster and more efficient for him to deploy the funds elsewhere in the biotechnology and medical space."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nUpstart NFT marketplace Blur, the largest rival to market leader OpenSea in recent months, is set to begin its delayed airdrop of BLUR tokens today to reward Ethereum NFT traders.\n\nBlur launched its marketplace last October with the promise of token rewards for traders, and has granted users \u201ccare packages\u201d that represent coming token allotments. Users can finally open up their care packages today and claim the Ethereum-based tokens, with an estimated start around 1:30pm ET following a late morning delay.\n\nThe marketplace has awarded the token allotments in three waves to date. The first wave was offered up to eligible Ethereum NFT traders who used a competing marketplace in the six months prior to Blur\u2019s own launch. The second wave was for Blur users who listed their NFTs for sale on the marketplace through November, while the final wave is for traders who bid on NFTs through Blur.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIT'S TIME FOR $BLUR Care Packages can be opened on Feb 14 at 12PM EST, 1AM HKG, 6PM CET. Make sure the launch announcement comes from our official @BLUR_io account tomorrow and double check all URLs before claiming. pic.twitter.com/tSbOPLqYTW \u2014 Blur (@blur_io) February 13, 2023\n\nBlur initially planned to drop the governance token to eligible users in January, but then delayed the airdrop to today. \u201cWe\u2019re trying new things,\u201d the marketplace tweeted on January 19, \u201cand the extra two weeks will allow us to deliver a launch that hasn\u2019t been done before.\u201d\n\nBilling itself the \u201cmarketplace for pro traders,\u201d Blur raised $11 million in a seed round led by Paradigm and announced in March 2022. Like LooksRare and other marketplaces that have emerged following the rise of the NFT market, Blur is trying to build up an audience by offering potentially valuable token rewards to traders.\n\nAnticipation for the pending token drop has apparently fueled Blur\u2019s rise over the last few months, with the marketplace sometimes topping OpenSea in terms of NFT trading volume.\n\nHowever, the hype around token rewards has also prompted suspicion over how much \u201cwash trading\u201d is taking place on the platform as users potentially manipulate trades to boost rewards. That\u2019s what happened with LooksRare in early 2022, as users traded NFTs back and forth between their own wallets at artificially inflated prices to manipulate the rewards model.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBlur hasn\u2019t yielded billions of dollars\u2019 worth of suspicious-looking trades, however, unlike LooksRare did last year. But data shows that Blur has far fewer active traders and transactions than OpenSea over the past week, despite posting more overall trading volume.\n\nData from analytics platform Dune suggests that about 13% of Blur trades are classified as suspected wash trading, compared to about 2% for OpenSea.\n\nWe\u2019ll see whether Blur\u2019s surging momentum in recent months continues after users stop trading with airdrop incentives in mind. Notable crypto exchanges like Coinbase and Huobi have already announced plans to support the BLUR token once it starts trading today.\n\nEditor's note: This article was updated after publication to reflect the changed airdrop timing."

        "content": "Ordinals, an NFT-like project on the Bitcoin blockchain, has gained momentum over the past month, signaling a chance that a new frontier may be on the horizon for the biggest cryptocurrency. But in order to be the biggest, experts say its accessibility and security need to be improved.\n\nOver 90,000 Ordinals have been inscribed \u2014 which is jargon for created (or minted) \u2014 on the Bitcoin blockchain to date, according to Dune Analytics data. Ordinals hit an all-time high on February 9 for the number of mints at over 20,000 that day.\n\n\u201cIt seems foolish to say this won\u2019t be a very impactful revelation,\u201d Nick Hansen, CEO and co-founder of Luxor, told TechCrunch. \u201cI can\u2019t predict the future, but given current trends and hockey stick growth, we\u2019re definitely headed to more Bitcoin NFT inscriptions now than fewer.\u201d\n\nThe Ordinals project isn\u2019t the first to try bringing NFTs onto the Bitcoin blockchain. Counterparty was the first platform to inscribe NFTs on Bitcoin\u2019s network with the Rare Pepe collection in 2014. Although Rare Pepe didn\u2019t do much to boost mass demand, one of its NFTs from 2016 sold for $3.6 million at a Sotheby\u2019s auction about a year ago.\n\nOrdinals stands out as a project for directly inscribing onto satoshis, the smallest denomination of bitcoin (equivalent to 100 millionth of a bitcoin), without needing another chain or token. \u201cThe unique thing about Ordinals is its putting the image literally in the blockchain,\u201d Muneeb Ali, co-founder of Stacks and CEO of Trust Machines, said. \u201cOther NFTs usually link to the images on-chain.\u201d\n\nEven though Ordinals and Bitcoin NFTs in general are exploding, it\u2019s still in very early stages, especially when compared to behemoths like Ethereum and Solana.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very clunky because it\u2019s day one,\u201d said Alex Adelman, the co-founder and CEO of Bitcoin rewards platform Lolli. \u201cIt\u2019s like the Wild West, but that\u2019s how NFTs felt back in the day, as well with Ethereum.\u201d\n\nEthereum and Solana now have a huge leg up when it comes to infrastructure, communities, and trading platforms and collections. In the past 30 days, Ethereum, the No. 1 blockchain by NFT sales volume, saw volumes increase 35.5% to $860 million across over 178,000 buyers, according to CryptoSlam data. Solana, the second-largest blockchain by NFT sales volume, fell 15.6% to $114.6 million across over 80,000 buyers during the same time period.\n\n\u201cEthereum has proven there\u2019s a market for this already and is essentially stealing market share based on demand,\u201d Adelman said.\n\nSo, inherently Bitcoin NFTs will compete with other major NFT ecosystems, Hansen said. \u201cI think we\u2019ll most likely see a lot of Ethereum NFT projects building bridges to move to Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nWhen people build on Bitcoin, it gets a lot more attention, Ali said. \u201cSome people think it\u2019s more valuable than other chains because it\u2019s unclear if those other chains will be around, but bitcoin will likely be around in 10, 20 or 50 years from now.\u201d\n\nBut this expansion won\u2019t happen overnight, and the current infrastructure for Bitcoin NFTs is extremely clunky and still done manually on many fronts. For example, many people are legitimately completing inscriptions manually rather than through a service like an NFT marketplace.\n\n\u201cBuys are happening through Discords and Google Sheets,\u201d Adelman said. \u201cMarketplaces are very much needed; we can\u2019t be buying and selling on Google Sheets for much longer because there\u2019s going to be hacks, people will get pissed off and it won\u2019t be sustainable.\u201d\n\nLast week Gamma, a marketplace for Bitcoin NFTs, launched its Ordinals feature to help people who have a Bitcoin address inscribe their own NFTs. \u201cWe had over 2,000 people submitting inscriptions in the first two hours,\u201d Jamil Dhanani, founder and CEO of Gamma, told TechCrunch. \u201cThis is an indication something is here and we\u2019re not sure it\u2019s going to be the same as Ethereum NFTs, but the value of inscribing data resonates with people.\u201d\n\nAccessibility is the \u201cnorth star for all of this right now,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cHow do we get a wallet and see our JPEGs? Right now there\u2019s no way to get around it, all of it is really difficult, and custodying it has been hard. The bar is incredibly high right now.\u201d\n\nAdelman agreed, noting \u201cit\u2019s not accessible at all.\u201d But in 2017, there weren\u2019t very many experiences that were accessible in the Ethereum ecosystem, either, he said.\n\n\u201cThere will be services to improve all of this and the access,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cAs the products and services come to market, it will become more and more prevalent the amount of inscriptions being minted, inscribed and transacted.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithin a year, we\u2019ll have full ecosystems of plug-and-play NFT projects like on Ethereum would be my guess,\u201d he added\n\nAnd more capital and developers will surely enter the space. \u201cMy inbox is overflowing with developers on Ethereum and Solana who don\u2019t know how to build on Bitcoin. The developer community in Bitcoin is getting real demand now, and people are throwing money at it,\u201d Ali said. \u201cThat\u2019s exciting and a healthy thing [ \u2026 ] people realize bitcoin carries a premium, but a ton of work needs to be done.\u201d\n\nOver time, there will be \u201cmuch more use of bitcoin and a much more robust market,\u201d Dhanani said.\n\n\u201cIf Bitcoin wants to stay the most decentralized, widespread and prolific cryptocurrency, it needs something like [Bitcoin NFTs] to push it forward,\u201d Adelman said."

        "title": "Infura is to blame for MetaMask's violation of the crypto spirit - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Censorship resistance is the foundation of crypto, so for many cryptocurrency purists, the Nov. 23 announcement by ConsenSys, the New York-based company behind the leading Ethereum browser wallet, informing its 20 million MetaMask users that their IP and wallet addresses would be collected was simply a gross violation of the crypto spirit.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, ConsenSys first reacted by saying the data collected would only be retained for seven days and then that it had updated the MetaMask features to allow users to opt out of Infura. However, the question remains: Have they done enough to establish crypto resistance?\n\nWhile many may be OK with MetaMask tracking users\u2019 wallets and IP addresses, many more of us are not because blockchain is supposed to be about decentralization and giving people the power to control their data and their finances without intermediaries \u2014 such as banks and governments.\n\nRelated: Are we still mad at MetaMask and ConsenSys for snooping on us?\n\nFor the sake of a healthy debate, let\u2019s say we are fine with MetaMask tracking users\u2019 wallets and IP addresses in certain acceptable instances. Those reasons could be in the case of a malicious attack. The information gathered by the Infura protocol could help track down the criminals involved.\n\nPerhaps, more importantly for ConsenSys, the \u201cspying\u201d could have more to do with official regulations, such as Know Your Customer laws, Anti-Money Laundering laws and financing terrorism.\n\nHowever, the reasoning behind the decision to \u201cspy\u201d or end MetaMask user privacy features is highly concerning \u2014 and even a bit frightening \u2014 because it clearly contravenes the crypto spirit.\n\nControl and ownership back to users\n\nThe crypto spirit centers on putting people back in control of their assets so they can do what they with them and when they wish and have ownership over their data so they can participate in the decentralized economy, such as the machine economy, by monetizing their information.\n\nInfura is mainly to blame for violating the crypto spirit by tracking users\u2019 IP and Ether (ETH) wallet addresses while advising MetaMask\u2019s users to spin up a whole new Ethereum node or to use a different node provider if they are so concerned over lnfura\u2019s intrusions.\n\nSo MetaMask says \"Just don't use Infura\" - so let's see how easy MetaMask makes it to \"not use Infura\".\n\n\n\nPart 1 - Installation:\n\n\n\nThe first two screens are straight forward here. They seem to provide a clear privacy policy, that's good. pic.twitter.com/9HqLo4h18U \u2014 Chase Wright (mysticryuujin.eth ) (@mysticryuujin) November 25, 2022\n\nSuppose Infura (or any other API provider) holds users\u2019 IP and ETH addresses. In that case, it can quickly locate the user\u2019s home and tie it back to all the ETH assets and on-chain transactions users have made. That is quite scary.\n\nContradictory intrusions\n\nThat raised a fascinating debate among the crypto community. While the Ethereum blockchain provides censorship resistance, API providers such as Infura, which provide access to the Ethereum blockchain, are not obligated contradictorily to be censorship resistant.\n\nThat represents a considerable risk for users of MetaMask or, for that fact, any other wallet, such as these Ethereum API nodes, because it makes them vulnerable to censorship without any prior notification or warning.\n\nRelated: Coinbase is fighting back as the SEC closes in on Tornado Cash\n\nAnd then came Alchemy and MyEtherWallet, which tried to \u201ccash in on MetaMask users\u2019 concerns,\u201d only to surface as two crypto wallet solutions that also track user data.\n\nIt is true that anyone can send Bitcoin (BTC) to anyone \u2014 even if the police or government doesn\u2019t approve. However, if BTC were not censorship-resistant, those authorities could seize or block that Bitcoin. Crypto was created with censorship resistance in mind because we need and cherish our right to privacy.\n\nIt is also ironic. Blockchain developers have racked their brains to design the chain to be censorship resistant. However, the API node provider \u201chijacks\u201d the original intention and silently changes it, and all the while, the potential victims \u2014 users \u2014 are not informed of the modifications.\n\nIn light of Infura\u2019s violations of the \u201ccrypto spirit,\u201d here are two considerations.\n\nCrypto enthusiasts should continue monitoring API providers and notifying communities when they behave unethically\n\nMonitoring from the public is required, as done by the two whistleblowers via their Twitter accounts.\n\nMetaMask and other wallets must inform users immediately and clarify the terms of their privacy. For example, they should tell users they are using Infura, which does not ensure their privacy 100%. That, arguably, was not done properly or in a sufficiently overt manner in November.\n\nBuilders of decentralized applications (DApps) should be responsible for notifying people that an API node in use is not secure or censorship-resistant to raise awareness.\n\nWhat type of technology can address this concern soundly?\n\nAPI node-as-a-service makes it simple for non-tech users to spin up API nodes for their wallets. That should be as easy for both users and developers alike as purchasing a VPN service.\n\nIn math we trust. Technology always fights for freedom on behalf of people. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently posted an \u201cIncomplete Guide to Stealth Addresses,\u201d which does not require new technology. However, if implemented on Ethereum, they partially address the privacy violation concerns raised by Infura. People can still locate a user\u2019s house using Infura, but not their on-chain transactions or assets.\n\nRaullen Chai is the co-founder and CEO of IoTeX. He previously worked for companies including Google, Uber and Oracle. He holds a Ph.D. from the University of Waterloo, where his research focused on designing and analyzing lightweight ciphers and authentication protocols for the Internet of Things.

        "content": "At least two significant donations from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin have been made to aid those harmed by last week's deadly earthquakes in Turkey and Syria.\n\nIn the early morning of 6 February, an earthquake of 7.8 magnitude was recorded due to which the deathtoll surpassed the 33,000 figure mark, and thus motivated crypto industry to offer help.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHow much has the Ethereum founder donated?\n\nOn 11 February, the vitalik.eth address sent around $150,000 worth of ETH to Ahbap, a non-governmental and non-profit organisation dedicated to relief efforts in Turkey.\n\nOn 12 February, Buterin made his most recent donation of 50 ETH, or roughly $77,000 to Anka relief. According to blockchain security firm PeckShield, the donations were directed to Anka Relief, a Web3 relief support group that also organised the Ukraine DAO project. The latest donation adds to another 99 ETH that Vitalik sent in support of earthquake victims.\n\nWhile highlighting the current support by Buterin, Anka praised the efforts of the Ethereum co-founder for his generosity and said \u201cSince day one of the disaster, we have witnessed donations piling in the wallets of a handful of major NGOs. Great that they have attracted and will be attracting more funds.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of continuous help from the crypto industry, a report from Etherscan, a blockchain explorer for the Ethereum network, suggests that the Ahbap wallet contains 409 ETH worth $622,000. It further claimed to have received $4.3 million in crypto donations, with stablecoins topping the chart.\n\nCrypto industry offering help\n\nThe Financial Times of London reported late last week that donations in cryptocurrency have been flooding in from all across the world. Companies had sent more than $10 million in cryptocurrency, with Binance alone offering $5 million to help the nation.\n\nPrior to this, cryptocurrencies have also been used for earthquake relief donations and to help with war efforts in Ukraine. The devastating earthquake in Nepal in 2015 marked the maximum support in the form of donations in Bitcoin to relief organisations."

        "content": "$46 million of stolen Wormhole funds has just been transferred from the hacker\u2019s wallet.\n\nWormhole\u2019s token bridge was exploited in February 2022.\n\nThe stolen crypto from one of the industry\u2019s largest exploits is on the move once more, with on-chain data revealing that another $46 million in stolen funds has just been transferred from the hacker\u2019s wallet.\n\nWormhole\u2019s token bridge was exploited in February 2022, resulting in the third-largest crypto hack last year. Wrapped ETH (wETH) worth approximately $321 million was stolen in the attack.\n\nAccording to blockchain security firm PeckShield, the hacker\u2019s associated wallet has again gotten active, transferring $46 million in cryptocurrency.\n\nThis consisted of approximately 24,400 Lido Finance-wrapped Ethereum staking token (wstETH) worth around $41.4 million and 3,000 Rocket Pool Ethereum staking token (rETH) worth around $5 million that was transferred to MakerDAO.\n\nThe analysis\n\nAccording to PeckShield, the hacker appears to be looking for yield or arbitrage opportunities on their stolen loot, as the assets were exchanged for 16.6 million DAI.\n\nThe MakerDAO stablecoin was then used to purchase 9,750 ETH and 1,000 stETH, then wrapped into 9,700 wstETH.\n\nLast week, an on-chain sleuth noticed the hacker \u201cbuying the dip.\u201d Over the last few hours, the price of Ethereum has, however, fallen below those levels. According to CoinMarketCap, the Ethereum token was trading down 2.6% on the day at $1,505 at the time of writing.\n\nstETH prices depegged from Ethereum and climbed as high as $1,570 at the time of the transfers. At $1,541, they are currently trading 2.4% higher than ETH. Besides, wstETH has depegged and is now worth $1,676, or 11.3% more than the underlying asset.\n\nThe latest transfer of these hacked funds comes just a few weeks after the hacker sent another $155 million in Ethereum to a decentralized exchange last month.\n\n95,630 ETH was sent to the OpenOcean DEX and then converted into ETH-pegged assets such as Lido\u2019s stETH and wstETH."

        "title": "NFT Traders Flex Their Blur Airdrops: Here\u2019s Who Got the Most Tokens - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nRising NFT marketplace Blur held its anticipated BLUR token airdrop this afternoon, and some of the top traders snagged more than $1 million worth of tokens at the current value. In fact, the top trader snagged more than $1.9 million worth of the Ethereum-based governance tokens.\n\nAccording to public blockchain data curated by Dune, the top claimant in the BLUR airdrop took home over 3.2 million BLUR tokens, valued at about $1.93 million based on the current price of about $0.60 per token via CoinGecko.\n\nIt\u2019s not immediately clear who holds the Ethereum wallet that claimed that enormous stash of tokens, but it\u2019s a relatively new wallet created less than three months ago. It has also been incredibly active in the NFT space, trading massive sums of Mutant Ape Yacht Club and Otherside NFTs in recent days.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA look at the trading activity from the wallet shows that the holder has been buying and selling loads of the same NFTs over and over again, suggesting wash trading or at least a coordinated effort to game the Blur trading model. The sale prices aren\u2019t high enough to raise suspicion, but the assets are being flipped at such frequency to generate enormous trading volume.\n\nInterestingly, a look at the wallets of the second-highest claimant (2.97M BLUR, or $1.8 million) and third-highest claimant (2.5M BLUR, or $1.5 million) show numerous interactions with the top wallet, including back-and-forth batch sales of various NFTs via Blur.\n\nMoney printer go BLURRRRR. I just received 610658.739770709 $BLUR from @BLUR_io\u2019s Season 1 drop. Season 2 begins NOW. Start listing and bidding on Blur to get a head start on Season 2 rewards. pic.twitter.com/7Y3i6m8MMW \u2014 Keungz (@keung) February 14, 2023\n\nAgain, it points to either wash trading from one person or group across multiple wallets, or a coordinated effort. As with the top wallet, it\u2019s not immediately clear who owns these wallets\u2014but they\u2019re all intertwined in what appears to be a large-scale and successful attempt to manipulate the Blur airdrop, surely driving up Blur\u2019s marketplace trading volume in the process.\n\nOther top claimants in the Blur airdrop include well-known collectors and social media personalities, including the pseudonymous Machi Big Brother (almost 1.85 million BLUR, or $1.1 million worth), Keungz (610K BLUR, or $368,000 worth), and major Bored Ape Yacht Club trader Franklin (540K BLUR, or $326,000 worth).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBlur offered up 360 million BLUR tokens through the airdrop, with that circulating supply giving the token a current market cap around $217 million. It\u2019s a relatively small chunk of the overall BLUR supply, however, which will apparently tally 3 billion BLUR once all tokens are released. Nearly 260 million of the airdropped tokens have been claimed so far, or about 72%.\n\nBLUR shot as high as $5.02 per token when it first hit the market today, but fell sharply. It\u2019s currently down 88% from that short-lived peak."

        "content": "The global crypto market cap stands on the verge of losing the $1 trillion mark, as prices of top coins saw more losses than gains early Monday morning. Bitcoin (BTC), the world\u2019s oldest crypto, failed to rise above the $22,000 mark over the weekend. Other popular altcoins \u2014 including the likes of Dogecoin (DOGE), Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), and Litecoin (LTC) \u2014 saw a mix of reds and greens across the board. The Render Token (RNDR) became the top gainer, with a 24-hour jump of over 13 percent.\n\nThe global crypto market cap stood at $1.01 trillion at the time of writing, registering a 24-hour dip of 0.49 percent.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price today\n\nBitcoin price stood at $21,828.45, registering a 24-hour gain of 0.09 percent, as per CoinMarketCap. According to Indian exchange WazirX, BTC price stood at Rs 18.75 lakhs.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price today\n\nETH price stood at $1,518.99, marking a 24-hour dip of 0.88 percent at the time of writing. As per WazirX, Ethereum price in India stood at Rs 1.32 lakhs.\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) price today\n\nDOGE registered a 24-hour loss of 0.17 percent, as per CoinMarketCap data, currently priced at $0.08179. As per WazirX, Dogecoin price in India stood at Rs 7.29.\n\nLitecoin (LTC) price today\n\nLitecoin saw a 24-hour dip of 0.16 percent. At the time of writing, it was trading at $93.07.

As per WazirX, SOL price in India stood at Rs 1,956.40.\n\nTop crypto gainers today (February 13)\n\nAs per CoinMarketCap data, here are the top five crypto gainers over the past 24 hours:\n\nRender Token (RNDR)\n\nPrice: $1.62\n\n24-hour gain: 13.87 percent\n\nStacks (STX)\n\nPrice: $0.3141\n\n24-hour gain: 9.21 percent\n\nZiliqa (ZIL)\n\nPrice: $0.03058\n\n24-hour gain: 9.18 percent\n\nInternet Computer (ICP)\n\nPrice: $5.64\n\n24-hour gain: 8.16 percent\n\nOasis Network (ROSE)\n\nPrice: $0.07401\n\n24-hour gain: 5.27 percent\n\nTop crypto losers today (February 13)\n\nAs per CoinMarketCap data, here are the top five crypto losers over the past 24 hours:\n\nHedera (HBAR)\n\nPrice: $0.08466\n\n24-hour loss: 8.63 percent\n\nMina (MINA)\n\nPrice: $1.00\n\n24-hour loss: 8.55 percent\n\nOptimism (OP)\n\nPrice: $2.28\n\n24-hour loss: 7.53 percent\n\nFantom (FTM)\n\nPrice: $0.4354\n\n24-hour loss: 7.50 percent\n\nThe Graph (GRT)\n\nPrice: $0.1538\n\n24-hour loss: 6.93 percent\n\nWhat crypto exchanges are saying about the current market scenario\n\nMudrex co-founder and CEO Edul Patel told ABP Live, \u201cMost cryptocurrencies experienced a decline over the weekend. Bitcoin's value dipped below $22,000 following the US-based Kraken crypto exchange's decision to halt its staking service and pay a $30 million fine to the SEC for not registering the service. The current trading price of Bitcoin, near its support level of $21,770, is bearish, and if the trend continues, it could fall to $21,500 by the end of the week. Currently, Bitcoin does not show any signs of a midterm price recovery.\u201d\n\nWazirX Vice President Rajagopal Menon said, \u201cThe Crypto market is feeling the impact of global regulations. Liquid staking token prices surged after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and crypto exchange Kraken reached a settlement which clarified that staking as a technical service will continue in the US but with more transparency around tokens going into the staking pool, to prevent fund misuse. Bitcoin\u2019s price fell due to the SEC verdict that Kraken will cease its US operations. Ethereum\u2019s price went down by almost 1.6 percent.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin said, \u201cBitcoin price drops below $21,750, downtrend could continue with potential to reach $21,200. If the price breaks below this level, further declines may occur with the next support level at $20,600. Despite the current decline, with support from the 200-day EMA, there may be an opportunity for another top if the market holds above $20,300.\u201d\n\nKunji founder Anurag Dixit offered his take, \u201cOver the weekend, there was significant growth observed in certain subsectors of the cryptocurrency market. However, the US Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) is currently investigating and charging Paxos for their involvement with the BUSD stablecoin, which highlights the increased regulatory scrutiny that the industry may face in the coming year. Despite the challenging global regulatory environment, there seems to be a shift in the commentary surrounding cryptocurrency regulations in India. Previously, there had been some suggestions to ban cryptocurrencies, but recent comments from Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman indicate a more accommodating stance. It is expected that the regulation of cryptocurrencies will eventually be a coordinated effort by governments worldwide. However, India's initial stance during the G20 summit was to ban cryptocurrencies, as opposed to exploring the possibility of a coordinated regulatory framework.\"\n\nShivam Thakral, the CEO of BuyUCoin, said, \u201cThe crypto market had a busy weekend as BTC is looking for a new support level. The macroeconomic factors are swinging the prices across the crypto market which include regulatory uncertainty and higher-than-expected December consumer prices. BTC is trading close to the $22,000 level while ETH is exchanging hands at the $1,516 level. The next FOMC meeting is the next big event for the digital asset market for which investors are eagerly waiting.\u201d\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

        "content": "Brain Armstrong speaks up following rumors that the U.S. SEC is targeting Crypto staking.\n\nCoinbase staking services fails to meet the Howey test elements.\n\nCoinbase exchange is not pleased with the SEC\u2019s rumored plans to go after cryptocurrency staking, and the exchange is making it crystal clear. Coinbase\u2019s head Brian Armstrog is reiterating that \u201cCoinbase\u2019s staking services are not securities. We will happily defend this in court if needed.\u201d\n\nCoinbase's staking services are not securities. We will happily defend this in court if needed.https://t.co/GtTOz77YV3 \u2014 Brian Armstrong \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f (@brian_armstrong) February 12, 2023\n\nThe exchange\u2019s CEO had told the market that SEC was out to crack down on crypto staking in the country, for retail customers. To him, that path would be a terrible one to take. Coinbase has updated its blog with new content explaining why its exchange\u2019s staking services are not securities.\n\nLong-term crypto companies have been migrating from proof of work to proof of stake, as it is a less energy-intensive protocol.\n\nCrypto users around the globe have been leaning more towards staking and its profits. Debates about proof of stake and how it is received on a regulatory level have been a long-term topic of discussion. If regulation is done wrong as Coinbase observed, it could endanger the PoS technology in the U.S. Coinbase observed in the post:\n\nAt Coinbase, we\u2019ve been committed to providing our users with a secure, compliant platform to access the cryptoeconomy since day one, and our staking products are not securities. But there are a lot of products in the market called staking and many of them work very differently. Today I\u2019ll focus on core staking services (protocol-based, on-chain staking), like the ones Coinbase offers, which are a vital aspect of crypto and blockchain technologies.\u201d\n\nCoinbase is defining its Crypto staking services before the SEC does\n\nCoinbase offers its main staking service through the Coinbase Earn program. With the program, users can stake selected assets for recurring payment from the blockchain protocol. Users are assured of a stake through products like Coinbase Wallet and Coinbase Cloud.\n\nCoinbase is claiming that its staking is not a security and that staking, in general, is not a security. Coinbase refers to the U.S. Securities Act and Howey test that is used by the SEC to determine what investment contract is or isn\u2019t a security.\n\nHowever, staking does not meet the four elements of the Howey test. The first element test is the investment of money and Coinbase maintains that staking does not constitute an investment of money.\n\nIn Coinbase\u2019s words, when customers ask Coinbase to stake their crypto, they don\u2019t give up anything in return. Customers retain their full ownership of their assets and rights to unstake.\n\nCoinbase also fails to meet the second element \u201ccommon enterprise\u201d because assets are staked in a decentralized network, Coinbase observed. Stakers are connected by blockchain and validate transactions through a user community and not a common enterprise.\n\nReasonable expectations of profits and the efforts of others are the last two elements of the howey test. Like the former, Coinbase staking services do not meet the test elements.\n\nCoinbase is trying to communicate that it is important for the SEC to get it right with staking and the regulation surrounding staking.\n\nThe purpose of securities law is to correct for imbalances in information. But there is no imbalance of information in staking, as all participants are connected on the blockchain and are able to validate transactions through a community of users with equal access to the same information..\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

        "title": "The Present and Future of Layer 2 Rollup - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "An Overview of Layer 2 Roll-ups\n\nOver the past few years, Layer 2 (L2) rollup solutions have come to the forefront as activity on the Ethereum network has grown. Activity and engagement with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has caused a surge in Layer 1 (L1) blockchain activity.\n\nIn turn, the demand for blockspace, represented by gas costs, has increased. And the time for transaction finality has risen due to the increased network load.\n\nWhilst the Ethereum Merge set the groundwork for future gas fee optimisations; it did not directly reduce transaction gas fees.\n\nIn the year between the summer of 2020 and the peak demand in the summer of 2021 gas cost in Gwei on the Ethereum network increased by up to 1300%. The need to make transactions fast and affordable spurred the creation of two primary forms of rollup: Optimistic and Zero-Knowledge (ZK).\n\nRollups help remove the computational demands on the Ethereum network by moving transaction processing off-chain, converting them into a single piece of data and then submitting back on Ethereum as a batch to reduce the associated cost and time.\n\nThe big difference between the two is that Optimistic roll-ups utilise fraud proofs, whereas ZK-rollups rely on zero-knowledge proofs to verify changes to the main chain.\n\nOptimistic and ZK-rollups: Fraud Proofs vs Validity Proofs\n\nFraud proofs bundle transactions off-chain and then repost them to the L1. After a bundle has been submitted on the L1 there is a challenge period, during which anyone can challenge the result of the rollup by computing a fraud proof.\n\nSimilarly, zero-knowledge proofs batch transactions off-chain and submit them as a single transaction. Where they differ is rather than assuming the transactions are correct initially, they use a validity proof to instantly prove whether the transactions are valid. Once the transactions have been confirmed as valid they are then submitted to the L1.\n\nThis is how they derive their respective names \u2013 fraud proofs are where the transactions are checked retrospectively to see if there are any fraudulent transactions, whereas validity proofs are completed before the transactions are submitted to the L1.\n\nWhilst there are prominent projects for both, they each come with their own respective benefits and drawbacks. Optimistic roll-ups have the advantage that fraud proofs are only required when there is an issue.\n\nThis means they require less computational resources and are able to scale well. The trouble lies with the challenge period. A longer challenge period increases the likelihood that any fraudulent transactions are identified, however it also means that users have to wait longer to withdraw their funds.\n\nFor leading optimistic rollup solutions, such as Arbitrum and Optimism, this waiting period can last up to a week. Alternatively, ZK-rollups have the advantage of always reflecting a correct L2 state. Their drawback is that proofs are required for all state transitions, rather than solely when they are contested, which limits scalability. This is further compounded by the complex nature and early stage of the technology.\n\nDespite their respective challenges, ZK-rollups are being heralded as the future for roll-ups. This is primarily due to the automatic generation of validity proofs increasing the security of the protocol, the significantly reduced time to withdraw due to there being no challenge period, and that ZK-rollups boast better data compression.\n\nFor these reasons we will hone in on the current state of the ZK-rollup space, the latest innovations and what lies ahead in the future.\n\nThe ZK-Rollup Space\n\nAs we\u2019ve discussed, ZK-rollups are predominantly in the focal point with players like zkSync, Starknet, Polygon zkEVM, and Scroll all raising large amounts of capital to develop their solutions despite only StarkNet having launched on mainnet ($780MM in total).\n\nEach of these projects have taken their own angle, differing primarily across their rollups data availability strategy and their proving algorithm. The data availability strategy determines where the state data of a roll-up is stored, on-chain storage has increased security but it uses up block space on the Ethereum network which reduces transaction throughput.\n\nThe proving algorithm is the means of generating a validity proof, which can either be STARK or SNARK.\n\nBoth of these algorithms help developers to relocate computation and storage off-chain, in turn increasing scalability. They are also able to verify whether a user has sufficient funds and the correct private key without having to access the information itself, thus improving the security.\n\nYou can read more about the technical differences here. STARKs have the advantage of offering more scalability, security and transparency compared to SNARKs.\n\nBut the drawback STARKS have is a larger proof size, which takes longer to verify, and that SNARKs comparatively only use 24% of the gas. Therein for both SNARKS and STARKS we have the tradeoff between speed and cost vs. scalability, security and transparency.\n\nWhilst many different methods are being explored there is not yet a definitive answer as to the best way to set up a ZK-rollup. Each configuration brings respective benefits and many developers are still exploring the optimal choice or combination for their rollup designs.\n\nThe Hurdles To Overcome\n\nAs we\u2019ve discussed, ZK-rollups are still in development and there are various challenges that need to be overcome before blockchain users are able to reap their full benefits.\n\nLanguage compatibility is one such challenge; translating EVM-friendly programming languages, such as Solidity, into a custom-built language specifically optimised for ZKP can help boost their efficiency, but it brings with it adoption challenges for developers.\n\nFor example, StarkNet is looking to solve this with Warp, a Solidity to Cairo (the language of StarkNet\u2019s ZKP) language compiler that looks to automatically convert Solidity into Cairo. Using Warp removes the need for developers to rewrite their code in Cairo, making it a much smoother process.\n\nOther challenges include the secretive nature of projects, with many going against the open source ethos of crypto due to concerns over first-mover advantage and capturing a sticky userbase. Most ZK-rollups were first launched this year, highlighting the amount of work that is yet to be done in the space.\n\nLastly, whilst rollups (both optimistic and zero-knowledge) have the benefits of improved speed and cost, it tends to be at the expense of decentralisation.\n\nThis is due to the inherent need for sequencers, the actors batching transactions and committing proofs to the L1.\n\nAll rollups currently need a centralised sequencer and use upgradeable smart contracts that are managed by a single entity. Because the space is still so early, a central focal point is typically required for quick fixes to bugs in the code. Add to that the projects aren\u2019t open sourced, creating another hurdle for community members to act as sequencers.\n\nMany projects have indicated that they plan to decentralize their sequencer functions in the future, but this will undoubtedly take additional resources and time.\n\nDecentralization Plans\n\nLaunching a token and open-sourcing code will be the next steps for many of the projects seeking decentralisation. Tokenisation of these services to generate activity and decentralise the product is another area where we expect to see a myriad of different solutions cropping up as projects look to create the most scalable, decentralised and active L2 on the market.\n\nStarkWare and zkSync are both planning to launch a token and Polygon could potentially use MATIC to support Polygon\u2019s zkEVM initiative. Token engineering on ZK-rollups is an even more nascent space than the optimistic rollup technology and finding an effective and sustainable model can differentiate and boost adoption.\n\nThe Future\n\nzkEVMs are still in their very early stages and the race is on to launch on mainnet. StarkNet has the first mover advantage but still has challenges with regards to supporting Solidity features due to the use of Cairo, leaving room for competitors to make improvements.\n\nThe projects that are able to amass significant user bases will attract dapp developers, in turn bringing more dApps to their platform and increasing the feature set. ConsenSys\u2019 zkEVM is currently moving to testnet and are focussing specifically on dapp developers for this reason, leveraging tools like MetaMask, Infura and Truffle so that they can deploy and manage applications as if they were directly using Ethereum.\n\nAnd whilst we have discussed the current players in the zkEVM market, other predominant rollup solutions like Polygon, Optimism and Arbitrum still command a significant market share.\n\nAs zkEVM solutions mature, we may see these projects look to transition to validity proofs or hybrid solutions, leveraging their existing user bases to attract dapp development and maintain their market dominance. In the end, the many rollup solutions (and the increased competition between them) will continue to improve the web3 user experience and introduce platforms for applications to onboard the next generation of users.\n\nGiven these threats, we\u2019re not surprised at the secrecy of projects in the space, but we believe the true winner will be able to leverage the efficiency of ZK-rollups and combine it with a seamless developer and user experience to come out on top."

        "title": "11 Ways To Make Money With Ethereum in Nigeria - Business Post Nigeria",
        "content": "You\u2019re probably familiar with Bitcoin, but have you heard of Ethereum? Ethereum is a decentralised platform for building and running applications and is quickly becoming one of the hottest investment opportunities in the crypto space. If you\u2019re looking for ways to make money with Ethereum in Nigeria, you\u2019ve come to the right place. In this blog post, we\u2019ll explore 11 ways to get started and make the most of your investment.\n\nImagine this: You\u2019re scrolling through your social media feed, and you come across a post from a friend who made a ton of money with Ethereum. They tell you about this fantastic platform they used to invest in decentralised applications and make a fortune. You\u2019re intrigued but also a bit sceptical \u2013 you\u2019ve heard of cryptocurrencies, but you have no idea how they work.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly how I felt when I first heard about Ethereum. But, being the curious person I am, I decided to do some research and learn all about it. And let me tell you, I was blown away by what I discovered. Ethereum is a game-changer, and I want to share everything I learned with you.\n\nIn this article, I\u2019ll break down Ethereum in a way that\u2019s easy to understand so you, too, can take advantage of its potential to make money. Whether you\u2019re a beginner or just looking to expand your investment portfolio, this article is for you. So, sit back, grab a cup of coffee, water, tea or anything you want, and get ready to learn about the fantastic world of Ethereum and the different ways you can make money from it!\n\nOverview of Ethereum\n\nEthereum is a pretty cool platform. It\u2019s decentralised, which means it\u2019s not controlled by any government or corporation. It\u2019s also open-source, which means anyone can use and build on it. Basically, it\u2019s a platform for creating and running smart contracts and decentralised apps (dApps).\n\nSo what are smart contracts? Think of them as computer programs that automatically execute when certain conditions are met. For example, you could use a smart contract to automate the exchange of money, property, or other assets between two parties. No need for a middleman!\n\nEthereum uses its own cryptocurrency called Ether (ETH) to power its network and execute transactions. And to keep everything secure, it uses a consensus mechanism called Proof of Stake, which is more energy-efficient than other methods.\n\nIn terms of dApps, Ethereum is a pretty big deal. It\u2019s home to many decentralised apps, from games and social media to financial applications. And you can even create decentralised organisations (DAOs) that run on code rather than relying on a central authority.\n\nSo, that\u2019s Ethereum in a nutshell! It\u2019s a pretty innovative platform helping shape a more decentralised and open internet.\n\nSo, how can you make money from this cutting-edge cryptocurrency? Let\u2019s find out.\n\nWays To Earn Passive Income In Nigeria With Ethereum\n\n1. Trading Ethereum:\n\nOne of the most straightforward ways to make money with Ethereum is trading. The basic idea is to buy low and sell high. You\u2019ll need to find a reputable crypto exchange that supports Ethereum., and create an account. From there, you can buy Ethereum using Nigerian Naira (NGN) or another cryptocurrency and hold onto it until you think the price will go up. Then, you can sell it for a profit.\n\nKeep in mind that the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, and prices can change quickly. It\u2019s important to understand market trends and do your research before making any trades. Consider using stop-loss orders to minimise your risk and protect your investment.\n\nTo get the most out of your investment, you must sell your Ethereum on the best crypto trading platform, Breet app. Breet is an OTC crypto trading app in Nigeria where you can convert Ethereum to Naira and withdraw your funds directly to your Naira bank account within seconds for no extra charge. Get started by downloading Breet today, and enjoy a seamless trading experience.\n\n2. Staking Ethereum:\n\nStaking is another way to make money with Ethereum, and it\u2019s a lot less risky than trading. Staking means holding onto your Ethereum and helping to secure the network by participating in consensus. In return, you\u2019ll earn rewards in the form of new Ethereum. The more Ethereum you stake, the more you\u2019ll earn.\n\nTo start staking, you\u2019ll need a minimum amount of Ethereum in a wallet that supports staking. You can choose a staking provider or use a decentralised platform like Rocket Pool or Stakefish. Staking is an excellent option if you\u2019re looking for long-term investment and passive income.\n\n3. Participating in decentralised Finance (DeFi):\n\nDecentralised finance, or DeFi, is a growing sector of the Ethereum ecosystem that allows you to earn interest and yield on your Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies. DeFi protocols like Aave, Compound and Yearn Finance allow you to deposit your Ethereum and earn interest, similar to a savings account. You can also earn yield by providing liquidity to DeFi exchanges, such as Uniswap or Balancer.\n\nDeFi is a high-risk, high-reward opportunity, so it\u2019s essential to do your research and understand the risks involved. Make sure to only invest what you can afford to lose and consider using stop-loss orders to protect your investment.\n\n4. Crypto Lending:\n\nCrypto lending is another way to earn passive income with Ethereum. You can lend your Ethereum to borrowers and earn interest on your loan. This can be a great option if you have a large amount of Ethereum that you don\u2019t need to sell right away.\n\nSeveral platforms offer crypto lending services, such as Nexo, BlockFi, and Celsius. Keep in mind that crypto lending is a relatively new and untested market, so it\u2019s essential to do your research and understand the risks involved.\n\n5. Mining Ethereum:\n\nMining is the process of creating new Ethereum by solving complex mathematical problems. The more computing power you have, the more Ethereum you can mine. You\u2019ll need to set up a mining rig, which can be an expensive investment, but the rewards can be substantial.\n\nKeep in mind that mining is a highly competitive field, and the cost of electricity and hardware can be significant. You\u2019ll need to do a cost-benefit analysis to determine if mining is a good investment for you.\n\n6. Participating in Ethereum-based prediction markets:\n\nEthereum-based prediction markets, such as Augur and Gnosis, allow you to bet on the outcome of events and earn rewards based on your accuracy. You can participate in prediction markets by creating a market, placing bets, and earning rewards based on the outcome. This is a great option if you have knowledge or expertise in a particular field or market.\n\n7. Creating NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens):\n\nNFTs are unique digital assets that can be bought, sold, and traded on the Ethereum blockchain. If you\u2019re an artist, musician or have another creative talent, you can monetise your work by creating NFTs. You can sell your NFTs on platforms like OpenSea, Rarible, or SuperRare.\n\n8. Earning passive income through yield farming:\n\nYield farming is a process of earning passive income by depositing Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies in liquidity pools and earning rewards for providing liquidity to decentralised exchanges. This is a high-risk, high-reward opportunity for those familiar with the DeFi space. Several yield farming platforms, such as Binance Smart Chain, allow you to earn rewards for providing liquidity.\n\n9. Investing in Ethereum-based startups:\n\nAnother way to make money with Ethereum is by investing in Ethereum-based startups. This can be a high-risk, high-reward opportunity, as startup investments are generally considered speculative. However, if you do your research and invest in a promising startup, you could see significant returns on your investment.\n\n10. Earning Ethereum through content creation:\n\nIf you have a talent for writing, video production, or other forms of content creation, you can earn Ethereum by creating and sharing your content on various platforms. Some platforms allow you to earn rewards in the form of cryptocurrency for creating and sharing valuable content with the community.\n\n11. Earning Ethereum through affiliate marketing:\n\nFinally, you can earn Ethereum through affiliate marketing. This involves promoting products or services and earning commissions for every sale made through your unique affiliate link. Several Ethereum-based affiliate marketing platforms, such as Refersion, allow you to earn Ethereum for your marketing efforts.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, there are plenty of ways to make cash with Ethereum in Nigeria. Whether you\u2019re into trading, staking, DeFi, or something else entirely, there\u2019s a way for you to get in on the action. The key is to do your research and understand the risks involved with any investment. But with the right mindset and effort, you can make the most of your Ethereum investment and grow your wealth over time. So, get out there and start exploring the opportunities!"
