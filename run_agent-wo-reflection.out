Based on the news articles provided, there are several key points to consider for analyzing the market trend for Ethereum (ETH) cryptocurrency:

1. Celo Proposal to Migrate to Ethereum Layer 2 Passes: This news indicates a positive development for Ethereum as Celo, another blockchain project, is proposing to migrate to Ethereum's Layer 2. This migration could potentially increase the usage and adoption of Ethereum's Layer 2 solutions, which could have a positive impact on the Ethereum ecosystem.

2. Ethereum Price Analysis: The price of Ethereum has been experiencing a correction phase, with the price stalling around the $1830 mark. The article suggests that there is a consolidation phase happening, reflecting a weakness in bullish momentum. The key levels to watch are $1890 resistance and $1830 support, which could influence the near future trend of ETH. A breakout above $1890 could trigger a new recovery cycle, while a breakdown below $1830 could lead to a potential drop to $1800.

3. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin Tumble After SEC Lawsuit: The market experienced a decline after the SEC launched a lawsuit against internet marketer Richard Heart and his projects Hex, PulseChain, and PulseX. This news could have a short-term negative impact on Ethereum

You are an experienced ETH cryptocurrency trader and you are trying to maximize your overall profit by trading ETH. In each day, you will make an action to buy or sell ETH. You will start with 1 million dollars, half in cash and half in ETH. You are assisted by a few analysts below and need to decide the final action.

ON-CHAIN ANALYST REPORT: Based on the given information, the market trend for ETH appears to be bullish. The open price is relatively high, and there is a high number of transactions and unique addresses, indicating strong activity in the market. The value transferred is also significant, suggesting a high level of trading volume.

The average gas price and total gas used are relatively high, which could indicate increased demand for transactions on the Ethereum network. The high number of successful transactions further supports the bullish trend.

The short-long moving average signal and MACD signal both indicate a buy signal, suggesting that the market is currently favorable for buying ETH. However, the Bollinger Bands signal is indicating a hold, which could suggest some potential consolidation in the near term.

Overall, based on the information provided, the market trend for ETH is likely bullish, with potential for further price appreciation in the short to medium term. Traders and investors may consider buying ETH based on the current signals and market conditions.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, the market trend for ETH appears to be bullish. The high number of transactions, unique addresses, and value transferred indicate strong activity in the market, along with the buy signals from the short-long moving average and MACD signals. Although the Bollinger Bands signal suggests potential consolidation in the near term, the overall sentiment is positive for buying ETH.

Considering the news analyst report, the positive development of Celo proposing to migrate to Ethereum's Layer 2 could increase adoption and usage of Ethereum's solutions. While there is a correction phase in the price of Ethereum, the key levels to watch are $1890 resistance and $1830 support. The negative impact of the SEC lawsuit on the market is a short-term concern but may not have a significant long-term effect.

Given the bullish market trend and positive news developments, I am confident in the upward trajectory of ETH. Therefore, I suggest buying ETH with a value of -0.7 (buy with 70% cash).

Meanwhile, Plutus is the platform’s smart contract language, which powers decentralized applications (DApps). These elements are designed to ensure secure and cost-efficient transactions, which is key to the overall utility and adoption of a blockchain network.\n\nThe lower transaction cost is a major point of contention between Cardano and Ethereum, the latter of which has faced criticism for its high transaction fees, particularly during periods of network congestion. Cardano, which is known as the "Japanese Ethereum," is aiming to offer a more accessible, affordable, and permissionless blockchain.\n\nHoskinson\'s comments align with his previous criticisms of Ethereum, where he notably challenged the staking mechanism of the blockchain he once helped to create.\n\nHe has been known to contrast the approaches of the two platforms, suggesting that Cardano\'s proof-of-stake protocol is designed more effectively, contributing to its superiority over Ethereum.\n\nIn a series of critical remarks, Hoskinson has also described Ethereum as "a dumpster fire" and suggested that it could become obsolete.'}, {'id': 6, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vdS50b2RheS9ldGhlcmV1bS1ldGYtcmFjZS1nYWlucy1zdGVhbS1zaXgtYXNzZXQtbWFuYWdlcnMtZmlsZWQtd2l0aC1zZWPSAVNodHRwczovL3UudG9kYXkvZXRoZXJldW0tZXRmLXJhY2UtZ2FpbnMtc3RlYW0tc2l4LWFzc2V0LW1hbmFnZXJzLWZpbGVkLXdpdGgtc2VjP2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Tue, 01 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Ethereum ETF Race Gains Steam, Six Asset Managers Filed With SEC - U.Today', 'content': 'Advertisement\n\nEric Balchunas, Bloomberg\'s senior analyst for exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and his colleague James Seyffart summarized all approval requests for Ethereum (ETH) futures ETFs that are under review by the U.S. Securities and Exchanges Commission.\n\nVanEcks, ProShares, Grayscale, who else?

In TradFi, security dealers will find short-term repos to manage both their own assets and their client’s assets. In the case of Term Finance, the security dealer will be replaced by smart contracts.\n\nBilly Welch, the co-founder of Term Labs, the team behind Term Finance, told Blockworks its ability to scale fixed-term lending sets it apart from other fixed-term lending protocols.\n\nMany existing fixed-term lending protocols today utilize automated market makers and liquidity pools to originate fixed-term loans.\n\n“From a borrower’s perspective, when you’re trying to borrow (for example) $500,000, $1 million, $2 million, there is significant slippage,” Welch said. “It’s not scalable for an institutional level user, then from [a liquidity provider] or lender’s perspective, you only make returns as borrowers interact against that pool. So your real returns are half a percent per year.”\n\nTerm Finance, on the other hand, uses a double-sided blind auction process where the protocol matches borrowers and lenders depending on how much they are willing to bid, Welch said.\n\n“We conduct these auctions where borrowers and lenders can submit their bids and offers to borrow and lend over a period of time, and once the auction closes, we take the bids and offers and create a supply-demand curve,” Welch said. “Any borrower that’s willing to bid at or above the clearing rate gets a loan, and any lender willing to receive the clearing rate or less makes a loan.”\n\nWith this model, liquidity providers will not have to trap their liquidity in an automated market maker for an indefinite amount of time.\n\n“All you have to do is lock it up for the period of when you submit your bid, if you get done in an auction you get a loan, and if you don’t you can take your tokens back and send it to another DeFi lending protocol and get variable rate lending in that capacity,” Welch said.\n\nThe first public auction on Ethereum mainnet will be a one-month loan maturing Aug. 31 on wstETH collateral borrowing USDC. The auction will begin at 11 am ET today, and interested participants will have 48 hours before Thursday at 11 am ET to place their bids.\n\n“The long-term vision is we have a repo token maturing every week, every month, going out to one year. This can serve as a basis for a DeFi native benchmark yield curve,” Welch said.\n\nDon’t miss the next big story – join our free daily newsletter.'}].

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

According to the filing, ETHG intends to invest in cash-settled, front-month, i.e. with the shortest time to maturity, ETH futures contracts, without seeking direct exposure to the current spot price of Ethereum.\n\nThe fund is classified as “non-diversified” under the Investment Company Act of 1940, meaning it is able to invest a relatively high percentage of its assets in financial instruments with a single counterparty or a few counterparties.\n\nThe filing details that the fund will not invest in ETH futures contracts directly; instead, the investments will be channeled through a wholly-owned subsidiary operating under the laws of the Cayman Islands.\n\nFurthermore, since the Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF intends to qualify for treatment as a regulated investment company, the

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
Based on the news provided, it is evident that there is a significant interest in Ethereum (ETH) futures-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) among asset managers. Six asset managers have filed applications with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for ETH futures-based ETFs, indicating a growing interest in ETH as an investment vehicle.

The filing of these ETF applications could potentially lead to increased liquidity and trading volume in the ETH market, as ETFs are known to attract a wide range of investors, including institutional investors. This increased interest in ETH could lead to a positive market trend for the cryptocurrency, as more investors enter the market through these ETFs.

Additionally, the news of MicroStrategy filing to raise up to $750 million in share sales to buy more bitcoin could also have a positive impact on the overall cryptocurrency market sentiment. The company's significant holdings in bitcoin and its plans to increase its exposure to the cryptocurrency could signal confidence in the long-term potential of digital assets.

Overall, based on the news provided, the market trend for ETH and other cryptocurrencies could be positive, with the potential for increased interest and investment in the asset class through ETFs and institutional investors.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

However, the recent 1.79% fall in Ethereum prices forms a bearish candle breaking the bottom support to exceed the $1849 mark.\n\nCurrently, the Ethereum price trades at $1833 below the 50-day EMA, with an intraday fall of 0.28%. The bearish range breakout intensifies the dark cloud over Ethereum prices, projecting a potential drop in market value to $1800.\n\nTrading View\n\nWith a closing price of $1820, Ethereum was at its lowest closing level in 36 days. This brings the biggest altcoin closer to a long-term support trendline forming since December 2022. The ascending support trendline has helped ETH prices bounce back five times since December 2022.\n\nThe RSI indicator projects a high possibility of a bullish divergence forming at the coming retracement to the trendline. Meanwhile, the 200-day EMA follows a sideways track and stays close to $1800, ready to provide a cushion.\n\nIn case of a bullish reversal, the Ethereum prices can reclaim the 50-day EMA and challenge the $2000 resistance level before reaching the $2150 mark.\n\nHowever, a prolonged downtrend can challenge the bullish dominance of the $1800 mark.'}, {'id': 6, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vY3J5cHRvc2xhdGUuY29tL3dvcmxkLW1vYmlsZS1sYXVuY2hlcy1ldGhlcmV1bS1hbmQtYm5iLWNoYWluLWJyaWRnZXMtc3RyZW5ndGhlbmluZy1tdWx0aWNoYWluLXN0cmF0ZWd5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Thu, 03 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'World Mobile launches Ethereum and BNB Chain bridges, strengthening multichain strategy - CryptoSlate', 'content': 'World Mobile (WMT), a global mobile network based on blockchain, has launched dedicated cross-chain bridges for Ethereum (ETH) and BNB Chain networks.\n\nAccording to an Aug. 3 statement, the newly launched cross-chain bridges align with World Mobile’s multichain strategy of exposing the crypto community to its growing ecosystem, as the bridges would allow users to seamlessly move their WMT tokens between Cardano (ADA) and the other blockchain networks.\n\nSpeed and scalability\n\nWorld Mobile underscored the importance of the scalability and speed offered by both networks, which were key factors in their inclusion.\n\nBy incorporating these networks into its operations, World Mobile aims to realize its vision of connecting global communities and fostering a more inclusive mobile ecosystem.\n\nZachary Vann, the Head of Development at World Mobile Token, further highlighted the dominance and influence of the two blockchain networks within the crypto space. Vann added:\n\n“This is a significant step forward for our multichain strategy, as it will enable our token to access the rich and diverse ecosystems on both chains.”\n\nAdditionally, the Ethereum and BNB Chain cross-chain bridges will offer users of the two networks a chance to join the emerging WMT ecosystem. BNB Chain and Ethereum are two of the most used smart contract networks, with both networks having more than 200 million unique addresses, respectively.\n\nWMT eyes liquidity\n\nIn addition to its primary objective, the initiative is set to bolster WMT liquidity. Compared to its native Cardano network, Ethereum and BNB Chain currently demonstrate higher levels of liquidity.\n\nNotably, the World Mobile sidechain AyA will see seamless integration with these two prominent networks, further enhancing its potential and accessibility.\n\nWith the creation of the new bridges, WMT now has three cross-chain bridges connecting it to other networks. The third bridge connects World Mobile to Conflux (CFX) blockchain.\n\nDespite a slight drop of 0.93% in the last 24 hours, WMT’s price holds steady at $0.11489, as per the data from CryptoSlate.\n\nMentioned in this article'}, {'id': 8, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NidGMuY29tL25ld3MvZXRoZXJldW0vb24tY2hhaW4tbWV0cmljLXN0YWduYXRpb24tZXRoZXJldW0tYnJlYWstMjAwMC_SAVlodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzYnRjLmNvbS9uZXdzL2V0aGVyZXVtL29uLWNoYWluLW1ldHJpYy1zdGFnbmF0aW9uLWV0aGVyZXVtLWJyZWFrLTIwMDAvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Thu, 03 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Key On-Chain Metric Points to Stagnation, Will Ethereum Ever Break $2,000? - NewsBTC', 'content': 'According to Etherscan data, the number of active ERC-20 addresses has not changed much in 2023. It has stayed between 200,000 and 300,000 while Ethereum prices stagnate below July 2023 highs. As of August 2, there were about 275,000 active ERC-20 addresses, up from 156,000 on June 18. Although activity has been low overall, there was a significant increase on June 11, with over 446,000 active ERC-20 addresses.\n\nEthereum’s price trajectory has been tumultuous in tandem with this activity pattern, looking at the charts. For instance, Ethereum bulls have failed to breach the $2,100 liquidation level posted in the latter stages of H1 2023.\n\nEthereum Prices Volatile, Few Coins Burned\n\nAt the moment, ETH prices hover around the $1,800 range, teetering precariously and likely to drop, looking at candlestick arrangements in the daily chart. Although Ethereum has been bullish in the past two months, bulls have been tamed, and a drop below the $1,800 level may signal a shift from bullish to bearish in the medium term.\n\nWith ETH under pressure, the number of active ERC-20 addresses remains constant and relatively lower than the 2021 peaks. This means there is less demand for ETH, which is used to pay transaction fees. As a result, gas fees are lower because there is less competition for block space. Typically, this would encourage more people to participate and even deploy complex contracts in decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nWith EIP-1559 in the equation, low activity means fewer coins are taken out of circulation. Despite low network activity, the protocol continues to issue 2 ETH after each validated block, watering down deflationary effects enforced by EIP-1559.\n\nDeFi Activities Falling\n\nFalling activity could be attributed to the waning interest in decentralized finance (DeFi) activities over recent months. As of August 2, the total value locked (TVL) remains below $50 billion, with a significant portion of assets tied in Ethereum. DeFi projects like LidoDAO, Curve, and Uniswap facilitate the trading of ERC-20 tokens.\n\nFurthermore, on-chain data highlights USDT as the most actively transacted token. Given its position as the third-largest coin by market cap, with substantial circulation in Ethereum and Tron networks, such a trend is expected.\n\nLooking back at ERC-20 transactions from June and July, it is evident that transfers stayed constant despite temporary price increases. Ethereum prices rose from $1,630 to $2,000 between mid-June and mid-July 2023, but ETH is now lower.\n\nOn-chain ERC-20 activity has remained stable despite price volatility. It’s unclear whether there will be a change in activity as prices continue to drop. However, lower prices may force token holders to wait and see, leading to less activity.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

At the time of writing, CRV currently has a token liquidity of $6.75 million, a significant dip from $70.42 million before the hacks.\n\n“LPs (liquidity providers) are moving to other pools, so you’re seeing a lot of volume go to other DEXes,” Fish told Blockworks. “We want to join and put ourselves into that mix.”\n\nCapturing the stablecoin market\n\nFish notes that Trader Joe’s initial plan was to deploy on Ethereum in a month or two, around the beginning of Q4, after working on improving its auto pool technology.\n\n“But this opportunity came up, and we felt this is the best time to deploy,” he said.\n\nAuto pools are designed to help automate the balance of liquidity for users passively.\n\n“Ethereum runs a little bit slower, it is gas intensive, and our AMMs also use a lot of gas,” Fish explained. “If you’re managing positions in a concentrated liquidity AMM, which requires you to rebalance often, and make a lot of transactions every day, then for the average Joe it’s going to be very uncomfortable for him to market make.”\n\nLuckily, managing positions in a stable stablecoin market is relatively simple, Fish said.\n\n“The price of USDC and USDT isn’t going to vary that much,” he said. “So in most cases, people can just deploy in that range and then earn fees from within that range.”\n\nTrader Joe’s initial launch on Ethereum will include stablecoin pools USDC/USDT and USDC/DAI.\n\nHow Trader Joe compares to Uniswap\n\nLike Uniswap v3, Trader Joe is a concentrated liquidity AMM, providing constrained liquidity within a tight range for its users.\n\nCompared to its competitor, its unique edge is that it offers dynamic fee components, Fish noted.\n\nOn Uniswap v3, liquidity providers are offered three fee tiers, ranging from 0.05%, 0.3% and 1%.\n\nBy contrast, on Trader Joe, there is a base fixed fee and a variable component which is dependent on the volatility within the past few seconds to minutes.\n\nTrader Joe is currently deployed on Avalanche, Arbitrum and BNB chains.\n\nAccording to data on DeFiLlama, Trader Joe has a $57.45 million TVL on Avalanche, making it the largest DEX on the network.\n\nOn Arbitrum, however, it sports a TVL of $31.9 million, a significantly less amount compared to Uniswap v3, which currently reports volumes of $261.7 million.\n\nDon’t miss the next big story – join our free daily newsletter.'}, {'id': 39, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZW56aW5nYS5jb20vbWFya2V0cy9jcnlwdG9jdXJyZW5jeS8yMy8wOC8zMzU4Mzk5NC9hLWxvb2stYXQtYml0Y29pbi1ldGhlcmV1bS1hbmQtZG9nZWNvaW4taW50by10aGUtd2Vla2VuZC1hcy1zdG9jay1tYXJrZXQtdHVybnMtbG93ZXLSAS1odHRwczovL3d3dy5iZW56aW5nYS5jb20vYW1wL2NvbnRlbnQvMzM1ODM5OTQ?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Fri, 04 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'A Look At Bitcoin, Ethereum And Dogecoin Into The Weekend As Stock Market Turns Lower - ProShares Trust U - Benzinga', 'content': "Loading...

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

Almost 90% of its aggregated total value locked (TVL) is controlled by three networks. Here\'s how Arbitrum (ARB) keeps its supremacy in this field.\n\nArbitrum succeeds since it remains "credibly neutral," Patrick McCorry says\n\nCryptocurrency researcher Patrick McCorry, former assistant professor at King\'s College London, is sure that "credible neutrality" is one of the reasons behind Arbitrum (ARB), Ethereum-based network\'s success. Its team has never launched "official" decentralized applications on Arbitrum (ARB), leaving space for open competition.\n\nIn my opinion as an observer, one of the reasons why Arbitrum has been successful to date is that the ecosystem did not pick a favourite and remained credibly neutral.\n\n\n\nWithout favourites, it allows anyone to feel like they can deploy on the chain and compete as an equal. https://t.co/fcM5IMVQ55 — Patrick McCorry (💙,🧡) (@stonecoldpat0) August 5, 2023\n\nWith no "favorite" applications officially supported by Arbitrum DAO and Offchain Labs, any team can come to the blockchain and start deploying "like an equal."\n\nMcCorry\'s position echoes that of the Arbitrum (ARB) community head, who slammed the L1s and L2s that created their own applications on corresponding blockchain networks:\n\nThe worst thing a chain team can do is start creating their own native dApps or products on top of it. You just end up being in direct competition with teams building on your chain within that vertical\n\nArbitrum (ARB) has never endorsed any applications as its "native": All crucial protocols using it as a technical basis are created by third-party teams.\n\nAs covered by U.Today, there is strong evidence that Arbitrum\'s (ARB) growth is fueled by real usage in DeFi: Airdrop hunters are only responsible for 5-6% of its transactions.\n\nArbitrum vs Optimism rivalry gains traction\n\nBy press time, Arbitrum (ARB) remains the largest Ethereum-based network by TVL: It has accumulated $5.93 billion in liquidity across all of its verified protocols. This is equal to 56.16% of the whole Ethereum L2s ecosystem. Its closest competitor Optimism (OP) is responsible for $2.95 billion, or 27.8% of liquidity.\n\nHowever, in the past week, Optimism (OP) has surpassed its rival in a number of crucial metrics, starting from the number of daily on-chain transactions.\n\nIt was also closer to surpassing Arbitrum (ARB) in the net number of daily active addresses. However, both metrics might only be rallying due to the hype around Worldcoin (WDC), a controversial eye-scanning project by OpenAI\'s Sam Altman.\n\nThat is why analysts are sure that nothing poses a threat to Arbitrum\'s (ARB) dominance in the L2s segment it has kept for a couple of months.'}, {'id': 6, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vYW1iY3J5cHRvLmNvbS9ob3ctY2FyZGFuby1rZWVwcy1kb21pbmF0aW5nLWV0aGVyZXVtLWRlc3BpdGUtcHJpY2UtZGVjbGluZS_SAVZodHRwczovL2FtYmNyeXB0by5jb20vaG93LWNhcmRhbm8ta2VlcHMtZG9taW5hdGluZy1ldGhlcmV1bS1kZXNwaXRlLXByaWNlLWRlY2xpbmUvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Sat, 05 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'How Cardano keeps dominating Ethereum despite price decline - AMBCrypto News', 'content': 'Cardano’s development activity was substantially higher compared to Ethereum.\n\nADA’s price dropped by 6% last week, but there was a possibility of a trend reversal.\n\nCardano [ADA] has outperformed the king of altcoins, Ethereum [ETH], by a huge margin in terms of development activity. In fact, data suggested that ADA’s development activity consistently remained three times higher than Ethereum.\n\nRead Cardano’s [ADA] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nThis metric has been reflected in the blockchain’s efforts to push out new updates over the last few months, the latest being the Mithril mainnet upgrade.\n\nCardano’s development activity remains high\n\nIt was interesting to note that Cardano’s development activity rose substantially over the last month. Its development activity contributor count also remained high.\n\nA major reason for this uptrend can be attributed to the recent Mithril mainnet launch, which aimed to reduce the time required for nodes to sync with the blockchain.\n\nAfter the mainnet update was pushed, Cardano’s multiple teams continued to work on other projects, which were highlighted in the blockchain’s latest edition of its weekly development report.\n\nAs per the report, Mithril mainnet has been consistently producing new certificates and snapshots. The Mithril team also worked on upgrading the Cardano node to v.8.1.2, fixing the release-preprod network that stopped producing certificates.\n\nThis week’s #Cardano development update is live on #EssentialCardano!

The Lace team continued the implementation of Posthog analytics and dedicated efforts to add Trezor support and implement the multi-delegation feature.\n\nThe report also mentioned updated statistics of the Cardano blockchain. The blockchain’s total transactions reached 72.7 million, while its native tokens exceeded 8.6 million.\n\nMoreover, the number of projects building on ADA reached 1,271, while the number of projects launched touched 136.\n\nADA investors aren’t content\n\nWhile development activity remained high, the native token’s price action turned bearish. As per CoinMarketCap, ADA’s price declined by more than 6% over the last week. At press time, it was trading at $0.2915 with a market capitalization of over $10 billion.\n\nThe price drop caused its MVRV Ratio to plummet. Additionally, negative sentiment around Cardano also remained relatively high. However, the whales continued to show interest in ADA, as evident from its high whale transaction count.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Cardano Profit Calculator\n\nThe good news was that the bearish price trend might come to an end in the coming days. This possibility was pointed out by Coinglass.

The applications currently stand at 12, with the latest addition coming from ProShares, a popular fund manager.\n\nThe platform filed four applications for Ether-based ETFs, including a dual Ether and Bitcoin futures strategy ETF, an Ether Strategy ETF, and a short Ether Strategy ETF.\n\nWill The SEC Approve An Ethereum Futures ETF?\n\nThe recent surge in applications started on the 28th of July this year after Volatility Shares filed its application. Ever since, other asset management companies, including ProShares, Roundhill Financial, Bitwise, Van Eck, and Grayscale Investment, have filled submissions, with some bringing multiple applications.\n\nThe most recent application, filed on August 3 by ProShares, proposes an equal-weight Bitcoin and Ether ETF to measure the performance of holding long positions in the nearest maturing monthly Ether and Bitcoin contracts.\n\nAccording to renowned Financial Expert at Bloomberg Intelligence, James Seyffart, ProShare filed four separate applications with the SEC. Bitwise also submitted three applications, while Grayscale Investments filed two applications.\n\nHowever, despite the growing optimism, it remains to be seen if the Securities and Exchange Commission will approve these filings. The SEC has never approved an ETF that tracks Ether Futures contracts, unlike Bitcoin Futures ETFs that have been around since October 2021.\n\nMany market experts have argued that these applications are a mere gamble by these asset management companies, who do not want to miss out on being the first Ethereum ETF in the United States.\n\nETH price holds steady above $1,830 amid ETF race | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nThe likelihood of receiving the SEC’s approval remains slim as the regulatory body has never approved an Ethereum futures ETF filing. Add to the mix the consistent refusal of SEC’s Chair, Gary Gensler, consistent refusal to answer if the agency considers ETH a security. This has further compounded regulatory uncertainty around the network.\n\nIf none of the applications before the SEC get denied, the Ether ETFs will launch 75 days from their respective filing dates. Analysts expect the Volatility Shares ETF to lead the charge on 12th October.\n\nUnderstanding The Difference Between Futures And Spot ETF Products\n\nThe primary difference between futures and spot ETF products lies in the fact that while the former tracks the price of futures contracts, the latter requires the issuers to purchase the underlying assets. Spot ETFs are generally considered more valid since they require the fund manager to purchase and hold underlying assets.\n\nThe current spike in Ether-based applications comes amidst a wave of filings from leading asset management companies, including BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, among others. These companies are looking to offer the first spot in Bitcoin ETF in the US.\n\nInvestors and members of the crypto community remain expectant of the outcome of the SEC’s consideration of the applications lying before it. Whatever decision the agency takes is likely to affect the attractiveness and accessibility of crypto investments, especially for larger institutional investors.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

Other applicants include ProShares, VanEck, Grayscale, and Bitwise.\n\nThe introduction of the Bitcoin and Ether ETF ahead of schedule is an exciting development for the market as the cryptocurrency sector develops.\n\nThe year’s ETF trend reflects the rising popularity of cryptocurrency and other digital assets. The growth seen by cryptocurrencies in 2023 is reflected in the fact that all the top 10 ETFs for the year are focused on them. This congruence further demonstrates the promise of ETFs in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nBlackRock, ARK Invest, Fidelity Investments, WisdomTree, VanEck and Invesco are currently applying for a spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"}, {'id': 12, 'url': 'https://news.google.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?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Sun, 06 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Cryptocurrency Price Today: Bitcoin Remains Above $29,000 Mark As ApeCoin Becomes Top Gainer - ABP Live', 'content': 'Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) — two of the most valued crypto coins — managed to remain above the $29,000 and $18,000 marks, respectively, on early Sunday morning.

Discover SCENE\n\nA series of transactions on the NFT marketplace Blur has captivated Crypto Twitter and sparked questions of legality after a prolific trader going by the name of Hanwe Chang duped a competitor into buying certain Azuki NFTs at an inflated price.\n\n“[I] noticed that someone\'s bot was copying my bids on Blur, so I decided to trick him,” Chang said on Twitter, adding he had made a profit of 800 Ethereum with the strategy, netting close to $1.5 million.\n\nA relative newcomer compared to NFT marketplaces like OpenSea and SuperRare, Blur surged ahead in terms of trading volume earlier this year due to gamified incentives that reward users with tokens based on trade-related activity.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis includes rewards for users that bid on NFTs by trait, a practice in which Chang has become established, according to Blur’s leaderboards. Profile picture NFTs, including those from Azuki, often have unique qualities that can impact their value based on rarity, like eye color or clothing.\n\nOn Saturday, 12 Azuki NFTs that shared the specific background color “Off White A” sold simultaneously for 50 Ethereum worth $91,500 each. The previous Azuki NFT with an “Off White A” background had sold for less than 5 Ethereum or around $9,000—making it a massive, eye-catching markup.\n\nThe 12 NFTs appear to have been gathered by Chang in a digital wallet. A large chunk of the trades’ profits was then sent to a wallet labeled as “hanwe.eth” using the Ethereum Name Service after they had been completed, according to Ethercan.\n\nKnowing there were bots out there copying his trait bids, Chang likely duped an unsuspecting trader into buying the Azuki NFTs at an elevated price by placing a bid on his own NFTs, an account that goes by A Raving Ape theorized on Twitter.\n\nContext on how @HanweChang executed a plan to perfection and made 800e by selling "Off White A - Background color" azuki at 50e each and azuki elementals at 15e each.

But it seems not everyone involved was entertained.\n\nThe bot’s apparent owner, “elizab.eth,” stepped forward on Twitter to claim the “funds were stolen form [their] bot.” The trader wanted to discuss the possibility of bounty and said Chang could keep 10% of the funds if they agreed to return the rest.\n\nThe pseudonymous NFT influencer Dave III said Chang’s statement wasn’t very wise and warned others not to “brag about committing fraud,” calling his trick “illegal market activity.”\n\nThese 2 crypto twitter posts will go down as the dumbest of all time. #1: Hanwe admits to ‘Bid Spoofing’ or ‘Shill Bidding’ — an illegal market activity of Fraud or Wire Fraud #2: Avi admits to Market Manipulation.

Backed by a strong team of developers, software engineers, and researchers, it constantly upgrades over time. But, have you ever wondered who is deciding and implementing these upgrades?\n\nA decision or a proposal to make a change to the network has to be agreed upon by the entire development community of Ethereum. Only then, they can put it into action. The Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) concept was introduced to make this process smooth. Let us help you understand everything about Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) in this article.\n\nWhat are Ethereum Improvement proposals (EIPs)?\n\nEthereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) are standard potential changes, new features, or processes that improve the Ethereum ecosystem as a whole.\n\nThey were first introduced in October 2015 following the footsteps of the Bitcoin Improvement Protocols (BIPs) process, which itself followed Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs). EIPs have all the information of an upgrade and act as a “source of truth” to the community.\n\nDecentralization is the core feature of Ethereum and hence anyone can suggest a change to the network. But, you must follow the guidelines included in EIP-1 to suggest a proposal. Till now, most of the EIP authors are application developers or protocol developers. And, EIP editors like Gavin Wood and Vitalik Buterin, review them, correct them, and format issues.\n\nSignificance of Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs)\n\nWhether it’s the transition of Ethereum from a PoW network to a PoS network or the creation of non-fungible tokens, everything started with an EIP. They play a key role in every upgrade happening around the Ethereum network.\n\nSome of the top Ethereum Improvement Proposals that were already implemented are EIP-1559 (fee market change), EIP-20 (ERC-20 token standard), and EIP-721 (ERC-721 standard). The historical “The Merge” event was proposed by the EIP-3675. Similar to these, every upgrade happening on the network consists of a set of EIPs.\n\nEIPs allow the network to change, improve, and adapt to the increase in its usage. This makes Ethereum flexible and constantly updates to changes in the industry and meets changing demands of the users. By going through the review process by the whole community, EIPs make sure that these decisions are inclusive and accurate.\n\nTypes of Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs)\n\nThere are 3 types of EIPs which we are going to discuss here.\n\nStandards Track EIP\n\nThe Standards Track EIPs change almost all of the Ethereum implementations. These proposals make changes directly to the Ethereum network protocol. They include changes in block or transaction validity rules, changes that affect the interoperability of Ethereum dApps, etc.\n\nStandards Track EIPs have 3 parts of implementation – a design document, an implementation, and an update to formal specification. Furthermore, we can categorize these EIPs into Core, Networking, Interface, and ERC proposals.\n\nMeta EIP\n\nUnlike Standards Track EIPs, Meta EIPs do not make direct changes to the Ethereum network protocol. These are more like procedures, guidelines, or changes in the decision-making process. We can also call them Process EIPs and these changes require community consensus as they are more than just recommendations.\n\nInformation EIP\n\nThese EIPs neither make changes to the network protocol nor require community consensus. These proposals suggest general guidelines or information to the Ethereum community. Members of the community and implementers can ignore informational EIPs or follow their advice based on their choice.\n\nHow are EIPs Processed?\n\nSimilar to how a law must pass some stages to be finally implemented, an EIP must also go through some stages. Every EIP must pass through the following steps.\n\nDraft – In this phase, the EIP is still in the hands of the author. Once it follows all the guidelines of proposing an EIP like having no errors, proper format, and making technical sense, it can now be submitted to the Ethereum repository on GitHub for review.\n\nIn this phase, the EIP is still in the hands of the author. Once it follows all the guidelines of proposing an EIP like having no errors, proper format, and making technical sense, it can now be submitted to the Ethereum repository on GitHub for review. Review – After being checked officially by an editor, the author can publish the EIP on GitHub. The next step is to mark the EIP as suitable for peer review. After passing through the early stages of review, the proposal needs a review by a wider public.\n\nAfter being checked officially by an editor, the author can publish the EIP on GitHub. The next step is to mark the EIP as suitable for peer review. After passing through the early stages of review, the proposal needs a review by a wider public. Last Call – Any EIP must at least be in the review stage for a minimum of 2 weeks so that the community has enough time to read, review, and suggest changes. In this stage, the proposals can be sent back and forth for changes by the author. If the EIP remains in this phase for more than 6 months, it will move to “stagnant.”\n\nAny EIP must at least be in the review stage for a minimum of 2 weeks so that the community has enough time to read, review, and suggest changes. In this stage, the proposals can be sent back and forth for changes by the author. If the EIP remains in this phase for more than 6 months, it will move to “stagnant.” Final stage – When the EIP clears all the stages of review, non-core EIPs reach the final standard. But, core EIPs need to go through another phase. The core development team will implement the approved proposal into the software to enable it.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum Improvement proposals (EIPs) are an important part of Ethereum’s development over the years. The network is still under various upgrades to improve the overall scalability. All of these upgrades started with EIPs and are now making huge changes to the network. Overall, EIPs bring flexibility and adaptability to Ethereum which are essential to increase its adoption.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat is the most popular EIP?\n\nEIP-20, EIP-721, EIP-137, and EIP-1559 are popular EIPs. However, many EIPs exist today that are included in the upgrades of Ethereum.\n\nWhat is the purpose of EIPs?\n\nEthereum Improvement Proposals make changes to the network to make Ethereum better. They make the network flexible, efficient, and adaptable to the changing needs of users.\n\nWhat is the difference between EIP and ERC?'}]. Analyze the news and estimate the market trend accordingly.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

This incident, which transpired on July 26, has captivated the cryptocurrency community, prompting many to ponder the rationale behind this significant burn.\n\nThe occurrence came to light on August 6 when “degeneratewisdom”, a blockchain analyst, tweeted the query: “Can anyone on here explain this tx to me Looks like nd4.eth sent 2500 ETH to a dead address. Doesn’t look like a noob error either. Thoughts?”\n\nThis tweet thrust nd4.eth’s substantial 2500 ETH transfer to an inactive address into the spotlight, prompting speculation within the crypto community about the underlying intention behind this deliberate and seemingly calculated move.\n\nThe concept of “burning” tokens entails sending tokens to an address where they are rendered permanently unspendable, thereby diminishing the overall supply of the specific cryptocurrency. However, the reasoning behind nd4.eth’s decision to annihilate such a sizable sum of Ethereum remains veiled in obscurity.\n\nLaurence Day, the innovator behind the Wildcat Protocol, infused an element of humour into the situation, tweeting, “If you didn’t arise this morning and express gratitude to nd4.eth for contributing to the ultrasound money narrative, I urge you to engage in profound introspection regarding your objectives.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDelving deeper into the incident, analysts from the on-chain analysis company Lookonchain disclosed additional particulars about the persona behind nd4.eth.\n\n“The guy who transferred 2,500 $ETH($4.58M) to a dead address on July 26th is a whale with 34,287 $GMX($1.84M) and 311,003 $GNS($1.43M). He spent 5,330 $DAI to buy $GMX and $GNS on July 29 and also transferred 34.9 $GMX ($1,989) and 600 $GNX ($2,733) to the dead address,” Lookonchain wrote on Monday.\n\nWhile the exact motives of the address owner are still unknown, accidentally sending crypto or NFTs to a burn address has occurred before, albeit occasionally. Last March, an NFT collector called Brandon Riley accidentally sent his CryptoPunk #685, purchased for 77 ETH ($129,437), to a burn address while attempting to wrap it for trading on NFTfi. The irreversible error wiped out a third of Riley’s net worth. Although unrecoverable, Riley’s CryptoPunk was “resurrected” as a Bitcoin ordinal on the blockchain.\n\nLast September, cryptocurrency exchange Kucoin accidentally sent a substantial amount of Ethereum (ETH), valued at tens of millions of dollars, to the Ethereum burn address. This unexpected move, spanning over three days and involving more than 3,500 USDT and ETH transactions, left the cryptocurrency community puzzled with the exact motive behind this burn remaining unknown.'}].

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

Around 6.5 million ETH coins have been issued since the merge, and over 3.5 million of them have been burned.\n\nEthereum currently has a supply of about 120.2 million coins. And since the model is still inflationary, more coins are added every year. As of now, the network adds about 580,000 ETH each year. However, the Ethereum network burns about 1.75 million ETH each year, lowering the supply by roughly 0.98%. This makes the platform somewhat deflationary because the circulating ETH amount reduces as coins get actively burned on the network.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum: These ETH Futures ETFs Are Awaiting Approval\n\nPresently, gas fees generated by ETH transfers and smart contract operations are the main drivers of these burns. Additionally, NFT and DeFi platforms like OpenSea and UniSwap, also play a role. Additionally, the transfer of USDT, an ERC-20 token on the ETH network, also adds to ETH burns.\n\nWill Ethereum prices react to the burns?\n\nSource: Forbes\n\nSo far, ETH’s prices have not heavily responded to the burns. This could be because of less demand as of now. Burns without demand will do little to push the asset’s price. However, the project’s end goal is for the burn rate to outpace the rate of issuing new coins. This would effectively turn Ethereum (ETH) deflationary.\n\nAlso Read: How To Check An Ethereum Transaction?\n\nMoreover, many argue that ETH has become more deflationary than Bitcoin (BTC) after the implementation of the EIP-1559 protocol. This protocol is responsible for burning a fraction of the gas fee from each transaction. However, ETH does not have a fixed cap on its supply, unlike BTC which is capped at 21 million coins. Therefore, ETH’s burn rate will have to outpace its issuance in order for it to be truly considered a deflationary asset.

This price correction emerged as the initial enthusiasm within the crypto market, fueled by a bullish streak in June primarily driven by institutional investors, gradually subsided.\n\nEven though Lido’s TVL experienced a decline from its impressive $15 billion benchmark, it retains its position as the foremost DeFi protocol. Notably, Lido continues to command a substantial 36% share of the aggregate TVL encompassing all DeFi projects.\n\nPredicts staked Ether to grow beyond 8M\n\nThe DeFi protocol predicted that the total number of staked Ethereum via its platform will surpass eight million in August, as it has consistently experienced large monthly net inflows despite the activation of withdrawals.\n\nDeFillama data shows that this prediction has come to pass with the total value of assets locked on Lido in terms of Ethereum currently at 8.08 million ETH, an all-time high.

Consequently, the overall share held within the liquidity pools also underwent a substantial contraction, plummeting by 53.07%.\n\nOther metrics\n\nLido’s increasing adoption has also translated into the growing adoption of its staked ETH.

On this digital stage, an alarming manifestation of crime thrives, the titanic scale of which was recently unveiled by insightful researchers.\n\nThe proliferating shadow of cybercrime on Ethereum\n\nThe spectre of cybercrime is spreading in the shadow of the Ethereum network. While bitcoin remains the undisputed behemoth of the cryptosphere, Ethereum stands out for the complexity of its fraudulent activities, according to researchers.\n\nIts ability to host smart contracts offers a wider range of digital crimes. This characteristic transforms Ethereum into a veritable cybercrime empire.\n\nAccording to information extracted from blockchain explorers such as Etherscan, an alarming number of over 5,600 Ethereum addresses have been identified as being linked to cybercrime activities.\n\nWhat’s more, these findings find a powerful echo in the rigorous analyses carried out by Whale Alert’s ScamAlert. Together, these data reveal the frightening extent of cybercrime in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nThese tagged addresses traced over 1.78 million transactions from unsuspecting victims, totaling a staggering $1.65 billion in stolen funds. This figure is almost 16 times greater than self-reported losses to the FTC, revealing the severe extent to which crypto cybercrime is under-reported by regulators.\n\nThe many faces of cybercrime on Ethereum\n\nOn the throne of Ethereum crime, Ponzi schemes reign supreme. They account for 60% of stolen funds, far surpassing the scale of traditional financial Ponzi schemes. Fraudulent donations follow at 18%, followed by mining (13%) and hacking (5%).\n\nThe pseudonymity offered by blockchain has given Ponzi scams a mask of anonymity. This makes them harder to detect and crack down on.\n\nWhat’s more, the global reach of cryptocurrencies has widened the scope of these scams. As a result, crypto-Ponzi scams have become a ubiquitous and worrying threat to investors worldwide.\n\nBut the evil doesn’t stop there. New cybercrimes are emerging, specific to the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Rug pulls”, for example, lure investors into new projects only to abandon them abruptly, draining all liquidity. Phony token scams create worthless imitations of real coins to fool traders.\n\nRepercussions and the need for a shift in direction\n\nBeyond simple quantification, the researchers analyzed the impact of cybercrime on investor behavior.\n\nIn the short term, victims obtain higher returns by taking greater risks.

However, the hope remains it could hit the high price level of $5,000 sometime in the future.\n\nAs it happens, Ethereum managed to get close to this mark on November 9, 2021, when it reached its all-time high (ATH) of $4,815.01, climbing by 168.25% from the $1,794.97 where it stood on July 21, 2021, which is close to its price at present and suggests a very real possibility of repeating this success.\n\nWith this in mind, Finbold has analyzed the main factors that could (but do not necessarily have to) lead Ethereum closer to the $5,000 price level and eventually overtake it – either by themselves or together with other influences.\n\nMass adoption of Ethereum-based applications\n\nWith Ethereum being the most popular blockchain choice to build a wide range of decentralized applications (dApps) on, such as in the sector of decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and gaming, it could help its cryptocurrency grow further in price, thanks to the growing demand.\n\nFor instance, one of the major companies building on the Ethereum blockchain is PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL), which has recently announced the launch of its own ERC-20 United States dollar-pegged stablecoin PayPal USD (PYUSD), issued by crypto firm Paxos Trust Company, as Finbold reported on August 7.\n\nImproved scalability\n\nWith the launch of the better-performing, more accessible ‘Ethereum 2.0,’ the network has improved its scalability, helping it handle more transactions per second and making it more attractive to users and developers. If this trend continues, it could lead to growing demand for Ethereum and its higher price.\n\nIndeed, the Ethereum development team has been working hard on boosting the network’s usability, the work that also brought a shift from the proof-of-work (PoW) to the proof-of-stake (PoS) model with an aim to reduce energy waste and transaction times, as well as improve scalability.\n\nInstitutional adoption\n\nOn top of that, more institutional investors recognizing Ethereum’s potential and buying more ETH could drive the price higher simply by following the rules of supply and demand – the more desirable an asset is, the higher its price, and institutions can have the power to contribute in shaping market trends.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum’s advance could also happen under the influence of the Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) and X (formerly Twitter) CEO, Elon Musk, supporting the bold prediction on the future of the crypto market that could see both Ethereum and Bitcoin (BTC) surge massively.\n\nRegulatory environment\n\nAmid increased regulatory pressure, particularly in the US, which has culminated in multiple lawsuits against some of the industry’s largest representatives, the cryptocurrency market as a whole can feel its effects, which is why positive regulatory developments and favorable regulations for digital assets could help drive their prices, including Ethereum.\n\nOne example of such positive developments is the refusal of the British financial services minister, Andrew Griffith, to agree with the Treasury Committee’s recommendation to regulate retail trading and investing in unbacked crypto assets as gambling in late July and his support of their treatment as other financial services.\n\nMarket sentiment\n\nFinally, the atmosphere in the wider crypto and macroeconomic landscape can often influence the price of particular assets, including cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, for instance, with positive (or negative) developments and news coverage about the industry.\n\nIndeed, the above factors could contribute to the bullish sentiment, and when people are feeling bullish about digital assets in general, they are more likely to invest in them, and the positive sentiment could affect the price of ETH, which is more likely to increase.\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum was at press time changing hands at the price of $1,828.2, the same as the day before, in addition to losing 0.29% in the last week and declining 2.05% on its monthly chart, as per the latest information retrieved on August 8.\n\nEthereum 7-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nIn conclusion, time will tell if the above factors are truly powerful enough to push the price of Ethereum toward $5,000. But one thing is for certain – they could, indeed, contribute to its strengthening and, in time, possibly reaching this coveted price level.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

It’s built on Ethereum and “designed for digital payments and Web3,” with the firm saying it will soon be available to United States customers.\n\nThe launch has been seen as a boon for Ethereum adoption.

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
Based on the news articles provided, here is an analysis of the current market trend for Ethereum (ETH) cryptocurrency:

1. Ethereum Is Turning Deflationary, But Price Remains Stagnant:
   - The Ethereum network has burned over half the coins issued since the merge, making it somewhat deflationary.
   - Despite the burns, ETH prices have not heavily responded, possibly due to less demand at the moment.
   - The end goal is for the burn rate to outpace the rate of issuing new coins to make Ethereum truly deflationary.

2. Lido adoption surges with 10,000 new stakers despite Ethereum's price struggles:
   - Lido's TVL briefly exceeded $15 billion but fell below due to Ethereum's price struggles.
   - The total number of staked Ethereum via Lido is predicted to surpass eight million in August.
   - Despite challenges like the Curve Finance exploit, Lido's adoption continues to grow.

3. Crypto: Ethereum, the empire of cybercrime:
   - Ethereum is seen as an empire of cybercrime due to the complexity of fraudulent activities on the network.
   - Over 5,600 Ethereum addresses have been linked to cybercrime activities, involving significant amounts of stolen funds.
   - Ponzi

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by both the on-chain analyst report and the news analyst report, it is clear that the overall market trend for Ethereum (ETH) is bullish. The on-chain data indicates strong buying pressure with stable open prices, increasing number of transactions, unique addresses, and value transferred. Additionally, the technical indicators all suggest a "buy" sentiment, further supporting the bullish trend.

Despite the deflationary nature of Ethereum due to coin burns and challenges in price response, the overall adoption of Ethereum through platforms like Lido continues to grow. While there are concerns about cybercrime activities on the network, the market trend remains positive.

Given the bullish market trend, I am confident in the upward movement of ETH prices. Therefore, I recommend buying more ETH to maximize profit potential.

It is one of the selling points of the world’s second most-used cryptocurrency. However, PayPal Holdings, Inc.’s (PYPL) announcment on Monday that it would be introducing its own U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, PayPal USD (PYUSD), could spark some serious debate.\n\nPYUSD is an Ethereum-based stablecoin, which would, after introduction, be pegged to the value of the U.S. dollar. It has been designed for digital payments and the web, and will soon be available for U.S. customers. But even as this is bound to push Ethereum stocks up by establishing its place as the money layer on the Internet, it will also hit the crypto coin’s core value of decentralizing.\n\nCentralization issues are the most common attack areas within the gamut of decentralized finance or DeFi, one of the crypto world’s main differentiating features. In 2021 alone, DeFi hacks amounted to no less than $10 billion, revealing patterns of how the transactions are classified and tracked. Now, with around 430 million accounts actively using PayPal, the chances of cluster attacks would go up.\n\nMany smart contract auditors have highlighted that the PYUSD algo contains “freezefunds” and “wipefrozenfunds” functions, which are textbook examples of centralization attack vectors. Concerns have also been raised about the digital contract that users would sign, and that these contracts resemble censorship-enabled central bank digital currency.\n\nDespite this, Ethereum would get a massive boost once the project goes live. It would finally give Ethereum the mainstream push that it has been seeking all these years in its competition with Bitcoin (BTC). Coupled with the Shanghai Upgrade, under which it shifted its blockchain validation system from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, this might be ETH’s year.\n\nPowered by these developments and what has largely been hailed as a crypto rebound, the price of Ethereum has soared 53.9% this year as of Aug 8. So, with Ethereum getting this push, it might be prudent to keep a watch on stocks exposed to this open-source blockchain platform, decentralized or not.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccenture plc ACN is a global system integrator that provides consulting, technology and other services, and markets Ethereum-based blockchain solutions to businesses to make it easier to process payments.\n\nAccenture’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 8.2%.

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
Based on the news articles provided, it is evident that Ethereum (ETH) is gaining significant traction and attention in the cryptocurrency market. The migration of the Y00ts NFT Collection to Ethereum after accepting a $3M grant from Polygon indicates a growing interest in Ethereum-based projects and platforms.

Furthermore, the announcement by PayPal Holdings, Inc. to introduce its own U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, PayPal USD (PYUSD), which is based on Ethereum, is another positive development for the Ethereum ecosystem. Despite concerns about centralization issues, this move is likely to boost Ethereum's mainstream adoption and position it as a key player in the digital payments space.

The positive sentiment surrounding Ethereum is also reflected in the price performance of the cryptocurrency, which has soared 53.9% this year. This, coupled with the shift to proof-of-stake validation system through the Shanghai Upgrade, indicates a strong potential for Ethereum's growth and market dominance.

As an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst, it is recommended to closely monitor the developments in the Ethereum ecosystem, particularly projects migrating to Ethereum and partnerships with major companies like PayPal. The market trend for Ethereum appears to be bullish, with potential for further growth and adoption in the near future.

You are an experienced ETH cryptocurrency trader and you are trying to maximize your overall profit by trading ETH. In each day, you will make an action to buy or sell ETH. You will start with 1 million dollars, half in cash and half in ETH. You are assisted by a few analysts below and need to decide the final action.

ON-CHAIN ANALYST REPORT: Based on the recent information provided, it appears that the Ethereum (ETH) market trend is bullish. The open prices have been relatively stable and there has been a consistent increase in the number of transactions, unique addresses, and value transferred. The average gas price has also been fluctuating but overall remains at a relatively high level.

The technical indicators such as the short-long moving average signal, MACD signal, and Bollinger Bands signal all suggest a buy sentiment. Additionally, the majority of transactions have been successful, indicating a strong level of activity and interest in the market.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by the on-chain and news analysts, it is clear that the Ethereum (ETH) market trend is currently bullish. The on-chain data indicates a positive momentum with stable open prices, increasing number of transactions, unique addresses, and value transferred. Technical indicators also suggest a buy sentiment, further supported by the positive news surrounding Ethereum's growing traction in the market.

The migration of the Y00ts NFT Collection to Ethereum, the introduction of PayPal USD stablecoin based on Ethereum, and the overall price performance of ETH this year all point towards a strong potential for growth and adoption in the near future. The market sentiment is positive, and there is a clear indication of further upward movement in the Ethereum market.

Given the bullish trend, I recommend buying more ETH to maximize profit. My action would be to buy ETH with 70% cash, indicating a high level of confidence in the upward trend of the market.

According to data from Glassnode, this metric which counts only externally owned addresses just reached an all-time high of 104,127,318. But what does this mean for the price of Ethereum?\n\nEthereum Non-Zero Addresses Reach New All-Time High\n\nMore addresses mean more people are using the network and Ethereum is in the driver’s seat when it comes to most application aspects of the crypto industry. As a result, the Ethereum blockchain has seen the highest growth rate in new addresses in recent years.\n\nThis growth has been particularly high as more people flock to decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), the majority of which are built on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nAs of the time of writing, there are now 104,127,318 Ethereum addresses holding at least one wei, the smallest unit of ETH. Just around two years ago in 2021, this metric was around 50 million addresses, showing a 100% jump during this time.\n\nAlthough only a fraction of these wallets are active, the high number of non-zero addresses shows the sheer increase in ETH adoption. In the same vein, the number of non-zero Bitcoin addresses only recently reached an all-time high of 47.8 million addresses.\n\nMore Addresses Means Increased Network Activity and Adoption\n\nThe growing interest in trading, smart contracts, DeFi, and NFTs will continue to boost the number of Ethereum users and non-zero addresses, especially now that the industry sits on the cusp of a possible bull run.\n\nETH bulls continue to hold above $1,800 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nAccording to a similar metric by Glassnode Alerts, the amount of Ethereum supply last active within a seven to 10-year timeframe also just reached n new all-time high of 4.312 million ETH. This extended state of inactivity is suggestive of HODLing and long-term faith on the part of investors.\n\nBullish For The Price Of ETH\n\nIn the past, major rallies in Ether’s price have coincided with a surge in new addresses on the network. During the 2021 bull run, Ethereum saw a flurry of new addresses and non-zero addresses, as its price reached an all-time high of $4,810.\n\nAs mainstream interest and adoption of Ethereum grow, the value and price of Ether (ETH) are likely to increase. Non-zero addresses mean activity on many addresses is increasing, which can create buy pressure in addition to other factors that should push ETH’s price higher.\n\nAdditionally, investment companies are looking to launch exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tied to Ethereum futures, which could propel a spike in ETH’s price.\n\nRight now, ETH is currently trading at $1,852 and is looking to break above the resistance being mounted at $2,000 by the bears.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

However, this move also raises concerns about centralization and the potential loss of control over personal assets.\n\nAt the same time, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission has recently witnessed a surge in applications for Ether (ETH) ETFs, which mirrors a trend of major asset management firms seeking to establish spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs.\n\nETH’s drop in DApp deposits and active users is concerning\n\nThe Ethereum network is having problems because of high gas fees, which are the costs for transactions, including those done with smart contracts. For the past two months, the average transaction fee has been more than $4, which limited the demand for its decentralized apps (DApps).\n\nEthereum network applications' total deposits in ETH. Source: DefiLlama\n\nThere has been a noticeable decline in the total value locked (TVL) of deposits on the Ethereum network. This decrease marked the lowest TVL level observed over the past three years, as reported by DefiLlama.\n\nWhile there may have been some shifts in this trend over the past week, the current scenario still reflects a substantial reduction in Ether deposits, specifically around 12.9 million, in contrast to the 14.75 million recorded three months ago.\n\nTo ascertain whether the decline in Ethereum’s TVL correlates with a decline in its user base, investors should monitor the utilization of DApps. It’s important to note that certain DApps, such as gaming platforms and marketplaces, do not require substantial deposits.\n\nEthereum's 30-day DApp activity. Source: DappRadar\n\nThe number of active addresses using DApps is down, which is concerning. In the last 30 days, the main DApps on Ethereum had 25% fewer active users. This might reflect that investors aren’t satisfied with how much it costs to transact on the network.\n\nExamining Ether derivatives can help to figure out whether the $1,800 level could actually prove a reliable support level based on how ETH investors are positioned.\n\nDerivatives metrics show balanced demand between bulls and bears\n\nEther quarterly futures are popular among whales and arbitrage desks. However, these fixed-month contracts typically trade at a slight premium to spot markets, indicating that sellers are asking for more money to delay settlement. As a result, ETH futures contracts in healthy markets should trade at a 5 to 10% annualized premium — a situation known as contango, which is not unique to crypto markets.\n\nEther 3-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nAs per the futures premium, also referred to as the basis indicator, professional traders in the Ether market have remained unable to adopt a bullish stance since July 16. The current level of 5% hovers on the brink of a neutral-to-bearish threshold, indicating a state of equilibrium in demand between leveraged long and short positions.\n\nRelated: NFT project y00ts to return $3M grant as it ditches Polygon for Ethereum\n\nThe unveiling of Coinbase's Base network on Aug. 9 could contribute to Ether’s challenge of surpassing the $1,900 mark. Several development teams within the ecosystem have announced their offerings for the Base network, which presently incorporates a version of the decentralized exchange Uniswap.\n\nWhile Ether’s bullish prospects are fueled by the potential approval of an ETF and the substantial user base facilitated by PayPal’s stablecoin, the network finds itself confronted by competition from existing smart contract platforms and challengers with ample resources. Such a scenario introduces an element of uncertainty surrounding the resilience of the $1,800 support level.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

Charge it, please! Visa proposes to let you pay with card - Blockworks', 'content': 'Visa has wrapped up testing a way for users to pay on-chain gas fees directly in fiat with a credit or debit card, the payments giant said on Thursday.\n\nThe experiment, which was conducted on the Ethereum Goerli testnet, uses a paymaster contract to sponsor gas fees on behalf of users, according to a statement.\n\nIt means users can send blockchain transactions without having to worry about maintaining a balance of ether. Visa believes the contract could make transactions more accessible to a wider range of users.\n\n“Our experiment aims to offer a promising approach to substantially addressing the challenges of blockchain-based transactions,” Visa’s technical team wrote. “By leveraging the innovative concept of a paymaster, in conjunction with account abstraction and the ERC-4337 standard, we explored the potential for a process that could redefine blockchain-based transactions.”\n\nA paymaster contract is a specialized type of smart contract within the blockchain ecosystem, designed to manage the payment of gas fees.\n\nThe company said merchants or decentralized applications (dapps) could run their own paymaster solution, or existing wallet and paymaster service providers could offer a card-based gas fee payment choice alongside their other paymaster offerings.\n\nThe experiment is part of Visa’s ongoing development within the industry. The company has been working on ways to make blockchain payments more user-friendly and accessible.\n\nVisa reportedly began experimenting with converting digital assets into fiat payments on the Ethereum blockchain earlier this year. The aim is to parallel its current foreign currency exchange processes, as part of its broader push to build proficiency in global settlements involving both digital and traditional currencies.\n\nIn the context of transactions on blockchains like Ethereum, every operation conducted incurs a cost known as a “gas” fee, representing the computational effort required to execute the operation. Gas fees help keep the Ethereum network secure by making it costly for bad actors to spam the network.\n\nSince inception, network fees have been a fundamental part of ensuring security and encouraging adoption within first-generation blockchain systems. Though, following ten years of user growth, the hope is the trajectory of Web3 will move towards a “gasless” future.\n\nDon’t miss the next big story – join our free daily newsletter.'}, {'id': 30, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvYmFua2luZy9maW5hbmNlL2FuYWx5c3RzLWJ1bGxpc2gtb24tZXRoZXJldW0tZXRmcy1idXQtaG93LWlzLWV0aC1wZXJmb3JtaW5nLXBvbWVyZG9nZS1wcmVkaWN0ZWQtdG8tMjAwMC1pbi0yMDIzL2FydGljbGVzaG93LzEwMjY1NDgxNS5jbXPSAbIBaHR0cHM6Ly9tLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuY29tL2luZHVzdHJ5L2JhbmtpbmcvZmluYW5jZS9hbmFseXN0cy1idWxsaXNoLW9uLWV0aGVyZXVtLWV0ZnMtYnV0LWhvdy1pcy1ldGgtcGVyZm9ybWluZy1wb21lcmRvZ2UtcHJlZGljdGVkLXRvLTIwMDAtaW4tMjAyMy9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvMTAyNjU0ODE1LmNtcw?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Fri, 11 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Analysts Bullish on Ethereum ETFs, but How Is ETH Performing?

The biggest liquid staking protocol on Ethereum currently has a limited node operator set of 29 operators. It must then be a no-brainer that they hold a hegemony over the network. Any protocol claiming to be decentralized but running its operations as a business is also able to offer much higher standards of composability. While this composability that is offered to users is a feature, it can be counter-productive as well — primarily because of the systemic risks this can cause.\n\nOn the flip side, decentralized protocols do exist, but they are highly unscalable. And thus, they have a fraction of ETH staked in them compared to what is often staked via the centralized ones.\n\nWhile decentralized protocols have attempted to reduce the minimum capital required to run a validator node from 32 to 8 ETH, that is still a sizeable amount for the wider ecosystem. Admittedly, this does open up opportunities for a wide number of stakers to start staking on the network, however, we contend that 8 ETH is still a sizeable amount. This reintroduces the problem of scalability, and thus a significant portion of ETH gets staked through a select group of professional node operators. This leads to the further concentration of staked ETH. The presence of these centralized node operators across different liquid staking protocols undermines the censorship resistance of the underlying network.\n\nThe inflow of ETH post-Shapella is a good indicator of users’ liquid staking preferences. One would hope that a lot of the incoming ETH would go to decentralized liquid staking; however, the figures state otherwise.\n\nMaking Ethereum liquid staking scalable\n\nOne of the biggest challenges for the existing liquid staking protocols today is that they are tuned for either scalability alone or decentralization alone. The ones that are tuned for scalability alone are not decentralized, and the ones that are tuned for decentralization are not scalable. There are several examples of this — from protocols having a concentrated node operator set to those having high minimum capital requirements to run validator nodes for Ethereum.\n\nWhile there have been attempts by these protocols to move towards either making their architectures scalable or decentralized, making that is quite difficult given the huge amounts of ETH that are already staked via them. Moreover, these protocol-level changes require a lot of internal deliberations (at-least for decentralized protocols) before they are rolled out.\n\nMoreover, a core objective of any business is to make sure that they hold the hegemony over the industry to persistently retain that. This is reflected by the feigned attempts at a willingness to decentralize — but then having them falling on their head. Perhaps, there is no reason why this would happen. A centralized liquid staking protocol often operates as a business whose core objective is to compromise decentralization to achieve profitability. While I do not condemn the latter, I do feel that it comes — almost always — at the cost of decentralization.\n\nWhat Ethereum needs\n\nEthereum prophets often call for the need to diversify staking across a multitude of protocols. And perhaps, it wouldn’t be remiss to credit those protocols that have emerged that are attempting to realize that vision. However, I must provide a caveat that any emerging protocols need strategic and critical analysis. No one would want shabby architecture being polished and presented as a resilient solution and risking the stability of Ethereum. I believe that there are two things that need immediate attention to drive growth to Ethereum liquid staking:\n\nReducing the minimum capital requirements to run a validator node: This is perhaps easier stated than executed. Reducing the minimum capital requirements incentivizes a wider spectrum of users to participate in network validation.\n\nThis is perhaps easier stated than executed. Reducing the minimum capital requirements incentivizes a wider spectrum of users to participate in network validation. Building censorship resistance: This is perhaps common knowledge, but it often gets overlooked. With the pace at which the macroeconomic landscape is evolving, it is a dire need for protocols to integrate solutions that build the censorship resilience of the protocol. This is akin to hedging against potential future slowdowns in validator architecture and building a high-performant architecture that keeps the network secure.\n\nAdmittedly, I find myself at crossroads while writing these solutions because, while I assert that being aware of the existing challenges as well as the solutions is of paramount importance, it is not enough to persistently echo them. It is essential that we engage in extensive research and relentlessly test and build solutions that help solve these challenges and build a resilient architecture.\n\nMohak is the founder of ClayStack.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

However, three altcoins posted notable gains.\n\nSolana (SOL) grew 8.5% to its current price of $24.55; Toncoin (TON) added 10.1% to hit $1.32, and Shiba Inu (SHIB) blew up 17.8% to trade at $0.00001108.\n\nShiba Inu appears to have kept up the momentum of last week’s rally that commenced on news that the coin’s makers are shedding their memecoin reputation and introducing a new identity protocol to all apps on the ecosystem for increased security and privacy.\n\nAltogether the market made small gains this week, as July’s U.S. inflation readings indicated a continued cooling off.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn the news...\n\nThis week brought a fairly busy and diverse news cycle, with institutional and global adoption stories commanding attention alongside the Fed’s new stablecoin note and the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission’s face-saving tactics in its failing war on crypto.\n\nOn Monday, payments giant PayPal announced it would be releasing an Ethereum-based dollar-pegged stablecoin called PayPal USD (PYUSD).\n\nThe currency will be issued by Paxos and is expected to become "a part of the overall payments infrastructure," according to a media quote by PayPal CEO Dan Schulman.\n\nStarting next month, Paxos will be publishing monthly reserve reports and third-party attestations of PYUSD’s reserves, enabling the public to keep track of the credibility and value of the assets underpinning the stablecoin’s value.\n\nDemocratic Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-CA) aired her concerns in a written statement: “I am deeply concerned that PayPal has chosen to launch its own stablecoin while there is still no Federal framework for regulation, oversight and enforcement of these assets. [...] Given PayPal’s size and reach, Federal oversight and enforcement of its stablecoin operations is essential.”\n\nOn Tuesday, Brazil announced the name of its new central bank digital currency (CBDC): DREX, or the “digital real”— the name being a near-acronym for “digital real electronic transaction.”\n\nThe digital real is a centrally-issued tokenized real that utilizes distributed ledger technology similar to blockchain, but it’s not without controversy.\n\nEarly last month, the Brazilian Central Bank published the code of the pilot project on its GitHub profile. Developers thus discovered several problematic functions within the smart contract.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe capabilities given to the Central Bank include the ability to freeze users\' accounts, decrease target balances, confiscate, and mint new units of the digital currency. This, in turn, has attracted criticism that the project enforces exactly the kind of centralization crypto was created to avoid.\n\nThat day, Binance announced it had secured licenses to operate in El Salvador, a country where Bitcoin is legal tender. Binance has been feeling the heat of the SEC’s spotlight in the U.S. after the federal securities regulator sued it for breaching securities laws, alleging further still that Binance execs are involved in commingling customer funds and market manipulation.\n\nAlso that day, the Federal Reserve issued a statement announcing incoming guidance for chartered banks dealing with dollar-pegged stablecoins. It also said it was stepping up its “novel activities supervision program” for banks dealing with crypto or crypto companies in its jurisdiction.\n\nIn particular, the Fed is looking to monitor the transaction validation process, including the “timing and finality of settlement of transactions, potential irreversibility of transactions, and the central authority of transaction records.”\n\nThe statement hints that the Fed will implement know-your-client (KYC) measures and ensure that nationally-chartered banks demonstrate appropriate risk-mitigation strategies.\n\nOn Friday, the SEC announced it plans to appeal Judge Torres’s landmark ruling in the agency’s ongoing lawsuit against Ripple for—you guessed it—breaching securities laws.\n\nTorres ruled that Ripple’s XRP was not a security by definition but could be presented as one depending on how it’s sold. Her verdict essentially contradicted the SEC’s claim that offerings to retail customers via exchanges constitute securities offerings.\n\nThe following day, the SEC once more played for time and delayed its decision to approve or reject a high-profile spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund application from ARK 21Shares.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFinally, on Saturday payments giant Visa announced an experimental solution on the Ethereum blockchain that enables users to pay gas fees using Visa credit or debit cards.'}].

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
Based on the news articles provided, it appears that Ethereum (ETH) is experiencing positive developments and trends in the market. Here are some key points to consider:

1. Ethereum Fees Outperforming Price: The increase in Ethereum fees by 176% compared to the price growth of 53% is seen as a bullish sign. This indicates a strong demand for using the Ethereum network, which could lead to further price appreciation.

2. Migration to L2 Ecosystems: The migration of users from Ethereum's L1 to various L2 ecosystems is a dominant process that is affecting fee indicators. This shift could lead to increased adoption of scaling solutions like Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync, which may contribute to a significant portion of Ethereum fees by the end of 2023.

3. Voyager Transfers Assets to Coinbase: Despite Voyager transferring a significant amount of Ethereum and Shiba Inu to Coinbase, the prices of these assets have not been negatively impacted. This suggests that there is still strong demand and positive sentiment surrounding these cryptocurrencies.

4. PayPal Launching Stablecoin on Ethereum: PayPal's announcement of launching a dollar-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain could further boost Ethereum's utility and adoption.

Overall, the news surrounding Ethereum in the articles indicates positive developments

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

The revelation comes as a surprise to many, as the former president has previously expressed his disdain for digital assets.\n\nThe crypto wallet in question is most likely connected to Trump’s NFT (non-fungible token) collection, which was launched in December 2022. The limited collection has a total of 44,000 Trump-themed trading cards. The entire collection sold out in just one day, netting over $8.9 million in sales.

The platform has established itself as the crypto ecosystem’s benchmark for Layer 1 infrastructure. The company’s leadership is nevertheless significantly contested. Indeed, with the increased dynamism of the technology market globally, new Layer 1 projects are regularly emerging. Their ambition is to rival or even dethrone Ethereum in this sector. To achieve this, these initiatives propose technological improvements. They also provide enhanced scaling capabilities. Operational advances that generally translate into lower transaction fees for users. In short, they want to do better than Ethereum. But can they? The truth is, it’s extremely difficult to predict with any certainty which project(s) will be able to supplant Ethereum. Admittedly, many of these crypto initiatives are not lacking in relevance. However, this is without taking into account the vast operational network that Ethereum has built to establish its market dominance. With that in mind, we’ll take a closer look at Layer 1 blockchain technology and the particularities of the one developed by Ethereum. We’ll then compare some of the crypto industry’s most popular Layer 1 projects with Ethereum’s.\n\nA look back at the Layer 1 concept\n\nTo assess whether Ethereum’s Layer 1 could be surpassed by other projects, it’s vital to understand its meaning and role within the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nLayer 1, often abbreviated to L1, is the very foundation of blockchain. It is the main blockchain that functions autonomously, without depending on other systems for its operation. It is this independence that distinguishes it from Layer 2 solutions, which are built on top of Layer 1 to enhance scalability and performance without modifying the underlying blockchain.\n\nLayer 0, on the other hand, is the underlying infrastructure layer that facilitates communication between different blockchains. It is a network of networks that enables Layer 1 blockchains to communicate with each other.\n\nLayer 1 blockchains have their own network of validator nodes responsible for validating transactions and blocks. They also use specific consensus mechanisms, such as Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS) or Proof of Authority (PoA), to guarantee network security and integrity.\n\nIconic blockchains such as Bitcoin, Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Ethereum all operate as Layer 1, each with its own token, which serves as the fuel for transactions and interactions within its ecosystem.\n\nSo what distinguishes Ethereum’s Layer 1 from other first-layer blockchains?\n\nSingularity of Ethereum Layer 1\n\nEthereum, as a Layer 1 project, occupies a prominent place in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, and for good reason. Its platform is distinguished by unique features that have redefined the possibilities offered by blockchain technology.\n\nOne of Ethereum’s major innovations is the introduction of smart contracts. These autonomous programs run automatically as soon as predefined conditions are met, without the need for human intervention.\n\nThanks to smart contracts, Ethereum has facilitated the development of decentralized applications (dApps). This has reduced dependence on traditional intermediaries, broadening the range of services available in the crypto ecosystem. In addition, Ethereum has played a crucial role in promoting interoperability between different blockchain platforms.\n\nWhile remaining true to its principles of decentralization, Ethereum is constantly seeking solutions to scale-up challenges, in order to satisfy a rapidly growing and demanding community.\n\nHowever, despite its leading status, Ethereum faces major challenges, particularly with regard to network scaling and high transaction costs. These challenges underline the importance of constant evolution of the platform. Other Layer 1 projects are emerging with innovative proposals, seeking to fill Ethereum’s gaps while offering new functionalities.\n\nLayer 1 projects competing with Ethereum\n\nThe cryptocurrency industry is full of Layer 1 blockchain projects. Given the multitude of offerings available, it would be tedious to cover them all here. However, by observing current trends in the sector, several of them seem to be gaining credibility and could potentially rival the current leaders.\n\nTake Cardano, founded in 2015 by Charles Hoskinson. He often describes his project as an “enhanced version of Ethereum”. Focused on innovation, Cardano is a decentralized blockchain based on proof-of-stake (PoS). It offers developers the possibility of creating smart contracts, while guaranteeing fast, low-cost transactions. One of Cardano’s notable achievements is the Ouroboros protocol, the first peer-verified blockchain protocol, ensuring decentralization, security and scalability.\n\nRipple (XRP) is a major player in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Although Ripple is not a Layer 1 blockchain per se, its network, RippleNet, was designed to facilitate fast, low-cost international money transfers between banks and other financial institutions. Despite recent legal disputes that could influence the price of XRP, its native asset, Ripple continues to stand out. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, XRP is not mined, but uses a unique distributed consensus mechanism to validate transactions.\n\nSolana is also a major player among Layer 1 projects. As a public, open source blockchain, it encourages the development of smart contracts, NFTs and dApps. Solana stands out for its hybrid consensus model combining proof-of-history (PoH) and a PoS synchronization engine. This combination enables Solana to achieve an impressive transaction rate of 65,000 TPS, well above Ethereum’s 15 TPS. It’s worth noting that technology giants such as Apple, Google and Microsoft are backing the project.\n\nOther Layer 1 projects such as Polkadot, Everscale, Stellar, Avalanche, Algorand, Solar Network, Kadena and Cronos are also gaining in popularity. Each of them has unique features that attract the attention of investors. But can they overtake Ethereum? It’s not impossible. Competition in the crypto industry is fierce. In this context, only continued innovation and sustained adoption will determine the future market leader. For the time being, we have to acknowledge Ethereum’s hegemony. It is supported by a vast ecosystem of developers, users and existing projects.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum, as the pioneer of smart contracts and dApps, has long dominated the Layer 1 blockchain landscape, but the emergence of innovative projects such as Cardano, Solana and others shows that there is real competition for this leadership position. Each of these projects brings unique solutions to today’s blockchain challenges, whether in terms of scalability, security or energy efficiency. So, who will be the next king of the Layer 1 protocol? Only time will tell. What is certain is that competition stimulates innovation, and this can only be good for the entire crypto ecosystem.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

This article explores the intricacies of Bitcoin Spark, its comparison with Ethereum, and the reasons behind its rising prominence.\n\nEthereum: A Brief Overview\n\nEthereum has long been a major player in the crypto world, known for its versatility and the unique functionalities it offers. It extends the blockchain applications beyond just cryptocurrency, enabling developers to build and deploy decentralized applications (dApps) powered by smart contracts. Ethereum's native token, ETH, facilitates transactions within these smart contracts and acts as a security measure against inefficient code and malicious activities.\n\nOn the contrary, Bitcoin's primary purpose has been as a digital currency and a store of value. Ethereum's broad application scope and dynamic platform have attracted a significant number of investors who see it as a promising avenue for long-term growth.\n\nBitcoin Spark: A New Contender\n\nBitcoin Spark, or BTCS, is a novel cryptocurrency project aiming to improve upon the limitations of Bitcoin and, in some aspects, Ethereum. It uses a radical blockchain technology known as Proof-Of-Process (PoP), which is a hybrid of Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) models. This unique consensus model enhances the transaction capacity and reduces transaction fees, making BTCS more efficient for everyday transactions.\n\nMoreover, the Bitcoin Spark network includes a separate layer for smart contracts, which can use different programming languages. This layer reaches consensus on the main network but allows innovative dApps to be developed without causing transaction congestion.\n\nDeciphering Proof-of-Process\n\nThe PoP model is a novel concept introduced by Bitcoin Spark. It combines the principles of PoW and PoS with a unique algorithm that restricts linear rewards based on stake size or raw processing power. This innovative approach prevents the concentration of power among large-scale miners.\n\nBTCS mining requires an easy-to-use mining program that can be installed on any device. This program automatically limits the device's processing power usage, thereby controlling the mining capability. The rewards for miners are proportional to the processing power they rent out to the network, fostering a fair distribution of BTCS tokens.\n\nA New Era of Mining\n\nBitcoin Spark's mining approach is a significant departure from traditional methods. Bitcoin's PoW model involves solving complex mathematical problems using high-end computers, consuming a lot of energy. In contrast, Ethereum's PoS model requires participants to lock a certain amount of ETH to earn validation rights.\n\nBitcoin Spark, with its PoP model, simplifies this process. It allows users to mine using any device, making mining more accessible and promoting decentralization. This method also ensures a fair distribution of BTCS tokens regardless of the size of the stake or the computing power of the mining device.\n\nRewarding Network Participants\n\nBitcoin Spark has devised innovative ways to reward network participants. The primary source of revenue comes from a decentralized CPU rental system. Users pay with BTCS tokens to access processing power, which then goes into the mining rewards pool.\n\nThe project also earns revenue from advertising. Half of the revenue from advertisements on the Bitcoin Spark application and website is distributed among network participants and miners. The community actively polices the advertising content, ensuring a clean and trustworthy platform.\n\nBitcoin Spark's Tokenomics\n\nBitcoin Spark's tokenomics closely mirror that of Bitcoin, with a maximum supply of 21 million tokens. However, the time to reach this maximum supply is significantly longer for BTCS, allowing for a prolonged period of mining rewards distribution.\n\nDuring the ICO phase, BTCS was offered at $1.50, with an additional 20% bonus. This presented an excellent opportunity for investors to participate in the project's growth.\n\nThe Future of Bitcoin Spark\n\nBitcoin Spark's unique features and solutions looks to stir interest among investors and crypto enthusiasts. Its potential for disrupting the crypto space makes it an intriguing project to watch.\n\nWhile Ethereum continues to maintain its stronghold with its unique offerings, Bitcoin Spark is rapidly emerging as a strong contender. As both platforms continue to evolve, the competition for dominance in the crypto world is heating up.\n\nFind out more about Bitcoin Spark on:\n\nWebsite: https://bitcoinspark.org/\n\nBuy BTCS: https://network.bitcoinspark.org/register\n\nThis post was authored by an external contributor and does not represent Benzinga's opinions and has not been edited for content.

It was the first blockchain to challenge and match the dominance of the Bitcoin network.\n\nEthereum is a decentralized platform that allows developers to create, publish, and distribute applications and smart contracts.\n\nWith its innovative features and services, and a community-run ecosystem that supports thousands of decentralized applications, it quickly gained popularity among investors and users worldwide.\n\nPerhaps its most notable feature is the ability to deploy smart contracts, which accelerated the development of the crypto industry.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum Investors Await Rally as Addresses in Profits Hit Monthly Low\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum Transaction Fees\n\nTransaction fees, or gas fees, are incurred when executing a transaction on the Ethereum network.\n\nEvery network action, whether sending Ether (ETH) or interacting with a smart contract, requires computational power. Miners, who validate transactions and maintain the network, are compensated with gas fees for their efforts.\n\nGas fees are denominated in Gwei, a tiny fraction of an ETH.\n\nOne Gwei is equivalent to 0.000000001 ETH. When you initiate a transaction, you specify a gas limit, the maximum amount of computational work you are willing to pay for.\n\nAdditionally, you set a gas price, the amount of Gwei you are willing to pay per unit of gas. The total transaction fee is calculated by multiplying the gas limit by the gas price.\n\nFactors Contributing to High Ethereum Fees\n\nSource: CNN\n\nSeveral factors have contributed to the high fees on the Ethereum network:\n\n1. Network Congestion\n\nAs the popularity of Ethereum has soared, the number of transactions on the network has increased dramatically. This surge in demand has led to network congestion, causing delays and driving up transaction fees.\n\nDuring peak hours, when the network is crowded with users, gas prices tend to skyrocket as users compete to process their transactions.\n\n2. Gas Limit and Gas Price\n\nThe gas limit and gas price you set for your transactions can significantly impact the fees you pay. You will pay more for your transactions if you set a high gas limit or a high gas price.\n\nFinding a balance and optimizing these parameters to minimize fees while ensuring your transactions are processed promptly is important.\n\n3. Smart Contract Complexity\n\nThe complexity of smart contracts also plays a role in determining transaction fees. More complex smart contracts require more computational resources, resulting in higher gas fees.\n\nAs decentralized applications (dApps) and their functionalities become more intricate, the network experiences increased congestion, leading to higher gas prices.\n\n4. Ethereum Network Upgrades\n\nThe Ethereum network has undergone several upgrades to improve scalability and address the issue of high fees. One such upgrade is EIP-1559, which introduced a base fee mechanism to make gas prices more predictable and reduce fee volatility.\n\nHowever, these upgrades take time to implement and may not immediately alleviate the problem of high fees.\n\nHow to Reduce and Avoid High Ethereum Fees\n\nSource: CNBC\n\nNow that we understand the factors contributing to high Ethereum fees let’s explore some practical tips to reduce and avoid them:\n\n1. Optimize Gas Limit and Gas Price\n\nTo minimize transaction fees, optimizing the gas limit and gas price for each transaction is crucial.\n\nTo decrease fees, you can set a lower gas limit and gas price, but avoid setting them too low to prevent transaction delays.\n\nExperiment with different values and find the optimal cost and transaction speed balance.\n\n2. Use Layer-2 Scaling Solutions\n\nLayer-2 scaling solutions encompass technologies constructed on the Ethereum network to boost transaction throughput and cut fees.\n\nThese solutions, such as Optimistic Rollups and zkSync, process transactions off-chain or more optimally, alleviating the burden on the Ethereum mainnet. By utilizing layer-2 solutions, you can benefit from faster and cheaper transactions.\n\n3. Choose Off-Peak Times\n\nGas fees tend to be lower during off-peak times with less network congestion.\n\nYou can take advantage of lower fees by scheduling your transactions during these periods, such as late at night or on weekends.\n\nMonitoring gas price charts or using tools like Gas Now can help you identify the optimal transaction times.\n\n4. Consider Gas Tokens\n\nGas tokens, such as CHI or GST2, allow you to pre-purchase gas at a lower price and use it to pay transaction fees in the future.\n\nYou can effectively reduce your overall gas costs by acquiring gas tokens when gas prices are low and redeeming them when fees are high.\n\nHowever, remember that gas tokens might have limitations and some wallets and platforms might not support them.\n\n5. Choose the Priority Fee Option\n\nSome wallets and platforms offer a priority fee option that allows you to pay a slightly higher fee to process your transaction faster. If time is of the essence, opting for a priority fee can ensure your transaction is prioritized by miners and confirmed more quickly.\n\nSource: Comparic\n\n6. Explore Alternative Blockchains\n\nIf high Ethereum fees persist or if you require faster and cheaper transactions, consider exploring alternative blockchains.\n\nBlockchains like Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, and Solana offer lower fees and faster transaction speeds.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that these blockchains may have different functionalities and may not support all Ethereum-based tokens and applications.\n\n7. Stay Informed and Adapt\n\nThe Ethereum network keeps evolving, and developers are actively creating new solutions to tackle high fees.\n\nStay informed about network upgrades, improvements, and emerging technologies that aim to reduce fees. B\n\ny adapting to the changing landscape, you can leverage the latest tools and innovations to minimize your transaction costs.\n\nConclusion\n\nHigh Ethereum network fees can be a barrier for users looking to transact on the blockchain. However, by understanding the factors contributing to these fees and implementing the tips mentioned above, you can reduce and avoid high fees on the Ethereum network.\n\nRemember to optimize your gas limit and gas price, explore layer-2 scaling solutions, transact during off-peak times, consider gas tokens, choose priority fees when necessary, explore alternative blockchains, and stay informed about advancements in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nWith these strategies, you can navigate the world of Ethereum transactions more cost-effectively.\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial or investment advice.

Considering both reports, it seems that the overall sentiment is in favor of an upward trend for ETH. Therefore, I am confident in predicting a bullish market trend for Ethereum and will take a significant action to buy ETH.

If you\'ve been waiting for the right time to invest, now may seem like a smart buying opportunity, as crypto prices steadily inch closer to their previous peaks.\n\nBut some investors are still cautious, which is understandable considering how quickly the crypto market crashed last year. The last thing anyone wants is to invest while prices are higher, only to have the market plummet yet again.\n\nSo is it really a smart time to invest in Ethereum? The answer is, it depends.\n\nThe case for investing now\n\nMarket volatility is always unnerving, but it\'s especially challenging in the crypto space. While Ethereum has experienced incredible highs over the last few years, the lows can be unbearable for many investors.\n\nHowever, remember that crypto is a long-term investment. Even the strongest cryptocurrencies will likely see extreme volatility in the near term, but the best investments have the potential for significant long-term growth.\n\nEthereum remains one of the strongest players in the industry, and it has some major advantages over its competitors, including:\n\nIts sheer size: With a market cap of around $221 billion, Ethereum makes up just under 20% of the entire crypto market. While popularity alone doesn\'t necessarily make for a strong investment, it\'s tough for smaller cryptocurrencies to compete with a behemoth like Ethereum -- putting it in a league of its own.\n\nWith a market cap of around $221 billion, Ethereum makes up just under 20% of the entire crypto market. While popularity alone doesn\'t necessarily make for a strong investment, it\'s tough for smaller cryptocurrencies to compete with a behemoth like Ethereum -- putting it in a league of its own. It\'s the leading smart contract platform: The Ethereum blockchain is host to a wide variety of decentralized applications (dApps), ranging from NFT marketplaces to metaverse applications to decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. Although many other networks (such as Solana and Cardano ) can also host dApps, Ethereum is far and away the most popular platform.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain is host to a wide variety of decentralized applications (dApps), ranging from NFT marketplaces to metaverse applications to decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. Although many other networks (such as and ) can also host dApps, Ethereum is far and away the most popular platform. It\'s constantly updating: Last year, Ethereum developers successfully completed The Merge, a landmark upgrade that moved the network from the energy-intensive proof-of-work system to the far more efficient proof-of-stake. But there are many other updates still in the pipeline -- most notably The Surge, which should vastly improve the network\'s speed and reduce transaction fees.\n\nIn other words, Ethereum has a lot going for it right now. It\'s consistently been one of the clear leaders in the crypto space, and if it continues its upgrades and improvements, it has the potential to soar even more over time.\n\nWhen it may be best to avoid Ethereum\n\nAs with any cryptocurrency, Ethereum is still largely speculative. While it has many distinct advantages, those are mostly speculative right now, too.\n\nIf NFTs, the metaverse, or DeFi become more mainstream, Ethereum will benefit from it. But if those applications never catch on with the public, the crypto may have a tough time staying relevant. Right now, nobody can say how this space will fare over the long term, and there\'s always a chance it could fail.\n\nThis isn\'t to say you shouldn\'t invest in Ethereum for these reasons. For many investors, the potentially lucrative earnings outweigh the risk of crypto\'s speculative nature. But in general, even the "safest" cryptocurrencies are still more volatile than stocks -- which can be a deal-breaker for more risk-averse investors.\n\nIf you\'re on the fence, ask yourself which of these two scenarios you\'d regret more: investing now and losing money if Ethereum fails, or not investing and missing out on those earnings if it succeeds.\n\nThere\'s no right or wrong answer here, but it can help you determine where your priorities lie. If your biggest concern is making a bad investment and losing money, crypto in general may not be the best fit for you right now.\n\nCrypto can be incredibly volatile, and it\'s important to consider your risk tolerance before you invest. That said, Ethereum has built a reputation for being a leader in the industry, and it has plenty of advantages that could make it a smart buy right now.'}].

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

Based on the news articles provided, there are a few key points to consider for the ETH market trend:

1. Ethereum 'Restaking' Takes Shape as Next Big Trend in Blockchain Security: The ability for Ethereum stakers to restake tokens to other projects outside of Ethereum could offer an additional source of income. This could potentially attract more investors to participate in staking, which may increase the demand for ETH and positively impact its price.

2. SEC Said to Be Poised to Allow US Debut of Ether-Futures ETFs: The US Securities and Exchange Commission is considering allowing the first exchange-traded funds based on Ether futures. If approved, this could bring more institutional investors into the ETH market and potentially increase liquidity and demand for ETH.

3. Bitcoin and Ethereum Now Less Volatile Than Oil: Report: The volatility of Bitcoin and Ethereum has decreased compared to oil, which could indicate a more stable market environment for these cryptocurrencies. Reduced volatility may attract more conservative investors to consider investing in ETH.

Overall, the news articles suggest positive developments for the Ethereum market, including potential new sources of income for stakers, the possibility of Ether-futures ETFs being approved, and decreased volatility compared to traditional assets like oil. These factors could contribute to a positive market trend for ETH in

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, we can see that the market trend for ETH appears to be bullish. The short-long moving average and MACD signals are both indicating a buy signal, and the Bollinger Bands signal also supports this bullish trend. Additionally, the news analyst report highlights positive developments for the Ethereum market, such as the potential for new sources of income for stakers, the possibility of Ether-futures ETFs being approved, and decreased volatility compared to traditional assets like oil.

Considering all of this information, it is reasonable to conclude that the overall market trend for ETH is positive and likely to continue in an upward direction. Therefore, I would recommend buying more ETH to maximize profit in this bullish market.

No other social media platform allows everyday folk to interact with celebrities, CEOs, and multi-millionaires/billionaires the way Twitter does. For that reason, one may find several instances where influential figures on the platform voice their opinions in a candid non-corporate-like manner.\n\nOn August 17th, Twitter became home to a daring statement by Charles Hoskinson, CEO of Cardano. Hoskinson quote-retweeted a user who outright mocked Cardano, Hydra, and Hoskinson. The CEO then responded by highlighting key advantages Cardano has over Ethereum, the blockchain the user seemingly preferred.\n\nCool, let’s make a bet. My prediction is that within six months time, Charles will: Stop talking about Hydra “We never actually said that was a viable solution for everything, it’s only good for a few specific things”, has level set on Input Endorsers “That’s the long term… — 0xNLY.arf (@0xNLYFANS) August 17, 2023\n\nCardano: A Better Way Of Handling Transactions\n\nHoskinson’s response focused both on criticizing Ethereum, and on highlighting the capabilities of his technology.\n\n“Hydra is live on mainnet and evolving fast. Mithril is live as well and the first step towards a rich DA and light client strategy. We already designed a significantly better way of handling transactions via tiered pricing and Babel fees.\n\nThere’s been a roll-up strategy since Midnight was conceived 4 years ago. The protocols and primitives had to catch up and are getting there,” tweeted Hoskinson.\n\nHydra refers to the layer-2 scaling solution that uses sidechains to offload transactions from the main chain. This allows Cardano to process more transactions per second at a lower cost.\n\n“Meanwhile Ethereum has a dumpster fire of a consensus layer, has a terrible programming model that they can’t change, and are getting eaten alive by their own layer 2 ecosystem.“\n\nIt's getting delusion town now.

With 1,000 stacking pools, each of which processes 1,000 TPS, Cardano could achieve a throughput of up to one million transactions per second,” said Hoskinson in his video.\n\nHydra was first revealed during an AMA video on Hoskinson’s Youtube channel in 2020. When asked about updates on the layer-2 solution his company has been working on, he had this to say:\n\n“We are going to keep adding resources to Hydra, and we’ve been trying to identify some teams so we can parallelize the workstream because it’s such a high commercial priority. And it’s going to be very important that we’ll be able to offload a large number of the transaction traffic that’s going to come from all of the apps that are coming.”\n\nHoskinson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nCardano’s ADA Token Thrives Despite Outcasting\n\nCardano’s native token ADA has been subject to several attacks due to its status in the eyes of the US Securities and Exchange Commission and its leader, Gary Gensler. Gensler sees any token besides Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, and Litecoin as a security. Accordingly, the SEC is willing to sue any exchange that trades in significant sums of these supposed ‘unregistered securities.’\n\nAs a result, many exchanges, such as Revolut, have been seen suspending trading of tokens such as ADA, SOL, and MATIC.\n\nHowever, Cardano and Hoskinson look at the application of ADA and its corresponding blockchain as technologies beyond the simple potential of financial investment.\n\nFor example, in 2021, Hoskinson tweeted his celebration of Cardano technology being used in Ethiopian schools as a form of encrypted credentials for five million students.\n\nDropped by the MOE today to discuss the digital transformation of Ethiopia's educational credentials.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

While that recent performance is impressive, there are still plenty of skeptics out there. After all, a a recent price of about $1,730, Ethereum is 64% below its all-time high of $4,892 from two years ago, and hasn\'t had the type of monster rally many investors were expecting when it completed The Merge, a system upgrade, last September.\n\nIn fact, Ethereum is trading at almost exactly the same price it was one year ago. And it has had unexpected difficulty breaking through the $2,000 price level. So is Ethereum undervalued or not? To answer that question, there are three important factors to consider.\n\nInnovation leader\n\nEthereum recently celebrated its eighth birthday, and it\'s fascinating to look back and see how far Ethereum has come in such a relatively short time. Ethereum has become the de facto benchmark standard that all other Layer-1 blockchains measure themselves against. There have been a large number of blockchains that have attempted to become "the next Ethereum" and failed -- and that list includes Cardano, Avalanche, and Solana.\n\nBy investing in Ethereum, you are investing in the innovation leader with a clear competitive advantage. Ethereum pioneered the concept of smart contracts for the blockchain and has consistently been first to market with new innovations. That includes the launch of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), new decentralized finance exchanges, and new gaming and metaverse experiences. Given Ethereum\'s track record of innovation, I\'m confident that there\'s plenty of upside potential ahead.\n\nDiversification benefits\n\nAll of that innovation happening on the Ethereum blockchain means that the size and scope of the Ethereum ecosystem continues to grow. Ethereum still has the largest community of blockchain developers in the world, and the number of use cases for Ethereum continues to grow. For example, Wall Street firms are experimenting with Ethereum as a new form of payment network, while manufacturing companies are experimenting with Ethereum\'s blockchain technology to improve their supply chains.\n\nFrom my perspective, Ethereum is simply the most diversified crypto that you can own in your portfolio. You\'re not investing in a one-trick pony, and that is really the key to Ethereum\'s allure for both retail and institutional investors. That\'s an important consideration during volatile and uncertain market conditions, when diversification is the key to riding out the tough times.\n\nRoadmap for success\n\nOne other key consideration is that Ethereum has a roadmap for success, so you can see exactly where Ethereum has been, and where it\'s headed. After The Merge, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin unveiled an updated roadmap that includes five new distinct stages, known as the Surge, Scourge, Verge, Purge, and Splurge. Even if each of those stages only lasts six months, that\'s still a three-year strategic vision. If you\'re a buy-and-hold investor, that\'s exactly what you want to see: a long-term plan for success.\n\nWhen you dig into the specific milestones on Ethereum\'s roadmap, that\'s when things get really interesting. For example, the current phase of development ("The Surge") has a goal of boosting Ethereum\'s transaction processing abilities to 100,000 transactions per second. That\'s blazingly fast speed, even faster than the theoretical maximum speed of the Visa card payment network (65,000 transactions per second). Eventually, says Buterin, the goal is to hit 1 million transactions per second.\n\nWhat could possibly go wrong?\n\nInvesting in crypto can be risky and speculative, and it\'s no different with Ethereum. So, yes, there\'s actually quite a bit that could go wrong for Ethereum. The Securities and Exchange Commission, for example, might decide that Ethereum is actually a security, thereby sending it to crypto purgatory and upending future plans for development. There\'s also a risk that an upstart "Ethereum killer" might truly emerge, dooming Ethereum to the dustbin of history.\n\nBut, as noted above, Ethereum has a strong track record of innovation, growth, and diversification. At recent prices it seems remarkably undervalued. Just two years ago, Ethereum was trading for nearly $5,000. So I\'m very confident buying Ethereum now, while it still seems to be trading at a discount. Over the long haul, Ethereum\'s upside potential is just too high to ignore.'}, {'id': 1, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd2F0Y2hlci5ndXJ1L25ld3MvaXMtZXRoZXItdGhlLXNhbWUtYXMtZXRoZXJldW3SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Sat, 19 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Is Ether the Same as Ethereum? - Watcher Guru', 'content': 'Is Ether the Same as Ethereum?\n\nCryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors often come across the terms Ethereum and Ether.\n\nHowever, there is a common misconception that these two terms are interchangeable.\n\nIn reality, Ethereum and Ether are distinct entities within the realm of digital currency.\n\nThis article aims to clarify the differences between Ethereum and Ether, providing a comprehensive understanding of their roles and functionalities in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nAlso read: Why are Ethereum Network Fees so High?\n\nSource: Forbes\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nEthereum is a blockchain-based platform that revolutionizes the way we interact with digital assets and decentralized applications (dApps).\n\nIt serves as a decentralized global platform for developers to create smart contracts and dApps without the need for intermediaries.\n\nEthereum’s blockchain technology allows for secure, transparent, and tamper-proof transactions and operations.\n\nFeatures and Benefits of Ethereum\n\nDecentralization: Ethereum operates on a decentralized network of nodes, eliminating the need for a central authority or third-party intermediaries. This decentralized approach ensures transparency and reduces the risk of censorship or manipulation. Smart Contracts: Ethereum introduced the concept of smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. These contracts automatically execute transactions and enforce agreements without the need for intermediaries, offering efficiency and automation in various industries. Decentralized Applications (dApps): Ethereum provides a platform for developers to build decentralized applications that operate on the blockchain. These dApps leverage the security, transparency, and immutability of the Ethereum network while offering a wide range of functionalities and use cases. Interoperability: Ethereum allows for interoperability with other blockchain networks, enabling seamless integration and communication between different decentralized platforms. This interoperability expands the potential for collaboration and innovation within the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nUnderstanding Ether\n\nSource: CNN\n\nWhat is Ether?\n\nEther (ETH) is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network.\n\nWhile Ethereum is the platform, Ether serves as the fuel that powers transactions and operations within the network.\n\nEther stands as a digital asset that is purchasable, tradable, and usable for investment, payments, and exchange trading.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum: Donald Trump Holds Up To $500k ETH\n\nFunctions and Uses of Ether\n\nPayment Method: Ether is used as a means of payment for on-chain transactions within the Ethereum network.\n\n\n\nWhen users initiate transactions or execute smart contracts on Ethereum, they need to pay gas fees, which are calculated in Ether. These gas fees compensate the network participants, including miners, for their computational resources and effort in securing the blockchain. Investment: Ether can be seen as a digital asset that individuals can invest in for potential capital appreciation. Similar to other cryptocurrencies, the value of Ether is subject to market fluctuations and can provide opportunities for investors to generate profits.\n\n\n\nYet, remember that engaging in cryptocurrency investments involves risks and requires prudent consideration. Trading: Ether is listed and traded on various cryptocurrency exchanges, allowing users to buy, sell, and trade the digital asset. Traders can take advantage of price movements and volatility in the cryptocurrency market to potentially profit from their trading activities. Medium of Exchange: Some merchants and online retailers accept Ether as a form of payment for goods and services.\n\n\n\nThe use of Ether as a medium of exchange provides an alternative to traditional fiat currency transactions, offering faster and more secure transactions, especially for cross-border payments.\n\nEther vs. Ethereum: The Differences\n\nIt is crucial to understand the distinction between Ethereum and Ether to avoid confusion. Ethereum refers to the blockchain-based platform that enables the creation of decentralized applications and smart contracts.\n\nOn the other hand, Ether is the specific cryptocurrency that operates within the Ethereum network.\n\nWhile Ethereum is the infrastructure, it also serves as the digital asset and means of value exchange within that infrastructure.\n\nConclusion: Is Ether the Same as Ethereum?\n\nIn summary, Ethereum and Ether are integral components of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, but they are not interchangeable terms.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum is a blockchain-based platform that facilitates the development and deployment of decentralized applications and smart contracts. Ether, on the other hand, is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, serving as a digital asset and payment method within the ecosystem.\n\nUnderstanding the distinctions between Ethereum and Ether is essential for anyone navigating the world of cryptocurrencies, enabling informed decision-making and participation in this evolving digital landscape.'}].

Following the ARB airdrop, daily transactions and user numbers have consistently exceeded the chain’s past averages.\n\nArbitrum, an Ethereum rollup hosting asset valued at $5.77 billion, sustained robust growth in the previous quarter. Throughout Q2, Arbitrum maintained its momentum by enhancing its infrastructure and advancing its ecosystem.\n\nAfter the ARB airdrop incentives concluded and the airdrop resulted in a “sell-the-news” reaction for the native token and its associated ecosystem projects, noteworthy activity levels persisted, evident in transaction and user counts surpassing pre-airdrop figures.\n\nThe influx of new users underscores Arbitrum’s enduring strength and flourishing ecosystem.\n\nA group of “super airdrop hunters” who amassed ARB tokens using multiple Ethereum addresses contributed significantly to the selling pressure.\n\nThe ARB token experienced significant selling during the airdrop, causing its price to plummet from $10.29 to $1 in just a few hours.\n\nNansen’s report stated that the stability of Arbitrum after its Airdrop “points towards more organic activity” as new users have been increasing, even “surpassing Ethereum on certain days in Q2.”\n\nIn the second quarter of 2023, daily transactions and gas prices on Arbitrum One, one of the critical components of Arbitrum utilizing Arbitrum Rollup technology to enhance transaction throughput while maintaining security, remained steady, averaging 800k transactions.\n\nSource: Nansen\n\nThe quarter saw a consistent rise in transaction count compared to the previous quarter, indicating heightened activity since the airdrop. Daily active addresses on Arbitrum remained stable at approximately 200k throughout the quarter.\n\nConversely, there has been a gradual increase in the number of new wallets initiating transactions on Arbitrum since the beginning of the year. On specific days in Q2, this count surpassed Ethereum’s new wallet activity.\n\nArbitrum (ARB) Airdrop Spurs Price Surge and Ecosystem Growth Since March\n\nThe announcement of the Arbitrum (ARB) airdrop on March 16 led to a significant price increase in native tokens of projects within the Arbitrum ecosystem, including GMX (GMX), Magic (MAGIC), Gains Network (GNS), and Radiant Network (RDNT).\n\nThis surge was directly tied to the ARB airdrop, fueling growth in the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nThe price surge occurred mainly between the airdrop announcement and its execution on March 23.\n\nAs noted in a report, “Once the airdrop launched alongside the $ARB token introduction, ecosystem token prices began to decrease, following a typical ‘sell the news’ pattern.”\n\nThe Arbitrum airdrop allocated 1.1% of the total 12.75 billion ARB supply to the ecosystem’s DAOs. This allocation was crucial for a positive outlook on the Arbitrum ecosystem, as DAOs could leverage ARB incentives to encourage usage.\n\nHowever, the airdrop amounts for individual projects in the Arbitrum ecosystem were relatively smaller. Only GMX and MAGIC received allocations exceeding $10 million.\n\nMost projects received less than $500,000 worth of ARB tokens, which needed to be improved to incentivize liquidity across a large user base.\n\nWith the speculation surrounding the ARB airdrop subsiding, the growing number of new wallets implies increased organic engagement.\n\nDaily active users, transaction count, and on-chain value have all settled at levels higher than pre-airdrop figures.\n\nThe upward trends in gas fee expenditure and the establishment of new wallets further signify the growing utilization of the network.'}, {'id': 3, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vZGFpbHljb2luLmNvbS9ldm0tY2hhaW5zLXdoYXQtaXMtZXRoZXJldW0tdmlydHVhbC1tYWNoaW5lL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Sun, 20 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'EVM Chains: What Is the Ethereum Virtual Machine? - DailyCoin', 'content': 'EVM Chains are the bread and butter of the crypto space.

The Ethereum Virtual Machine means that whether you’re using Ethereum (ETH) or Polygon (MATIC), things look and feel more or less the same. For example, you don’t need to memorize the Arbitrum (ARB) whitepaper to use crypto wallets like MetaMask or a dex like Uniswap on the Arbitrum network.\n\nIf you’re confident using one EVM Chain, you’re confident using all of them.\n\nHow Does the Ethereum Virtual Machine Work?\n\nWhen you look closely at the EVM, you’ll find a complex system that runs tasks consistently. The Ethereum Virtual Machine is deterministic, meaning if you give it a specific task, it will always give the same result, no matter where it’s done or who does it.\n\nThis deterministic nature is crucial for the consensus mechanism of the EVM-based networks, ensuring all nodes harmoniously agree on the state of the blockchain.\n\nThe EVM operates on a unique set of instructions, allowing for the creation, deployment, and execution of smart contracts. These contracts, written primarily in a programming language called Solidity, are then compiled into bytecode. This bytecode is what the EVM reads, interprets, and executes.\n\nWhen you initiate a smart contract transaction, the EVM springs into action. It processes the transaction, calculates the necessary gas fees, and updates the blockchain’s state.\n\nAnother intriguing facet of the EVM is its Turing completeness, meaning it can perform any calculation that any other programmable computer can, provided it’s given enough time and memory.\n\nHow does this benefit the Ethereum blockchain? Well, it means that the EVM can execute any algorithm or program, granting Ethereum its iconic flexibility. This versatility helps developers create innovative smart contracts and Web 3 dApps (decentralized applications) on the Ethereum mainnet and other EVM chains.\n\nWhy Is EVM Compatibility so Important?\n\nIn an industry fraught with interoperability issues and complex bridging processes, EVM chains help to smooth the onboarding process and give users a sense of trust and familiarity with new networks.\n\nEVM compatibility means that a blockchain can run the EVM and execute Ethereum smart contracts. This makes it easy for blockchain developers to port over existing contracts and ERC-20 tokens to a cross-chain environment and deploy crucial dApps, like decentralized exchanges or NFT marketplaces.\n\nWith the rise of multiple blockchains, each with its unique strengths like faster transactions and lower transaction fees, the ability to communicate and interact between them is of paramount importance. EVM-compatible blockchains integrate more easily than non-EVM chains, enabling assets and data to flow between different chains.\n\nOn top of that, operating an EVM helps emerging chains leverage Ethereum’s existing tools and infrastructure. Being a pioneer in the smart contract space, Ethereum has a rich ecosystem of DApps. EVM compatibility allows other blockchains to tap into this established ecosystem, benefiting from tried-and-tested tools and services without reinventing the wheel.\n\nLooking at competing Layer-1 blockchains that don’t naturally support EVM compatibility, like Cardano (ADA), we see first-hand how difficult it is to onboard new users, especially in DeFi.\n\nDespite Cardano having powerful tech in its own right, the network struggles to attract a user base as large as EVM chains like the BSC, Polygon, and Arbitrum. Cardano developers need to be proficient in the network’s dedicated programming language, Haskell, while all EVM chains use the same languages, like Solidity and Vyper.\n\nWhat’s the Difference Between EVM-Equivalence and EVM-Compatibility?\n\nJust when you thought you’d understood everything, there’s another layer of definitions. In today’s rapidly evolving industry, some blockchain ecosystems insist that simply being EVM-compatible is no longer enough. Teams like Polygon aim for EVM equivalence within the Polygon Proof-of-Stake sidechain and zkEVM.\n\nIs there any difference between compatibility and equivalence?\n\nEVM-Compatibility\n\nEVM-Compatibility represents a blockchain’s ability to run the EVM and execute Ethereum-based smart contracts. An EVM-compatible blockchain can seamlessly integrate with Ethereum’s tools, protocols, and standards.\n\nDevelopers can deploy the same smart contracts across multiple EVM-compatible blockchains without major code modifications.\n\nEVM-Equivalence\n\nOn the other hand, EVM-Equivalence is a more profound alignment with the Ethereum ecosystem. An EVM-equivalent blockchain not only supports Ethereum’s smart contracts but also mirrors Ethereum’s state, account structures, and consensus mechanisms.\n\nIt’s like a twin of the Ethereum network, sharing its DNA but existing as a separate entity. EVM-equivalent blockchains can synchronize with Ethereum’s state and offer a near-identical environment for dApps and contracts.\n\nWhile EVM-Compatibility offers a bridge to the Ethereum ecosystem, allowing for smooth functionality and integration, EVM-Equivalence is like walking in Ethereum’s shoes, mirroring its every step.\n\nExamples Of EVM-Compatible Blockchains\n\nNow that we better understand what EVM Chains are let’s dive into a quick list of the top EVM-compatible blockchains in the crypto industry.\n\nBinance Smart Chain (BSC) – With more daily users than any other network, BNB Chain is easily the most popular EVM chain. It introduced thousands of people to DeFi for the first time and was the first major low-cost alternative to Ethereum.\n\n– With more daily users than any other network, BNB Chain is easily the most popular EVM chain.

The Fantom network is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) designed for scalability.\n\n– Unlike its rivals in this list, Fantom isn’t technically a blockchain. The Fantom network is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) designed for scalability. Celo (CELO) – Originally designed as a simple payment network, Celo has blossomed into a fully-fledged and functional EVM chain with plenty of dApps and tools for the budding DeFi enthusiast.\n\nEVM Chain Pros and Cons\n\nAfter the invention of Bitcoin (BTC) itself, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is arguably the biggest revolution in the blockchain landscape, serving as the backbone for a myriad of decentralized applications and platforms. Of course, it’s not without its faults.\n\nPros\n\nInteroperability – EVM-compatible chains can seamlessly interact with Ethereum-based code, allowing for smooth data and asset transfers between blockchains.\n\n– EVM-compatible chains can seamlessly interact with Ethereum-based code, allowing for smooth data and asset transfers between blockchains.

Learning Curve – For newcomers, the Ethereum Virtual Machine can present a steep learning curve, marking it difficult to come to terms with.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nWhile networks like Solana and Cardano don’t natively support EVM-based programs, independent teams have created EVM networks like NEON and Milkomeda that settle transactions on their respective Layer-1.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nIn the current climate of the crypto industry, running an Ethereum Virtual Machine is essential if teams want to bring users to their blockchain. Without being EVM-compatible, the barriers to entry are too inconvenient.\n\nAs we can see, Cardano is a Top 10 cryptocurrency by market cap, but it has far fewer DeFi applications and TVL statistics than relatively unknown EVM-chains like Kava and Pulsechain.\n\nFAQs'}].

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by both the on-chain analyst report and the news analyst report, the overall market trend for ETH cryptocurrency appears to be bullish. The on-chain data indicates positive momentum with increasing open prices, growing interest and adoption, stable network performance, and buy signals from technical indicators. Additionally, the news articles highlight the outperformance of XRP, discussions comparing Ethereum and Cardano, and the awakening of a pre-mine Ethereum whale after 8 years of silence.

Considering the bullish trend, it is advisable to buy ETH to maximize profit. Given the confidence in the upward trend, I would suggest a significant action to capitalize on the positive market sentiment. Therefore, I recommend buying ETH with a value of -0.8 (buy with 80% cash).

According to the Arkham Intelligence dashboard , this wallet belonged to the co-founder of Ethereum.\n\nThere are also $84,000 worth of USD Coin (USDC) and $58,000 worth of Wrapped Ethereum (WETH) in the wallet.\n\nButerin has previously transferred assets to a cryptocurrency exchange as he sent 200 ETH to Kraken in March. Buterin also sold a number of unwanted altcoins (sh*tcoins) for 439.25 ETH.\n\nButerin’s Transaction Coincides with Crypto Market’s Recent Decline\n\nButerin’s move followed last week’s (August 17) flash fall in the cryptocurrency market, when the price of ETH dropped below $1700 for the first time since June and it’s still trading below that threshold.\n\nData from the blockchain analysis company Glassnode show that Ethereum owners fiercely hold their positions even as they quickly transfer assets among cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nThe data aggregator reports that 14.88 million ETH are currently held on exchanges, a figure not seen since 2018.\n\nExchange outflows are typically interpreted as a positive sign that the asset is being retained for the long term.\n\n“Ethereum’s Transitions Vital For Success” – Buterin\n\nIn June, Buterin explained that the Ethereum blockchain “fails” outright in the absence of an adequate scaling infrastructure to lower transaction costs.\n\n“Ethereum fails because each transaction costs $3.75 ($82.48 if we have another bull run) and every product aiming for the mass market inevitably forgets about the chain and adopts centralized workarounds for everything,” he claimed .\n\nButerin then said that smart contract wallets represent another area of failure.\n\nHe explained that switching to smart contract wallets had certain drawbacks because managing several addresses at once presents challenges from the user experience perspective.\n\nTo effectively shift into an on-chain world with zero-knowledge rollups, Buterin said that wallets would need to secure data in addition to cryptographic assets.\n\n“In a ZK world, this is no longer true: the wallet is not just protecting authentication credentials, it’s also holding your data,” he added .\n\nFor the third and final shift, privacy, new identification, reputation, and social recovery mechanisms will be required.\n\nWithout the third shift, he claimed , “Ethereum fails because making all transactions (and POAPs, etc.) publicly visible for anyone to see is far too high a privacy sacrifice for many users and everyone moves onto centralized solutions that at least somewhat hide your data.”\n\nEthereum’s co-founder proposed using stealth addresses to alleviate this problem.\n\nA Turning Point for ETH\n\nEthereum is at a turning moment because the chart structure is so fragile. ETH price is expected to drop sharply if it brokes through the $1,600–$1,550 level.\n\nThe monthly average of Ethereum ($ETH) addresses that are currently active is lower than the annual average, indicating little on-chain activity.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap , at the time of writing, ETH was trading at $1,667.56, that represents a 0.36% fall over the last 24 hours.'}, {'id': 7, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvaW5kZXNrLmNvbS92aWRlby93aHktZGlkLWV0aGVyZXVtLWNvLWZvdW5kZXItdml0YWxpay1idXRlcmluLXNlbmQtZG9sbGFyMW0td29ydGgtb2YtZXRoZXItdG8tY29pbmJhc2Uv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Mon, 21 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Why Did Ethereum Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin Send $1M Worth of Ether to Coinbase? - CoinDesk', 'content': "Vital has moved some Ethereum about a $1 million worth Ethereum to coin base. What does this mean? Well, might indicate that he's willing to sell a little bit. He moved about 600 to coin base over the weekend. Vitals, public addresses for his Ethereum holdings are out there. Most people know where they are. They're visible on most uh either scans or like Blockchain explorers out there. And for good reason, right? He's probably the most central figure head in all crypto because he's uh the front man or the image of Ethereum ecosystem, which is the largest smart contract ecosystem and the second largest coin by market cap behind Bitcoin. So when people see vital or anyone else moving money uh with that big of a name out there, they start paying attention. Of course, we don't know if he sold this Ethereum and we also don't know the reasons behind it. Maybe he just wanted to get some more cushion for uh his US D bank account. Who knows Zach? I'll throw this one up to you. I don't look at this story and be like, oh, this is like a, a big ominous bad dark cloud story. I just think our boy is, you know, he's traveling all over around the world, he needs some money. Hey, man, I'm with you. I think big picture like this is the funny thing about crypto, right? You get to watch this stuff happen, you just get to see it. You're like, oh we know that this is a wallet associative of tal and you know, he chose to keep that in the public domain essentially. And now we can sort of see the the flows of money across uh the world into these exchange addresses, right? So it is just kind of a funny feature of crypto and I never, it never, it never gets dull to me that we can have these conversations based on, on chain activity and unchain activity alone, right? We don't know his intent. We don't know why we don't know what's, what's happening. We just know that we can watch this thing move from point A to point B and deduce, maybe that there's something uh animating that, right? And I think that's a really funny feature of crypto that we can talk about these things. Um without any other knowledge, aside from the fact that we just know one wallet interacted with another, and therefore we know this one happens to be vital and we can speculate on whatever the million dollars is gonna be for if it's for, you know, I don't know, getting more travel luggage. So he can go to different places around the world or not. But, yeah, I don't know. There's not much to say here. I don't know, is gonna, like, change people's price project like projections for Ethereum. Right? Or if it change, I don't think this indicates that like, vital is any less bullish on his creation. But it is just kind of a funny thing. Um, least blotter section of like Ethereum Daily News that you can, uh, I don't know, read with your morning coffee. Well, I say really quick before I hand it over to Wendy. Uh, the funny part about this is the Ethereum Foundation, which of course is a steward of a lot that happens in Ethereum does sell the top almost every single cycle. They have like successfully sold the top on Eth and they put that money back into the Treasury to support grants for Ethereum ecosystem. So it ends up, I think being a net positive. But a lot of people look at when the Ethereum Foundation sells and then sort of make a note about that. And this one, people, obviously not at the top. We're down about, you know, 50 plus percent from the top in 2021 2022. But people might be looking at this and be like, oh, maybe we're looking at like another lower point in the future. If Italic is selling Wendy, it's a one, it's one, literally $1 million. It's really not a lot of money, especially when you're looking at Crypto Whale Wall. It's like there's so many people that are moving around a lot more capital that are loaning it out doing things. I also want to reference a story from coin desk back in March or excuse me, May 17th of 2021 vital 6 billion in ship token says he doesn't want the power so vital has kind of been infamous of doing different things with his funds and wallets that have been tracked. So I don't think it's necessarily a big deal that he moved 1 million of worth to coin base. I think if it was going to be a very, very large amount, it probably would be done. OTC. Um but maybe he just wanted the, hey, maybe he wanted to bridge the funds over to base or to um friend who knows, who knows? Yeah, Wendy, this isn't the first time Vital has sold either. So I don't think this is gonna like do anything to the markets, but I wanted to ask all of you a question based on what said, what do we think if, if vital does cash out a million dollars here, what do we think he's gonna buy? What luxury luggage does vital buy. I love his luggage post. That's one of the better blogs out there is how vital lives out of a 40 liter backpack and here's how he does it. That one is a good piece of content. A lot of 40 liter backpacks. If we're talking a million dollars, I don't think it's that hungry. Maybe he's hungry. He gotta buy snacks. A lot of backpack. All right. Don't know. Don't know."}]. Analyze the news and estimate the market trend accordingly.
*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
Based on the news provided, it appears that Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has moved $1 million worth of ETH to Coinbase. This action has raised speculation in the market, with some suggesting that he may be preparing for a significant sell-off. Additionally, the broader cryptocurrency market has been experiencing a downturn, with both Bitcoin and ETH seeing losses recently.

The movement of ETH by Vitalik Buterin to Coinbase, along with the overall market conditions, could potentially lead to increased selling pressure on Ethereum. This could result in a further decline in ETH price in the near term.

Furthermore, the news also highlights the increasing activity across Ethereum's Layer 2 networks, with throughput hitting record highs. This could indicate growing interest and adoption of Layer 2 solutions, which may have a positive impact on the Ethereum ecosystem in the long run.

Overall, the combination of Vitalik Buterin's ETH transfer to Coinbase, the market downturn, and the developments in Layer 2 networks suggest a mixed outlook for Ethereum. Short-term price volatility and potential downward pressure may be expected, but the long-term prospects for Ethereum's scalability and network efficiency through Layer 2 solutions remain promising. Traders and investors should closely monitor market developments and adjust their strategies accordingly.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, the market trend for ETH is currently bullish. The technical indicators are signaling a buy or hold position, and there is potential for further price increases in the near future. Additionally, the active trading activity in the market and the successful transactions indicate a positive market sentiment.

However, the news analyst report highlights some potential short-term challenges for Ethereum, such as the movement of ETH by Vitalik Buterin to Coinbase and the overall market downturn. These factors could lead to increased selling pressure on Ethereum and result in a further decline in ETH price in the near term.

Considering both reports, it is evident that the market trend for ETH is bullish in the long term, but there may be short-term volatility and downward pressure. Therefore, I would recommend a cautious approach and suggest a slight sell action to capitalize on the potential short-term challenges.

Diving deep into the charts, renowned crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen has surfaced with a noteworthy insight that raises concerns for the altcoin giant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe crux of the matter lies in ETH's breach of the dynamic support line, signified by the Bull Market Support Band indicator. This echoes a pattern last witnessed over four years ago. Back then, Ethereum suffered a pivotal level loss, paving the way for a tumultuous six-month journey where its value plummeted by a staggering 48%, only finding reprieve by the close of December 2019.\n\nIn 2019, #ETH fell below its Bull Market Support Band in July/August, just as it has in 2023. pic.twitter.com/36v6BEDch1 — Benjamin Cowen (@intocryptoverse) August 22, 2023\n\nWith history appearing to echo itself, the stakes are high for ETH's journey through the remainder of this year and the advent of 2024. An unsettling projection arises from Cowen's analysis, spotlighting the potential for Ethereum to slide toward the $900 mark per token.\n\nConvergence of perspectives\n\nNotably, Cowen is not the sole voice predicting such an outcome. Just a day prior, crypto analyst Ali Martinez , renowned in his own right, also foresaw a comparable fate for Ethereum based on meticulous technical analysis. Martinez articulated that Ethereum's fall beneath the $1,600-$1,550 range could lay the groundwork for a substantial correction ranging from 37% to 45%, ultimately targeting the $1,000 mark.\n\nAs the situation continues to evolve, it is increasingly evident that dark clouds are amassing over Ethereum, casting a shadow of uncertainty not only on the altcoin itself but also on the broader crypto market."}, {'id': 1, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NidGMuY29tL2FuYWx5c2lzL2V0aC9ldGhlcmV1bS1wcmljZS1zZWxsaW5nLWludGVyZXN0LTE3MDAv0gFOaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmV3c2J0Yy5jb20vYW5hbHlzaXMvZXRoL2V0aGVyZXVtLXByaWNlLXNlbGxpbmctaW50ZXJlc3QtMTcwMC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Tue, 22 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Ethereum Price Key Indicators Suggest Rising Selling Interest Below $1,700 - NewsBTC', 'content': 'Ethereum price is struggling to recover above the $1,700 resistance against the US Dollar.

As per Glassnode Alerts’ tweet, the number of ETH addresses in loss reached a seven-month high of 42,602,870.333.\n\nHowever, upon taking a closer look, the reason behind the downtrend might not have been less network activity. This was because while ETH’s active addresses dropped, Layer-2s like Base, Optimism [OP], and rollups gained popularity.\n\nThe primary reason behind market participants shifting to L2s was that they offered more scalability. For reference, Coinbase’s L2 Base bridged $251 million, with ETH accounting for $155 million out of the total within days of launch.\n\nA closer look at Ethereum’s state\n\nA look at Ethereum’s on-chain performance gave a better understanding of what was going on in the ecosystem. Upon checking, it was revealed that investors in funds and trusts, including Grayscale, have relatively weak buying sentiment.\n\nAdditionally, as per CryptoQuant, ETH’s net deposit on exchanges was high compared to the seven-day average, suggesting high selling pressure. However, it was interesting to see that when ETH fell victim to the latest price correction, investors took it as an opportunity to increase accumulation.\n\nThis was evident from Glassnode Alerts’ tweet, which pointed out that Ethereum’s exchange outflow volume reached a one-month high during that period.\n\n? #Ethereum $ETH Exchange Outflow Volume (7d MA) just reached a 1-month high of 9,627.006 ETH Previous 1-month high of 9,608.990 ETH was observed on 20 August 2023 View metric:https://t.co/LzFffVHu6i pic.twitter.com/dhJIEP4CZO — glassnode alerts (@glassnodealerts) August 21, 2023\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today\n\nNot only metrics, but a few market indicators were also bearish. For example, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) displayed a bullish edge in the market.\n\nFurthermore, ETH’s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) also registered a downtick, increasing the chances of a price decline. Nonetheless, the Money Flow Index (MFI) rebounded from the oversold zone, which can help the token increase its price.'}, {'id': 6, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy92aWRlb3MvMjAyMy0wOC0yMi9ob3ctYnVzaW5lc3Nlcy1zaG91bGQtdXNlLWV0aGVyZXVtLXZpZGVv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Tue, 22 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "How EY's Brody Thinks Businesses Should Use Ethereum - Bloomberg", 'content': "00:00\n\nPaul, I want to first get your take on the FCC case, maybe not as as a judge, but just as someone who watches crypto.

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
Based on the news articles provided, there are mixed signals regarding the Ethereum (ETH) market trend:

1. The first article from U.Today suggests that Ethereum is teetering on the edge of a scenario reminiscent of 2019, with concerns raised by renowned crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen about a potential slide towards the $900 mark per token. This analysis indicates a bearish outlook for Ethereum.

2. The second article from NewsBTC highlights that Ethereum is struggling to recover above the $1,700 resistance level against the US Dollar. The technical analysis suggests that if Ethereum fails to clear the $1,700 resistance, it could start another decline. This also points towards a bearish trend for Ethereum.

3. The third article from AMBCrypto News discusses the decline in Ethereum's network activity and the potential reasons behind ETH's price drop. The article mentions that despite the decline in network activity, investors are taking advantage of the price correction to increase accumulation. This mixed signal could indicate a neutral to slightly bearish sentiment.

4. The fourth article from Bloomberg features insights from EY's Brody on how businesses should use Ethereum. Brody emphasizes the potential of Ethereum as a global computing infrastructure and the importance of blockchain technology for business ecosystems. This positive outlook suggests a bullish sentiment

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, the ETH market trend appears to be bullish. The stable open prices, increasing number of transactions and unique addresses, as well as the signals from various technical indicators all point towards a positive outlook for Ethereum.

However, the news analyst report presents a mixed picture with some articles suggesting a bearish trend for Ethereum due to concerns about price levels and resistance levels. Despite this, there are also positive insights about the potential of Ethereum as a global computing infrastructure and the continued accumulation by investors during price corrections.

Taking into consideration both reports, it seems that the overall sentiment is leaning towards a bullish trend for ETH. The positive indicators from the on-chain analysis outweigh the bearish signals from the news articles.

Therefore, I would recommend buying ETH with a confidence level of -0.6.

With the move, the U.S. joins other countries where Bitstamp staking services aren\'t available, including Canada, Japan, Singapore and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe decision appears to be related to recent legal developments in the United States. In early August, Bitstamp announced at least seven altcoins would no longer be offered in the country. They were Axie Infinity (AXS), Chiliz (CHZ), Decentraland (MANA), Polygon (MATIC), Near (NEAR), The Sandbox (SAND) and Solana (SOL). While the company didn’t specify why it suspended trading, all seven tokens were deemed unregistered securities by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in June as part of its lawsuits against crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase.\n\nUpdate for our US users\n\n\n\nStarting August 29: AXS, CHZ, MANA, MATIC, NEAR, SAND, and SOL trading will be halted after evaluating recent market developments.\n\n\n\nExecute any open trades. Holding and withdrawing tokens afterwards will be unaffected.\n\n\n\nMore info:… — Bitstamp (@Bitstamp) August 8, 2023\n\nEther is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain and the second largest by market cap behind Bitcoin (BTC).

Optimistic rollups are “optimistic” in nature as they assume transactions are valid until proven otherwise.\n\nMost rollups today only have one single sequencer, meaning there is a centralization risk, Anurag Arjun, co-founder of modular blockchain Avail, told Blockworks.\n\nThis is not a major problem at present, as rollup solutions must put the raw transaction data on Ethereum using something called calldata — the cheapest form of storage on Ethereum today, as Arjun notes.\n\nOnce a calldata is submitted to Ethereum mainnet, anyone can challenge whether or not it is accurate within a set period of time, according to Neel Somani, the founder of blockchain scaling solution Eclipse.\n\nIf no one challenges the validity of the rollup, it will be accepted on Ethereum once the period of time is up.\n\nThe problem, Somani notes, is how someone can then prove that a transaction was executed inaccurately if they don’t have the data.\n\n“If I don’t tell you what I executed, there’s no way for you to possibly prove that it is wrong, so you need to know exactly what I executed in order to fix that,” Somani said. “So all blockchains must prove data availability in some way, shape or form.”\n\nData availability sampling\n\nAs all blockchains must prove data availability, it can be inefficient to download a full block onto a network, which again invokes the initial data availability problem.\n\n“So as someone who doesn’t want to download the full block, I still want the confidence that the information on the block is not being withheld,” Somani said.\n\nThe solution, according to Somani, is the use of data availability sampling to gain confidence that the block is actually there.\n\nData availability sampling involves sampling random parts of the block to obtain arbitrarily high confidence that the block is there, Somani explains.\n\nThis technology utilizes polynomials — a mathematical expression comprising variables, coefficients and exponentiation — to model relationships between variables in a block.\n\nA common misinterpretation of data availability sampling is that if you sample half the block, you only gain 50% confidence that the information in the block is accurate, Somani said. This isn’t true, he explains, because as with data availability sampling, users must make sure that they have enough points to recover the original polynomial.\n\nProjects like Celestia and Avail are currently building out data availability sampling solutions.\n\n“What we sincerely believe is that every base layer is going to be a data availability layer,” Arjun told Blockworks. “The main directional fight that we are having is wanting to scale data availability at the base layer, and have execution and roll up on the second layer.”\n\nDon’t miss the next big story – join our free daily newsletter.'}].

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***

This signified a substantial increase in staking volume.\n\nAccording to CryptoMarketCap, the total circulating supply of ETH had surpassed 120 million as of this writing.

Nonetheless, this metric has undergone a substantial reduction in recent months.\n\nAs of this writing, the percentage of the circulating supply residing on exchanges hovered around 8.5%. Also, this shift signified a decrease from the January figure of over 13 million to approximately 10.7 million on exchanges.\n\nAdditionally, this reflected a scenario where an increasing number of holders were inclined to stake their ETH.

Source: a video screenshot, Lex Fridman / YouTube\n\nEthereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin has said he is “definitely” worried about centralization risks following The Merge, the event when the current Ethereum Mainnet merges with the beacon chain proof-of-stake (PoS) system.\n\nThe Ethereum mastermind noted that Lido Finance, the largest provider of staking services for Ethereum, where around a third of staked ETH (stETH) has been deposited, could theoretically disturb the Ethereum network post-Merge.\n\n“But I also think it’s important to not overly catastrophize the issue,” he added.\n\n“First of all, if you have a third [of staked Ether deposits on the Beacon chain], you can’t revert the chain or whatever,” Buterin said in an interview with Fortune, adding:\n\n“But realistically, the worst that you could do is make finality stop happening for about a day or so, which is inconvenient, but it’s not that terrible.”\n\nButerin also mentioned that Lido does not act as a single entity but that “they have something like 21 delegates and nodes that are running these validators that are inside of Lido,” he said, claiming that “there’s a lot of good decentralization between them.”\n\nLido is the largest provider of staking services for Ethereum. Generally, users who want to become Ethereum 2.0 validators and earn rewards need to stake a minimum of ETH 32, which is a high price.\n\nHowever, Lido enables users to pool their ETH and participate in staking even if they don’t have the required ETH 32. The protocol distributes stETH tokens to users in return for their staked coins, which can be redeemed for ETH in the future or traded for other coins.\n\nThe Merge is Ethereum’s long-anticipated update expected to happen by the end of the year.\n\nThe upgrade has several benefits, Buterin said, noting that it makes Ethereum more environmentally friendly compared to the current proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism. According to last year’s estimate by a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, this upgrade can cut the energy used by the Ethereum network by at least 99.95%.\n\n“Also, proof of stake can increase the safety of the system. It makes it more expensive to attack,” Buterin told Fortune. “It makes it easier to recover from an attack, which is something people don’t think about.”\n\nAnother benefit is that PoS is more censorship-resistant. That is because, Buterin says, “miners are easier to detect and easier to shut down than just computers that are running validator nodes.”\n\nMeanwhile, at 10:33 UTC, ETH is trading at USD 1,156, up by 3% over the past 24 hours and down 4% over the past 7 days. The coin is also down by more than 76% compared to its all-time high of USD 4,878 recorded in November last year.\n\n____\n\nLearn more:\n\n– Dominant Staking Pool Lido Causing ‘Long Lasting’ Damage to Ethereum, But Aims to Improve\n\n– Ethereum’s Ropsten Test is ‘Almost’ Bug-Free, Two More Testnets to Go Before the Merge\n\n\n\n– Major Bitcoin & Crypto Companies Warn of ‘Extreme’ Risk in Proof-of-Stake Systems\n\n– The Compromises and Benefits of Ethereum Switching to a Proof-of-Stake Network\n\n\n\n– Contradictory Vitalik Buterin Says He Wants a More Bitcoin-like Ethereum\n\n– Top Blockchain Non-Financial Applications According to Vitalik Buterin\n\n\n\n– Ethereum Beacon Chain Experienced a 7-block Reorg, More Work Needed Ahead of The Merge\n\n– Ethereum’s Merge Could Lower Demand for Bitcoin but Regulatory & Technical Challenges Persist'}, {'id': 3, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd2F0Y2hlci5ndXJ1L25ld3MvaG93LWxvbmctd2lsbC1pdC10YWtlLWZvci1ldGhlcmV1bS10by1yZWFjaC01MDAw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Fri, 25 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'How Long Will it Take for Ethereum to Reach $5000? - Watcher Guru', 'content': 'How Long Will it Take for Ethereum to Reach $5,000?: Guide\n\n\u200dThe world of cryptocurrencies has been buzzing with excitement as Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, continues to make waves in the market.\n\nInvestors and enthusiasts alike are eagerly awaiting for Ethereum to reach its all-time high of $5000.\n\nIn this article, we will explore the factors that could contribute to Ethereum’s price surge and discuss how long it might take for ETH to reach this significant milestone.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum: Rising Shorts, Whale Interest Opens Bullish Speculation\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum and its Price Movements\n\nEthereum is a decentralized blockchain platform that enables developers to build and deploy smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps).\n\nUtilizing a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, is more energy-efficient than Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism.\n\nVarious factors, such as market demand, investor sentiment, technological advancements, regulatory changes, and overall market conditions, shape Ethereum’s price.\n\nIt is essential to consider these factors when trying to predict the future price movements of ETH.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin Moves 600 ETH to Coinbase; What’s the Motive?\n\nThe Recent Performance of Ethereum\n\nIn recent weeks, Ethereum has experienced a significant surge in price, surpassing several key resistance levels.\n\nThe price of ETH has risen steadily, reflecting the growing interest and confidence in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nSeveral factors contribute to Ethereum’s price rally: the generally positive crypto market sentiment, wider blockchain technology adoption, and the surging popularity of decentralized finance (DeFi) apps on Ethereum’s platform.\n\nThe potential for Ethereum to reach $5,000\n\nSource: Pixabay\n\nMany experts and analysts believe that Ethereum has the potential to reach $5000 in the future.

Debate continues on Ethereum’s classification.\n\nLegal clarity is vital to avoid regulatory uncertainty and to guide industry growth.\n\nEthereum’s journey from ICO to decentralization has shaped its status.\n\nImportance Of Determining Ethereum’s Legal Classification As A Security\n\nDetermining Ethereum’s legal classification as a security is considered to be an important regulatory decision that would impact the cryptocurrency space. The reason is because securities laws affect regulations with trading laws, issuance laws, and investment practices.\n\nThe Howey Test, referenced by the Securities and Exchange Commision (SEC), defines whether an asset is a security. The outcome of this decision will also influence investor protection, market stability, and innovation in the crypto space.\n\nBackground On Securities And How Securities Are Regulated Under US Law\n\nThe regulation of crypto-assets, particularly in relation to securities is a complex issue. In general, securities sold or traded in the U.S. must be registered, and the registration process involves providing essential facts about the company’s or cryptos properties, business, and the security itself.\n\nThe SEC’s role includes minimizing compliance while ensuring investor protection. These regulations are designed to provide investors with access to relevant information about investments before and after investing, and to prevent conflicts of interest in the securities industry.\n\nDefinition Of Securities\n\nSecurities are fungible and tradable financial instruments to raise capital in both the public and private markets. Securities can include notes, stocks, bonds, certificates of interest, collateral trust certificates, and more. These instruments then serve as a means for individuals and entities to invest, speculate, and manage risk within the financial markets.\n\nThe term “security” covers a broad range of investments, and its definition can vary based on jurisdiction and context. Securities play a pivotal role in capital markets, enabling companies and governments to access funding while offering investors opportunities for potential returns and income.\n\nWhat Is The Howey Test? Explanation Of The Howey Test\n\nThe SEC is a U.S. government oversight agency responsible for regulating the securities markets and safeguarding investors. The SEC’s jurisdiction extends to various aspects of financial markets, including investment banks, trading, financial dealings, product offerings, advertising, and fiduciary responsibilities.\n\nThe Howey Test is a legal framework used in the United States to determine whether a transaction qualifies as an investment contract and thus falls under securities regulations. The test originates from the landmark Supreme Court case SEC v. W.J. Howey Co in 1946.\n\nThe test consists of three main elements:\n\nAn investment of money,\n\nIn a common enterprise,\n\nWith an expectation of profits primarily from the efforts of others.\n\nIf these three elements are met, the transaction is considered a security, subject to the regulations set forth by SEC. The Howey Test serves as a fundamental guideline for classifying various financial arrangements and offerings in terms of whether they require compliance with securities laws and regulations, ensuring investor protection and transparency in financial markets.\n\nEthereum’s Characteristics And SEC’s Perspective On Ethereum\n\nEthereum is a decentralized blockchain platform known for its programmable smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). It enables developers to build and deploy decentralized applications on its network, offering features like transparency, immutability, and trustlessness. Ethereum’s native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), is used for transactions and to incentivize network participants.\n\nThe U.S. SEC has indicated that whether a particular cryptocurrency, like Ether, constitutes a security depends on its specific characteristics and how it is marketed and sold. The SEC has noted that if a cryptocurrency operates as a security , it falls under its regulatory jurisdiction, subject to applicable securities laws. The classification of cryptocurrencies like Ethereum is based on the Howey Test and other legal considerations to determine their status as securities or commodities, impacting their regulatory oversight and legal compliance.\n\nSEC’s Statements and Actions Regarding Cryptocurrencies And Tokens\n\nThe U.S. SEC has actively engaged with the evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies and tokens through its statements and actions. The SEC’s emphasis on investor protection and market integrity has led to a series of public statements clarifying its position on digital assets. It has consistently emphasized that whether a particular cryptocurrency or token qualifies as a security depends on the underlying facts and circumstances, with the Howey Test being a pivotal framework.\n\nOn July 25, 2017, the SEC released an investigative report addressing the treatment of digital assets, specifically tokens offered by “virtual” organizations through distributed ledger or blockchain technology. The report emphasized that these assets, often marketed as “Initial Coin Offerings” (ICOs) or “Token Sales,” could fall under the scope of federal securities laws. The SEC’s stance was whether an asset is a security depends on the factual and economic nature of the transaction rather than the terminology or technology employed.\n\nThe investigative report on the case of “The DAO,” a virtual organization that offered and sold tokens. The SEC concluded that these tokens were securities, thereby subject to federal securities laws. The report underscored that entities issuing securities via distributed ledger or blockchain technology must adhere to registration requirements, unless a valid exemption applies.\n\nAdditionally, unregistered offerings and securities exchanges facilitating trading in these securities could face liabilities.While the SEC is open to innovative technologies, its measured approach underscores the need to balance innovation with the protection of investors and the integrity of the markets.\n\nExamination Of SEC’s Stance On Ethereum’s Status As A Security\n\nThe position on whether Ethereum’s status is a security or not is not so well defined. While Ethereum initially launched through a token sale, the SEC’s perspective has evolved over time. Former Chairman Jay Clayton highlighted that as Ethereum decentralized and its network matured, it might not fit the traditional definition of a security subject to securities regulations.\n\nThe determination hinges on whether the sale of Ether, Ethereum’s native cryptocurrency, involved the investment of money in a common enterprise with an expectation of profits primarily from the efforts of others, the key elements of the Howey Test. The SEC’s cautious and nuanced approach reflects its commitment to balance innovation and investor protection in the rapidly evolving digital asset landscape.\n\nContrary to initial concerns, Gary Gensler, head of the SEC, reportedly indicated in 2018, that he also doesn’t view Ethereum as a security based on his interpretation of its historical issuance and network distribution. He referenced his earlier remarks from a 2018 lecture at MIT, where he emphasized that Ethereum was likely offered and sold as a security during its initial coin offering (ICO) phase.\n\nGensler’s statement aligns with the idea that the initial sale of a token could be considered a security offering, but over time, if the token’s network becomes sufficiently decentralized, it may no longer meet the criteria of a security. This view holds significance for Ethereum’s regulatory treatment and could impact how other cryptocurrencies are evaluated by the SEC.\n\nAnalysis Of Speeches, Regulations, And Enforcement Actions Relevant To Ethereum\n\nThe analysis of speeches, regulations, and enforcement actions relevant to Ethereum, offers insight into the SEC’s evolving stance. Various officials’ speeches have indicated the importance of evaluating the underlying characteristics of a cryptocurrency and its manner of distribution to determine its regulatory status. The issuance of guidance, the establishment of a framework, and subsequent statements by SEC officials have further clarified its position.\n\nConclusion\n\nDetermining Ethereum’s legal status as security is key for cryptocurrency regulation and market prices. The SEC’s approach using the Howey Test emphasizes investor protection, market stability, and innovation. While Bitcoin is often seen as a commodity, Ethereum’s classification remains debated.\n\nClarity is crucial to alleviate regulatory ambiguity, fostering industry growth. Understanding securities and the SEC’s role is essential; they govern investment instruments and ensure market fairness. Ethereum’s evolving journey from ICO issuance to a decentralized network shapes its status. Former and current SEC chairs, Clayton and Gensler, offer nuanced perspectives on the definition of Ethereum.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat is the significance of determining Ethereum’s legal classification?\n\nEthereum’s classification impacts its regulatory treatment, influencing trading, issuance, and investment practices in the cryptocurrency space.\n\nHow does the Howey Test affect cryptocurrency regulation?\n\nThe Howey Test helps determine if a transaction qualifies as an investment contract, potentially subjecting it to securities regulations for investor protection.\n\nWhat is the SEC’s role in regulating securities?\n\nThe SEC safeguards investors and maintains market fairness by overseeing securities markets, ensuring transparency, and preventing insider advantages.\n\nWhy is legal clarity important for cryptocurrencies like Ethereum?\n\nClear classification mitigates regulatory uncertainty, fostering industry development while balancing innovation and investor safeguarding in the digital asset landscape.'}].

Co-founder Roman Semenov, who was also named in the indictment, remains at large in Dubai.\n\nLast year, the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) banned Americans from using privacy mixer Tornado Cash, claiming that criminals had used it to launder money—specifically naming the North Korean state-sponsored hacker organization Lazarus Group.\n\nEarlier this week, the legislative body of the Central African Republic (CAR) granted approval for the tokenization of land and natural resources to help the government position the country as an up-and-coming business destination in Africa.\n\nThe project launched last year with resource tokenization in mind; it is meant to facilitate investment in CAR through Sango Coin, a state-issued token—though not a Central Bank Digital Currency—backed by Bitcoin on a sidechain network. However, initial responses to Sango Coin’s launch were lukewarm.'}, {'id': 2, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NidGMuY29tL25ld3MvZXRoZXJldW0vZXRoZXJldW0tb3duZXJzaGlwLWNlbnRyYWxpemF0aW9uL9IBTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NidGMuY29tL25ld3MvZXRoZXJldW0vZXRoZXJldW0tb3duZXJzaGlwLWNlbnRyYWxpemF0aW9uL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Sat, 26 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'This Ethereum Metric Has Sparked Centralization Concerns Over ETH Ownership - NewsBTC', 'content': 'Crypto blockchains are designed to be fully decentralized so that no single person or group has control. However, new data has shown that the top 10 Ethereum addresses control over 35% of the total ETH supply. For a network that was designed to be decentralized, this has sparked some serious concerns over how centralized ETH has become.\n\nThe 10 Largest Ethereum Addresses Hold Over 35% Of The Available Supply\n\nWhile sharing the metric on social media platform X, crypto market intelligence platform Santiment showed how holdings of the 10 largest Ethereum addresses have now climbed to 35% of the total supply.\n\nThis indicates that while small traders have been trying to offload their supply during the recent price crash, many ETH whales are taking the chance to buy the dip.\n\n🐳 The 10 largest addresses on the #Ethereum network are now holding over 35% of the available supply.

Data shows that these addresses held only 11.2% of the total supply in August 2018, and then rose to 24% in August 2022.

One of Binance’s wallets (Binance 7) holds over 1.66%, while the exchange also holds large ETH amounts in other wallets, making it the largest of any single entity.\n\nIn comparison, the top 10 addresses of Bitcoin, the largest crypto in the world, own only 5.35% of the total supply.

More deposits into the contract signal that more investors are depositing to become validators in ETH 2.0.\n\nInterestingly, the number of wallets holding between 10 and 10,000 ETH has risen to 355,000, and 1,788 more 10-10,000 ETH wallets have been added since the beginning of June.

And after a whirlwind surge in 2023, prices are falling yet again.\n\nHowever, many cryptocurrencies have still proven to be incredibly lucrative long-term investments. For example, while the price of Ethereum (ETH 0.42%) has fallen by around 11% over the last month, it's still up more than 300% over the last three years -- and that's despite the brutal crypto winter throughout 2022.\n\nIf crypto prices rebound, we could see similar gains over time. And while past performance doesn't predict future returns, it can sometimes be encouraging to look at how much you could have earned if you'd invested years ago.\n\nHow far could Ethereum have taken you?\n\nEthereum is one of the biggest success stories to come out of the crypto market. Despite extreme volatility, it remains the second most popular name in the industry. It currently has a market cap of around $198 billion, making up around 20% of the entire crypto sector.\n\nWhile it certainly hasn't been immune to volatility, it's also fared better than many of its competitors. Its price is currently down by around 65% from its peak in late 2021, while Cardano has fallen by a staggering 87% in that time, and Solana has plummeted by around 91%.\n\nFor long-term investors who stuck it out through the rough patches, Ethereum has been a lucrative investment. Here's how much $100 of Ethereum would be worth today, depending on when you'd invested:\n\nDate Invested Ethereum Returns as of Today How Much $100 Would Be Worth Today Aug. 1, 2021 -30% $70 Aug. 1, 2020 333% $433 Aug. 1, 2019 671% $771\n\nThe short term can be rocky for crypto, and if you'd invested in late 2021 right before prices plummeted, your investment would have declined in value. But if you'd invested just four years ago and held through all the ups and downs, you'd have nearly 8 times your initial investment by today.\n\nIs Ethereum a good investment right now?\n\nAgain, past performance doesn't predict future returns. There are never any guarantees when investing, and this is especially true with crypto due to its speculative nature. No one can say, then, whether Ethereum will continue on its track of explosive long-term returns.\n\nThat said, Ethereum is one of the strongest players in the crypto space, and it has a slew of advantages. Its sheer size is one of them, as it's far and away the most popular network for decentralized applications -- such as NFT marketplaces, DeFi projects, and metaverse apps.\n\nEthereum's developers are also committed to consistently upgrading the blockchain to make it stronger and more useful. Last year, they successfully pulled off The Merge -- a landmark upgrade that moved Ethereum from the energy-intensive proof-of-work system to the far more efficient proof-of-stake model.\n\nThe Surge is one of the next eagerly awaited updates, and it aims to improve the network's speed and reduce transaction fees. These have long been two major pain points for Ethereum, and if developers are able to successfully pull off this update, it could be a game-changer.\n\nDownsides to consider before you buy\n\nWhile Ethereum has plenty of advantages, it won't be right for every portfolio.\n\nLike the crypto industry in general, Ethereum is still a speculative investment. Although it does have a fair amount of utility (especially compared to many of its competitors), its primary uses are also somewhat speculative right now. If NFTs, DeFi, or the metaverse become more mainstream, for instance, Ethereum could thrive. But if they never catch on, it could spell trouble.\n\nMuch of Ethereum's future success also hinges on its upcoming upgrades. If those updates take longer than expected to complete or there are significant hiccups during the rollouts, that could shake users' confidence -- and provide an opportunity for competitors to swoop in and grab market share.\n\nIn short, Ethereum is still speculative, but it's also one of the strongest investments in the crypto space right now. If you're willing to take on more risk for the chance to earn potentially lucrative returns over the long run, it may be a smart addition to your portfolio."}].

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

The asset has been impaired to its fair value at the year end."\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLast year, OnlyFans—infamous for the many adult performers hosted on the platform—made a splash in the crypto space by announcing that creators could use verified Ethereum NFTs in their profile images.

At the time of the NFT announcement, ETH was trading at $2,797.43, but fell to $1,298.94 by November 30 when the reporting period ended.

He delivers high-quality engaging articles to Coinpedia through his in-depth research and analysis.\n\nIn the past week, Bitcoin has experienced significant price fluctuations within its consolidation range, influenced by various macroeconomic factors such as Jerome Powell’s address. As Bitcoin falls short of meeting the short-term bullish expectations of investors, capital is increasingly flowing into the altcoin sector. Looking ahead to the coming week, a substantial recovery rally in the altcoin market is anticipated, with Ethereum, Litecoin, and Shiba Inu potentially leading this rally.\n\nAltcoins On The Edge Of Recovery\n\nBitcoin’s price continues to flash volatility near $26K in response to Powell’s hawkish comments. This development is somewhat expected, considering the bearish trend Bitcoin had been exhibiting in the days leading up to the Jackson Hole symposium. Traders had been preparing for Powell’s ongoing moves on controlling the inflation to align with the central bank’s 2% target.\n\nAmid this, the prices of Ethereum, Litecoin, and Shiba Inu have been hovering near key support levels. With sellers unable to push prices further downward, a potential bounce-back from these support levels is anticipated for the coming week.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis\n\nEther’s price recently attempted to break above $1,700 but couldn’t maintain its position, indicating strong defense from the bears at this price point.\n\nThe declining moving averages and the RSI below the midline suggest that bearish momentum still dominates. Sellers are likely to aim for pushing the price into the $1,625 to $1,544 range. If successful, we could see a drop below the support channel, plunging the ETH price toward the $1,360 level.\n\nConversely, bulls aren’t leaving the field easily. They are expected to robustly defend the support zone and attempt to push the price above the 50-day EMA of $1,678. If they manage this, it would imply that the ETH price could continue to hover in a bullish range of $1,785-$1,863.\n\nLitecoin Price Analysis\n\nLitecoin has been trading within a narrow band of $60 to $67 over the last several days. While the bulls have managed to hold a decline below the $60 support level, they’ve been unable to push past the $67 resistance.\n\nAn extended consolidation often leads to a solid breakout momentum ahead, and LTC price might experience that soon. If bulls successfully break above the consolidation next week, LTC price could initially target the 200-day EMA at $77 before aiming for the more ambitious $85 mark, where significant bearish activity is expected.\n\nConversely, it’s crucial for the bulls to defend the $60 support level. Failure to do so could trigger the next downward phase, potentially driving the price to $47.\n\nShiba Inu Price Analysis\n\nThe extended wick on SHIB’s candle pattern indicates that bearish traders are still active, selling off during upward movements.\n\nIf the price falls below the immediate support level of $0.000008, it would imply that the bears are still in control. In such a scenario, SHIB’s price could decline to a low of $0.0000077. A further drop below this point could lead to a retest of the long-standing support at $0.00000705.\n\nOn the other hand, a surge above EMA50 will strengthen bullish positions, sending the meme coin toward $0.00001.'}].

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, the Ethereum (ETH) market trend appears to be bullish. The open prices have been stable with a slight increase, the number of transactions and unique addresses are growing, and various technical indicators are signaling a "buy" sentiment. This suggests that there is potential for further growth in the near future.

However, the news analyst report presents a mixed outlook on Ethereum. While there are positive signals such as OnlyFans investing in Ethereum, there are also concerns about a decrease in the value of its holdings and bearish indicators like the falling MVRV ratio and other market indicators pointing towards a potential price decline.

Considering both reports, it seems that the overall market trend for Ethereum is leaning towards a bullish sentiment, despite some mixed signals. Therefore, I would recommend buying ETH with a negative value to capitalize on the potential growth in the market.

(Ethereum Price Analysis) - CryptoPotato', 'content': 'Following an unexpected and rapid drop from the $1.8K threshold, Ethereum’s price experienced a significant dip, falling below the critical 100-day and 200-day moving averages (MAs).\n\nThis development is considered a significant bearish sign for ETH. However, the price managed to find support within a crucial range, hinting at the possibility of an imminent consolidation phase.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nA close examination of the daily chart reveals that the price’s breach beneath the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, around $1,835 and $1,800 correspondingly, caused a marked downtrend that eventually landed Ethereum’s value within the pivotal support zone at $1.6K.\n\nIt’s important to note that the 200-day moving average holds substantial significance as an indicator of prevailing market trends. Traditionally, a bearish sentiment engulfs the market when the price remains below this MA.\n\nCurrently, the $1.6K support level has proven its resilience in upholding the price, indicating the potential for a recovery and subsequent pullback. However, the recent downtrend has shifted the market’s structure into a more bearish stance, thus enhancing the possibility of a retest of the $1,400 zone in the upcoming weeks.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nTurning attention to the 4-hour timeframe, it becomes evident that ETH lost the critical support point of $1.8K. This quick decline led the price to find support within the range of $1.5K, resulting in a temporary end of the prevailing downtrend.\n\nRemarkably, this support level has so far demonstrated its efficacy in maintaining the price, resulting in a period of sideways consolidation. As a consequence of this consolidation phase, Ethereum’s price movement has taken on the form of a roughly symmetrical triangle pattern. This technical pattern can develop into bullish and bearish signals depending on the direction in which the pattern’s breakout occurs.\n\nOn-chain Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nEthereum’s price trajectory currently remains in a state of uncertainty, displaying no clear inclination towards an upward or downward movement. Consequently, as the price chart offers limited insights into forthcoming market trends, delving into the futures market sentiment might provide valuable insights into Ethereum’s current state.\n\nThe following chart illustrates Ethereum’s funding rates, a pivotal point for identifying the dominance between long traders and short sellers. Positive values align with a bullish outlook, while negative values signify a bearish stance.\n\nNotably, an apparent pattern emerges from the data. Following a sudden impulsive decline, succeeded by a consolidation phase with stagnant price action, the funding rates undertook a downward trend, forming lower peaks on the chart. This unfolding scenario hints at a lack of interest in going long in the futures market, potentially paving the way for a bearish trajectory.\n\nNonetheless, despite the prevailing bearish sentiment, there remains the possibility of a minor corrective phase preceding a more pronounced downward trend. Should the funding rates assume a negative stance, this could elevate the likelihood of a cascade of short liquidations, potentially leading to a substantial bullish rebound that propels the price upwards.'}].

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report and news analyst report, the overall market trend for Ethereum (ETH) appears to be bullish. The on-chain data indicates a strong buying sentiment with increasing open prices, number of transactions, unique addresses, and value transferred. Technical indicators also suggest a "buy" sentiment, further supporting the bullish trend.

The news articles highlight positive developments such as OnlyFans' parent company investing $20 million in Ethereum, indicating confidence in the cryptocurrency's growth potential. Additionally, 1inch's purchase of $10 million worth of Ethereum after a major fund withdrawal shows movement in the market and potential for further growth.

Considering the bullish market trend and positive news, I am confident in the upward trajectory of ETH. Therefore, I recommend buying ETH with a significant portion of cash to maximize potential profits.

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
Based on the news articles provided, it seems that Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin have been rising without any new triggers. This could indicate a positive trend in the cryptocurrency market, as these major cryptocurrencies are experiencing growth even without specific catalysts.

Additionally, there is news about Polygon releasing a 'Chain Development Kit' for ZK-Powered Networks on Ethereum. This development could potentially attract more users and investors to the Ethereum network, leading to increased demand for Ethereum and potentially driving up its price.

On the other hand, there is news about OnlyFans' parent company facing Ethereum losses after investing $19 million in 2022. This could have a negative impact on Ethereum's price in the short term, as the selling pressure from the parent company could lead to a decrease in Ethereum's value.

Overall, the market trend for Ethereum could be mixed in the short term, with potential upside from the Polygon development but downside pressure from the selling of Ethereum by OnlyFans' parent company. As for Bitcoin and Dogecoin, the positive trend without new triggers could continue in the near future.

Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, the ETH market trend is currently bullish. The open prices have been stable with a slight increase, the number of transactions and unique addresses are growing, and most signals indicate a buy signal. This suggests that there is strong buying momentum and positive indicators in the market.

On the other hand, the news analyst report indicates a mixed short-term trend for Ethereum. While there is potential upside from the Polygon development, there is also downside pressure from the selling of Ethereum by OnlyFans' parent company. This could lead to some uncertainty in the market in the near future.

Considering both reports, the overall sentiment seems to lean towards a bullish trend for Ethereum, with potential short-term fluctuations. Given the strong buying momentum and positive indicators highlighted in the on-chain analyst report, I am confident in predicting a continued upward trend for ETH.

It also holds more than 100 ERC-20 tokens, collectively worth $177.1 million. Those numbers bring Robinhood’s total holdings for all Ethereum-based tokens above $2.71 billion.\n\nArkham noted that the address holds funds in custody on behalf of Robinhood users. Robinhood’s trading model requires the company to back user balances at a 1:1 ratio in line with regulations set by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe four Ethereum addresses larger than Robinhood’s account include Ethereum’s beacon deposit contract, a wrapped Ether contract, and addresses belonging to major cryptocurrency exchanges Kraken and Binance.\n\nThe beacon deposit contract is by far the largest of those addresses. With more than 29 million ETH ($49.7 billion), it accounts for one-quarter of the entire Ethereum supply.\n\nRobinhood has addresses on other chains\n\nArkham’s data additionally shows that Robinhood holds funds on numerous other exchanges, including Avalanche ($29.83 million), Polygon ($1.40 million), Arbitrum ($395), and BNB Chain ($203). The funds that Robinhood holds on each of those blockchains are not entirely made up of the chain’s native token.\n\nIn total, Robinhood holds $7.39 billion of crypto in those addresses as of Aug. 30. The company’s earlier quarterly results indicated that it held $11.5 billion of assets related to user cryptocurrency safeguarding obligations on June 30. It is unclear whether this change is due to fluctuations in cryptocurrency prices or actual changes in the amount of crypto in each of Robinhood’s addresses.\n\nSo far, Robinhood has only confirmed to CryptoSlate that it owns the $3 billion Bitcoin address.

Until the real move happens and people don’t get a chance to get into their positions. That’s why positioning is super important to do that in an early stage, which is when you start to take a look at price levels.\n\nWe’re 10 months prior to the Bitcoin halving. The period where sentiment is the lowest and altcoins are usually swimming around their cycle lows. Bitcoin dominance is peaking, and will not peak to that level anymore in this cycle. It happened in 2015, ten months prior to the halving. It happened in 2019, ten months prior to the halving. It happens in 2023, ten months prior to the halving.”\n\nAccording to the analyst, the Bitcoin dominance chart is flashing bullish for altcoins as the the 200-week moving average (MA) and the 200-week exponential moving average (EMA) are starting to act like resistance just like they did months before Bitcoin’s 2020 halving event.\n\n“A clear rejection at the 200-Week MA and EMA and looking to continue the fall, while altcoins are slowly picking up in their BTC pairs as a new cycle starts. While nobody expects it.”\n\nHe also says that several altcoin projects, like Ethereum and blockchain oracle Chainlink (LINK), have continued to develop during the bear market, setting the stage for massive rally events when the bull cycle takes off.\n\n“Are projects still developing and did something change on that perspective? Well. The good part is that many fraudulent projects are washed out of the markets, while the good ones are constantly building further. Ethereum has swapped towards PoS (proof-of-stake) and is getting Ethereum ETFs (exchange-traded funds) based on futures in a month maximum. Chainlink has developed CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol) and I’m not even mentioning all the other progress in DeFi (decentralized finance), NFTs (non-fungible tokens) and more.”\n\nEthereum is trading for $1,733 at time of writing, up 5.1% in the last 24 hours.

(2023 Guide) - Watcher Guru', 'content': 'Can you Make Money with Ethereum?: Guide\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies can be a lucrative venture, but it’s important to carefully consider the potential risks and rewards before making any financial decisions.\n\nWhen it comes to Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, many investors wonder if it’s worth putting their money into this digital asset.\n\nIn this article, we will explore the long-term investment potential of Ethereum and provide insights into how you can make real money with this cryptocurrency.\n\nAlso read: Worldcoin’s Surge Causes Optimism to Dethrone Arbitrum in Daily Transactions\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum and its Potential Ethereum is not just a cryptocurrency; it is a decentralized blockchain platform that enables the creation of smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps).\n\nSource: Forbes\n\nThis unique feature sets Ethereum apart from other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code.\n\nThey automatically execute when certain conditions are met, eliminating the need for intermediaries and making transactions more efficient and secure.\n\nThe potential use cases for Ethereum are vast and extend beyond simple peer-to-peer transactions.\n\nThe platform can be used for a wide range of applications. This includes decentralized finance (DeFi), supply chain management, gaming, and even social media.\n\nThe demand for Ethereum is expected to grow exponentially. Most likely due to more industries recognizing the benefits of blockchain technology and smart contracts.\n\nThe long-term investment potential of Ethereum\n\nWhen considering Ethereum as a long-term investment, it’s important to look at several factors that contribute to its potential growth:\n\nAdoption and Use Cases\n\nEthereum’s versatility and widespread adoption make it an attractive investment option. As the platform continues to grow, the demand for Ethereum and its native token, Ether (ETH), is likely to increase.\n\nEthereum’s ability to support a wide range of industries contributes to its long-term investment potential.\n\nThe Shift to Proof-of-Stake (PoS)\n\nEthereum is in the process of transitioning from the current proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a more energy-efficient and secure proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism.\n\nThis upgrade, known as Ethereum 2.0, aims to address the scalability and environmental concerns associated with PoW.\n\nBy staking Ethereum, individuals can participate in the network’s consensus mechanism and earn passive income by validating transactions. This transition is expected to drive demand for Ethereum as more individuals and institutions participate in staking activities.\n\nNetwork upgrades and improvements\n\nThe Ethereum network is constantly evolving, with regular upgrades and improvements being implemented to address scalability, security, and usability concerns.\n\nUpcoming upgrades, such as the London hard fork, aim to reduce transaction fees and improve the overall user experience.\n\nThese improvements contribute to the long-term sustainability and growth of the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nSource: CNN\n\nMarket dominance and liquidity\n\nAs the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Ethereum has established itself as a dominant player in the crypto market.\n\nThis market dominance translates to increased liquidity, making it easier for investors to buy and sell Ethereum tokens.\n\nHigher liquidity enhances the overall stability of the asset and provides investors with more opportunities to enter or exit positions.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin ‘Oversold’ For The 1st Time Since 2020\n\nHow to Make Real Money With Ethereum\n\nNext, let’s explore some strategies that can help you make real money with this cryptocurrency.\n\nBuy and hold (HODL)\n\nOne of the simplest and most popular strategies is to buy and hold cryptocurrencies for the long term.\n\nThis strategy, often referred to as “HODLing,” involves purchasing Ethereum tokens and holding onto them. You do this with the expectation that their value will appreciate over time.\n\nBy taking a long-term perspective, investors can potentially benefit from the overall growth of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nStaking Ethereum\n\nPeople can participate in Ethereum’s consensus mechanism and earn passive income by staking their Ethereum tokens.\n\nIn return, stakers receive rewards in the form of additional Ethereum tokens. The amount of passive income earned through staking depends on factors such as the amount of Ethereum staked and the overall network participation.\n\nParticipating in Decentralized Finance (DeFi)\n\nDecentralized finance, or DeFi, has gained significant attention in recent years, and Ethereum is at the forefront of this movement.\n\nDeFi platforms built on the Ethereum network offer a range of financial services. These include lending, borrowing, yield farming, and decentralized exchanges.\n\nAdditionally, by participating in DeFi protocols, individuals can earn interest on their Ethereum holdings, provide liquidity to earn fees or engage in arbitrage opportunities.\n\nHowever, it’s important to conduct thorough research and understand the risks associated with DeFi before participating.\n\nTrading Ethereum\n\nSource: Pixabay\n\nFor individuals with trading experience and a deep understanding of market dynamics, actively trading Ethereum can be a profitable endeavor.\n\nDay trading or swing trading Ethereum involves buying and selling the cryptocurrency within short time frames to take advantage of price fluctuations.\n\nFurthermore, this strategy requires careful analysis, technical skills, and risk management to be successful.\n\nIt’s important to note that trading cryptocurrencies can be highly volatile, and losses are possible.\n\nHow Much Can You Make with a $100 Investment in Ethereum?\n\nThe potential returns on a $100 investment in Ethereum depend on various factors, such as the entry point, market conditions, and the holding period.\n\nEthereum’s price has experienced significant volatility in the past, with periods of both rapid growth and sharp corrections.\n\nMoreover, it’s important to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results, and the cryptocurrency market remains highly unpredictable.\n\nHowever, a $100 investment made at a favorable entry point could potentially grow substantially over time.\n\nFor example, if an individual had invested $100 in Ethereum in early 2020 when the price was around $150, their investment would have grown to approximately $13,333 by mid-2021 when the price reached $2,000. This represents a significant return on investment.\n\nAdditionally, it’s worth noting that the cryptocurrency market is inherently risky, and investing in Ethereum or any other digital asset carries the potential for loss. It’s important to conduct thorough research, diversify your portfolio, and only invest funds that you can afford to lose.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, Ethereum presents a compelling long-term investment opportunity due to its versatile platform, potential for widespread adoption, and ongoing network improvements.\n\nInvesting in Ethereum requires careful consideration and an understanding of the associated risks.\n\nBy adopting strategies such as buying and holding, staking, participating in DeFi, or trading Ethereum, individuals can potentially make real money with this cryptocurrency.\n\nHowever, it’s crucial to approach the cryptocurrency market with caution, conduct thorough research, and make informed investment decisions based on your risk tolerance and financial goals.'}].

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

*** ONCHAIN ANALYST RESPONSE ***
Based on the recent information provided, we can see that the open price of ETH has been fluctuating between 1645.18 and 1730.19. The number of transactions, unique addresses, value transferred, average gas price, total gas used, and successful transactions have also been varying.

The short-long moving average signal, MACD signal, and Bollinger Bands signal have been consistently indicating a "buy" trend. However, the MACD signal turned to "sell" with the open price at 1730.19.

Overall, the market trend for ETH appears to be bullish, with the majority of signals indicating a "buy" trend. However, the recent MACD signal change to "sell" at the higher open price could suggest a potential short-term correction or consolidation. Traders and investors should closely monitor the market for any further developments to make informed decisions.

This classification played a pivotal role in her decision to reject the case that Uniswap’s token sales are to be regulated under the exchange act.\n\nHowever, her statement does not serve as a definitive ruling on the legal status of Ethereum and Bitcoin in the U.S. legal system.\n\nThis latest judgment diverges from recent legal actions that have treated certain cryptocurrencies differently. Notably, a July ruling by a U.S. federal judge classified XRP as a security when sold to institutional investors, but not when sold to the general public or distributed to staff members.\n\nFollowing the ruling, SEC Chair Gary Gensler was left “disappointed,” with the agency planning to appeal the decision.\n\nThe disagreement between regulatory bodies adds another layer of complexity. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have been debating jurisdictional rights concerning cryptocurrencies.\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler\'s assertion that "everything other than Bitcoin" falls under the SEC\'s jurisdiction as securities, which clashes with the CFTC\'s claim that cryptocurrencies, including Ether, should be treated as commodities.\n\nThe uncertainty surrounding the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies has prompted lawmakers to introduce various bills in Congress aimed at bringing clarity to the issue.\n\nHowever, these bills propose differing solutions, including categorizing cryptocurrencies as securities or commodities, and determining the regulatory authority responsible for overseeing them.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmong these bills, the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act suggests a process for classifying cryptocurrencies.\n\nOn the other hand, the Digital Commodity Exchange Act proposes the registration and regulation of crypto spot exchanges under the CFTC.\n\nMeanwhile, the Digital Asset Market Structure Bill introduces the concept of SEC certification for cryptocurrencies, ensuring sufficient decentralization before granting commodity status.'}, {'id': 55, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9naWRkeS1zbWFydC13YWxsZXQtbGF1bmNoZXMtbXVsdGljaGFpbi0yMDAwMDAwNDYuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Thu, 31 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Giddy Smart Wallet Launches Multichain Support Beginning With Ethereum - Yahoo Finance', 'content': 'Salt Lake City, Utah --News Direct-- Giddy\n\nGiddy, the innovative self-custody crypto smart wallet that provides easy retail access to DeFi earning opportunities, is excited to announce it is expanding its advanced private key technology with immediate support for Ethereum Mainnet.\n\nThis marks the second chain supported by Giddy following its initial launch on the Polygon network, and will soon be followed by other EVM-compatible networks such as Arbitrum, Base, Binance Smart Chain, and more.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by the on-chain and news analysts, the overall market trend for ETH appears to be bullish. The majority of signals indicate a "buy" trend, with positive developments such as regulatory clarity, enhanced wallet features, and increased accessibility contributing to potential growth in the cryptocurrency market.

Although the recent MACD signal change to "sell" at a higher open price could suggest a short-term correction or consolidation, the overall bullish sentiment and positive news articles point towards a potential upward trend in the near future.

Considering the bullish market trend and positive developments, I am confident in predicting a further increase in the price of ETH. Therefore, I recommend buying ETH with a negative value to maximize profit.

The solution makes use of StarkWare’s STARK proofs, the ZK-proof technology co-invented by mathematician Eli Ben-Sasson.\n\nStarkWare presented Herodotus with a custom-built instance of its shared prover service SHARP, which enables advanced scaling efficiency using recursive proofs. The latter allows a virtual machine to provide “proofs of proofs” by generating proofs of transactions or blocks in parallel and real-time, batching them into a subsequent proof.\n\nRelated: More TPS, less gas: Ethereum L2 Starknet outlines performance upgrades\n\nAt a slightly more technical level, the accumulator acts as a cache that stores block headers. If the accumulator has a header in its cache, the respective storage-proof computation can use it for validation.\n\nA visual representation of the possible use of recursive proofs to batch a variety of information into subsequent verified and cached proofs. Source: StarkWare\n\nIf the header is not cached, the prover has to generate a proof to cover the requested block range, add the block header to the accumulator and then complete the requested storage proof computation.\n\nAs the name suggests, the on-chain accumulator essentially accumulates proofs that rollup prior proofs, drastically reducing the time it takes to verify the Ethereum blockchain and associated data at any point in the network’s history.\n\nHerodotus chief technology officer Marcello Bardus notes that the technology removes the need to traverse the entire blockchain on the blockchain itself:\n\n“We can do it off chain, generate an accumulator and just cherrypick one specific block without iterating from the entire chain on the chain itself.”\n\nStarkWare notes that Storage proofs could prove groundbreaking as an alternative to cross-chain bridges that rely on third-party oracles to track and verify data.\n\nRelated: StarkNet overhauls Cairo programming language to drive developer adoption\n\nHerodotus co-founder Kacper Koziol added that the accumulator is an innovation that Ethereum has long needed to align with blockchain principles of transparency and accessibility. The technology will essentially allow any user to access any point in Ethereum’s history.\n\n“This will be very powerful. For the first time in the history of blockchains, people are going to be able to prove the correctness of any aspect of anyone’s on-chain information.”\n\nThe two teams highlight the potential for storage proofs to build “Web2 equivalent applications,” tapping into the pioneering ability to access and verify Ethereum blockchain data autonomously.\n\nAccount recovery is touted as one potential use case, where the ability to verify on-chain data could trigger a proverbial dead man’s switch or automate insurance protocols that use historical on-chain events to trigger smart contract payouts.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: Recursive inscriptions: Bitcoin ‘supercomputer’ and BTC DeFi coming soon'}, {'id': 1, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNjbi5jb20vbmV3cy9ldGgtc3Rha2luZy1zZXJ2aWNlcy1hZ3JlZS1saW1pdC1mb3ItdmFsaWRhdG9ycy1hbWlkLWNyaXRpY2lzbS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Fri, 01 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Ethereum Staking Services Accept 22% Validators Limit Amid Criticism From ETH Community - CCN.com', 'content': 'Key Takeaways\n\nSome ETH staking service providers agreed to a self-imposed limit.\n\nThe limit restricts the amount of the staking market they control.\n\nThey promise to hold no more than 22% of the Ethereum staking market.\n\nPotential centralization of ETH liquid staking behind the move.\n\nEthereum has always been at the forefront of the debate about decentralization and now this is being protected by the adoption of a ground-breaking self-limit regulation by Ethereum staking providers.\n\nThe 22% Self-Limit Rule\n\nIn order to maintain Ethereum blockchain’s decentralized nature, at least five Ethereum liquid staking providers, including Rocket Pool , Stader Labs , Diva Staking , Puffer Finance , and StakeWise , have either adopted or are actively working to implement a self-limit rule. This regulation limits their ownership to no more than 22% of the Ethereum staking market.\n\nThis figure was selected due to Ethereum’s consensus algorithm requiring a 66% validator agreement on the network’s state. This rule mandates the collaboration of at least four major companies for finalizing the chain, making transactions unchangeable by setting the limit at 22%.\n\nStruggling Against Centralization\n\nThe Ethereum community has had ongoing concerns about staking service centralization, as indicated by the self-limit proposal presented by Superphiz, an Ethereum core developer, in May 2022 . The main goal is to maintain the network’s decentralized nature by preventing any one entity from obtaining disproportionate influence over it.\n\nThese providers are committed (or are in the process of committing) to self-limit to <22% of Ethereum validators. This is how our chain will be successful: Coordination above greed. Cooperation instead of winner-take-all.@Rocket_Pool @stakewise_io @staderlabs @divastaking — superphiz.eth 🦇🔊🛡️ (@superphiz) August 30, 2023\n\nLido Finance Mysteries\n\nThe biggest Ethereum liquid staking service, Lido Finance, stands out as an important exception to this trend. According to data from Dune Analytics , Lido has now a commanding 32.4% of all staked Ethereum, leaving Coinbase with just an 8.7% market share.\n\nIn an unexpected move, Lido Finance voted against self-limiting in June, with a whopping 99.8% majority.\n\n“They have expressed an intention to control the majority of validators on the beacon chain,” Superphiz said in an August 31 post.\n\nVarious Views in ETH Community\n\nThe self-limit rule has received a mixed reception from the Ethereum community. Some claim that the rule ignores the Ethereum tenets in favor of concentrating on economic self-interest. They argue that if proponents of the self-limit rule were in Lido’s position of power, they may view things differently.\n\nEasy to commit to self-limit when it seems that most of these will likely never reach 22% market share of Liquid staking on Ethereum. Folks in the ETH community should not shame more user-friendly solutions as greedy products. https://t.co/65vgti3Jrm — Neel Daftary 🦇🔊 (@DaftaryNeel) August 31, 2023\n\nOn the other hand, several members of the Ethereum community voiced worries about the risks of centralization posed by Lido’s substantial market share. They call this domination “selfish” and push for measures to maintain the health and decentralization of the larger Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nYeah because they have way less market share than that now… easy to chirp from the cheap seats. This has nothing to do with “Ethereum alignment.” None of these teams would self limit were they in Lido’s place. Everyone is doing the economically selfish and rational thing… — Mippo 🟪 (@MikeIppolito_) August 31, 2023\n\nThe debate over Ethereum’s decentralization will persist as it evolves. The 22% self-limit rule is a significant step in striking a balance between market growth and network decentralization.\n\nIt underscores the Ethereum community’s commitment to preserving decentralization for impartiality and permissionless innovation on the platform.\n\nThe Ethereum community’s commitment to decentralization is demonstrated by its acceptance of the 22% self-limit rule. This novel strategy aims to protect the fundamental values of the Ethereum platform by preventing any one company from exerting undue control over the Ethereum staking market.\n\nWhile opinions may vary, it underscores the Ethereum community’s ongoing commitment to striking the right balance between market dynamics and network integrity.'}].

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, we can see that the majority of signals are indicating a bullish trend for ETH. The market trend appears to be positive, with signals pointing towards a "buy" trend. However, it is important to note that the recent MACD signal turning to "sell" may suggest a potential short-term correction or consolidation in the market.

Considering the mixed sentiment from the news analyst report, where there are both bearish and bullish indicators, it is crucial to carefully assess the overall market trend. The negative sentiment from the first article suggesting a potential price drop in the short term is countered by the positive news of integration of in-app swapping on the Ethereum network, expansion of Giddy to support Ethereum, and the launch of technology by StarkWare and Herodotus to verify historical data.

Taking into account the bullish trend indicated by the majority of signals in the on-chain analyst report and the positive news surrounding Ethereum's adoption and utility, I would recommend a slightly bullish action to buy ETH with a confidence level of 0.2. 

Action: -0.2 (buy with 20% cash)

The Court said the SEC had failed to provide a “coherent explanation” for the denial.\n\nEthereum (ETH) took inconsequential seven-day losses of 0.4% and now changes hands at $1,646.\n\nVirtually every other leading cryptocurrency is approximately the same price it was last weekend except Toncoin (TON), which blew up 22% to trade at $1.75, and Bitcoin Cash (BCH), which rose 8.6% to $206.87.\n\nToncoin’s bullish momentum can be attributed to the development of the TON ecosystem.\n\nThe TON Foundation, which spun out from Telegram to develop TON, recently released a Telegram-centric Web3 app store and launched a community-driven initiative, Believers.ton, to promote ecosystem development.\n\nBitcoin Cash was one of the fastest risers when the Grayscale/SEC news broke on Tuesday and appears to have sustained the rally into the weekend. Similarly, Coinbase stock soared 15% in the hours following the news.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAny intraweek gains that Bitcoin and Ethereum made were wiped out early on Friday as the industry reacted to news that the SEC needed more time to approve or reject 6 Bitcoin ETF applications.\n\nAll told, it was another excruciatingly slow news cycle this week for those looking to see some sign of growing global crypto adoption. On Thursday, airline Giant Lufthansa launched an NFT-based loyalty program on Polygon. Polygon’s MATIC token didn’t particularly react to the news, though—it ended the week 1.2% higher at a price of around $0.55.'}, {'id': 12, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vY29pbmdhcGUuY29tL21hcmtldHMvZXRoZXJldW0tcHJpY2UtcHJlZGljdGlvbi1ldGgtcHJpY2UtdG8taGl0LTE1MDAtc29vbi_SAVZodHRwczovL2NvaW5nYXBlLmNvbS9tYXJrZXRzL2V0aGVyZXVtLXByaWNlLXByZWRpY3Rpb24tZXRoLXByaWNlLXRvLWhpdC0xNTAwLXNvb24vYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Sat, 02 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH Price to Hit $1500 if Buyers Lose this Key Support - CoinGape', 'content': 'During the aggressive sell-off in mid-August, the Ethereum price showed a bearish breakdown from the support trendline of the channel pattern.

She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nRenowned macro guru Raoul Pal expresses unwavering optimism in the face of lingering market uncertainties. Pal, a steadfast bull, maintains that his bullish stance, which he has held for an extended period, remains unshaken.\n\nWhen questioned about the foundation of his bullish outlook, Pal elucidated that he believes the much-anticipated recession, which had loomed ominously on the economic horizon, was largely factored into the market dynamics last year. According to him, the substantial downturns witnessed in equity markets and the cryptocurrency realm during that period were clear manifestations of this anticipatory pricing.\n\nRaoul Pal’s Unwavering Bullish Stance\n\nIn a recent interview with Crypto Banter, Pal reiterated his consistent perspective, asserting that the long-anticipated recession has already transpired and was duly assimilated by the markets in the preceding year.\n\nTo illustrate this point, he cited the substantial market fluctuations, including a precipitous 75% decline in cryptocurrencies and a 30-35% dip in stock values, as compelling evidence of the market’s proactive response to the impending economic cycle.\n\nPal expounded on how the market had preemptively adjusted to these anticipated changes in the prior year. Subsequently, it embarked on a path of anticipatory behavior, as evidenced by the discernible surge in liquidity since the month of June.\n\nDrawing from his forward-looking indicators, Pal revealed that liquidity had exhibited an upward trajectory since June of the preceding year. These indicators played a pivotal role in shaping his investment decisions, most notably in Ethereum, where he augmented his holdings during a significant market sell-off.\n\nContemplating the future landscape, Pal highlights that current data trends are now harmonizing with his forward-looking indicators. He emphasized that inflationary pressures are gradually receding, while unemployment figures are showing a gradual ascent. Furthermore, economic growth appears to be losing momentum. These unfolding trends, in Pal’s assessment, suggest that the Federal Reserve may, in due course, contemplate halting its ongoing rate hikes and, potentially, resort to rate cuts in a bid to sustain economic stability.'}, {'id': 6, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vY3J5cHRvc2xhdGUuY29tL2Z0eC1jb2xkLXdhbGxldC1tb3ZlZC1hbG1vc3QtMTBtLWluLWFsdGNvaW5zLXRvLWV0aGVyZXVtLXNpbmNlLWF1Zy0zMS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Sat, 02 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'FTX cold wallet moved almost $10M in altcoins to Ethereum since Aug. 31 - CryptoSlate', 'content': 'A cold wallet owned by collapsed crypto exchange FTX moved almost $10 million in altcoins from Solana to Ethereum since Aug. 31 for undisclosed reasons, according to on-chain data.\n\nThe altcoins include notable tokens like LINK, SUSHI, LUNA, and YFI.

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
Based on the news articles provided, here is an analysis of the current market trend for Ethereum (ETH) cryptocurrency:

1. **Market Stability**: The first news article mentions that Ethereum (ETH) experienced inconsequential seven-day losses of 0.4% and is currently trading at $1,646. This indicates that Ethereum has remained relatively stable over the past week.

2. **Price Prediction**: The second news article discusses a potential price prediction for Ethereum, suggesting that if buyers lose a key support level, the price could drop to $1500. This indicates a bearish outlook if the support level is not maintained.

3. **Altcoin Potential Rally**: The third news article highlights that an Ethereum-based altcoin, Chainlink (LINK), is showing signs of a potential rally. This could indicate positive sentiment for Ethereum and related altcoins in the market.

4. **Asset Movement**: The fourth news article mentions that FTX, a collapsed crypto exchange, moved almost $10 million in altcoins from Solana to Ethereum. This movement of assets could have implications for Ethereum's market dynamics.

Overall, the market trend for Ethereum appears to be relatively stable with some potential for price fluctuations based on the support levels and altcoin movements. It is important to monitor these factors closely

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, the market trend for ETH cryptocurrency appears to be bullish. The open prices have been increasing, the number of transactions and unique addresses are on the rise, and there is significant activity on the network. The signals from various indicators also suggest a buy or hold position, supporting the bullish trend.

However, the news analyst report does mention some potential price fluctuations based on support levels and altcoin movements. While Ethereum has remained relatively stable over the past week, there is a mention of a potential price drop if key support levels are not maintained. The movement of assets from one exchange to Ethereum could also impact market dynamics.

Taking all of this information into consideration, the overall market trend for Ethereum seems to be bullish with some potential for short-term fluctuations. Given the positive momentum and signals from the on-chain analysis, I am confident in the upward trend of ETH.

Therefore, I would suggest buying ETH with a confidence level of -0.7.

According to the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) giant, this blockchain could be forked from the Solana (SOL) blockchain. In effect, this would mean that MakerDAO will be moving away from the Ethereum-based architecture which it currently utilizes.\n\nadvertisement\n\nExplaining further, the MakerDAO CEO claimed that the Solana codebase is the “most promising” to explore for NewChain due to its technical quality and optimization, resilience of the Solana ecosystem following the “FTX blowup,” and past examples of successful forks of the protocol, like the Pyth Network.\n\nIn response to this potential development, Yakovenko acknowledged that MakerDAO’s move is impressive, citing that it is a win for open source. At the same time, he warned that it should not be perceived as an endorsement of one blockchain over the other.\n\n“I really hope that people in the Solana community don’t use this as some cudgel to attack Ethereum,” Yakovenko said in a recent post.

Is it an innate sense of positivity; a belief that everything will turn out for the best?\n\nTo ordinary people, yes. That’s exactly what it is. For crypto enthusiasts, on the other hand, Optimism is something quite different.\n\nOptimism is an Ethereum Layer-2 scaling solution that aims to make Vitalik Buterin’s blockchain faster, affordable, and ultimately more accessible. As the Ethereum blockchain has grown in popularity and usage, it’s become clear that the network’s sluggish speeds and extortionate gas fees are ill-equipped for crypto mass adoption.\n\nWhat is Optimism (OP), and how does it work? In a crowded niche, what separates Optimism from the dozens of other Layer-2 blockchains like Arbitrum (ARB) or Polygon zkEVM?\n\nWhat is Optimism (OP)?\n\nOptimism, known by its native token symbol OP, is one of the Ethereum network’s leading Layer-2 scaling solutions. It resolves the litany of issues plaguing the Ethereum blockchain, namely scalability and high transaction fees.\n\nThe Optimism project is spearheaded by the Optimism Foundation, a passionate team of developers and decentralization enthusiasts dedicated to improving Ethereum (ETH) and ensuring its long-term growth and sustainability. The foundation’s work has given birth to one of the most promising Layer-2 solutions, with Optimism going from strength to strength since its launch.\n\nHow Does Optimism Work?\n\nCreatively named, Optimism is what crypto people call an Optimistic Rollup. In simple terms, Optimistic rollups are a method of batching groups of Layer-2 blockchain transaction data into one ‘rolled up’ transaction that can then be secured on the Ethereum mainnet, a Layer-1.\n\nProcessing transactions off-chain significantly reduces the load on the main network, meaning that Layer-2 users can enjoy all of Ethereum’s functionality without suffering its low speeds and crippling gas fees.\n\nA sequencer handles optimism block production. The sequencer is responsible for instant transaction confirmations and blockchain state updates, constructing and executing Layer-2 blocks, and submitting user transactions to Layer-1.\n\nWhy are they called Optimistic rollups, you ask? When it comes to blockchain security, Optimism operates on the principle of ‘fault proofs.’ This means that node operators operate on the ‘optimistic’ approach that the state of the blockchain is correct, secure, and doesn’t require proof of validity. It is removed and replaced if this state is challenged and found faulty.\n\nAs is always the case among Layer-2s, Optimism runs an EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine). This makes it easy for Ethereum developers to redeploy their favorite EVM-based dApps and smart contracts directly on Optimism and gives users a sense of familiarity with the network.\n\nThe Optimism Token\n\nAt the heart of Optimism is the OP token, the native cryptocurrency token of the network. OP is an ERC-20 token that plays a crucial role in the governance and future development of the Optimism network, serving as the requirement for OP community members to join and contribute to decision-making processes. It may come as a surprise, but OP is not used to pay Optimism gas fees.\n\nOne of the largest crypto airdrops to date, the OP token was distributed to hundreds of thousands of Optimism wallets. Those lucky qualifying addresses were people who’d positively contributed to Optimism’s growth, whether they were DAO voters, multi-sig signers, or simple users who interacted with Optimism dApps.\n\nOP’s first airdrop shared over 200M OP tokens and marked the birth of Optimism’s governance model, known as the Optimism Collective. This governing body collective comprises two separate houses: The Token House and the Citizens’ House.\n\nComprised of OP token holders, The Token House handles protocol governance. Through decentralized governance proposals, the Token House manages everything from protocol upgrades to inflation adjustments, treasury appropriations, rights protection, and governance fund grants.\n\nOn the other hand, the Citizens’ House is an experimental attempt at a non-plutocratic governance model, which aims to draw power and influence away from crypto whales. The Citizen’s House manages retroactive public goods funding, which rewards builders and developers who create products and services that grow the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nOptimism Ecosystem\n\nAs you’d expect from a top Layer-2 network, the Optimism ecosystem is a vibrant and dynamic space with an excellent variety of dApps. Thanks to roll-up technology, Optimism is paving the way for a new era of Ethereum-based applications that are faster, cheaper, and more efficient than what’s available on the mainnet.\n\nDeFi\n\nDecentralized Finance, or DeFi, is undoubtedly one of the most transformative applications of blockchain technology. Optimism’s EVM compatibility and low fees have made it the perfect playground for creative DeFi applications.\n\nClassic decentralized exchanges like Uniswap and Sushiswap have both moved in and set up camp on Optimism, but they’re outclassed in TVL (Total Value Locked) and trading volume by Velodrome, Optimism’s native DEX.\n\nOther DeFi platforms on Optimism can offer financial services like lending, borrowing, and yield farming through popular platforms like AAVE and Optimism’s dedicated lending market, Sonne Finance. Synthetix (SNX), another popular application on the network, supports derivatives and synthetic asset trading.\n\nNFTs\n\nWhile Optimism DeFi is a force to be reckoned with, NFTs on the network have struggled to stay relevant. What’s more interesting is that this trend is consistent across all Layer-2 networks, not just Optimism.\n\nEven though Layer-2 networks, whether they’re optimistic rollups or zk-rollups (zero-knowledge), make it cheaper and easier to trade and mint NFTs, NFT culture still resides largely on Layer-1 networks like Ethereum and Solana (SOL).\n\nDespite iconic NFT marketplaces like Opensea integrating support for Optimism, NFT trading volume is almost non-existent.\n\nA quick look at the top collections page on Quix, Optimism’s top NFT marketplace, shows that the last week of trading volume barely tips over 0.1 ETH. Opensea doesn’t fare much better, with the world’s most recognizable NFT platform tipping the scales at around two ETH per week.\n\nThe Optimism Superchain\n\nTo expand Ethereum’s capabilities further than we’ve ever thought possible, Optimism has set out to build a horizontally scalable network of blockchains called the Optimism Superchain. With the vision of growing a wider network of standardized, open-source Layer-2 networks, the Superchain tackles Ethereum’s scalability crisis from a new angle.\n\nThe central engine of the Superchain is the OP Stack, an open-source development toolkit that unifies all Superchain networks and ensures they’re all beating to the same rhythm. It guarantees that all networks are built using the same security features and communication systems to maintain a cohesive ecosystem.\n\nMoreover, the Superchain introduces a new revenue model that rewards developers with fees from their respective chains and applications. Optimism’s Superchain has proven a popular choice for large-scale businesses, including Worldcoin (WLD) and Coinbase’s Base Chain.\n\nOptimism vs. Arbitrum\n\nTwo names reign supreme in the fierce and competitive race to become the ultimate Ethereum scaling solution. At face value, there’s not a huge difference between Optimism and Arbitrum. Both networks are optimistic rollups that improve Ethereum’s scalability.\n\nUnderneath the hood, the main difference is how they handle fraud proofing. While Optimism uses single-round fraud proofs, Arbitrum takes this one step further with multi-round proofs. The result? Optimism is a faster network, but it runs the risk of having higher gas fees than Arbitrum during periods of Ethereum congestion.\n\nDiving into the on-chain metrics, Arbitrum is king in the eye of DeFi users. According to DeFiLlama, Arbitrum has more than double Optimism’s TVL (Total Value Locked) and almost 3x as many protocols built on the network. But if you’re an Optimism fan, don’t lose heart.\n\nRecent trends indicate a change in the guard. Over the past few months, daily transactions and active addresses on Arbitrum have steadily declined, while the same metrics on Optimism show sustained growth.\n\nOptimism Pros and Cons\n\nShould we be feeling optimistic or pessimistic about Optimism? Let’s dive into the pros and cons.\n\nPros\n\nScalability – Optimism offers greater transaction speeds and throughput than the Ethereum mainnet, making it better suited to supporting a large user base.\n\n– Optimism offers greater transaction speeds and throughput than the Ethereum mainnet, making it better suited to supporting a large user base.

Dozens of Layer-2 networks are joining the race, some with greater resources and more modern infrastructure. While Optimism was one of the first Layer-2s to hit the market, there is a chance its competitors will outperform it.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nEthereum is undeniably the largest Layer-1 blockchain in the industry. However, its scalability concerns make it unusable for most of the global population.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by the on-chain and news analysts, the overall market trend for ETH cryptocurrency appears to be bearish. The on-chain data indicates a lack of significant buying pressure, high gas prices, and bearish technical indicators. Additionally, the news analyst report highlights the pressure from sellers and the lack of readiness for a sharp move in the price of Ethereum.

Considering these factors, I predict that the market trend for ETH will continue to be bearish in the near future. Therefore, I will take a conservative approach and suggest selling a portion of ETH to maximize profit in this downward trend.

On-chain data on September 4 shows that one Ethereum holder sold 694 ETH, worth roughly $1.13 million when writing, for 1,010 MKR. At the time of the swap, MKR was changing hands at $1,122.\n\nWhale Swaps ETH For MKR\n\nAs of September 4, the address, “0x3737,” had over $20.37 million worth of assets. While the whale trades against Vitalik and doubles down on MKR, zooming in on the address’s portfolio shows that the largest holding is ETH.\n\nThe address holds 10,000 ETH worth $16.3 million at spot rates, representing over 75% of the total portfolio. Meanwhile, some of his other major holdings include Arbitrum (ARB), worth $2.9 million, and MKR, worth $1.1 million.\n\nMKR, the token issued by MakerDAO, the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that controls the minting of DAI, a stablecoin on Ethereum, has been ripping higher in the last few months.\n\nMKR plays a key role in stabilizing DAO and is used as a last resort. Holders participate in governance, voting on proposals that best stabilize the algorithmic stablecoin, deciding collateral types accepted, stability fee adjustments, and others.\n\nFrom June, MKR has more than doubled, rising 125% to peak at around $1,300 in early August. It is now trading at over $1,100, up 13% from August lows.\n\nMaker Presents Endgame\n\nThe token’s surge has been attributed to multiple factors, specifically the release of the “Endgame” roadmap. Under this plan, MakerDAO plans to, among other things, release their blockchain, rebrand, and introduce two more tokens.\n\nThis move is significant because MakerDAO is among the first decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. According to DeFiLlama data, the protocol has a total value locked (TVL) of over $5 billion. It is the largest decentralized money market in the world.\n\nMeanwhile, DAI, its algorithmic yield-earning stablecoin, has been stable recently and is the largest in Ethereum. At press time, DAI had a market cap of $5.3 billion, perched at 12th on the leaderboard. At this pace, DAI is the third-largest stablecoin after USDT and USDC.\n\nVitalik Buterin, despite the stellar performance of MKR relative to the broader crypto market, liquidated $580,000 worth of MKR after MakerDAO’s co-founder, Rune Christensen, said it was considering launching a new blockchain bridging to Ethereum that’s based on Solana’s code. The new blockchain, dubbed NewChain, is part of MakerDAO’s roadmap, “Endgame”.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

You are an experienced ETH cryptocurrency trader and you are trying to maximize your overall profit by trading ETH. In each day, you will make an action to buy or sell ETH. You will start with 1 million dollars, half in cash and half in ETH. You are assisted by a few analysts below and need to decide the final action.

ON-CHAIN ANALYST REPORT: Based on the recent information provided, we can see that the open price of ETH has been fluctuating between 1630.61 and 1730.19. The number of transactions, unique addresses, value transferred, average gas price, total gas used, and successful transactions have also been varying.

The short-long moving average signal is indicating a buy signal, while the MACD signal is showing a sell signal. The Bollinger Bands signal is suggesting a hold.

Overall, the market trend for ETH appears to be mixed with conflicting signals from different indicators. It is important to closely monitor the price movements and other relevant factors to make informed trading decisions.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, we can see that the market trend for ETH is mixed with conflicting signals from different indicators. The short-long moving average signal is indicating a buy signal, while the MACD signal is showing a sell signal. The Bollinger Bands signal is suggesting a hold. This indicates uncertainty in the market direction.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights that the cryptocurrency market is experiencing mixed trading conditions. While some cryptocurrencies are trading with gains, others are facing cuts. The fear and greed index is in the fear zone, indicating caution among investors. However, the introduction of GUISE, a privacy-focused cryptocurrency on the Ethereum blockchain, could potentially attract more users to the platform.

Considering the mixed signals from the on-chain analysis and the news report, along with the lack of a reflection analyst report, it is difficult to determine a clear market trend for ETH. However, given the slightly bearish sentiment in the news report and the conflicting signals from the on-chain analysis, I would lean towards a more conservative approach.

Based on the news articles provided, here is an analysis of the market trend for Ethereum (ETH) cryptocurrency:

1. "Explaining Ethereum's 'Risk Free' Rate of Return - CoinDesk": This article discusses the positive trend of staking in cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, which offers a touchpoint with dividend-paying stocks and reduces the immateriality of crypto. It suggests that staking has become an expectation in the crypto space, which could be seen as a positive development for Ethereum.

2. "Not Dogecoin, Shiba Inu But This 'Ethereum Rival' Is The 'Most Loved Altcoin' Among Large Investors - Eme - Benzinga": The article highlights the investment interest in Solana (SOL) as an Ethereum rival, with institutional investors pouring money into it. Despite outflows in other altcoins, Solana has managed to capture the attention of large entities and is considered the most loved altcoin among investors. This could indicate a shift in investor sentiment towards alternative cryptocurrencies like Solana.

You are an experienced ETH cryptocurrency trader and you are trying to maximize your overall profit by trading ETH. In each day, you will make an action to buy or sell ETH. You will start with 1 million dollars, half in cash and half in ETH. You are assisted by a few analysts below and need to decide the final action.

ON-CHAIN ANALYST REPORT: Based on the recent information provided, it appears that the market trend for ETH is currently showing a buy signal for the short-long moving average, but a sell signal for the MACD indicator. The Bollinger Bands signal is indicating a hold.

The number of transactions, unique addresses, and value transferred have been fluctuating, but overall remain at relatively high levels. The average gas price has also been fluctuating, but has been relatively high in recent data points.

Overall, it seems that there is some uncertainty in the market as indicated by the conflicting signals from different indicators. It may be a good idea to closely monitor the market and wait for more clarity before making any significant trading decisions.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, there is some uncertainty in the market with conflicting signals from different indicators. The buy signal from the short-long moving average is countered by the sell signal from the MACD indicator, while the Bollinger Bands signal is indicating a hold. This mixed signal suggests that the market trend for ETH is currently unclear.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights positive developments for Ethereum, such as the increasing trend of staking and the investment interest in alternative cryptocurrencies like Solana. These factors could potentially drive the price of ETH higher in the near future.

Considering the mixed signals from the on-chain analysis and the positive news developments, I believe that the overall market trend for ETH is slightly bullish. Therefore, I would recommend buying ETH with a moderate confidence level.

Action: -0.4 (buy with 40% cash)

And if you look here, red is Solana and the deltas, and then blue is ETH. You can see it smashes it. These things are on a log scale on the left. And that is the big difference. Looking at all of the key factors, they have 10 wins each, but in reality, where Solana wins, it wins by a lot more. Where Ethereum wins, it only wins by a fraction.”\n\nHis chart shows 19 different categories comparing Solana to ETH. Solana beats ETH in such categories as block time, average fee and the maximum number of transactions that a blockchain can carry out in a second, also known as transactions per second (TPS).\n\nThe trader says that ETH is considered more established than Solana and a safer bet for investors.\n\nHowever, he notes that more institutional money has flowed into Solana so far in 2023.\n\n“Ethereum is safe. It’s established. It has been around for a long time. The risk is very low. When big money comes in, they’ll go into ETH first, although we have seen so far this year in 2023 institutional money is going into Solana more so than Ethereum.”\n\nAccording to the trader, since Solana’s market cap is much smaller than Ethereum’s, SOL has a greater opportunity for a larger price increase than ETH.\n\nSolana is the 10th-ranked digital asset by market cap with a market cap of $8.2 billion. Ethereum is the second top digital asset by market cap with a market cap of $196 billion.\n\n“This is the magic question though. When you break it all down is Ethereum 20 times better than Solana? And the answer in my opinion is no. But there is risk with Solana, therefore you allocate accordingly. My Solana bag is about a third the size of my ETH bag but it will grow and I think it’ll grow faster.\n\nBut that little skinny green sliver on the right is the market cap of Solana versus the market cap of ETH. And the ETH market cap is 20 times higher, which is stunning. And I look as an investor for relative value.

Pointing out that the majority of nodes are currently run through providers like Amazon Web Services, he identified node centralization as a major problem the Ethereum community needs to deal with.\n\nIn another potential threat to Ethereum’s decentralization, critics have speculated that Chinese firms secretly control some of the richest ETH wallets in existence.\n\nThe Problem of Ethereum Node Centralization\n\nThe Ethereum network is made up of computers that communicate with each other in order to validate transactions and record data about the status of the blockchain.\n\nEach computer in the network is known as an Ethereum node. From its inception, the Ethereum community has worked to establish nodes all around the world. In order to ensure the network’s decentralization, various computers belonging to individuals, businesses, universities and other organizations all operate nodes.\n\nHowever, not all computers are up to the task. In fact, to operate a full Ethereum node, Quicknode recommends a minimum of 16 GB of RAM, a fast SSD drive with at least 1 TB of space, at least 25 MBit/s bandwidth and a fast CPU with 4 or more cores.\n\nDue to the high technical bar node operators must meet, 57.5% of all nodes are run through cloud hosting services. As a consequence, although there are currently 5882 Ethereum nodes in operation, over half of these are controlled by just 21 cloud service providers.\n\nIn fact, 1805 nodes are operated via Amazon Web Services (AWS) alone, presenting a major challenge to Ethereum’s decentralization.\n\nVitalik Buterin on the Future of Ethereum Nodes\n\nSpeaking at Korea Blockchain Week, Vitalik Buterin discusses how to create a more decentralized Ethereum network by making it easier to run nodes.\n\nAddressing the problem of node centralization in Seoul on Monday, September 4, Buterin observed that reducing the amount of data each node has to store would lower technical barriers for would-be operators.\n\n“Today, it takes hundreds of gigabytes of data to run a node… In the longer term, there’s a plan to maintain fully verified Ethereum nodes where you could literally run it on your phone,” he said .\n\nPlans to change how Ethereum nodes handle data have already been formed. For example, the Ethereum Roadmap identifies planned upgrades that will allow computers operating Ethereum nodes to delete historical data they no longer need.\n\nIn the immediate future, the Ethereum Foundation is focused on data expiry as the most achievable goal for reducing the computational burden on network participants.\n\nLooking further ahead, however, a concept known as statelessness could make it much easier to run an Ethereum node.\n\nUnder a stateless system, not all nodes would have to access the network’s full state data. But the most ambitious vision for the future of Ethereum nodes, a concept known as “strong statelessness,” may not happen for a long time.\n\nAccording to Buterin, “These technical problems will have to be addressed eventually—maybe a 10-year timescale, maybe a 20-year timescale.”\n\nChinese Government Wallets May Hold a Huge Stash of ETH\n\nAs well as the concentration of nodes among a few operators, another threat to Ethereum’s decentralization could come from the concentration of ETH among a small number of wallets.\n\nIn the proof of stake (PoS) era, ETH accumulation of that kind poses a major threat to Ethereum decentralization.\n\nUnder Ethereum’s previous proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, what’s known as a 51% attack would require a single party to control over half of all miners, thus requiring a huge amount of resources to pull off. However, with the switch from miners to stakers, to seize control of the network, attackers would need to control more than half of the circulating supply of ETH instead.\n\nFor some researchers, this prospect is especially worrying given that many of the oldest and richest Ethereum wallets remain shrouded in secrecy. Moreover, concerns have been raised recently about the role of the Chinese business conglomerate Wanxiang in Ethereum’s early history.\n\nAs the Twitter sleuth TruthLabs has observed, Wanxiang has been associated with Ethereum since its inception and likely received a portion of the 72 million ETH that was distributed to early investors.\n\nA quick 🧵showing that Wanxiang, Chinese auto and early Ethereum Investor funded and setup Vitalik Buterins official wallets. 1/6https://t.co/4uMLLnzguq pic.twitter.com/Ec1cjLOLz2 — TruthLabs \U0001fae1 (@BoringSleuth) January 29, 2023\n\nIn fact, the Chinese company has ties to Vitalik Buterin going back to 2015, when the then-CEO of Wanxiang Blockchain Labs, Feng Xia, purchased $500,000 worth of ETH from the Ethereum founder.\n\nFor TruthLabs, Wanxiang’s deep roots in the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) are a good reason to be suspicious of its ETH holdings. In fact, the crypto investigator speculates that the CCP is Ethereum’s biggest whale, secretly controlling as much as 66.6% Of the ETH supply.\n\nA complete guess, 66.6%. I found 12 Genesis Block Wallets today, alone where they ended up with the majority of the ETH from. Its so hard to know. They were invested in over 500 projects by EOY 2021, and in many cases got the pre-ICO tokens prior to both ETH/altcoin price waves. — TruthLabs \U0001fae1 (@BoringSleuth) June 28, 2023'}].

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, we see a mixed sentiment in the market for ETH. While the short-long moving average signal is indicating a buy signal, the MACD signal is showing a sell signal. The bollinger bands signal is suggesting a hold. This mixed sentiment indicates uncertainty in the market direction.

Considering the news analyst report, there are both positive and negative factors to consider. The proposal for privacy pools could attract more users concerned about privacy, which is a positive development. However, concerns about sequencers issues and competition from Solana could create negative sentiment among users and investors.

Taking all of this into account, I believe that the market trend for ETH is slightly bearish. The mixed signals from the on-chain analysis, combined with the potential negative factors highlighted in the news report, lead me to believe that the price of ETH may experience a slight decline in the near future.

Therefore, I suggest selling 20% of ETH. 

Action: 0.2 (sell 20% ETH)

Last month, two co-founders of the EVM-compatible transaction mixing service Tornado Cash were charged by the US government.\n\nThe paper’s authors — Buterin, as well as Chainalysis chief scientist Jacob Illum, University of Basel professor Fabian Schär, doctoral candidate Matthias Nadler of the University of Basel, and Spankchain co-founder Ameen Soleimani — contend that good and bad actors could be distinguished through the use of a “smart contract-based privacy enhancing protocol” dubbed Privacy Pools.\n\nPrivacy Pools uses zero-knowledge (ZK) technology and enables users to generate a new withdrawal address that can’t be linked to previous transactions.\n\nIt also lets users choose their own privacy settings — meaning they can exclude any suspicious users from their transactions. This can be achieved through Merkle roots.\n\nThe authors note that their intention is to find cooperative solutions between lawmakers, regulators and practitioners across various fields to ensure that privacy-enhanced infrastructure can thrive in an otherwise regulated environment.\n\n“We argue that the proposal is quite flexible and can be adapted to potentially satisfy a\n\nlarge variety of regulatory requirements,” the authors wrote. “The paper should be seen as a humble contribution towards a potential future in which financial privacy and regulation can co-exist.”\n\nInside Privacy Pools\n\nAny crypto asset created and spent on a blockchain possesses a coin ID (or hash) associated with it. This information is stored using a Merkle tree, a data structure through which each hash is linked to another hash in a tree-like structure.\n\nNumerous transaction hashes are stored in a block, and each block is also hashed, creating a Merkle root.\n\nIn tandem with zero-knowledge tech — which enable blockchains to prove that data is accurate without revealing the information itself — users can prove that their withdrawals are made through a previous deposit. At the same time, they’d only reveal information from a limited data set of their choosing.\n\nThis means that honest users can prove that the origins of their funds are not directly tied to criminal activity.\n\nDon’t miss the next big story – join our free daily newsletter.'}, {'id': 1, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8venljcnlwdG8uY29tL2V0aGVyZXVtLXdoYWxlcy1idXktdXAtb3Zlci0yMDAwMDAtZXRoLXdpdGhpbi0yNC1ob3Vycy1hcy1hdHRyYWN0aXZlLXByaWNlcy1wcmV2YWlsL9IBbWh0dHBzOi8venljcnlwdG8uY29tL2V0aGVyZXVtLXdoYWxlcy1idXktdXAtb3Zlci0yMDAwMDAtZXRoLXdpdGhpbi0yNC1ob3Vycy1hcy1hdHRyYWN0aXZlLXByaWNlcy1wcmV2YWlsLz9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Thu, 07 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Ethereum Whales Buy Up Over 200,000 ETH Within 24 Hours As Attractive Prices Prevail - ZyCrypto', 'content': 'Advertisement\n\nAs the bear market continues to tighten its grip, Ethereum has witnessed a decline in price mirroring the downward trajectory of Bitcoin.\n\nThis downturn has instilled apprehension among investors, resulting in a surge in selling activity surrounding this digital asset. Nonetheless, as retail takes fright, Ethereum whales are now taking advantage of the prevailing bearish sentiment, as they have commenced purchasing substantial quantities of ETH at current discounted prices.\n\nLate Tuesday, Ethereum whales made a substantial move by purchasing approximately 260,000 Ether (ETH) in just 24 hours. Ali Martinez, a prominent cryptocurrency analyst, revealed this significant acquisition, amounting to nearly $425 million, on Twitter. The pundit shared a compelling chart from Santiment, showcasing the remarkable influx of capital into Ethereum despite prevailing market conditions.\n\nThis development unfolds against the backdrop of crypto prices remaining under pressure recently. Many have attributed Ether’s weakness to dumping by big investors over the past four months, as well as prevailing regulatory challenges facing the crypto industry, particularly in the U.S.\n\nRecently, Brian Quinlivan, Santiment’s marketing director, noted that large Ethereum (ETH) holders had exhibited bearish behaviour since around April, contrasting with their bullish stance observed in late 2022.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“There has been about a 4-month long dump in supply from addresses holding between 10 and 10,000 ETH. They really were accumulating significantly at the end of last year, but profit taking from these key tiers happened hard and quickly right as the price was hitting around a 1-year high of approximately $2,120.” Quinlivan wrote.\n\nJust yesterday, Santiment highlighted two whales who sent 300,000 Ether to Coinbase, raising fears of an imminent dump among traders.\n\nOn the other hand, an analyst known by the pseudonym “greatest trader” from Cryptoquant linked Ether’s continued weakness to future traders who have been actively selling.\n\nIn a post earlier this week, the analyst noted Ethereum’s ongoing bearish trend, illustrated by a declining 30-day moving average of the taker buy-sell ratio, signals dominant bearish sentiment among futures traders. In reading this metric, values above one signify bullish sentiment, while values below one indicate bearish sentiment.\n\nThe pundit shared a chart which depicts the continuous decline in the taker buy-sell ratio over the past few months, consistently remaining below the pivotal one mark and reaching a yearly low.\n\n“This consistent behavior underscores the dominant bearish sentiment among futures traders participating in Ethereum’s market.” He wrote.\n\nThe analyst noted that for Ethereum’s price to embark on a new bullish trajectory, it would require a shift in behaviour among futures traders, characterized by a more aggressive buying stance, as indicated by a metric rising above the critical one threshold.\n\nEther was trading at $1,636 at press time, barely up a percentage point over the past 24 hours.'}, {'id': 3, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vZGVjcnlwdC5jby9yZXNvdXJjZXMvd2hvLWlzLXZpdGFsaWstYnV0ZXJpbi1ldGhlcmV1bS1jcmVhdG9y0gFKaHR0cHM6Ly9kZWNyeXB0LmNvL3Jlc291cmNlcy93aG8taXMtdml0YWxpay1idXRlcmluLWV0aGVyZXVtLWNyZWF0b3I_YW1wPTE?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Thu, 07 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Who is Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum Creator? - Decrypt', 'content': "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEarn a free on-chain certificate touting your knowledge of Ethereum by taking Decrypt U's free course, Getting Started with Ethereum.\n\nAs of September 2023, Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world by total value, with a market capitalization of over $229 billion. Despite the fact that Ethereum’s value is lower than that of rival Bitcoin, though, there is a good argument to be made that Ethereum is more important for the crypto and blockchain spaces overall than its larger competitor. Since its launch in 2015, the Ethereum network has been instrumental in powering the next generation of decentralized applications (dApps) and, more recently, the world of decentralized finance (DeFi) more broadly.\n\nThis is thanks to Ethereum’s powerful smart contracts capabilities and versatility. As of March 2023, protocols built using the Ethereum network were responsible for about 90%, or $90 billion, of the total value locked in DeFi.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJust as Ethereum is a critical component of the crypto world and one that has shaped the development of the industry since its launch, the network’s founder Vitalik Buterin is similarly influential. The Russian-Canadian programmer and writer—who is not yet 30 years old as of this writing—is arguably the single most famous individual in the world of cryptocurrency today (another prime candidate for this title, Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto, is a pseudonymous name potentially representing more than one real person). Who is Vitalik Buterin, and how did he come to create Ethereum?\n\nEarly Interests Led to Crypto\n\nButerin was born in Russia but moved to Canada at a young age, where he was quickly recognized for his strong abilities in math. His earliest experiences with programming and crypto came at home, as his father was a computer scientist. Notably, Buterin’s early experience with the massively multiplayer online role-playing game World of Warcraft may have contributed to his desire to work outside of the traditional, centralized economics space: although a devoted player, he quit the game when developers made a change to the rules that he disagreed with.\n\nThrough high school and into college, Buterin honed his programming abilities and connected with influential mentors like the cryptographer Ian Goldberg, known for his involvement with the Tor Project among other things. It was during this time that he also first learned of Bitcoin, in 2011. Buterin wrote blog articles on cryptocurrency to earn his first BTC, eventually co-founding and contributing to Bitcoin Magazine.\n\nCollege Years and Ethereum Origins\n\nAs a student at the University of Waterloo, Buterin assisted Goldberg until his work in cryptocurrency began to take up a substantial portion of his time. At this stage, he left university to travel the world for several months to connect with Bitcoin developers. This experience was crucial to Buterin’s development of the Ethereum model, as he felt that the developers he met were all too concerned with specific uses for cryptocurrency. Buterin came to believe that the next generation of blockchain systems should be more versatile and broader.\n\nButerin’s interest in broadening Bitcoin’s scope led him to pursue a Turing-complete programming language to realize his vision. The young programmer created an initial white paper for this concept, which he called Ethereum, in 2013. Venture capitalist Peter Thiel’s eponymous Fellowship awarded Buterin a grant of $100,000 in 2014, allowing him to fully focus his efforts on developing the new ecosystem.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBetween Buterin’s initial white paper in 2013 and Ethereum’s eventual launch many months later, the vision developed to encompass much more than just a digital currency, adding ideas about smart contracts, decentralized applications, and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) as well. By early 2014, Buterin was ready to share this wider concept with the crypto community, and he formally announced the project in January. An initial coin offering followed, raising about $18 million worth of BTC and allowing Buterin and his development team to launch the Ethereum Foundation to oversee Ethereum’s continued growth. In July 2015, Ethereum officially launched.\n\nActivity Since Ethereum’s Launch\n\nThe story of Ethereum is one of prolonged success (although not entirely free of setbacks as well), as the platform is now responsible for settling trillions of dollars worth of transactions each year. Indeed, the number of Ethereum transactions eclipsed the number of Bitcoin transactions in 2021. It has also been instrumental as the foundational network supporting movements like non-fungible tokens, a host of altcoins, and much more.\n\nButerin has continued to play a highly active role in Ethereum’s success since launch. He has also been outspoken about what he sees as the ongoing dangers of centralized banking and currency control, making him a potent advocate for the crypto world even beyond his own network and token.\n\nButerin has also spoken out against what he sees as a potential “dystopian” future for the cryptocurrency industry in which ultra-wealthy whales fail to capitalize on the power of crypto to fight against authoritarian governments. He has pushed for Ethereum to play a role in making voting systems more fair, in helping to provide universal basic income, in supporting urban planning initiatives and public-works projects, and more. This may be one reason why Buterin was a particularly vocal supporter of The Merge, the late-2022 seismic shift in which Ethereum moved from a proof-of-work model to a proof-of-stake one. The Merge is expected to dramatically reduce the Ethereum network’s energy consumption and to lower costs. Additionally, Buterin is known for his philanthropy, as he donated $1.2 billion to India’s Covid relief fund in 2021, to several projects supporting Ukraine following Russia’s invasion in 2022, and additional funds to a variety of research foundations."}].

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, we see a mixed market trend for ETH at the moment. While the short-long moving average is showing a buy signal, the MACD indicator is signaling a sell. The Bollinger Bands signal is indicating a hold. This mixed signal suggests uncertainty in the market direction.

Considering the news analyst report, we see both positive and negative developments impacting the market trend for ETH. The launch of the 'Sell' feature by MetaMask could attract more users to hold assets in self-custody, but concerns about high fees could hinder adoption. The phishing scam incident and the proposal for blockchain privacy and regulation also add to the mixed sentiment in the market.

Overall, the market trend for ETH appears to be uncertain with conflicting signals and developments. Given the mixed signals and developments, I would take a cautious approach and suggest a neutral action at this time.

Fast forward to 2023, and Ethereum has made substantial progress in this domain. Advanced technologies like STARK, Zero-Knowledge rollups and Cairo are now part of the Ethereum landscape. Nevertheless, privacy remains a concern, mainly due to legal and acceptance issues surrounding tokens generated by privacy systems, as exemplified by the Tornado Cash case, concluded the developer.\n\nButerin introduced the concept of proof-of-innocence, a means to validate tokens within privacy systems without revealing transaction origins. This concept underscores the importance of privacy and ongoing efforts to optimize zk-SNARKs for seamless integration into mainstream finance.\n\nCentralization and hacks\n\nShifting to consensus security, Ethereum has fully embraced a consensus mechanism, but challenges endure.

The data stored in blocks is not accessible to the Ethereum Virtual Machine and will be deleted after a certain time period, which is touted to drastically reduce transaction costs.\n\n“In reality, the cost of rollups is down to data availability. We are writing all the data to layer 1, which is why we have exactly the same security. But it’s expensive; it represents 95% of the cost.”\n\nLiochon said that Linea’s prover, which essentially handles the off-chain computation that verifies, bundles, and then creates a cryptographic proof of the combined transactions, only represents a fifth of the cost.\n\nThis highlights the major hurdle in making ZK-rollups the go-to scaling solution for the Ethereum ecosystem as opposed to other solutions like Optimistic Rollups.\n\nLiochon also said that Linea aims to be a general-purpose ZK-rollup that will be used for a variety of decentralized applications and solutions within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n“We are a generic rollup. We don’t want to have a specific use case or specific domain. It’s quite important to support all types of applications, including DeFi, gaming and social.”\n\nAs Cointelegraph previously reported, Consensys completed the launch of Linea in August 2023, having onboarding over 150 partners and bridging more than $26 million in Ether (ETH).\n\nMagazine: Here’s how Ethereum’s ZK-rollups can become interoperable'}, {'id': 0, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vY3J5cHRvLm5ld3MvbGVhcm4vZXRoZXJldW0tbm9kZXMtYW5kLWNsaWVudHMtYS1jb21wbGV0ZS1ndWlkZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Fri, 08 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Ethereum Node and Client: A Complete Guide - crypto.news', 'content': 'Ethereum nodes and clients play a pivotal role in the ongoing transformation of the crypto landscape. Ethereum, a cryptocurrency that has captured the attention of enthusiasts for months, is poised to surpass Bitcoin as the industry’s leading digital currency. Vitalik Buterin, the visionary creator of Ethereum, and the dedicated team of developers have been diligently working on a series of upgrades leading up to the eagerly anticipated main merge.\n\nEthereum nodes and clients form the backbone of this groundbreaking network. They are responsible for validating transactions, executing smart contracts, and ensuring the overall security and decentralization of the Ethereum ecosystem. In this article, we will delve deeper into the world of Ethereum nodes and clients, exploring their significance, functionality, and integral role in shaping the future of blockchain technology.\n\nThe Origin Story of Ethereum\n\nIn 2014, Vitalik Buterin published a white paper introducing Ethereum. The following year, 2015, saw the launch of the Ethereum platform by Buterin and Joe Lubin. Joe is also the founder of ConsenSys – a blockchain software company.\n\nEthereum has changed and improved a lot since it was first created, and all of these changes have led to one goal: making Ethereum the best crypto blockchain on the internet. Its operations are insanely good, and investors can trust that they are investing in a good project.\n\nIts ecosystem is made up of a variety of different specifications. Let’s take a look at some of its finest features: Ethereum Nodes and Clients.\n\nThe Ethereum Ecosystem\n\nIn simple terms, Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts. Smart contracts are basically application code that is executed and verified by the network. Ethereum has become the go-to platform for DeFi (decentralized finance) and NFTs (non-fungible tokens).\n\nEthereum was created to be scalable, programmable, secure, and decentralized. It’s the blockchain of choice for those who are creating technology on top of it. This blockchain is essential for these DeFi applications to develop and bring about a financial revolution.\n\nEthereum provides a highly flexible platform on which developers can create dApps using the native Solidity programming language and Ethereum Virtual Machine. The founders of Ethereum saw blockchain technology’s potential for more than just creating a secure virtual payment method. Now, Ethereum is changing from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS).\n\nWhat Is an Ethereum node?\n\nA node on the Ethereum network is any computer that runs the software required to interact with it. Nodes communicate with one another to validate transactions and store data about the blockchain’s state.\n\nDepending on your needs, whether a dApp or a wallet, any client can run three types of nodes: full, light, and archive. Each node will uniquely evaluate data and provide various synchronization methods. This refers to how quickly your node can get new information so that you can use it.\n\nFull Nodes: Full nodes are jam-packed with data. They keep and distribute all of the blockchain data from the Ethereum network. A full node will also participate in block validation.\n\nA full node can interact directly with any smart contract on a public blockchain. In addition, nodes can also deploy new smart contracts onto the same type of blockchain. However, running a full node may be costly in terms of hardware and bandwidth. Obtaining all of the data can be very time-consuming.\n\nLight Nodes: Light nodes are similar to full nodes. However, they handle significantly less information. The light node keeps track of the header chain. This is the most basic information in a block, such as a timestamp and the previous block’s hash.\n\nLight nodes are blockchain clients that only request data as needed. They can verify the validity of data, but they don’t participate in block validation. Remote clients often use light nodes.\n\nArchive Nodes: A archive node is a node that keeps all of the data that a full node does and creates an archive of past blockchain states. Even after a client has finished synchronizing, archive nodes will store historical data.\n\nOn the other hand, full and light nodes will “prune” the historical blockchain data. This means they can rebuild it but do not retain this information. Archive nodes may not be of much use to the average user. However, they’ve been instrumental in creating block explorers, wallet providers, and chain analytics applications.\n\nWhat Are Clients in Ethereum?\n\nIn computing, a “client” is software downloaded to your computer that helps you interact with another type of software or service provided by a server. An Ethereum client is a program that enables Ethereum nodes to read blocks on the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts. You’ll need to download an Ethereum client software to run a node.\n\nWith Ethereum, many different clients can be created using various programming languages. However, they all follow the same protocol and rules. This allows them to interact with each other on the Ethereum network.\n\nThe most popular functions of Ethereum clients include transaction and mining interfaces, but their applications extend far beyond basic blockchain operations. The Ethereum Foundation maintains the following Ethereum clients:\n\n· Geth (Go)\n\n· OpenEthereum (Rust)\n\n· Nethermind (C#, .NET)\n\n· Besu (Java)\n\n· Erigon (Go/Multi)\n\nIf the Ethereum Foundation doesn’t support your go-to programming language, don’t worry–numerous third-party Ethereum clients can provide you with the language support you need. There are 3 types of Ethereum clients.\n\nFull Client: Full clients enable any node on the network to complete all tasks, such as mining, transactions, validating block headers, and running smart contracts.\n\nFull clients enable any node on the network to complete all tasks, such as mining, transactions, validating block headers, and running smart contracts. Light Client: Light clients are a subset of client functionality. Because they do not keep the entire Ethereum blockchain, light clients can offer quicker speeds and free up data storage space over full clients.\n\nLight clients are a subset of client functionality. Because they do not keep the entire Ethereum blockchain, light clients can offer quicker speeds and free up data storage space over full clients. Remote Client: A remote client is a third kind of client that resembles a light client. The primary distinction is that a remote client does not keep its copy of the blockchain and does not validate transactions or block headers.\n\nRather than running a full client, remote clients simply connect to the Ethereum blockchain network via a light or full client. These clients are most often used as wallets for sending and receiving transactions.\n\nThe Difference Between Ethereum Nodes and Clients?\n\nAlthough nodes and clients are often used interchangeably, they serve different purposes in accessing the Ethereum network. It may help to think of nodes and clients like a computer accessing the internet: the node would be an operating system, such as Windows or iOS, while the client is the physical computer.\n\nYou can tap into the node operating system using a client computer. From there, you gain access to the internet–regardless of which type of computer or operating system you use.\n\nBottom Line\n\nNodes and clients are frequently equated, although they are not the same thing. The Clients and Nodes play vital roles in keeping the Ethereum blockchain functioning correctly. In short, an Ethereum node and client depend on each other to keep the Ethereum network functioning.'}]. Analyze the news and estimate the market trend accordingly.

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

Besides "technical" addresses associated with wallets controlled by largest CEXes, the operator of an MEV bot becomes the #1.\n\n$70 million for 1.26 million transactions: Meet largest gas spender on Ethereum (ETH)\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) wallet associated with a maximal extractable value (MEV) bot dubbed Jared From Subway (jaredfromsubway.eth) spent almost 38,000 Ethers (ETH) on gas, or over $70 million in equivalent. The bot initiated 1.26 million on-chain transactions, as demonstrated on a Dune dashboard created by Dragonfly\'s Hildobby.\n\njaredfromsubway.eth has now spent 37k ETH ($70m) on gas, the most of any address on Ethereum 🤯\n\n\n\nsrc: https://t.co/Ftl9QzMJPr pic.twitter.com/TdAeRvvzjJ — hildobby (@hildobby_) September 8, 2023\n\nAs such, this bot becomes the largest Ethereum (ETH) wallet in terms of gas spending. To provide context, the second position is occupied by one of Binance-controlled wallets with over 7.73 million transactions. It spends on gas less than half of what Jared From Subway transferred to Ethereum (ETH) validators.\n\nIt should also be noted that the Ethereum (ETH) gas price inches closer to multi-month lows. The current gas price is 9.39 Gwei, which means that one Uniswap (UNI) exchange is charged with approximately a $4 fee, as per Etherscan.\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) community is thrilled by such impressive statistics of an Ethereum MEV bot. Meanwhile, the net profit or PnL data for the account are yet to be calculated.\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, MEV bots are responsible for the majority of trading activity on DEXes. For instance, 80% of Uniswap\'s (UNI) trading volume across all pairs is generated by AI-powered MEV bots.\n\nWhat is special about MEV bot by JaredFromSubway?\n\nMEV bots are automated mechanisms designed to frontrun pending trades in the Ethereum (ETH) mempool by corrupting validators with higher fees. Once the bot identifies a large transaction, it can manipulate the price of this or that asset and execute the deal with a more attractive price.\n\nThe first signs of activity from the jaredfromsubway.eth-backed bot were registered in February 2023. Experts say that its algorithms are more sophisticated: It managed to have its transactions included in over 60% of Ethereum (ETH) blocks. In April 2023, it was spending over $1.1 million on gas daily.\n\nThe net number of jaredfromsubway.eth victims might exceed hundreds of thousands of DEX traders.\n\nThe bot is named after Jared Scott Fogle, a spokesperson of the American fast food chain Subway. Fogle advertised the restaurants for 15 years before being arrested for child sex tourism and child pornography storage in 2015.'}, {'id': 7, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NidGMuY29tL25ld3MvZXRoZXJldW0vaGVyZXMtd2h5LWV0aGVyZXVtLXByaWNlLWJhcmVseS1tb3ZlZC1mb2xsb3dpbmctYXJrcy1ldGYtYXBwbGljYXRpb24v0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmV3c2J0Yy5jb20vbmV3cy9ldGhlcmV1bS9oZXJlcy13aHktZXRoZXJldW0tcHJpY2UtYmFyZWx5LW1vdmVkLWZvbGxvd2luZy1hcmtzLWV0Zi1hcHBsaWNhdGlvbi9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Sat, 09 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Here’s Why Ethereum Price Barely Moved Following Ark’s ETF Application - NewsBTC', 'content': 'The price of Ethereum seems to be back under the influence of the current market sentiment despite enjoying a relatively positive week. On Wednesday, September 6, Ark Invest filed for the first Ethereum spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States.\n\nThis ETF application had a tame impact on the price of Ether, with the cryptocurrency only climbing to $1,650 the following day. Moreover, the token has almost fully reversed the minor gains from the significant development.\n\nEthereum Price Registers 0.1% Rise Last Week – Here’s Why\n\nEthereum currently changes hands at about $1,628, according to data from CoinGecko. A negligible 0.1% price increase in the last seven days underscores the struggling market performance of the second-largest cryptocurrency.\n\nA spot ETH exchange-traded fund is an investment vehicle that tracks the price of Ethereum on the spot market, allowing investors to buy and sell the crypto asset via a brokerage account. A product of this kind is expected to boost interest and investment in the Ether token.\n\nNevertheless, the price of ETH has remained relatively unmoved this week despite the optimistic news. A recent report by blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock has provided insight into why the news barely impacted the price of Ethereum.\n\n‘Supply & Demand Balance’\n\nAccording to the data analytics platform, the current supply and demand balance is one of the primary reasons why the ETH price continues to move sideways. “Large holdings are concentrated close to ETH’s current price, consolidating prices in a tight range,” IntoTheBlock said.\n\nSource: IntoTheBlock\n\nIntoTheBlock data shows that a total of 5.1 million ETH was acquired below the $1,600 mark to create support, while a total of 6.5 million ETH was purchased at a price above this level to establish resistance. The blockchain analytics firm concluded that traders agree to transact within a narrow range with a large concentration of ETH positions.\n\n‘Automated Buying, Discretionary Selling’\n\nAdditionally, IntoTheBlock believes that while bullish traders seemed to have bought the news, “discretionary sellers” overtook the narrative not too long after.\n\n“A key factor behind the discretionary selling is likely to be FTX’s upcoming liquidation of reportedly $3B in crypto holdings,” the report read.\n\nWhile FTX has yet to disclose when it intends to execute these liquidations, it is likely that recent activity on the exchange’s wallets alarmed the market.\n\nThis sentiment also seems to be reflected in the performance of SOL after global payment giant VISA disclosed that it will use the Solana network for payment settlements. While the value of SOL jumped by more than 5% to trade above $20 immediately after the announcement, the cryptocurrency is back trading beneath $19.5.\n\nWith the Ethereum and Solana tokens constituting a significant portion of FTX’s holdings, it is likely that the slow market performance of these assets is driven by traders being cautious because of the impending liquidation.\n\nETH price continues to move sideways on the daily timeframe | Source: ETHUSDT chart on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

The rally appears to have been caused by a tweet from the Stellar team, posted on Saturday, that says, “Something cool is dropping in 10 days.”\n\nIn the news…\n\nAfter the slow news cycles of the last fortnight, this week saw a return to the usual slew of adoption announcements, although any indication of political breakthroughs for crypto over in Washington was pretty thin on the ground.\n\nOn Monday, the London Stock Exchange Group announced that it is using blockchain technology to build an exchange offering tokenized versions of traditional financial assets. LSEG is currently in talks with multiple regulatory bodies about it, including the UK government and HM Treasury.\n\nThat day, European Central Bank executive board member Fabio Panetta took aim at stablecoins issued by private companies like PayPal, which launched its own dollar-pegged PayPal USD (PYUSD) last month.\n\nSpeaking at the European Parliament’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs meeting on Monday, Panetta said his main criticism of PYUSD and similar coins is that “private providers of payment services, including PayPal, have no incentive to limit the take-up of their stablecoins or the range of services they provide. Quite the opposite: their objective is to expand their customer base and gain market share.”\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn the other hand, Panetta thinks the proposed European central bank digital currency (CBDC), the digital euro, “would pay due attention to orderly adjustments in the financial sector while offering payment service providers a platform for innovations with pan-euro area reach,” he said.\n\nOn Tuesday, top-five South Korean financial conglomerate Hana Financial Group announced a partnership between its KEB Hana Bank and crypto custodian BitGo for late 2024.\n\nThe new deal ties a major domestic financial player to the crypto industry, although KEB Hana Bank has already taken steps into blockchain when it opened a digital branch in metaverse platform The Sandbox.\n\nCrypto-friendly payments giant Visa said on Tuesday that it has now expanded its settlement options to include USDC on the Solana blockchain. The company also announced that it was working with merchant acquirers Worldpay and Nuvei to allow them to settle using USDC instead of fiat.\n\nOn Wednesday, The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)—recognized by the SEC as the designated accounting standard setter for public companies—voted unanimously to change how companies disclose crypto holdings in order to give greater transparency to the trade. The new rules take effect in 2025.\n\nTwo global financial regulators, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the G20’s risk watchdog, the Financial Stability Board (FSB), on Thursday released a white paper outlining their plans for coordinated action to ensure that there is a “comprehensive policy and regulatory response for crypto-assets [as it] is necessary to address the risks of crypto-assets to macroeconomic and financial stability.”\n\nWhile the paper’s authors acknowledge that crypto doesn’t currently pose a risk to the financial system, they argue that widespread adoption would undermine the effectiveness of monetary policy.\n\nThe paper recommends constituencies “safeguard monetary sovereignty and strengthen monetary policy frameworks, guard against excessive capital flow volatility and adopt unambiguous tax treatment of crypto-assets” to protect themselves from risks.\n\nAD\n\nAD'}, {'id': 12, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIzLzA5LzA5LzItY3J5cHRvY3VycmVuY2llcy10aGF0LWNvdWxkLWR3YXJmLWV0aGVyZXVtL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Sat, 09 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': '2 Cryptocurrencies That Could Dwarf Ethereum - The Motley Fool', 'content': 'Ethereum (ETH -1.09%) remains the second-most valuable cryptocurrency in the world by market capitalization, trailing only Bitcoin (BTC -0.71%). Given Ethereum\'s dominant position in so many key areas of the blockchain world, it can be hard to imagine any other cryptocurrency ever surpassing it.\n\nBut for the past few years, a long line of rivals have attempted to do exactly that. Many of them have been described as "Ethereum killers," due to their superior performance metrics and rapidly growing blockchain ecosystems. And two that particularly stand out right now are Cardano (ADA 4.66%) and Solana (SOL 8.56%). Let\'s take a closer look at how they might eventually surpass Ethereum over the long haul.\n\n1. Cardano\n\nWith a market cap of nearly $9 billion, Cardano ranks as the seventh-largest cryptocurrency in the world. That might sound impressive, but Ethereum has a market cap of almost $200 billion, so Cardano needs to increase in value by a multiple of 20 to 25 just to reach Ethereum\'s current size. To dwarf Ethereum, Cardano would likely need to 50x in value.\n\nThat\'s a big ask, so it\'s important that the founder of Cardano, Charles Hoskinson, also happens to be one of the co-founders of Ethereum. If there\'s anyone who knows how to out-Ethereum Ethereum, it\'s Hoskinson. He\'s been very vocal about the structural flaws of Ethereum in the past, arguing that Cardano has superior blockchain technology. This summer, he even suggested that Cardano would eventually surpass Ethereum and Bitcoin to become the top cryptocurrency in the world.\n\nFrom my perspective, it all starts with decentralized finance (DeFi). But in 2021, Cardano upgraded its blockchain to support the smart contracts required for DeFi, and it has continually made new improvements and upgrades since then. This year, for example, Cardano saw the launch of its first stablecoin, as well as a burst of new activity on decentralized exchanges. If Cardano\'s DeFi ecosystem continues to grow quickly, this could lead to rapid gains in valuation.\n\nMoreover, growth in emerging markets could send Cardano soaring. As Hoskinson outlined in a recent interview, Cardano is looking for blockchain partners across Africa, South America, Asia, and the Middle East. If Cardano becomes the most popular blockchain network in these regions, then it could have a massive impact on its future valuation.\n\n2. Solana\n\nSimilar in size to Cardano, Solana has a market cap of $8 billion. So it will need the same types of growth catalysts as Cardano to ever surpass Ethereum. In short, Solana needs a big, think-outside-the-box idea to drive 50-fold valuation gains.\n\nAnd that big idea might just be mobile crypto. Back in summer 2022, Solana first unveiled its strategic vision for mobile crypto, including a new flagship Android-based mobile device optimized for crypto and a software development kit to help developers around the world build for mobile crypto. It sounded like a lot of hype, but this spring, Solana finally launched its Saga crypto phone. The concept was simple but brilliant: Everything you do on your phone involving crypto should be simple and intuitive, and you should be able to bring crypto with you wherever you go.\n\nThe problem is that the collapse of FTX last year had disastrous implications for Solana, which had extensive links to former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried. All the fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) swirling around Solana since the FTX meltdown has taken a toll on the Solana ecosystem. Some high-profile NFT collections, for example, decided to migrate to other blockchains this year, and overall activity on the Solana ecosystem has just started to regain its previous footing. The good news is that Solana is up more than 100% for the year, so the worst may be behind it.\n\nWhat are the chances of overtaking Ethereum?\n\nFor either Cardano or Solana to ever overtake Ethereum, a lot has to go right. The fact that there have been so many purported "Ethereum killers," and none of them have ever managed to unseat Ethereum tells you a lot. The bottom line is that it\'s very difficult to overtake a market leader with a first-mover advantage, especially within the tech sector.\n\nIf forced to choose between Cardano and Solana, I\'d pick Solana. This is a crypto that is not just trying to out-Ethereum Ethereum, it\'s actually proposing a new approach to blockchain technology based around mobile. For me, that\'s an exciting concept and a big reason why I think Solana might just pull off what many people think is impossible.'}]. Analyze the news and estimate the market trend accordingly.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, the market trend for ETH cryptocurrency appears to be bullish in the short term. The increase in the number of transactions, unique addresses, and value transferred, along with the stable open prices, indicate a positive trend. Although there is a potential for a short-term correction based on the MACD signal, the overall sentiment is bullish.

Considering the news analyst report, there are mixed sentiments regarding Ethereum and its competitors. While Solana and Cardano are seen as potential rivals to Ethereum with positive growth prospects, there are concerns about Ethereum's price movement despite positive news.

Taking into account the overall analysis, I believe that the bullish trend in the market is likely to continue for ETH. Therefore, I am confident in buying more ETH at this time to maximize profit.

Ethereum [ETH] and other top networks have experienced a significant slowdown in activity as is usually the case under such circumstances.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nThe impact of the current market conditions was evident in multiple facets of the Ethereum network. This includes its TVL, which was a long way from its historic high. It had a total value locked of $21.42 billion at the time of writing, which is a stark contrast compared to its historic peak above $108 billion in 2021.\n\nDespite the slightly improved conditions so far this year, the market is still in a state of caution. As such, we have seen significant outflows in TVL since April. An indication that investor confidence in ETH’s bullish potential is not there yet.\n\nRegardless of the slow and negative TVL growth in the last few months, there are some areas in ETH’s journey this year that inspire some more confidence. For example, Ethereum’s total value locked in ETH deposit contracts just achieved a new historic peak at over 28.7 million ETH.\n\n? #Ethereum $ETH Total Value in the ETH 2.0 Deposit Contract just reached an ATH of 28,734,846 ETH View metric:https://t.co/SzbMPqvhlb pic.twitter.com/eiDkE5DVw4 — glassnode alerts (@glassnodealerts) September 9, 2023\n\nThe total value locked also confirms that Ethereum’s ecosystem is still experiencing healthy network activity.

According to its supply distribution metric, addresses holding over 10 million ETH (denoted in red) have been accumulating in the last 4 weeks. This category controls the largest share of ETH’s circulating supply at 23.55%.\n\nAddresses in the 10,000 to 100,000 ETH category have also been accumulating ETH since the start of September.

One year ago, investors salivated at the thought of what impact The Merge might have on Ethereum\'s future price.\n\nBut guess what? Ethereum is still trading under $1,650, at almost exactly the same price that it was 12 months ago. This raises an interesting question: What exactly have we learned from Ethereum and The Merge? And how can those lessons be applied when evaluating other cryptocurrencies? Let\'s take a closer look.\n\nTech upgrades\n\nPerhaps the biggest lesson here is that tech upgrades, no matter how big, do not always lead to huge price increases. This is an important point to keep in mind, based on how much hype many of these tech upgrades get. They are usually presented as major catalysts capable of sending a crypto soaring. But the truth might be quite different.\n\nWhat\'s interesting in the case of Ethereum is that The Merge was a truly transformational change and theoretically should have had a dramatic impact on Ethereum\'s price. The Merge transformed Ethereum from an old, energy-intensive, proof-of-work blockchain into a modern, energy-efficient, proof-of-stake blockchain. So, The Merge was a very different type of event than a typical annual upgrade that many blockchains undergo, and yet it still didn\'t have an appreciable impact on Ethereum\'s price.\n\nFrom my perspective, it means that the "tech upgrade = growth catalyst" investment thesis is no longer useful for evaluating cryptocurrencies. Going forward, you can pretty much assume that either the market is going to price in these upgrades as they are announced or the market is going to ignore the upgrade entirely. So, trying to time your investment decisions around key upgrades is not likely to be an effective strategy.\n\nRegulatory risk\n\nThe second big lesson from The Merge is that new business models can lead to new regulatory headaches. As soon as Ethereum became a proof-of-stake blockchain, it meant that there was going to be much more of a focus on crypto staking, which is the process of "locking up" your crypto in exchange for a financial reward. Until The Merge, crypto staking was a sleepy backwater of the crypto industry. But after The Merge, everyone was trying to figure out how to capture those financial rewards.\n\nAnd that included, unfortunately, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). From the perspective of SEC chairman Gary Gensler, new crypto-staking products sounded a lot like securities, and he vowed to take a closer look. In February, the SEC ended up going after cryptocurrency exchange Kraken for its crypto-staking activities, and that immediately got the attention of the market. Right now, Coinbase Global (COIN 1.38%) is locked in an epic battle with the SEC over the future of crypto staking.\n\nIf you parse through all the filings, documents, and back-and-forth between market participants and regulatory authorities, it sounds a lot like the SEC is not so much opposed to the concept of staking as it is to the way staking is marketed to retail investors, who might think it\'s a no-brainer, no-risk guaranteed return of some kind. But still, if you\'re an investor in Ethereum, you have to be aware that some regulatory risk does exist here, and it was all brought about by a change in business model (i.e., the shift from mining to staking).\n\nMacroeconomic outlook\n\nThe third big lesson is that the macroeconomic outlook matters more for crypto than many of us would like to admit. Gone are the days when the crypto market was completely separate from traditional, mainstream financial markets. With a surge of new institutional money into crypto comes a surge of institutional thinking about the crypto market. And that means a 24/7 obsession with the macroeconomic outlook.\n\nThus, while 2023 should have been all about the new era of Ethereum 2.0, it has instead been all about regional bank crises, Federal Reserve policy, jobs data, and inflation data. Long story short, there is absolutely no way Ethereum is going to skyrocket in price if banks are failing, inflation is surging, and economic growth is anemic. This completely changes the game for many crypto investors, who need to take a much more holistic view of the financial markets into account when choosing where to invest.\n\nA framework for analyzing cryptocurrencies\n\nTaken together, these three lessons can offer the basic framework for evaluating just about any cryptocurrency. First, make sure you understand the underlying business model of a crypto. Next, layer in some macroeconomic analysis, with a focus on key events or metrics that are being watched by the biggest institutional investors. And only then can you start to focus on all the interesting features of a new tech upgrade. In short, the tech upgrade is just the cherry on top of the final dessert, not the main course.\n\nAnd Ethereum? I\'m still bullish on this crypto, even if it hasn\'t taken off the way it was supposed to one year ago. It\'s still up 35% for the year, and recent developments seem to suggest that institutional investors are adding to their Ethereum positions. But I\'m not trying to time the market around new tech upgrades. Instead, I\'m investing in Ethereum because I have confidence in its long-term growth prospects.'}].

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

As covered by U.Today previously, Jared From Subway, the operator of the most effective MEV bots, paid over $70 million in gas since being launched in February 2023.\n\nThe bot made over 1.1 million transactions but paid more in gas fees than the wallets of exchanges that used Ethereum (ETH) 10 times more frequently.\n\nPer the statistics, during periods of pale market performance, Ethereum (ETH) MEV bots — mechanisms for frontrunning transactions by paying extra gas fees — might be responsible for 80-90% of top DEXes\' trading volumes.'}, {'id': 7, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vZGFpbHlob2RsLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA5LzExL2V4dHJlbWUtZXRoZXJldW0tY3Jhc2gtbm93LWluLXRoZS1jYXJkcy1hY2NvcmRpbmctdG8tYW5hbHlzdC1iZW5qYW1pbi1jb3dlbi1oZXJlcy1oaXMtdGFyZ2V0L9IBggFodHRwczovL2RhaWx5aG9kbC5jb20vMjAyMy8wOS8xMS9leHRyZW1lLWV0aGVyZXVtLWNyYXNoLW5vdy1pbi10aGUtY2FyZHMtYWNjb3JkaW5nLXRvLWFuYWx5c3QtYmVuamFtaW4tY293ZW4taGVyZXMtaGlzLXRhcmdldC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Mon, 11 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Extreme Ethereum Crash Now in the Cards, According to Analyst Benjamin Cowen – Here’s His Target - The Daily Hodl', 'content': "A widely followed crypto analyst says that a massive crash for the leading smart contract platform is within the realm of possibility.\n\nIn a new strategy session, crypto trader Benjamin Cowen tells his 787,000 YouTube subscribers that a freefall to the $400-$800 range is in the cards for Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest crypto asset by market cap.\n\n“There’s a good chance that [there will] be a lower low, and it might not be a much lower low, maybe it just goes down to just below $800.

Discover SCENE\n\nInstitutions have fallen out of love with Ethereum in 2023, selling upwards of nine digits of the asset in the year to date.\n\nAccording to the latest analysis by CoinShares, the number two cryptocurrency saw $4.8 million in outflows this past week, reaching $108 million in sales this year. That places it as the most sold digital asset by large entities, wrote James Butterfill, head of research for CoinShares.\n\nThe analyst labeled it the “least loved digital asset” for exchange-traded product (ETP) investors, trouncing its second-place holder, Tron, by more than $50 million.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHowever, all that could change soon after Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest applied for the first spot Ethereum ETF last week—the first of its kind in the United States. And that news comes after the network turned inflationary and on-chain activity plummeted as the grueling bear market carries on.\n\nWhat Ethereum has felt this year is broadly based among digital assets, per CoinShares.\n\nSentiment regarding institutions purchasing crypto remains poor, according to their weekly report published this morning. It showed a fourth consecutive week of selling, with outflows totaling $59 million over the past seven days.\n\nThe current run of outflows, wrote James Butterfill, reaches $294 million, representing 0.9% of total assets under management (AUM).\n\nSelling came primarily from North America, with Canada and the United States offloading $17.6 million and $12.3 million in the past seven days. Germany led the way across the Atlantic and into Europe, with $20 million worth of selling.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nButterfill told Decrypt that the main reason behind the rampant selling is the U.S. dollar. It has shown strength as of late, driven by the “market’s belief we are in a soft landing scenario,” posting eight straight weeks of green candles.\n\nEven so, he reckons that as the year ends, it will “increasingly be seen that this isn’t the case,” especially if high-interest rates kick in.\n\nAlthough the previous report by CoinShares highlighted a bunch of under-the-surface trading, with volumes skyrocketing by 90% to $2.8 billion, this week\'s trading activity plummeted.\n\nVolumes “are super low,” revealed Butterfill, averaging “just” $2.3 billion daily over the past month, compared to the yearly average of $7 billion. The last seven days were an even further cry from these numbers, dropping by 73% to $743 million.\n\nThis suggests, the analyst told Decrypt, an “apathetic investor”—clarifying, however, that the market saw a very similar scenario prior to the last two Bitcoin halvings.\n\nBitcoin was the most damaged crypto asset last week, with large entities offloading a whopping $69 million worth of the asset despite being in the green the week prior.\n\nAdding to the bearishness, Bitcoin short products saw the largest weekly inflows since March, with $15 million pouring into these instruments. “Timing wise this is interesting as the inflows in March also came at a time of heightened regulatory uncertainty,” said Butterfill.\n\nWhat’s to come? Butterfill suspects that many investors are waiting to see what the Fed will do this month with interest rates, with any potential weakness in the dollar “likely to be supportive for Bitcoin.”\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe analyst concluded, however, that CPI could come in above expectations due to the swift surge in gasoline prices. He also pointed to FTX, telling Decrypt, "There are the FTX asset sales ‘stock overhangs’ potentially to deal with too.”'}]. Analyze the news and estimate the market trend accordingly.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, we can see that the market trend for ETH appears to be bullish, with indicators such as the short-long moving average signal, MACD signal, and Bollinger Bands signal pointing towards a potential buying opportunity. The MACD signal turning to "buy" at the lower open price of 1549.89 further supports this bullish trend.

However, the news analyst report presents mixed signals, with articles highlighting potential security breaches, inflationary concerns, and bearish predictions for Ethereum. While these factors could potentially impact market sentiment negatively, it is important to note that the on-chain analysis is currently indicating a bullish trend for ETH.

Considering the overall analysis and the bullish market trend indicated by the on-chain data, I would recommend buying ETH with a confidence level of -0.6. This suggests a strong conviction in the upward trend of ETH and a willingness to allocate 60% of cash towards purchasing more ETH.

Based on the news articles provided, there are a few key points to consider for estimating the market trend for ETH cryptocurrency trading:

1. Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin's Twitter hack due to a SIM swap incident highlights the importance of security measures in the cryptocurrency space. This incident may lead to increased awareness and emphasis on securing accounts and assets, which could potentially have a positive impact on the market sentiment for Ethereum.

2. The significant liquidations totaling over $185.97 million in the cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin witnessing high liquidation values, indicate a period of market volatility. This volatility could lead to short-term price fluctuations and uncertainty in the market.

3. Apple CEO Tim Cook's comments on owning cryptocurrency and the potential acceptance of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin for products like Apple Pay could have a positive impact on the overall cryptocurrency market sentiment. However, the timing of these comments coinciding with near peak valuations for Bitcoin and Ethereum suggests that investors who bought at that time may have experienced losses.

Overall, the market trend for ETH cryptocurrency trading may be influenced by a combination of factors such as security concerns, market volatility, and positive sentiment from influential figures like Tim Cook. It is important to closely monitor market developments and investor sentiment to make informed trading decisions.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, the market trend for ETH cryptocurrency appears to be bullish. The open prices have been increasing, the number of transactions and unique addresses are on the rise, and technical indicators are mostly showing buy or hold signals. This indicates a positive momentum in the market with growing interest and activity in the ETH network.

Considering the news analyst report, while there are some concerns such as security incidents and market volatility, there are also positive factors like potential acceptance of cryptocurrencies by influential figures like Tim Cook. These factors may lead to short-term price fluctuations but overall sentiment seems to be leaning towards a positive outlook for Ethereum.

Taking into account both reports, it seems that the bullish trend in the market is likely to continue in the near term. Therefore, I am confident in my prediction and will take a significant action to buy ETH.

Something to compete with the likes of Google and Twitter, without going down a closed, centralized system such as China’s tight integration of Wechat, Alipay and increasingly CBDC.\n\nButerin envisions a gradual on-ramping process for new Web3 users to create an Ethereum address, initially controlled by a familiar service like Gmail, but using account abstraction, giving people the ability to take ownership when they are ready to use more crypto-native approaches.\n\n“Basically, give people the opportunity to slide down the decentralization ladder and then, at the end of it, really properly be in this totally independent stack that actually works together — all the different pieces inside it,” he said.\n\nDon’t miss the next big story – join our free daily newsletter.'}, {'id': 6, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vZGFpbHlob2RsLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA5LzEzL3Zpc2Etc2F5cy10aGlzLWV0aGVyZXVtLXJpdmFsLWhhcy11bmlxdWUtdGVjaG5vbG9naWNhbC1hZHZhbnRhZ2VzLW92ZXItb3RoZXItY2hhaW5zL9IBeWh0dHBzOi8vZGFpbHlob2RsLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA5LzEzL3Zpc2Etc2F5cy10aGlzLWV0aGVyZXVtLXJpdmFsLWhhcy11bmlxdWUtdGVjaG5vbG9naWNhbC1hZHZhbnRhZ2VzLW92ZXItb3RoZXItY2hhaW5zL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Wed, 13 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Visa Says This Ethereum Rival Has ‘Unique Technological Advantages’ Over Other Chains - The Daily Hodl', 'content': "Credit card giant Visa says that one Ethereum (ETH) competitor has unique technological advantages over other blockchains as a payments platform.\n\nIn a new company blog post, the financial services titan says that smart contract platform Solana (SOL) has distinctive features that set it apart from its rivals, such as low and predictable transfer fees, high throughput rates and significant node support.\n\nAccording to Visa, Solana even has the upper hand against the king crypto Bitcoin (BTC) and ETH in some aspects.\n\n“Solana’s transaction fees are not only affordable, usually less than $0.001, but predictable. This level of low-cost predictability helps make it an attractive network to explore efficiencies and cost savings for existing payment operations.\n\nIn [the figure] below, Solana clearly stands out from a cost perspective compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum, whose fees can fluctuate unpredictably based on demand for transactions to execute on the network. A network with unpredictable transaction costs can be more difficult for payment companies to manage within their products and can lead to confusing consumer experiences.”\n\nVisa goes on to say that because of Solana’s efficiency, they have decided to expand their stablecoin settlement program to include Solana as a means of testing the blockchain’s capacity to meet the financial demands of modern corporations.\n\n“Solana’s unique technological advantages, including high throughput with parallel processing, low cost with localized fee markets and high resiliency with a significant number of nodes and multiple node clients, work together to create a scalable blockchain platform with a compelling value proposition for payments.\n\nThese are some of the reasons that we decided to expand our stablecoin settlement pilot to include transactions over the Solana network.

Does the virtual machine suffer from limitations that are inherent to the execution layer of the system, or can developers overcome them?\n\nWhile rollups take the computation load off the Ethereum mainchain, Blockworks co-founder Michael Ippolito wondered how the computation that occurs directly on Ethereum could be more “performant.”\n\n“Do rollups solve all of our scalability challenges, or is there still work to be done on the execution layer?” he asked during the Permissionless II conference in Austin, Texas.\n\nMonad Labs developer relations engineer Kevin Galler replied: “A lot of the current limitations of the EVM we know today are actually more of a side effect of how the backend computer of this EVM has been constructed up until now,” but are not inherent to the interface or the bytecode.\n\n“You can actually design parallelism and stuff into this,” he said, acknowledging that “there’s stuff you have to work around to maintain backwards compatibility.”\n\n“There’s like, 20 years of high performance computing research on how to do these things,” he said, “so, it’s a very solvable problem.”\n\nOffchain Labs senior software engineer Raul Jordan admitted that the current implementation of the EVM is “fairly slow for many reasons,” adding “there are many things we can do to power that up.”\n\nJordan noted that developers are already accustomed to being able to build DeFi primitives and other “really cool applications” with the EVM as it stands today, but wondered “how can we give them superpowers to build something greater than they have before?”\n\n“How can we empower them?” he asked. “Should we make the EVM faster, or can we introduce new constructs that allow them to do things that weren’t possible before?”\n\nCan’t cheat physics\n\nSomani expressed concerns with the possibility of an excess of layer-2 protocols. “The issue with the single threaded EVM…is that it results in a lot of rollups.”\n\n“There’s people suggesting there should be millions of rollups or something,” Somani continued. “That’s going to lead to a lot of issues with liquidity fragmentation and end-to-user experience.”\n\n“Sufficiently advanced virtual machines” have local fee markets, Somani said, “so that if there’s a lot of activity on one app, it doesn’t congest all those.”\n\n“So bringing that [virtual machine] to Ethereum can lead to this highly parallelized [layer-2] that doesn’t really need all these other robots to exist,” he said.\n\n“You can’t cheat physics,” Galler interjected. “Bandwidth is fundamentally what limits how fast a lot of these blockchains can run.”\n\nReflecting on scaling challenges, Jordan referred to the example of Arbitrum Stylus, noting that the product allows developers to write code in common programming languages like Rust and C++, compiling to a special instruction format called WebAssembly. “You can actually execute this side by side with EVM smart contracts.”\n\n“So we ended up realizing that the EVM is not the ceiling,” he said, “it’s actually the floor.”\n\n“You can do a lot more than you thought was possible while still maintaining the same guarantees.”\n\nScalability at the execution layer “has a long way to go,” Jordan added, “and we’re trying to get there.”\n\nDon’t miss the next big story – join our free daily newsletter.'}, {'id': 10, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vYW1iY3J5cHRvLmNvbS93aHktZXRoZXJldW1zLTYtbW9udGgtbG93LW1heS1ub3QtYmUtdGhlLWVuZC_SAUdodHRwczovL2FtYmNyeXB0by5jb20vd2h5LWV0aGVyZXVtcy02LW1vbnRoLWxvdy1tYXktbm90LWJlLXRoZS1lbmQvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Wed, 13 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Why Ethereum’s 6-month low may not be the end - AMBCrypto News', 'content': 'ETH could drop below $1,500 as many old coins changed wallets.\n\nThe sentiment remained bearish, but ETH’s burn mechanism could rescue the altcoin in the long-term.\n\nEthereum’s [ETH] plunge to $1,540 has been accompanied by interesting changes that could push the altcoin into capitulation, Santiment revealed. The on-chain analytic platform, in its 12 September post on X (formerly Twitter), noted that a large number of ETH have been transferred from old wallets.\n\n? #Ethereum dropped to $1,540 for the first time since March 12th, and this coincided with large quantities of stagnant $ETH moving away from old wallets. A continued dip in mean $ age while prices drop is a capitulation sign, which foreshadows reversals. https://t.co/50jK2C7aLi pic.twitter.com/4RhtlVX3rr — Santiment (@santimentfeed) September 12, 2023\n\nOldies leave their former abode\n\nThe post focused on using the Mean Coin Age (MCA) to decipher the possibility. The MCA is the sum of a coin’s Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) alive at the time of coin creation.\n\nAs a long-term indicator, a drop in the MCA implies a massive movement of UTXOs that have been immobile for a long period.\n\nRead Ethereum’s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH’s 90-day MCA had decreased to 41.07. This further affirmed Santiment’s position that a big fall could be close. Although the 90-day dormant circulation has now reduced, the surge to 634,000 on 11 September reinforced the notion that old coins were moving in droves.\n\nSo, the spike implies that it’s not just the two to five years dormant coins on Ethereum that are moving. Those who have remained stagnant for just three months joined the party.\n\nPreviously, AMBCrypto had explained why ETH’s price action could remain bearish. However, Santiment mentioned that after the rain comes sunshine, noting that relief could come to ETH after the projected price drop.\n\nIs light at the end of the tunnel?\n\nHowever, traders do not expect the recovery to be anytime soon, as shown by the funding rate. As of this writing, ETH’s funding rate was -0.003%. Since perpetual futures contracts can be held indefinitely, it becomes very necessary to have the funding rate.\n\nFunding rate is the amount of an asset paid between long and short-positioned traders with open contracts. When the funding rate is positive, it means that longs are paying too short to keep their position. In this case, traders’ sentiment is bullish.\n\nBut a negative funding rate means that shorts are paying longs a funding fee. Here, like it was with ETH, the sentiment is bearish. So, the broader bias was for ETH to drop much below $1,500.\n\nFor now, Ethereum may need to depend on other metrics besides its market-based indicators in the hope of recovery. One metric that comes to mind is the Ethereum burned supply.\n\nThis Ethereum burned supply represents the cumulative sum of ETH incinerated since the implementation of the EIP-1559. For context, the EIP-1559 was implemented during the London Hard Fork— the same period Ethereum began the burn mechanism.\n\nIn EIP-1559, the base for transactions is not sent to any miner/validator. Rather, it is burned as a means to reduce ETH’s supply and improve its value in the long term.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nLately, ETH turned inflationary, which could be a cause for concern. However, the burned supply of Ethereum had also increased to 4.25 million (as displayed above).\n\nIf the number continues to increase, then ETH may get back its deflationary pressure, and in the long term, could be profitable for its price.'}].

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

Based on the information provided by the on-chain and news analysts, the market trend for ETH cryptocurrency appears to be slightly positive in the short term, with some uncertainty and mixed signals in terms of momentum. The short-long moving average signal consistently indicates a "buy" signal, suggesting a positive trend in the short term. However, the MACD signal is mixed, and the bollinger bands signal is mostly indicating a "hold" signal, reflecting some uncertainty in the market momentum.

Considering the news articles, there is a focus on scalability and development within the Ethereum ecosystem, as well as the importance of innovation and pushing forward with new ideas according to Vitalik Buterin. Additionally, the interest from traditional financial institutions in alternative blockchain platforms like Solana indicates a growing interest in the blockchain space.

Taking all of this into account, I predict a slightly bullish trend for ETH in the short term. Therefore, I would recommend buying ETH with a moderate confidence level.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

Based on the news articles provided, there are several key points to consider for analyzing the market trend for Ethereum (ETH) cryptocurrency:

1. Ethereum Merge Anniversary: The news mentions that a year after the Ethereum Merge, the net supply of Ether has decreased by nearly 300K. This could potentially indicate a decrease in the circulating supply of Ether, which may lead to increased scarcity and potentially drive up the price of ETH.

2. Launch of Holesky Test Network: Ethereum developers have launched a new test network called Holesky, which aims to improve the testing capability of the Ethereum blockchain. This development could lead to enhanced scalability and performance of the Ethereum network, which may positively impact the market sentiment towards ETH.

3. Everlodge (ELDG) Presale: The news highlights the presale phase of Everlodge (ELDG), a project that aims to tokenize real estate assets on the Ethereum blockchain. The project has seen significant interest from investors, with the potential for ELDG's value to skyrocket once the full platform launches. This could attract more investors to the Ethereum ecosystem and potentially drive up demand for ETH.

4. Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) Comparison: The news compares the price fluctuations and market performance of Ethereum and Solana

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

This is because the average age at which both tokens have been sitting in wallets has become much younger after massive stagnation. In this regard, that of BUSD fell by 378 days, while that of Ethereum fell by 26 days.\n\n🤔 The average age in which #Ethereum and #BinanceCoin tokens have been sitting in wallets both became much younger after massive stagnation. Do you believe both coincide with the #FTX liquidations and sell-offs that began this week? https://t.co/RyFfUbMe22 pic.twitter.com/KfRZPtCZn1 — Santiment (@santimentfeed) September 15, 2023\n\nIt is speculated that this historic dormant movement might be related to the FTX-triggered liquidations and sell-offs that began earlier in the week.\n\nFTX, which currently controls over $3.4 billion in crypto assets, has been granted permission to sell its crypto holdings by a U.S. judge.\n\nFTX will be allowed to sell off in weekly batches, with a first-week restriction of $50 million and following weekly limits of $100 million. However, BTC and ETH can only be sold after giving the creditors' committee, ad hoc committee and the U.S. trustee a 10-day notice.\n\nThis aside, in recent weeks, Ethereum has seen dormant ICO-era whale wallets come to life. In the past week, a dormant pre-mine address that held 185 ETH worth $302,096 revived after 8.1 years.\n\nBinance moving to end support for BUSD\n\nAs part of its gradual move to end support for the BUSD stablecoin by 2024, crypto exchange Binance moved to burn several idle Binance-pegged tokens this week.\n\nOn Sept. 14, Binance set fire to idle Binance-pegged tokens, namely TUSDOLD (BSC), BUSD on the MATIC network, BUSD both on the BSC and BNB networks and BUSD on the TRX network.\n\nIn August, Binance announced it would gradually end support for BUSD, urging users to convert the token to other crypto assets by February next year.

Some, like Uniswap, a decentralized exchange (DEX), process billions worth of transactions every month.\n\nOn September 15, Bitcoin had over 800,000 daily active addresses (DAA), more than twice those in Ethereum, which stood at slightly over 378,000. The only time there was a slight change was on September 13, when over 1 million addresses were activated on Ethereum.\n\nThen, the number of DAA on Bitcoin also fell to around 743,000. However, the DAA on Ethereum has fallen sharply while Bitcoin has maintained an upward trajectory since late August. During this time, Ethereum’s DAA has been fluctuating heavily, as evidenced by the rise and fall on Sep 13 and through to today.\n\nEthereum Processes Over 1 Million Transactions Everyday\n\nEthereum shines in the number of daily transactions processed. When writing on September 15, the smart contract platform had processed over 1 million transactions while Bitcoin lagged, confirming less than 600,000.\n\nEven at this level, Ethereum has processed less than half of what it did on September 13, when the network processed over 2.3 million transactions. On the other hand, Bitcoin’s daily transactions have been steady, while those of Ethereum have, on average, risen over the past three months, as Artemis Terminal data shows.\n\nDAA and daily transaction count are important metrics that on-chain analysts use to analyze the level of engagement and health of public blockchains.\n\nOver the past 18 months, activity has rapidly shrunk as asset prices fall in the crypto winter. Ethereum’s drop from around $5,000 in late November 2021 to as low as $1,500 in 2022 weighed negatively on DeFi and NFT activity.\n\nAccording to DeFiLlama, the total value locked (TVL) of DeFi protocols has stabilized below $50 billion, down from around $180 billion in 2021. Meanwhile, trading volume has crashed by over 90%, dragging the value of NFT-related projects, including Immutable X and ApeCoin. To illustrate, APE is down 96% from peaks.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Two tokens rallied: Bitcoin Cash (BCH) grew 11.5% to $213.79, while Toncoin (TON) blew up 23% to trade at $2.20.\n\nTON’s explosive price movement this week was catalyzed by news on Wednesday that its parent company—Telegram—has integrated The Open Network blockchain’s Web3 wallet into its messaging app, bringing easy access to TON for the app’s 800 million users.\n\nThe move represents a symbolic win for Telegram. Technically, the company withdrew from involvement in TON in 2020 after litigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Telegram was accused of offering unregistered securities in the form of a token called Gram. It settled with the SEC by paying a fine of $18.5 million and returning unspent funds to investors.\n\nOne cryptocurrency notably depreciated over the week: Stellar (XLM) fell 9.3% to trade at $0.118263 at the time of writing. Its poor performance this week appears to be a correction from last week, when XLM rallied 10% off the back of a tweet that promised “something cool” in ten days.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWas it a major network overhaul? Nope, it was a big-budget commercial with Idris Elba.\n\nIn the news: adoption!\n\nThere were more encouraging signs of crypto adoption throughout the global north this week.\n\nOn Monday, Sony subsidiary Sony Network Communications announced it was developing a blockchain network in collaboration with crypto tech firm Startale Labs. The Singapore-based joint venture will be known as Sony Network Communications Labs Pte. Ltd. It remains unclear what Sony may use the platform for.\n\nAmerican payments giant PayPal launched crypto to USD off-ramps on Tuesday. The move came after PayPal launched a crypto On Ramp integration last month, enabling direct crypto purchases to MetaMask and Ledger users. Undoubtedly, the company’s biggest move in the space this year was the announcement of its own in-house greenback-pegged stablecoin PayPal USD.\n\nFinally, on Wednesday, Taurus–a Swiss crypto fintech firm—announced an agreement with Deutsche Bank.

This comes after a summer filled with twists and turns surrounding the launch and approval of the first-ever spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nSo could this new ETF from Ark Invest send the price of Ethereum soaring? There are several different factors to consider.\n\nInstitutional demand\n\nLet\'s face it -- the launch of a spot Ethereum ETF probably means little for the seasoned crypto investor. Why would you go to the added step of buying an ETF (which comes with management fees), when you can already go to a cryptocurrency exchange like Coinbase Global and buy Ethereum directly? The only allure of a spot crypto ETF is if you want exposure to crypto, but without the risk or hassle of investing directly in crypto.\n\nThe big reason a spot Ethereum ETF is so bullish for the markets is because it signals pent-up institutional demand for the world\'s second-largest cryptocurrency. Many institutional investors are unwilling or unable to purchase crypto directly, due to the constraints placed on them. Do you really want your pension fund or university endowment dabbling in a volatile, poorly regulated industry with significant risk of loss?\n\nBut the picture changes when you take into account a market-traded financial instrument that has been approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). According to the Ark Invest filing, the spot Ethereum ETF would trade on the CBOE BZX Exchange and custody its crypto assets with Coinbase. That essentially makes Ethereum "safe" (relatively speaking) for the world\'s biggest institutional investors. And that\'s where things get really exciting, because it could signal a tsunami of new money flowing into Ethereum. Theoretically, that new influx of money should boost Ethereum\'s price. It\'s just simple supply and demand.\n\nLessons from Bitcoin this summer\n\nAnd that, of course, brings us to what happened this summer, which was headlined by one big event: the decision by BlackRock, the world\'s biggest fund manager, to file for a spot Bitcoin ETF on June 15. That led to a flurry of follow-on filings from other institutional investors, a response by the SEC, and new adjustments to those filings in response to the SEC. Just about everyone -- including Ark Invest -- was trying to be first in line for the first-ever spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nAnd the market responded accordingly. The Bitcoin rally in June was very real. On the date of the BlackRock ETF filing, Bitcoin was trading around $25,000. Thirty days later, it was trading near $30,000, and bullish sentiment was risiing. It seemed to be a matter of not if, but when, a new spot Bitcoin ETF would be approved. Finally, it looked like Bitcoin was about to go mainstream.\n\nGranted, the effect on Ethereum is not going to be as great as for Bitcoin, simply due to the fact that institutional investors still prefer Bitcoin to Ethereum. But there is almost certain to be a similar type of effect, given that Ethereum now accounts for roughly 20% of the entire market cap of the crypto market.\n\nThe heavy hand of the SEC\n\nSo what could possibly go wrong? There\'s a short answer: the SEC. There\'s something about a spot Bitcoin ETF that the SEC doesn\'t like. Despite the fact that the SEC has already approved futures-based Bitcoin ETFs, it doesn\'t seem to want to approve a spot Bitcoin ETF. So it\'s uncertain how long the approval process could take. Ark Invest, for example, originally filed its first spot Bitcoin ETF application back in 2021.\n\nAnd, in the case of Ethereum, there\'s an added wrinkle. That\'s because Ark Invest is essentially skipping a step here. Unlike with Bitcoin, no futures-based Ethereum ETF has yet been approved in the U.S., although several applications have been filed. So Ark Invest is skipping from no Ethereum ETF in the U.S. to spot Ethereum ETF without the intermediate step of a futures-based Ethereum ETF.\n\nThe big picture\n\nDespite these regulatory challenges, the big picture is that the decision by Ark Invest to file for a spot Ethereum ETF appears to signal that there\'s plenty of institutional demand for Ethereum. As crypto becomes more and more of a mainstream asset class for institutional investors, that\'s huge for Ethereum\'s future prospects. So buckle up: This could get interesting if Cathie Wood ever gets SEC approval for the first-ever spot Ethereum ETF.'}]. Analyze the news and estimate the market trend accordingly.

Based on the news articles provided, there are several key points to consider for analyzing the market trend for Ethereum (ETH) cryptocurrency:

1. Ethereum's Successful Overhaul: The revamp of the Ethereum network known as the Merge has led to a more energy-efficient system and increased demand for staking features. However, there are concerns about the network potentially bogging itself down due to surging demand.

2. Historic Dormant Movement of Ethereum and BUSD: On-chain analytics firm Santiment notes historic dormant movements of Ethereum and Binance USD (BUSD) stablecoin, potentially related to FTX-triggered liquidations and sell-offs. This movement may impact market dynamics.

3. Bitcoin Dominates Ethereum in Daily Active Addresses: Despite Ethereum's role in smart contracts and DeFi, Bitcoin has more daily active users and lower daily transaction counts. This data suggests different levels of user engagement between the two cryptocurrencies.

4. Steady Week for Bitcoin and Ethereum: Both Bitcoin and Ethereum experienced stable prices over the week, with Ethereum facing inflationary supply concerns. Other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin Cash and Toncoin saw notable price movements.

5. Ark Invest's Spot Ethereum ETF Application: Ark Invest's filing for the first-ever spot Ethereum ETF signals institutional demand for Ethereum. The potential approval of this

1. Ethereum's Successful Overhaul: The revamp of the Ethereum network known as the Merge has led to a more energy-efficient system and increased demand for staking features. However, there are concerns about the network potentially bogging itself down due to surging demand.

2. Historic Dormant Movement of Ethereum and BUSD: On-chain analytics firm Santiment notes historic dormant movements of Ethereum and Binance USD (BUSD) stablecoin, potentially related to FTX-triggered liquidations and sell-offs. This movement may impact market dynamics.

3. Bitcoin Dominates Ethereum in Daily Active Addresses: Despite Ethereum's role in smart contracts and DeFi, Bitcoin has more daily active users and lower daily transaction counts. This data suggests different levels of user engagement between the two cryptocurrencies.

4. Steady Week for Bitcoin and Ethereum: Both Bitcoin and Ethereum experienced stable prices over the week, with Ethereum facing inflationary supply concerns. Other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin Cash and Toncoin saw notable price movements.

5. Ark Invest's Spot Ethereum ETF Application: Ark Invest's filing for the first-ever spot Ethereum ETF signals institutional demand for Ethereum. The potential approval of this

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report and news analyst report, the overall market trend for ETH cryptocurrency appears to be bullish.

He said:\n\n“Someone put 0x686f77206d7563682069732074686520666973683f (“how much is the fish?”) as extra-data in the EL Holesky genesis.json, and not in the CL genesis.ssz.”\n\nThis resulted in a misconfiguration that caused the testnet to fail to launch, according to Loerakker. He added that other fork parameters are “rumored to mismatch” but did not provide further details of those issues.\n\nLoerakker added that Holesky did not experience issues related to network size, something that was considered before launch. In August, developers determined that Holesky could handle 1.4 million validators. In response, they introduced a large amount of Holesky ETH, amounting to 1.6 billion tokens.\n\nRelaunch expected in coming weeks\n\nThough developers will soon relaunch Holesky, the exact date of that event is still unclear. Nethermind, an Ethereum research and engineering group, said developers will relaunch Holesky in one week. That seemingly places the next attempt on Sept. 22.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum contributor and Sigma Prime member Michael Sproul has suggested in a GitHub pull request that Holesky should be relaunched on Sept. 28. That date is nearly two weeks later than the network’s first launch attempt.\n\nRegardless of delays, the issue does not affect Ethereum’s mainnet, which is responsible for transactions with real value. Beaconchain.eth acknowledged this, writing that the Holesky launch “didn’t go as expected, but that’s what testnets are here for.”\n\nAccording to Ethereum documentation, Holesky will supersede Ethereum’s Goerli testnet. Both testnets are intended for testing related to staking, validating, and core network upgrades. Another testnet called Sepolia, which is aimed at independent developers who want to test their own Ethereum-based apps, also exists.\n\nEach of these testnets relies on special testnet ETH that is freely available through faucets and which generally has no real market value.'}, {'id': 5, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vY3J5cHRvLm5ld3MvZXRoZXJldW0tdW52ZWlscy1uZXctdGVzdG5ldC1jYWxsZWQtaG9sZXNreS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Sun, 17 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Ethereum unveils new testnet called 'Holešky' - crypto.news", 'content': 'Ethereum’s developers launched a new testnet that’s being touted as a promising alternative to the aging Goerli network.\n\nDubbed “Holešky,” the testnet was designed to facilitate staking, infrastructure, and protocol development.\n\nEthereum preps for future\n\nEthereum, the blockchain powering the world’s second-largest crypto by market cap, is continually evolving to meet the demands of a rapidly growing blockchain ecosystem. To keep pace with the ambitious roadmap, Ethereum developers have introduced a new testnet called “Holešky.”\n\nAt the core of the Holešky testnet launch is its unprecedented initial supply of 1.6 billion Holešky testnet Ether (HETH). This substantial allocation is provided to validators on Holešky’s inaugural day to kick start network operations.\n\nIn contrast, it’s worth noting that this token amount is ten times more than what the main Ethereum network currently holds. Ethereum developer Tim Beiko justified this allocation, stating that “devnets [are] regularly using 10B supply.” This move ensures that Holešky has ample resources to support the development and testing of new features.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum developers on Goerli now have to pay for test ETH\n\nRetiring the Goerli testnet\n\nBefore Holešky emerged, the Goerli testnet was Ethereum’s primary platform for testing new staking, infrastructure, and protocol developments.\n\nConcerns began to surface in October when developers voiced their reservations about Goerli’s insufficient supply of Goerli ETH to meet testing requirements. Holešky’s generous HETH supply is expected to address this issue effectively.\n\nIn tandem with Holešky’s launch, Ethereum developers have been encouraging application developers to migrate from Goerli to Sepolia, a move that leaves only protocol developers on the old network. The Ethereum team has set its sights on deprecating Goerli in January 2024. Following deprecation, Goerli will receive another year of maintenance before being permanently shut down, as outlined in official documentation.\n\nThe advent of Holešky marks a critical juncture in Ethereum’s journey. The platform is poised to implement a slew of transformative features, including proto-danksharding, danksharding, and Verkle trees.\n\nThese innovations reduce transaction fees and make running a node more cost-effective. To ensure seamless integration into the mainnet, each feature will undergo rigorous testing on Holešky, underscoring the testnet’s pivotal role in Ethereum’s development pipeline.\n\nRelentless development\n\nEthereum’s commitment to innovation remains unwavering. Recent upgrades, including the Shanghai upgrade, have already introduced substantial scalability, security, and functionality improvements. Ethereum researcher Christine Kim affirms that Ethereum’s development community is far from complacent and is already plotting the next wave of enhancements. The blockchain’s execution layer (EL) and consensus layer (CL) are the focal points of these upcoming code changes.\n\nWhile Holešky gears up for pivotal infrastructure and protocol testing, Ethereum has also made strides in simplifying the process of launching tokens on its blockchain.\n\nEthereum developer Aram Mughalyan recently revealed a groundbreaking development. Using the OpenZeppelin Contract Wizard, Mughalyan demonstrated how anyone can create a new token on the Ethereum blockchain in under one minute. This streamlined process allows broader token innovation within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum upgrade doubled energy efficiency rates, study reveals\n\nEther price analysis\n\nAccording to data from CoinGecko, the price of Ethereum (ETH) stands at $1,628; over the past seven days, the token has recorded a 0.07% increase. Ethereum’s market capitalization stands at more than $195 billion. On Sept. 11, ETH witnessed a dip to $1,530 before rebounding to its current valuation.\n\nThe introduction of the Holešky testnet and the simplification of token launches on Ethereum demonstrate the blockchain’s commitment to staying at the forefront of Web3 innovation.

A year ago Ethereum underwent a major technical transition that was meant to improve its security in an energy efficient way that many hoped would lead to higher price s and, separately, would open a new yield-generating opportunity for investors. The price of ether is down over the past six months, but it\'s still up 8% over the past year and nearly 35% year-to-date, according to Coin Metrics. With the crypto market as a whole suffering from low liquidity and volatility amid regulatory uncertainty, the incremental regulatory and technical developments in Bitcoin and Ethereum haven\'t been enough to push prices to new highs after the banking crisis-fueled rally earlier this year. Still, market participants are seeing and feeling the success of the Ethereum merge. "ETH\'s transition to proof-of-stake created a more composable, cheaper and less energy-intensive network that currently yields stakers about 4%," said Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at VanEck. "But with T-bills yielding 5% and the U.S. regulatory onslaught ongoing, investor and developer interest has been insufficient to pump the token much in recent months." "Ethereum daily gas fees are languishing near 2023 lows and daily trading activity at 2-year lows," he added.

It spiked to about 8% after the fall of FTX and in May following JPMorgan\'s takeover of First Republic. Yields were last at 3.9%. The yield changes based on participation levels in staking and Ethereum\'s process of validating transactions. It is expected to fall as more stakers come onto the network. (For more on staking check out our guide here .) More validators The amount of staked ether has been rising steadily over the past year with investors keen to earn extra yield on their assets. While the merge gave investors the opportunity to earn yield – by locking up their funds – this year\'s Shanghai, also known as Shapella, upgrade gave them the ability to unstake their funds. The Shanghai upgrade was widely seen as an event that would bring more liquidity to Ethereum. "While the market has been really stagnant across digital assets, staking has been one of the few areas that have seen constant growth in this period," said Andrew Ballinger, head of staking solutions at Canadian investment firm 3iQ. "About a week after [Shanghai] happened in April, we started to see assets coming into the network to be staked outpacing assets being withdrawn," he added. "That really demonstrates the immediate interest from people who were sitting on the sidelines, who hadn\'t been staking until this point to start doing so." The percentage of ether supply being staked has risen from 11.99% on Sept. 15, 2022, to 20.46% on Aug. 30 of this year. Burning fees and decreasing supply Ethereum has a mechanism programmed in to regulate the network\'s notoriously high transaction fees, called gas fees, by "burning" them. Everyday new ether is emitted into the market and if demand doesn\'t match the supply level, the price goes down. After the merge, investors expected there to be less supply in the market, and if demand stayed constant, that the price would rise. Since the merge, the supply of ether has fallen 0.248%, according to data provider Ultrasound Money . About 681,449 ETH have been issued while 981,427 have been burned. "The ETH supply is now kind of dependent on the usage – the more usage, the more ETH that\'s burned," said Maria Shen, a general partner at Electric Capital. "Right before the merge, the supply of ETH peaked, and now we are on a flat, deflationary supply curve." "Whenever someone does a transaction, they pay a fee," she explained. "Part of that fee is now being burned, and whenever you do that, the supply of Ethereum shrinks. So you have effectively a deflationary supply of ETH" – meaning the supply over time will begin to decline as opposed to increase, which is historically what it\'s always done – "as long as people keep using the network." The next upgrade The merge was just the first step in a series of upgrades that are planned to make improvements on Ethereum. The blockchain is the most popular among developers who are keen to build a new world of applications on this technology. But, in recent years, it has been hampered by its famously slow transaction times and egregious transaction fees. Those specific problems gave rise to alternatives like Solana and Cardano. If Ethereum can speed up transactions and solve the fee structure, it could become more competitive, Shen said. "Those no longer become differentiating factors," she said.

The history of its most important testnet, Goerli, has come to an end.\n\nHere\'s why Ethereans decided to sunset Goerli in 2023 and what is special about Holesky, Goerli\'s hotly anticipated successor.\n\nEthereum replaces Goerli testnet by Holesky: Basics\n\nToday, Sept. 15, 2023, on the first anniversary of The Merge activation in mainnet, Ethereum (ETH) has ceased supporting its testnet, Goerli. Developers need to migrate toward Holesky, the first PoS-by-design testnet.\n\nHolesky (or Holešky, Holešovice) is an Ethereum (ETH) test network (testnet) activated on Sept. 15, 2023.\n\nHolesky replaces Goerli as a staking, infrastructure and protocol-developer testnet.\n\nFor dApp stress tests, smart contract experiments and other EVM-related procedures, developers should refer to Sepolia testnet.\n\nHolesky is the first-ever Ethereum (ETH) testnet launched on the top of the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus.\n\nHolesky launches to address scalability issues of Goerli: the shortage of goETH testnet tokens, the low number of validators and so on.\n\nHolesky will have 1.46 million validators, which is almost twice as much as Ethereum (ETH) mainnet has.\n\nNew testnet support will be abandoned by 2028.\n\nAs such, with Holesky, Ethereum (ETH) developers will have a new sandbox environment in which to experiment with various features of the protocol.\n\nWhat is testnet?\n\nIn cryptocurrencies, a test network or testnet is an experimental distributed network that emulates the processes that happen on a cryptocurrency network, but with no real value transferred. Just as with main networks (mainnets), accounts can send tokens to each other, while validators confirm them by adding new blocks to the chain.\n\nUsers of a testnet get "play" tokens from faucets, a free-to-use mechanism created by Ethereum (ETH) enthusiasts. For instance, some faucets distribute free testnet Ethers for sharing Twitter accounts, connecting to Discord and so on.\n\nSuch networks are necessary for stress testing dApps without the risks of losing money. Every modern DeFi or wallet undergoes a testnet phase before mainnet deployment.\n\nRopsten, Rinkeby, Goerli, Sepolia: Crucial Ethereum (ETH) testnets\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second largest blockchain and the first programmable network (with smart contracts), used a couple of testnets during its eight-year history. Launched in 2016, Ropsten replaced Morden, the first-ever testnet for proof-of-work (PoW) Ethereum. Ropsten was a testbed of all major Ethereum (ETH) dApps we are using and the first testnet to be "merged" when Ethereum (ETH) tested the PoW-to-PoS transition.\n\nIn 2017, Ethereans launched Rinkeby, a testnet on the top of the Clique proof-of-authority (PoA) consensus mechanism, which is a modified version of proof of stake (Pos). It only interacted with the Go Ethereum (Geth) version of client software.\n\nAt the ETH Berlin Conference in 2018, Ethereum (ETH) developers unveiled Goerli, a multiclient Ethereum (ETH) testnet. It means that it could work with the versions of Ethereum (ETH) software written in various programming languages.\n\nFinally, in 2021, Ethereum Sepolia testnet was launched with an unlimited number of testnet tokens.\n\nIntroducing Holesky, very special Ethereum (ETH) testnet\n\nActivated today, Ethereum\'s Holesky is an attempt by core developers to address all the issues that somehow affected previous testnets and their usage by teams.\n\nHolesky: Highlights\n\nHolesky is the first long-standing public Ethereum testnet that is "merged from genesis"; this means that Holesky never had a proof-of-work (PoW) version. Not unlike its predecessors, Holesky draws its name from the Nádraží Holešovice subway station in Prague.\n\nHolesky works together with Sepolia; while the first testnet is designed to be a technical platform for experiments with staking designs, the general infrastructure of Ethereum (ETH) and protocol-level development ideas, Sepolia is a platform for testing smart contracts, decentralized applications and all EVM functionalities. Like all mainstream crypto testnets, Holesky will have its own set of validators, block explorer and ecosystem of faucets.\n\nHolesky: What was wrong with Goerli?\n\nHolesky goes live to replace Goerli, a major Ethereum (ETH) testnet since 2018. Holesky is designed to help Ethereum (ETH) testers avoid the disadvantages of earlier testnets. For instance, Ethereum Goerli users faced a shortage of GoETH test tokens and were even forced to purchase them for money, which is in contradiction of Ethereum (ETH) testnet rules. Holesky is unlikely to face similar issues.\n\nHolesky public testnet genesis file has been generated, and merged into main branch of https://t.co/JWKySOSvtU.\n\nLaunch date Sept/15, 2023, 14:00 UTC\n\nChain ID-17000 (zip code of Holešovice).\n\nThe genesis will have 1,460,000 validators. Our biggest public network to date. — Barnabas Busa (@BarnabasBusa) August 22, 2023\n\nAlso, it will have a previously unimaginable number of validators: 1.46 million entities will protect network integrity. This is more than Ethereum’s mainnet (700,000) and Goerli (512,000) have in all. This, in turn, will allow developers to mimic "real-world" Ethereum (ETH) operations closely.\n\nPer the creators of Holesky, they allocated over two billion HoleskyETH by the launch in order to make this quantity sufficient for all developers.\n\nHolesky: Specifications\n\nHolesky goes live with a set of specifications just like any other EVM ecosystem blockchain. Here\'s what future Holesky users should consider before getting connected to the network.'}]. Analyze the news and estimate the market trend accordingly.
*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
Based on the news articles provided, it is evident that Ethereum is undergoing significant developments in its testnet environment. The launch of the Holesky testnet as a replacement for the Goerli testnet is a crucial step in Ethereum's evolution. The Holesky testnet is designed to address scalability issues, provide ample resources for testing, and support the development of new features.

The transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism in the Holesky testnet is a notable advancement that could lead to a more efficient and cost-effective network. The increased number of validators and the substantial initial supply of HETH tokens on the Holesky testnet are positive indicators of Ethereum's commitment to innovation and improvement.

Overall, the developments in Ethereum's testnet environment suggest a positive outlook for the Ethereum ecosystem. The focus on scalability, protocol upgrades, and developer support could contribute to the long-term growth and adoption of Ethereum.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

New Ether issuance is down more than 80%, staking participation is up 87%, and nearly 1M ETH has been permanently removed from supply.\n\nOne Year After The Merge: ETH Supply Shrinks But Challenges Remain\n\nBut while Ethereum is largely making good on its deflationary promise, new challenges to the network’s decentralization have emerged.\n\nDeflationary Ethereum\n\nThe Merge took place on Sept. 15, 2022, transitioning the network from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake consensus.\n\nThe shift overhauled Ethereum’s fundamental tokenomics, with new daily Ether issuance falling more than 80% from 13,500 ETH to currently around 2,300 ETH. Coupled with the introduction of Ethereum’s burn mechanism one year prior, analysts predicted Ethereum would become deflationary, meaning that more ETH is burned from base transaction fees than enters circulation as rewards for stakers.\n\nThere are now nearly 300,000 fewer ETH in existence than at the time of The Merge. For comparison, an additional 3.8M ETH ($6.2B) would have been issued under Proof of Work.\n\nChallenges Posed By Liquid Staking\n\nThe Merge also gave rise to the 2023 boom in liquid staking tokens (LSTs) — assets representing an underlying position of staked Ether which can be easily traded on exchanges or used in DeFi applications.\n\nEthereum’s Shanghai upgrade also activated staked ETH withdrawals in April, reducing the price spread between ETH and popular liquid staking tokens and bolstering the adoption of LSTs. Today, 10.8M ETH or 42.5% of all staked Ether is held by liquid staking protocols.\n\nETH locked in Lido, the top LST protocol, increased 82% from 4.6M to 8.6M since the year began, according to Dune Analytics.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, the market trend for ETH cryptocurrency appears to be bearish. The MACD signal consistently indicates a sell signal, and the overall market activity shows volatility. Additionally, the high average gas price could be a concern for traders and investors.

However, the news analyst report presents some positive developments for Ethereum, such as the migration of Cosmos-based Canto and Polkadot chain Astar to Ethereum as Layer-2 solutions, Grayscale Investments' shift towards Proof of Stake consensus, and the deflationary nature of Ethereum post The Merge. These factors could potentially have a positive impact on the ETH market.

Considering the conflicting signals from the on-chain and news analyst reports, I believe that the positive developments mentioned in the news analyst report could outweigh the bearish trend indicated by the on-chain analysis. Therefore, I predict a bullish trend for ETH in the near future.

Given my confidence in the bullish trend, I would recommend buying ETH with a value of -0.7 (buy with 70% cash).

According to the report, the network is currently trading below fair value by 27% if certain key factors are considered holistically.\n\nThe report made use of a modified Metcalfe-centric model to arrive at its conclusion, noting that existing models do not take the scaling dynamics into account. Traditional models place a premium on the number of active users on the network’s mainnet, but RxR’s models rely on data from Ethereum’s layer 2 networks.\n\nMetcalfe’s law states that the financial value of a network is directly proportional to the square of the number of connected users, but extending the model to layer 2 activities yields new results.\n\n“Ethereum’s network valuation tracks the updated ML index better when the active user base of Ethereum’s scaling networks is factored into the model than when omitted,” said Lewis Harland, an RxR analyst.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the report, the research analyst noted that including the L2 activity proved more reliable for long-term forecasts. The analysts pointed out that ignoring off-chain and L2 activities may paint a grim picture that the Ethereum network may be overvalued.\n\nAt the moment, ETH trades at $1,655 with a total market capitalization of $199 billion, showing glimpses of a rally on the horizon. RxR’s blended model suggests that contrary to popular opinion, the market is yet to “price in” Ethereum’s network adoption levels.\n\n“User growth on Ethereum as an application platform is set to outpace simple value-transfer networks over time implying higher relative valuations based on Metcalfe’s law,” said Harland.\n\nEthereum’s thriving L2 ecosystem\n\nEthereum’s L2 space has been a beehive of activity, with several projects experimenting with novel ways around the network’s scaling issues. Arbitrum and Optimism are pushing the frontiers of Ethereum’s scaling with their novel offerings, with Coinbase’s BASE recording sky-high adoption levels.\n\nWith over 30 L2 networks in play, aggregate total value locked (TVL) has surged to $10 billion given the reliance on rollups and other novel scaling solutions.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report and news analyst report, it is clear that the market trend for ETH is currently bullish. The open prices have been increasing, there is strong activity and interest in ETH, technical indicators suggest a "buy" sentiment, and there are positive developments in the Ethereum ecosystem such as network expansion and the growth of Layer 2 solutions.

Considering all these factors, I am confident in predicting that the market trend for ETH will continue to be bullish in the near future. Therefore, I believe it is a good opportunity to capitalize on this positive momentum by buying more ETH.

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
Based on the news provided, there are several key points to consider for analyzing the market trend for ETH cryptocurrency:

1. Eclipse has launched a new general-purpose layer 2 scaling solution powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). This could potentially increase the scalability and throughput of Ethereum transactions, which may lead to increased adoption and usage of ETH.

2. The ether-to-bitcoin ratio has dropped to a 14-month low, indicating a bearish trend for Ethereum compared to Bitcoin. Large token holders, including Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, have moved coins to exchanges, possibly signaling a prelude to selling. This could lead to a short-term decrease in the price of ETH.

3. Whales have deposited a total of $60 million worth of ETH to crypto exchanges, raising concerns about further price declines. The movement of large ETH investors can have a significant impact on the market, and their actions may influence the overall sentiment towards ETH.

Overall, the market trend for ETH appears to be mixed. The launch of Eclipse's layer 2 solution could be positive for Ethereum's long-term growth, but the recent movements of large token holders and the bearish trend against Bitcoin may lead to short-term price volatility. It is important to closely monitor market developments and investor sentiment

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, the market trend for ETH cryptocurrency appears to be bullish in the short to medium term. The open prices have been increasing, the number of transactions and unique addresses are on the rise, and the value transferred remains high. The short-long moving average signal is indicating a buy signal, despite the MACD signal showing a sell signal.

However, the news analyst report presents a mixed picture. While the launch of Eclipse's layer 2 solution could be positive for Ethereum's long-term growth, the recent movements of large token holders and the bearish trend against Bitcoin may lead to short-term price volatility.

Considering both reports, it seems that the bullish trend in the short to medium term outweighs the potential short-term volatility. Therefore, I would recommend buying ETH with a confidence level of -0.6.

Top spenders tend to include the decentralized exchange Uniswap, various MEV bots, and layer-2 networks settling transactions to the base chain.\n\nThe Binance 14 address has spent $842,000 in total gas fees on a 24-hour basis, and just $562 in the last three hours. Over the course of its existence, the address — which currently accounts for $250 million of Binance’s nearly $56 billion in holdings — is responsible for $95 million in gas expenditure between both incoming and outgoing transfers.\n\nIn a statement to Blockworks, a Binance spokesperson said, “Binance carried out a routine consolidation of [ether] ETH to one of its wallets. Any impact to gas prices was unintentional but quickly resolved.”\n\nIndeed, throughout its existence the Binance 14 address has seen a number of gas spend spikes, including one on Dec. 9, 2022 that led to an 880 ETH spend over a 24-hour period.\n\nBinance was the target of ire on social media as a result of the account consolidation process, with many observers noting that if they had simply spread the transactions out over a longer period of time, the gas spike would have been significantly subdued.\n\nAs a result of what some labeled as inefficient methodology, Binance ended up spending more on gas than they would have otherwise and made the network more expensive for others.\n\n“Every interaction I have had with them screams of incompetence,” said Rotki app founder Lefteris Karapetsas of the transfers.\n\nDon’t miss the next big story – join our free daily newsletter.'}, {'id': 5, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vdS50b2RheS9tYXNzaXZlLWV0aGVyZXVtLXdoYWxlLWNvbnRpbnVlcy10by1zZWxsLXNoaWZ0aW5nLTUwNDAtZXRo0gFOaHR0cHM6Ly91LnRvZGF5L21hc3NpdmUtZXRoZXJldW0td2hhbGUtY29udGludWVzLXRvLXNlbGwtc2hpZnRpbmctNTA0MC1ldGg_YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Thu, 21 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Massive Ethereum Whale Continues to Sell, Shifting 5,040 ETH - U.Today', 'content': "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today.

That might sound impressive, but keep in mind that Ethereum is still trading at nearly the same level it was 12 months ago when it completed The Merge. Shouldn\'t Ethereum\'s price have soared after this much-hyped technological breakthrough?\n\nClearly, crypto investors aren\'t impressed by technical upgrades and are waiting for the next big catalyst to appear for Ethereum. But that next big catalyst might be right under their noses, and they aren\'t even aware of it yet. As a result, Ethereum could be massively undervalued at its current price of $1,645.\n\nLayer 2 blockchain activity\n\nThe one metric to keep an eye on is the amount of activity happening on Layer 2 blockchain networks. These Layer 2 blockchains are built directly on top of the main Ethereum network, and help make Ethereum run faster, more efficiently, and more affordably. As such, they are very much part of the broader Ethereum ecosystem, and should be taken into account when thinking about Ethereum\'s growth prospects.\n\nEven after The Merge, Ethereum needs these Layer 2 blockchains, and founder Vitalik Buterin has always been clear that he supports the development of these Layer 2 networks. They are not cannibalizing the future growth of Ethereum. Instead, they are actively contributing to a much faster rate of growth for Ethereum.\n\nTo give you an idea of just how important these Layer 2 blockchain networks are, there are now five that rank among the top 55 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Granted, many of them are hardly household names. With the exception of Polygon, which garnered a fair amount of attention around the time of The Merge, they are quietly working behind the scenes, helping to scale Ethereum.\n\nImpact on growth\n\nThese Layer 2 blockchains are directly contributing to Ethereum\'s market dominance in key areas. For example, take non-fungible tokens (NFTs). If you examine the 30-day sales volume for NFTs, Ethereum is still the clear leader, with just under $200 million in sales. The next biggest Layer 1 blockchain network is Solana, with just under $30 million in sales. So, as a quick approximation, it\'s possible to say that Ethereum is doing nearly 7 times the sales volume of its next closest competitor.\n\nHowever, two of the top blockchains for NFT sales volume are Immutable X and Polygon, and both of these are Layer 2 blockchains for Ethereum. When you add in the 30-day NFT sales volume for both of these (approximately $50 million total), then it\'s possible to say that Ethereum is doing 8 times or even 9 times the sales volume of its next closest competitor.\n\nAnd the same story is true in the decentralized finance (DeFi) market. Again, Ethereum is the clear market leader here, accounting for nearly 55% of Total Value Locked (TVL). This metric describes how much value is "locked up" in various DeFi protocols, and is the single best indicator for overall DeFi strength. But four Layer 2 blockchains also rank in the Top 10 for TVL, and these account for another 10% of TVL on an aggregate basis. Taking this into account, Ethereum is responsible for a staggering two-thirds of all TVL in the blockchain world.\n\nValuation models\n\nAs demonstrated above, taking into account Layer 2 blockchain activity shows just how much Ethereum is potentially undervalued. A new report from crypto research firm RxR came to a similar conclusion. Using a valuation model based on Metcalfe\'s Law, which states that the value of any network is directly proportional to the square of the number of users, the research firm suggested that Ethereum might be undervalued by as much as 27%. In short, investors are overlooking the massive user growth on Layer 2 blockchain networks, and that is causing them to undervalue Ethereum.\n\nGranted, there are bound to be some skeptics who think that Metcalfe\'s Law shouldn\'t be applied to cryptocurrencies. After all, it\'s inconclusive whether adding a new user to an existing blockchain network should lead to a huge increase in value. It\'s different in the case of, say, telecom networks, because it\'s immediately clear how each new user (i.e., the person paying the phone bill each month) can be monetized.\n\nMoreover, Metcalfe\'s Law can lead to some pretty dizzying price estimates for cryptocurrencies. During the last crypto bull market rally, models based on Metcalfe\'s Law were projecting a $20,000 price target for Ethereum. The all-time high for Ethereum is just under $5,000, so that price target was wildly off the mark.\n\nSo is Ethereum undervalued or not?\n\nStill, it\'s easy to see how Ethereum could be significantly undervalued. Ethereum\'s metrics seem to be flatlining or declining. But dig deeper, and you\'ll see Layer 2 activity is taking off. The big question you have to ask yourself as an investor is whether this Layer 2 activity should be additive to the overall value of Ethereum.\n\nIt might be a controversial take, but I\'m firmly in the camp of investors and analysts who think that Ethereum is trading at a huge discount right now. There\'s just too much activity happening on Layer 2 blockchain networks to ignore.'}, {'id': 10, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vbmV3cy9ldGhlcmV1bS1wcmljZS1uZXctbG93LWJpdGNvaW4tc3dpdGNoLXBvc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Thu, 21 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Ethereum price sees new low vs Bitcoin since switching to proof-of-stake - Cointelegraph', 'content': 'Ether (ETH) has seen a 36% year-to-date increase in its price in 2023 in U.S. dollar terms. This recovery, however, is modest given that ETH is currently trading 66% below its November 2021 peak of $4,870.\n\nEthereum vs. Bitcoin: 14-month downtrend and counting\n\nMoreover, on Sept. 20, Ether reached its lowest levels against Bitcoin (BTC) in 14 months, breaching the critical 0.06 BTC support. This has raised questions among Ether investors about the factors behind this price decline and what it will take to reverse the trend.\n\nETH/BTC price on Coinbase. Source: TradingView\n\nETH buyers placed their biggest hopes on protocol upgrades that significantly reduced the need for new coin issuance when the network transitioned to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.\n\nThese hopes were realized in mid-September 2022, resulting in an annualized issuance rate of just 0.25% of the supply. This transformation aligned with the Ethereum community’s vision of “ultrasound money.”\n\nFurthermore, the subsequent Shapella upgrade on April 12 allowed for withdrawals from the native staking protocol, addressing a major concern for investors. Previously, both the 32 ETH deposits and the yield from participating in the network consensus were locked up indefinitely.\n\nConfidence among Ethereum enthusiasts grew as these significant hurdles were crossed with minimal issues. They anticipated that the price of Ether would surpass $2,000, a prediction that came true on April 14.\n\nHowever, this optimism was short-lived, as ETH’s price promptly fell back to the same $1,850 level just a week later.\n\nNotably, instead of witnessing a net withdrawal, Ethereum staking experienced a net inflow of 3.1 million ETH in the 30 days following the Shappela upgrade, surpassing even the most optimistic expectations.\n\nGiven that the Ethereum network’s planned developments have generally been on track, albeit with the customary delays, investors now need to explore other potential catalysts for reversing the current downtrend in Ether’s price relative to BTC.\n\nExternal factors present important triggers for ETH price\n\nOne of these potential catalysts lies in the ongoing legal battle between Ripple (formerly Ripple Labs) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which could significantly impact Ether’s price momentum.\n\nThe SEC contends that XRP (XRP) sales to retail investors constitute a securities offering. However, in July, Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP generally does not qualify as a security under SEC guidelines, especially when distributed through exchanges.\n\nAs noted by the “American lawyer and Bitcoiner” Bryan Jacoutot on X (formerly Twitter), the Ethereum Foundation remains exposed due to the presale of ETH directed toward institutional investors and subject to a lock-up period.\n\n(1/12) ANALYSIS: I\'ve reviewed the district court ruling on XRP and it rests on very shaky ground. Expect an appeal.\n\n\n\nAND Ethereum Foundation remains at risk even if its upheld because of important distinctions in the methods used by Ripple to sell the "pre-mine"\n\n\n\n⬇️⬇️ — Bryan Jacoutot (@BryanJacoutot) July 13, 2023\n\nAccording to Jacoutot, even if Ripple were to secure a favorable outcome, it wouldn’t immediately mitigate the risks for Ethereum. Nevertheless, it’s undeniable that the regulatory uncertainty surrounding the Ether initial coin offering (ICO) remains a source of concern for investors.\n\nOn Sept. 20, an Ethereum address associated with the ICO era showed its first activity, transferring 32.1 ETH (valued at $52,000 at the time) directly to Coinbase. This additional movement only amplified regulatory concerns since there are no apparent incentives for addresses that have remained dormant for four to eight years to divest at this particular point in the market cycle.\n\nAn Ethereum ICO participant who has been dormant for 8 years transferred 32.1 $ETH to #Coinbase just now.\n\n\n\nThe address received 200 $ETH at Ethereum Genesis.\n\n\n\nAnd the address appears to be related to shemnon.eth (@shemnon).https://t.co/nj5eF8iRT0 pic.twitter.com/6Viytn4dU5 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) September 20, 2023\n\nA similar occurrence unfolded with an address linked to Vitalik Buterin, which sent 300 ETH (worth $490,000 at the time) to the Kraken exchange on Sept. 19.\n\nMore positive news gives hope to Ethereum investors\n\nOn the news side, Ethereum has seen some positive surprises, such as the unexpected request for a spot Ether exchange-traded fund by ARK Invest and 21Shares on Sept. 6. This development reduced the risks associated with excessive institutional concentration in Bitcoin, particularly if the ETF is approved.\n\nAdditionally, Canto, a layer-1 Cosmos-native blockchain, announced its expansion to Ethereum’s layer 2 on Sept. 18. This zero-knowledge, permissionless rollup, compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine, is primarily focused on bringing traditional finance into the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nShould Bitcoin’s price surge be driven solely by the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF or inflation concerns in the United States, Ether is well-positioned to follow suit, benefiting from the same catalysts.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum’s primary competitors in the decentralized applications sector, namely Solana and BNB Chain, face similar risks pertaining to ICO and securities regulations, making it unlikely for them to challenge Ethereum’s dominance in terms of total value locked and trading volumes.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Based on the news articles provided, there are several key points to consider for analyzing the market trend for Ethereum (ETH) cryptocurrency trading:

1. Binance account consolidation process causing Ethereum gas fees to soar: The routine consolidation process by Binance led to a spike in gas fees on the Ethereum network, causing inconvenience and increased costs for users. This could potentially impact trading activity on the Ethereum network as users may be deterred by high fees.

2. Massive Ethereum whale continues to sell ETH: A large ETH whale withdrew a significant amount of ETH from Binance, totaling $8.17 million. This continuous selling pressure from whales could put downward pressure on the price of ETH in the short term.

3. Ethereum price grinds lower but key support is still intact: The price of Ethereum corrected lower from resistance levels and is currently trading below key levels such as $1,640 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If the price breaks below the $1,600 support zone, it could lead to further losses.

4. Ethereum could be massively undervalued based on Layer 2 blockchain activity: Despite the price correction, Ethereum's value could be underestimated due to the significant activity happening on Layer 2 blockchain networks. This could potentially lead to a reversal in the downt

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, the market trend for ETH cryptocurrency appears to be bullish in the short to medium term. The open prices have been increasing, indicating positive momentum, and there is a high level of network activity with increasing interest and transactions. The short-long moving average signal is a buy, suggesting a positive short-term trend.

However, the news analyst report highlights some potential challenges, such as the spike in gas fees due to Binance account consolidation and continuous selling pressure from a large ETH whale. The price of Ethereum has corrected lower and is currently below key support levels, which could lead to further losses.

Taking into consideration both reports, it seems that the bullish trend in the short to medium term may face some short-term volatility and downward pressure. However, the overall positive momentum and network activity suggest that the market trend for ETH is still bullish.

Given this analysis, I would recommend selling 20% of ETH to take advantage of potential short-term corrections while still maintaining a majority of the position in ETH to benefit from the overall bullish trend.

The interior of this deceptively nondescript structure is a honeycomb of labyrinthine corridors and winding staircases that snake into its fortress-like belly, echoing the complexity of crypto to the unfamiliar. Today, the biggest challenge for Buterin and the ethereum community is making sure that it provides actual value to people. "The way that I see the ethereum ecosystem in general is that the last decade was the decade of kind of playing around and getting ethereum right. This decade is the decade where we have to actually build things that people use," Buterin said, hands clasped, as he leaned forward from his perch on an ergonomic-friendly kneeling chair. He is arguably the most influential cryptographic developer alive today, but Buterin wasn\'t trying to step into the limelight when he wrote the ethereum white paper in 2013. Still, years after shunning public accolades and demurring countless invitations to speak to the press, he can\'t shake the fame — or the superlatives used to describe him. Buterin was named the world\'s youngest crypto billionaire at age 27 as the crypto market swelled to its peak in 2021. They call him "V God" in China, Time magazine dubbed him crypto royalty in its April 2022 cover story, and he faces mobs of fans desperate for a moment of his attention — and a selfie — virtually anywhere he goes on the planet.

He regularly gives away his fortune to worthy causes, knocking down his net worth. And he isn\'t, according to his own estimation, the be-all and end-all authority on the ethereum network. He is, however, someone who cares deeply about realizing his vision of a world where, among other things, humans have equitable access to money no matter who they are or where they live.\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards ETHPrague 2023 was held at Paralelní Polis in the Czech Republic. Pavel Sinagl\n\nButerin finds that cryptocurrencies realize their greatest utility in emerging economies — a phenomenon that has gained momentum in recent years. "The stuff that we often find a bit basic and boring is exactly the stuff that brings lots of value to them right now, like making payments work, and savings," Buterin said, referring to lower-income countries. "Just being able to plug into the international economy — these are things that they don\'t have, and these are things that provide huge value for people there," Buterin told CNBC. "It\'s hard to even be interested in really abstract stuff like decentralized social media, when you don\'t really have those kinds of basics done." As U.S. investigators pressed criminal charges against the likes of Sam Bankman-Fried and federal regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Commission began cracking down on what they called the trade of unregistered securities, the action in crypto began to move overseas. Whereas investors in the U.S. tend to treat crypto as more of a get-rich-quick opportunity and a way to trade on volatility in a less-regulated market than traditional securities, Buterin typically gravitates to developing markets around the world — including Africa, where he traveled in February — where he sees tangible, day-to-day use cases for the technology he helped to build. "When I visited Argentina back at the end of 2021, lots of people use crypto, lots of people love crypto," he said. "I literally got recognized on the streets of Buenos Aires more often than I got recognized in San Francisco." But for crypto to become truly useful on a global scale, Buterin told CNBC, it ultimately has to move out of centralized entities such as custodial trading platforms and it must be simpler to use. "I found coffee shops without even looking for them that just happened to accept bitcoin and ether — but the problem is, they were all using Binance," said Buterin. He said he appreciates centralized exchanges such as Binance for offering a smoother user experience to non-technical people living in countries where the average GDP is less than $10,000 per capita. Nevertheless, he believes that it must become more decentralized. "Those centralized actors are vulnerable to, you know, both pressure from the outside and to themselves being corrupted," he said. Last year, a wave of bankruptcies in the crypto sector exposed grift throughout the industry. A lot of people got rich before the increase in interest rates and subsequent collapse of Luna in May 2022 set off a chain reaction that sent the entire market tumbling down, spurring a crypto winter that persists to this day. Bankman-Fried, the ex-CEO of now-bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, for example, faces criminal charges alleging that he promulgated a multibillion-dollar fraud scheme. Binance, the world\'s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, is being sued by both the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission over a raft of accusations, including the assertion that Binance commingled billions of dollars worth of user funds with its own money. Instead of placing blind trust in a central intermediary to act in the best interest of the customer, Buterin said, he believes the ideal solution comes down to writing better code so that users can deal directly on-chain. "We need the experience on-chain to actually be good for regular people to use," Buterin said. "We need it to actually be possible to do ethereum payments in a way where the transaction fee is less than five cents a transaction; in a way where the experience doesn\'t suck and randomly fail 2.3% of the time; in such a way that you need a Ph.D. in ethereum sciences to actually figure out what\'s going on," he said.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin speaks at ETHPrague 2023, an international conference drawing crypto developers from around the world. Photo: Pavel Sinagl\n\nPrivacy and security are also key priorities. "People need to have wallets that are actually secure, where if they lose the keys, they\'re not going to lose everything," Buterin added. A national digital currency could provide the ease of use he envisions, but he believes that decentralization is also critical, otherwise they\'ll devolve into another version of the existing banking system — only with more surveillance built in. "That was a space where I think I had somewhat more hope, probably, naively, five years ago, because there were a lot of people who wanted to do things like make them blockchain friendly, give actual transparency and verifiability guarantees, and some kind of level of actual privacy," Buterin said, referring to central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs. CBDCs are a type of blockchain-based virtual currency that is fully regulated and has the backing of a country\'s central bank. The People\'s Bank of China, which is arguably the leader in CBDCs thus far, has been piloting its take on a CBDC for almost a decade. As of June, transactions using the digital yuan, or e-yuan, hit nearly $250 billion. But as CBDCs catch on, concerns have been raised about financial surveillance and monitoring tools which can be baked into these government-issued digital currencies. "As each and every one of those projects come to a certain maturity," Buterin said, the privacy-preserving bits "all sort of fall away as the thing comes closer and closer to being a 1.0. We get systems that are not actually much better than existing payment systems, because they just basically end up being different front-ends for the existing banking system." "They end up being even less private and basically break down all of the existing barriers against both corporations and the government at the same time," he said.\n\nBuilding a new, brave world\n\nVitalik\'s father, Dmitry, introduced him to bitcoin in 2011. Both Vitalik and Dmitry Buterin, a computer scientist who had lived outside Moscow, were intrigued by the idea of a decentralized currency that operated outside the reach of governments or central banks. But Vitalik was keen to advance this new kind of decentralized ledger technology so that it could be put to greater use. What ultimately put him on the map was baking smart contracts — a programmable piece of code that aims to replace middlemen such as banks and lawyers in certain types of business transactions — into the blockchain. It was a game-changing innovation for the sector that led to an explosion of projects and initial coin offerings, or ICOs, built on ethereum. Today, the network serves as the primary building block for all sorts of crypto projects, including non-fungible tokens, or NFTs; decentralized finance, or DeFi; and web3, a still somewhat amorphous buzzword for a third generation of the internet that is decentralized and built using blockchain tech. Meanwhile, ethereum\'s native token, ether , is the world\'s second-biggest cryptocurrency by market cap after bitcoin.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin speaks at ETHPrague 2023, an international conference drawing crypto developers from around the world. Photo: Pavel Sinagl\n\nIn ethereum circles, hackers are known as BUIDLers — an intentional misspelling of the word "builders" in a sort of homage to the bitcoin meme HODL, or "hold on for dear life." The meme-off may seem silly, but it gets at the core of what separates these two very different sets of people. Bitcoiners tend to move more slowly on development, prioritizing security and decentralization above all else, while ethereum programmers tend to be more cavalier. While they aren\'t necessarily breaking things as they go, they do move fast and tinker aggressively. Last year, for example, the ethereum network fundamentally altered the way the blockchain secures its networks and verifies transactions, slashing its energy consumption by more than 99% in the process. Before this upgrade, both the bitcoin and ethereum blockchains had their own vast networks of miners all over the planet running highly specialized computers that crunched math equations in order to validate transactions. Proof-of-work uses a lot of energy, and it is one of the industry\'s biggest targets for criticism. But with the upgrade, ethereum migrated to a system known as proof-of-stake, which swaps out miners for validators. Instead of running large banks of computers, validators leverage their existing cache of ether as a means to verify transactions and mint new tokens. Buterin insisted that ethereum\'s move to a proof-of-stake model is more likely to stand up against government intervention. "Proof-of-stake is actually easier to anonymize and harder to shut down than proof-of-work is," he said. "Proof-of-work requires huge amounts of physical equipment and requires huge amounts of electricity. These are exactly the kinds of things that drug enforcement agencies have decades of experience detecting." About the ethereum network, he said, "On the other hand, you\'ve got your laptop. You just need a VPN somewhere, and you hide it in a corner. It\'s not perfect, but it\'s definitely much easier to hide."\n\nCoder behind the curtain\n\nIn previous appearances in Denver and Paris, Buterin\'s stage presence was colored with a subtle unease. But one-on-one in Prague, he really came alive, dropping the tics and effortlessly swapping the role of elusive coder for open-minded educator. His transparent communication style, coupled with his willingness to engage in profound philosophical discussions around concepts such as quadratic funding — a way to crowd-raise a central crypto treasury that is then used to fund public goods projects in ethereum, all with the help of an algorithm designed to optimize spending decisions — and soulbound digital identities on the blockchain have turned him into a trusted thought leader within the crypto community. Notably, Buterin is also very willing to field any question posed to him — especially those that address critiques of the network and of the scope of his leadership position today. Take the example of his own outsized role in the cryptocurrency he created. Unlike the pseudonymous and hidden Satoshi Nakamoto, who created bitcoin, Buterin is very much the face of ethereum. Some see this as a significant point of weakness for the network, because governments could target either Buterin or the Ethereum Foundation. But Buterin rejects those contentions. He said that five years ago a lot more was dependent on him personally and on the foundation, but today, clients — that is, software applications built on top of the blockchain that operate independently — have taken on a lot of the work. Ethereum has become its own self-governing ecosystem, with no single point of failure, he said. "Even if the foundation got some magic freezing order in every jurisdiction at the same time, and if something happened to me at the same time, there\'s entire companies that are sole maintainers of ethereum clients that would totally be able to continue," explained Buterin. They call it the philosophy of subtraction. "I think one of the ways of describing its aim is basically that the Ethereum Foundation isn\'t trying to kind of be a zealot, a long-term operator or dominator, or anything like that," he said. "The goal of the Ethereum Foundation is to foster things that, once they start, can continue in a way that\'s totally independent." In terms of what\'s next for ethereum, Buterin said a big priority is focusing on privacy and scalability through zero-knowledge rollups. ZK-rollups are transactions bundled into sets and executed off-chain. This layer-two technology plays a major role in future upgrades that will ultimately help to make ethereum faster and cheaper to use. "There\'s definitely an extent to which there are diverging interests and there is the extent to which I think the ecosystem does need to find a way to fight hard for the right to continue to build things with the kinds of privacy that we\'ve been used to for thousands of years," Buterin said. Clarification: Buterin does not believe he\'s been targeted by any countries specifically and does not consider himself an outlaw, but is apprehensive about visiting certain countries because of his work.'}, {'id': 1, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDkvMjIvdml0YWxpay1idXRlcmluLWNuYmMtaW50ZXJ2aWV3LWV0aGVyZXVtLWZvdW5kZXItb24tdXMtY3J5cHRvLWNyYWNrZG93bi5odG1s0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vYW1wLzIwMjMvMDkvMjIvdml0YWxpay1idXRlcmluLWNuYmMtaW50ZXJ2aWV3LWV0aGVyZXVtLWZvdW5kZXItb24tdXMtY3J5cHRvLWNyYWNrZG93bi5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Fri, 22 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Vitalik Buterin, the man behind ethereum, talks crypto and the U.S. crackdown - CNBC', 'content': 'Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin in Prague, where he finds refuge with like-minded programmers looking to change the world through cryptography-powered technology.

"The stuff that we often find a bit basic and boring is exactly the stuff that brings lots of value to them right now, like making payments work, and savings," Buterin said, referring to lower-income countries. "Just being able to plug into the international economy — these are things that they don\'t have, and these are things that provide huge value for people there," Buterin told CNBC. "It\'s hard to even be interested in really abstract stuff like decentralized social media, when you don\'t really have those kinds of basics done." As U.S. investigators pressed criminal charges against the likes of Sam Bankman-Fried and federal regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Commission began cracking down on what they called the trade of unregistered securities, the action in crypto began to move overseas. Whereas investors in the U.S. tend to treat crypto as more of a get-rich-quick opportunity and a way to trade on volatility in a less-regulated market than traditional securities, Buterin typically gravitates to developing markets around the world — including Africa, where he traveled in February — where he sees tangible, day-to-day use cases for the technology he helped to build. "When I visited Argentina back at the end of 2021, lots of people use crypto, lots of people love crypto," he said. "I literally got recognized on the streets of Buenos Aires more often than I got recognized in San Francisco." But for crypto to become truly useful on a global scale, Buterin told CNBC, it ultimately has to move out of centralized entities such as custodial trading platforms and it must be simpler to use. "I found coffee shops without even looking for them that just happened to accept bitcoin and ether — but the problem is, they were all using Binance," said Buterin. He said he appreciates centralized exchanges such as Binance for offering a smoother user experience to non-technical people living in countries where the average GDP is less than $10,000 per capita. Nevertheless, he believes that it must become more decentralized. "Those centralized actors are vulnerable to, you know, both pressure from the outside and to themselves being corrupted," he said. Last year, a wave of bankruptcies in the crypto sector exposed grift throughout the industry. A lot of people got rich before the increase in interest rates and subsequent collapse of Luna in May 2022 set off a chain reaction that sent the entire market tumbling down, spurring a crypto winter that persists to this day. Bankman-Fried, the ex-CEO of now-bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, for example, faces criminal charges alleging that he promulgated a multibillion-dollar fraud scheme. Binance, the world\'s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, is being sued by both the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission over a raft of accusations, including the assertion that Binance commingled billions of dollars worth of user funds with its own money. Instead of placing blind trust in a central intermediary to act in the best interest of the customer, Buterin said, he believes the ideal solution comes down to writing better code so that users can deal directly on-chain. "We need the experience on-chain to actually be good for regular people to use," Buterin said. "We need it to actually be possible to do ethereum payments in a way where the transaction fee is less than five cents a transaction; in a way where the experience doesn\'t suck and randomly fail 2.3% of the time; in such a way that you need a Ph.D. in ethereum sciences to actually figure out what\'s going on," he said.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin speaks at ETHPrague 2023, an international conference drawing crypto developers from around the world.

"People need to have wallets that are actually secure, where if they lose the keys, they\'re not going to lose everything," Buterin added. A national digital currency could provide the ease of use he envisions, but he believes that decentralization is also critical, otherwise they\'ll devolve into another version of the existing banking system — only with more surveillance built in. "That was a space where I think I had somewhat more hope, probably, naively, five years ago, because there were a lot of people who wanted to do things like make them blockchain friendly, give actual transparency and verifiability guarantees, and some kind of level of actual privacy," Buterin said, referring to central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs. CBDCs are a type of blockchain-based virtual currency that is fully regulated and has the backing of a country\'s central bank. The People\'s Bank of China, which is arguably the leader in CBDCs thus far, has been piloting its take on a CBDC for almost a decade. As of June, transactions using the digital yuan, or e-yuan, hit nearly $250 billion. But as CBDCs catch on, concerns have been raised about financial surveillance and monitoring tools which can be baked into these government-issued digital currencies. "As each and every one of those projects come to a certain maturity," Buterin said, the privacy-preserving bits "all sort of fall away as the thing comes closer and closer to being a 1.0. We get systems that are not actually much better than existing payment systems, because they just basically end up being different front-ends for the existing banking system." "They end up being even less private and basically break down all of the existing barriers against both corporations and the government at the same time," he said.\n\nBuilding a new, brave world\n\nVitalik\'s father, Dmitry, introduced him to bitcoin in 2011. Both Vitalik and Dmitry Buterin, a computer scientist who had lived outside Moscow, were intrigued by the idea of a decentralized currency that operated outside the reach of governments or central banks. But Vitalik was keen to advance this new kind of decentralized ledger technology so that it could be put to greater use. What ultimately put him on the map was baking smart contracts — a programmable piece of code that aims to replace middlemen such as banks and lawyers in certain types of business transactions — into the blockchain. It was a game-changing innovation for the sector that led to an explosion of projects and initial coin offerings, or ICOs, built on ethereum. Today, the network serves as the primary building block for all sorts of crypto projects, including non-fungible tokens, or NFTs; decentralized finance, or DeFi; and web3, a still somewhat amorphous buzzword for a third generation of the internet that is decentralized and built using blockchain tech. Meanwhile, ethereum\'s native token, ether , is the world\'s second-biggest cryptocurrency by market cap after bitcoin.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin speaks at ETHPrague 2023, an international conference drawing crypto developers from around the world. Photo: Pavel Sinagl\n\nIn ethereum circles, hackers are known as BUIDLers — an intentional misspelling of the word "builders" in a sort of homage to the bitcoin meme HODL, or "hold on for dear life." The meme-off may seem silly, but it gets at the core of what separates these two very different sets of people. Bitcoiners tend to move more slowly on development, prioritizing security and decentralization above all else, while ethereum programmers tend to be more cavalier. While they aren\'t necessarily breaking things as they go, they do move fast and tinker aggressively. Last year, for example, the ethereum network fundamentally altered the way the blockchain secures its networks and verifies transactions, slashing its energy consumption by more than 99% in the process. Before this upgrade, both the bitcoin and ethereum blockchains had their own vast networks of miners all over the planet running highly specialized computers that crunched math equations in order to validate transactions. Proof-of-work uses a lot of energy, and it is one of the industry\'s biggest targets for criticism. But with the upgrade, ethereum migrated to a system known as proof-of-stake, which swaps out miners for validators. Instead of running large banks of computers, validators leverage their existing cache of ether as a means to verify transactions and mint new tokens. Buterin insisted that ethereum\'s move to a proof-of-stake model is more likely to stand up against government intervention. "Proof-of-stake is actually easier to anonymize and harder to shut down than proof-of-work is," he said. "Proof-of-work requires huge amounts of physical equipment and requires huge amounts of electricity. These are exactly the kinds of things that drug enforcement agencies have decades of experience detecting." About the ethereum network, he said, "On the other hand, you\'ve got your laptop. You just need a VPN somewhere, and you hide it in a corner. It\'s not perfect, but it\'s definitely much easier to hide."\n\nCoder behind the curtain\n\nIn previous appearances in Denver and Paris, Buterin\'s stage presence was colored with a subtle unease. But one-on-one in Prague, he really came alive, dropping the tics and effortlessly swapping the role of elusive coder for open-minded educator. His transparent communication style, coupled with his willingness to engage in profound philosophical discussions around concepts such as quadratic funding — a way to crowd-raise a central crypto treasury that is then used to fund public goods projects in ethereum, all with the help of an algorithm designed to optimize spending decisions — and soulbound digital identities on the blockchain have turned him into a trusted thought leader within the crypto community. Notably, Buterin is also very willing to field any question posed to him — especially those that address critiques of the network and of the scope of his leadership position today. Take the example of his own outsized role in the cryptocurrency he created. Unlike the pseudonymous and hidden Satoshi Nakamoto, who created bitcoin, Buterin is very much the face of ethereum. Some see this as a significant point of weakness for the network, because governments could target either Buterin or the Ethereum Foundation. But Buterin rejects those contentions. He said that five years ago a lot more was dependent on him personally and on the foundation, but today, clients — that is, software applications built on top of the blockchain that operate independently — have taken on a lot of the work. Ethereum has become its own self-governing ecosystem, with no single point of failure, he said. "Even if the foundation got some magic freezing order in every jurisdiction at the same time, and if something happened to me at the same time, there\'s entire companies that are sole maintainers of ethereum clients that would totally be able to continue," explained Buterin. They call it the philosophy of subtraction. "I think one of the ways of describing its aim is basically that the Ethereum Foundation isn\'t trying to kind of be a zealot, a long-term operator or dominator, or anything like that," he said. "The goal of the Ethereum Foundation is to foster things that, once they start, can continue in a way that\'s totally independent." In terms of what\'s next for ethereum, Buterin said a big priority is focusing on privacy and scalability through zero-knowledge rollups. ZK-rollups are transactions bundled into sets and executed off-chain. This layer-two technology plays a major role in future upgrades that will ultimately help to make ethereum faster and cheaper to use. "There\'s definitely an extent to which there are diverging interests and there is the extent to which I think the ecosystem does need to find a way to fight hard for the right to continue to build things with the kinds of privacy that we\'ve been used to for thousands of years," Buterin said. Clarification: Buterin does not believe he\'s been targeted by any countries specifically and does not consider himself an outlaw, but is apprehensive about visiting certain countries because of his work.'}].

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
Based on the news provided, there are a few key points to consider for estimating the market trend for ETH cryptocurrency:

1. **Ether Turns Inflationary as Network Revenue Plunges**: The negative outlook for ETH compared to BTC due to shockingly low revenues and lack of buzz around the next protocol update could lead to a potential fall in ETH price to as low as $1,000 if the trend continues. This could indicate a bearish sentiment in the market.

2. **Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin Trade Muted**: The trading of BTC, ETH, and DOGE was mostly flat, with lower-than-average volume across the general market and the crypto sector. This could suggest a period of consolidation in the market, with bears potentially losing steam. Traders and investors will be watching the crypto sector over the weekend for indications of how the market may trade on Monday.

3. **Vitalik Buterin Talks Crypto and U.S. Crackdown**: Vitalik Buterin's insights on the crypto market, the importance of decentralization, privacy, and scalability, as well as his vision for the future of ethereum, could influence market sentiment positively. His focus on providing actual value to people and addressing privacy concerns align with the core principles of the crypto community.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by the on-chain and news analysts, the overall market trend for ETH cryptocurrency appears to be bearish in the short term. The on-chain analysis indicates fluctuating open prices, high gas prices, and conflicting signals from moving averages and MACD. The news analysis highlights negative revenue trends for ETH compared to BTC and the potential for a price drop to $1,000. 

Considering these factors, along with the lack of a reflection analyst report to provide a different perspective, I believe the bearish sentiment is stronger. Therefore, I will take a more conservative approach and suggest a sell action to minimize potential losses in the current market conditions.

*** ONCHAIN ANALYST RESPONSE ***
Based on the recent information provided, it appears that the market trend for ETH is currently showing a buy signal for the short-long moving average, but a sell signal for the MACD indicator. The Bollinger Bands signal is indicating a hold.

The number of transactions, unique addresses, and value transferred have been increasing over time, which could indicate growing interest and activity in the ETH market. However, the average gas price has also been increasing, which could potentially impact transaction costs for users.

Overall, it seems that there is some mixed signals in the market at the moment. It would be important to monitor the price movements and indicators closely to get a clearer picture of the market trend in the near future.

The general market condition has not offered much reprieve either, as most altcoins have failed to maintain an upward momentum. Fortunately, the latest on-chain revelation offers some hope for the price of Ethereum.\n\nEthereum Average Fee Drops To Lowest Level In 2023\n\nOn-chain analytics have been helpful in providing real-time insights into crypto market trends. And the latest on-chain revelations have highlighted a plunge in Ethereum network fees, which might prove to be a turning point for the cryptocurrency’s market value and performance.\n\nAccording to the on-chain analytics platform, Santiment, the Ethereum network fees have dropped to their lowest levels in 2023, with each transaction averaging about $1.15 as of this writing. This reflects a significant fall from the huge fees seen in 2021 and 2022, with demand for processing power causing the average fees to reach above $50.\n\nHistorically, such a decline in fees is a positive sign for Ethereum’s utility and adoption, as lower costs make it more profitable and worthwhile to use the network. Santiment also noted that rising utility is often the case due to Ether tokens becoming more affordable to circulate.\n\nIt is worth noting that the impact of this development can spread to the overall market value of the digital asset. Increased utility and adoption can contribute to the recovery of Ethereum’s market capitalization and value.\n\nThe Effect On ETH Price?\n\nIndeed, the plunging network fees positively benefit Ethereum and its users, especially as it can improve other network metrics and parameters. However, this development has not significantly impacted ETH price, as it seems to be struggling to break out from under the current selling pressure.\n\nOn Thursday, September 21, the cryptocurrency fell beneath the psychological $1,600 level for the second time this month. And the Ether token continues to trade below this price mark, with a roughly 2.6% decline in the past three days.\n\nInvestors will be watching to see if Ethereum can build positive network momentum while fees are low. However, it remains to be seen whether this will be enough to propel the ETH price out of consolidation, especially as there are no signs of buying pressure from Ethereum whales.\n\nThere are no signs of buying pressure from #Ethereum whales yet! pic.twitter.com/oqBbdbaOlb — Ali (@ali_charts) September 21, 2023\n\nMoreover, the dwindling number of major ETH holders adds zero optimism to this scenario. This is because such a decline in whale holdings can make the Ethereum price increasingly susceptible to downward pressure.\n\nAccording to CoinGecko data, the Ether token trades for $1,593, reflecting a 2.6% price dip in the past week. Ethereum is currently the second-largest cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization of $191.6 billion.\n\nEthereum price trading below $1,600 on the daily timeframe | Source: TOTAL chart on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from The Economic Times, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, we see mixed signals in the market for ETH. The short-long moving average is showing a buy signal, while the MACD indicator is showing a sell signal. The Bollinger Bands signal is indicating a hold. The increase in the number of transactions, unique addresses, and value transferred could indicate growing interest in the market, but the rising average gas price may impact transaction costs.

From the news analyst report, we see that there is a potential bullish setup for Ethereum with a buy opportunity at levels around $1,430 to $1,440 for longer-term positions. However, the delay in Ethereum's major upgrade and the news of lower network fees impacting market sentiment could introduce some uncertainty.

Considering the overall context, I believe that the market trend for ETH is slightly bearish in the short term due to the mixed signals and potential delays in upgrades. Therefore, I would suggest selling a portion of ETH to capitalize on the downside potential.

OP Stack is a similar customizable toolkit that leverages Optimism’s “optimistic” technology.\n\nMove to Ethereum Layer-2 Via Polygon CDK\n\nPolygon Labs’ co-founder Sandeep Nailwal presented a proposal to the Celo community this week recommending that the blockchain ecosystem consider implementing Polygon’s Chain Development Kit, which is a codebase enabling developers to build customized layer-2 chains leveraging zero-knowledge (ZK) technology.\n\nThe proposal on the Celo governance forum stated,\n\n“Polygon Labs is excited to welcome Celo home to Ethereum in the chain’s transition from an independent EVM-compatible L1 to an Ethereum L2.

According to Ultra Sound Money, over 13,000 ETH (equivalent to $21 million) has been introduced into Ethereum’s supply since the beginning of the month.\n\nThis suggests that Ethereum’s burn mechanism has failed to counterbalance the influx of new ETH entering the supply as rewards for validators, particularly during this period of reduced activity.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nWhile the crypto market did see a retracement following the Fed’s announcement, factors beyond the interest rate decision could have influenced their prices.\n\nEthereum’s on-chain activity may have declined in September, but this could be attributed to various factors, including market sentiment and investor behavior, rather than solely the failure of the burn mechanism.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s potential interest rate hike and the resultant market fluctuations underscore the vulnerability of digital assets to macroeconomic shifts. This is a stark reminder of the crypto market’s interconnectedness with traditional financial systems and the need for vigilance among crypto enthusiasts and investors.\n\nTo learn more about the challenges Ethereum faces amidst record-low fees, read here:\n\nETH Price Struggles Continue Despite Record-Low Network Fees\n\n\n\nTo stay updated on the recent mysterious XRP transfers involving millions, click here:\n\nMillions of XRP Moved in Mysterious Internal Transfers'}, {'id': 1, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL2NyeXB0b25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvZXRoZXJldW0tZXRoLXByaWNlLXByZWRpY3Rpb24td2lsbC1ldGgtYnJlYWstMTgwMC1iYXJyaWVyLXNvb24tYXMtd2FsbC1zdHJlZXQtbWVtZXMtcHJlc2FsZS1jbG9zZXMtdG9tb3Jyb3cuaHRt0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Sun, 24 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction: Will ETH Break the $1,800 Barrier Soon as Wall Street Memes Presale Closes ... - Cryptonews', 'content': 'Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction: Will ETH Break the $1,800 Barrier Soon as Wall Street Memes Presale Closes Tomorrow\n\nAs the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve with new developments, Ethereum (ETH) finds itself at a pivotal juncture.\n\nWith its price hovering just below the significant $1,800 threshold, many traders and analysts are keenly observing its next move.\n\nAdding to the intrigue, the impending closure of the Wall Street Memes presale tomorrow could bring about a fresh wave of interest and activity in the crypto sector.\n\nWill this event serve as a catalyst propelling Ethereum past the coveted $1,800 mark?\n\nLet’s delve into the factors influencing ETH’s price trajectory.\n\nEthereum Price\n\nToday’s Ethereum stands priced at $1,584, experiencing a trading volume of $3.6 billion over the past 24 hours.\n\nSeeing a slight dip, Ethereum has decreased by just under 0.50% within the same timeframe.\n\nCurrently holding its position as the second-ranked cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap, its market capitalization is assessed at $190 billion.\n\nThere are 120,230,004 ETH coins in circulation, while its maximum supply remains undisclosed.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction\n\nThe trading pattern of ETH/USD has been highly volatile, with resistance encountered at $1,600 and support found around the $1,575 level.\n\nA breakout from this range could trigger further price movements.\n\nIf ETH manages to surpass the $1,600 level, it may face resistance at $1,625, while a more substantial barrier could arise near the $1,660 double-top pattern.\n\nEthereum Price Chart – Source: Tradingview\n\nIn case the price of Ethereum drops below $1,575, it could potentially head towards the $1,535 level.\n\nThe chart shows that the 50-day EMA, RSI, and MACD indicators all suggest a bearish trend.\n\nIt is advisable for investors to keep a close eye on the $1,575 level, as breaking below it could reveal more opportunities for selling.\n\nWall Street Memes Presale Closes Tomorrow\n\nCurrently, many investors are exploring diverse opportunities within the cryptocurrency realm, and Wall Street Memes have caught their eye.

The reason is simple, anything new with potential finally makes it to the top. Following the trend, Ethereum, a similar type but with a much improved concept, was soon to climb the ladder of fame.\n\nThe evolution of Ethereum also spiked traders’ interests. Over the years, Ethereum has become the second largest cryptocurrency in the world. However, despite the technological spike, the coin couldn’t surpass Bitcoin. Will it ever? How high will Ethereum go? Let’s delve into the topic and understand where this coin is going in the future.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Price History\n\nLet us take a quick look at Ethereum’s historical price performance before getting into price prediction. The price of Ethereum (ETH) has fluctuated significantly since its launch in 2015. ETH first surpassed the $10 threshold in March 2016, despite experiencing a sizable surge after its launch.\n\nThe price of ETH increased more noticeably in late 2016 and early 2017 as a result of the Ethereum network’s rising popularity, which was largely brought on by the proliferation of initial coin offerings (ICOs). The price of Ethereum skyrocketed past $1,000, peaking at about $1,400 in January 2018.\n\nHowever, this price increase came after a significant decline during the ensuing crypto winter. ETH’s cost plunged to an all-time low of $80 in December 2018. However, with the start of the subsequent bullish market cycle, Ethereum started to climb steadily, occasionally experiencing minor corrections, eventually reaching a new peak of about $2,000 in May 2021.\n\nAs the bull market came to an end in November 2021, the price of ETH hit an all-time high of $4,891.70. Unfortunately, numerous crypto disasters, bankruptcies, and an unfavourable global macroeconomic environment all served to exacerbate the bear market.\n\nHow High Will Ethereum Go?\n\nAs the chart indicates, Ethereum has been receiving long term support since 2020. However, a major resistance was also created around $2038. It is the same period, when Ethereum was seen touching its all time high of $4868.\n\nHowever, Ethereum suffered a lot in 2022. In, 2023 is here with all the positive news, starting with the upgrade and switch to proof of stake (PoS). While writing the price prediction, Ethereum was at $1,858. There is a $222,970,691,577 USD market cap. The maximum supply is not known, but there are 120,245,588 ETH coins in circulation.\n\nIn the coming years, Ethereum price is predicted to range as high as $4,204.12 and $5,063.95, respectively. The typical anticipated trading expense is $4,355.45. By 2030, the price can rise up to $15,000.\n\nThe anticipations about Ethereum is quite positive. The coming period for the coin holds high expectations from traders, as well as, developers.\n\nMarket cap $196,632,048,264 ROI 65610.57% All Time High (Nov 16, 2021) $4,891.70 All Time Low (Oct 21, 2015) $0.4209\n\nUnderstanding the Idea Behind Creating Ethereum\n\nBitcoin was launched to test two main features that were missing in the financial system – permissionless transactions and cryptography. It sought to use the stern tenacity of cryptography to investigate the potential of the decentralized database. It could send values across the world without the involvement of intermediaries. However, it was missing an important feature of turning into a complete scripting language. But, do you know who had the solution? Yes, you guessed it right, Ethereum.\n\nThe idea behind Ethereum was to make it simplest, even though there might be data storage incompetence or higher time usage. As envisioned, Ethereum soon received the deserved reaction among the technological prophets. And now, after more than a decade, it has evolved into a technology that is more meticulous than Bitcoin.\n\nEthereum has played a pivotal role in the development of the blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystem, and it has been the foundation for a multitude of decentralized applications and projects in areas like decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and more. Its continued evolution and upgrades are aimed at addressing scalability and security concerns to ensure its long-term viability as a blockchain platform.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, Ethereum is a transformative digital currency that has disrupted traditional finance. Its underlying blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize various industries. As you embark on your journey into the world of Ethereum, remember to stay informed, practice security measures, and explore the endless possibilities this cryptocurrency offers.\n\n1. Is Ethereum Legal? Yes, Ethereum is legal in most countries. However, it’s essential to check your local regulations.\n\n2. How Do I Acquire Ethreum? You can acquire Ethreum through exchanges, mining, or by accepting it as payment for goods and services.'}]. Analyze the news and estimate the market trend accordingly.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by both the on-chain and news analysts, the overall market trend for ETH cryptocurrency appears to be bullish. The on-chain data indicates a strong uptrend with increasing transactions, unique addresses, and network activity. Additionally, the technical indicators such as short-long moving average, MACD, and Bollinger Bands all signal a "buy" recommendation.

The news articles also support this bullish sentiment, with developments such as Polygon Labs' proposal to streamline Celo's move to Ethereum Layer 2, anticipation of Ethereum futures ETF approval, and increased interest from traditional investors. Despite challenges with the ETH burn mechanism and market uncertainty due to potential interest rate hikes, the overall outlook remains positive.

Given the bullish trend in the market, I would recommend buying more ETH to maximize profit. Therefore, my suggested action would be to buy ETH with a confidence level of -0.7.

Concerns escalated earlier on Monday as reports emerged of Vitalik Buterin’s transfer of approximately 400 ETH to Coinbase, intensifying fears of further price declines.\n\nThe second largest cryptocurrency has recently been caught in a web of tight price consolidation after several rejections at the $1,650 resistance level, causing concern among traders and sparking a surge in negative funding rates in the cryptocurrency futures market.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Negative Funding Rates Surges\n\nCryptocurrency funding rates mirror market sentiment, signifying periodic payments between traders to align perpetual futures contract prices with underlying assets. Positive rates signal bullishness, while negative rates indicate bearishness. Ethereum’s recent narrow trading range has resulted in persistently negative funding rates, fostering a pessimistic outlook as traders brace for potential ETH price drops.\n\nNotably, “Greatest Trader” a pseudonymous analyst with popular crypto analytics firm CryptoQuant emphasized this trend in a post shared by the firm today.\n\nThe Potential for a Short Squeeze\n\nWhile prolonged periods of negative funding rates typically suggest a bearish market, they can also set the stage for a short squeeze, or a scenario where short sellers are forced to buy back their positions to cover their losses, resulting in a sudden price rebound. “Greatest Trader” further underscored the likelihood of such a sequence, explaining, “Consistent negative funding rates bear the potential to initiate a chain reaction of short liquidations, which, in turn, could catalyze an abrupt price rebound.”\n\nWhales and Traditional Investors Prepare for Volatility\n\nIn a related development, Ethereum options on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) have hit a record high of $352 million in open interest, signalling a spike in interest from traditional investors. This coincides with rising expectations of an Ethereum futures Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) approval scheduled for next week.\n\nThis surge in open interest indicates investor positioning for a potential bullish outcome, with data from Santiment showing Ethereum whales holding between 100,000 ETH and 1,000,000 ETH accumulating just over 1 million ETH after the September 11 price dip.

With the bears winning at a much higher rate than the bulls, Ethereum holders have found their holdings have continued to lose value. This time around, the plunge has sent the number of investors losing money to a new all-time high.\n\nNumber Of Ethereum Addresses In Loss At ATH\n\nOn-chain data tracker Glassnode Alerts on X (formerly Twitter) has revealed a shocking development regarding Ethereum addresses. According to the tracker, the number of addresses seeing losses on a 7-day moving average (MA) has jumped to its highest level ever.\n\nThis metric takes note of the price at which the ETH coins being held on addresses were last moved. Then it is compared to the current price of the altcoin to figure out if the addresses are seeing gains or losses. The metric had been rapidly climbing in 2023 due to the bear market, culminating in a new all-time high.\n\nAccording to Glassnode’s report, the total number of addresses in loss is now sitting at 49,939,211.006, rising from its previous all-time high of 49,921,736.464 that was reached on September 15. If the price of ETH continues to drop, then this figure will likely hit another all-time high soon.\n\nNumber of addresses in loss hit new all-time high Source: Glassnode\n\nOther ETH Metrics Flashing Bearish\n\nEthereum’s open interest in perpetual futures contracts had also taken a hit with the price struggles. It dropped to a one-month low $445,789,354, just weeks after hitting a previous one-month low of $450,965,900 on September 13.\n\nAccumulation also seems to be dropping among mid-sized investors in the meantime. Glassnode also reports that the number of addresses holding at least 10 ETH had plunged to a 3-month low of 347,825. This suggests that these investors may be offloading their holdings to prevent more losses.\n\nSmall investors are also not left out of this trend. Another metric that tracks the number of Ethereum addresses holding at least 0.1 ETH also showed a decline in recent months. This has led to a 5-month low for the metric, with only 5,120,950 addresses holding 0.1+ ETH.\n\nThese declines come as no surprise as the ETH price had lost support above $1,600. With the bears dragging the price below $1,600, the losses for holders had climbed rapidly as the altcoin’s price fell to two-week lows.\n\nFounder Vitalik Buterin had also made transactions carrying a significant amount of ETH toward centralized exchanges. This has sparked speculations that the founder is selling, which in turn could influence investors to sell as well.\n\nETH bears take control of price | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nFeatured image from Blockchair, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Market leader Bitcoin (BTC) held the fort at $26,569, more or less exactly the same price as last week, while Ethereum (ETH) dropped a slight 2.8% to trade for $1,592.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt was another of crypto’s relatively less volatile weeks, which seem to be occurring more frequently this year. There were no major price swings among any of the forty biggest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization—except for Chainlink.\n\nHolders of LINK found their stashes swell by 12% this week to hit $7 on Saturday.\n\nOn Wednesday, Toncoin (TON) was posting seven-day gains of 31%, but the coin’s rapid rally—which ran for just over a week on news that parent company Telegram had integrated a TON self-custodial wallet into the messaging app—appears to have cooled off by the weekend.\n\nToncoin enters Saturday just 3.7% up at $2.33.\n\nAdoption news\n\nThis week’s Fed policy meeting concluded with no new interest rate hikes, positively contributing to stabilizing crypto prices. The more difficult it is to borrow, the more people offload speculative assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies.\n\nThere were more headlines indicating that global crypto adoption is continuing apace.\n\nOn Monday, banking giant Citigroup launched a digital token service utilizing blockchain and smart contract technology to facilitate rapid cross-border payments between institutions.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Wednesday, PayPal announced that Venmo users will be able to purchase the payments giant’s dollar-pegged Ethereum-based stablecoin PYUSD “in the coming weeks.”\n\nPolitics\n\nThere were also several political developments with regard to crypto this week.\n\nThe former chair of the leading British regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), confessed at a conference on Tuesday that during his tenure (2018–2022), the FCA faced “political pressure” to accept several of the 43 firms currently approved to offer crypto services in the UK. He further said that “all the evidence” suggested that it “wasn’t a very good idea.”\n\nLater in the week, the FCA publicly urged British crypto companies to register with existing financial promotions legislation. All companies promoting crypto in the UK, whether based in the territory or not, have to make an application and pay a fee to get approved or promote their services through approved parties.\n\n“We are concerned by the poor engagement from many unregistered, overseas crypto asset firms who have U.K. customers on this important change,” the FCA wrote in its statement.\n\nIn the States on Wednesday, the House Financial Services Committee (HFSC) passed the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act, laying the groundwork for a future vote on the legislation on the House floor.\n\nProposed by crypto-friendly Congressman Tom Emmer (R-MN), the legislation hopes to block the Federal Reserve from issuing a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) to individuals.

This move has left his intentions and strategy unclear, adding suspense to his cryptocurrency actions.\n\nButerin is one of the most well-known individuals in the cryptocurrency industry. While the cryptocurrency market struggles with unpredictability, Buterin’s moves have generated interest and rumors.\n\nA Standard Transaction?\n\nData from the Ethereum blockchain scanning tool Etherscan show that Buterin made the most recent transfer into Coinbase on Monday, depositing 400 ETH worth approximately $630,000. Many in the crypto world are considering the consequences of this shift.\n\nMeanwhile, Buterin’s ongoing cryptocurrency deposits follow a recent pattern of transactions, adding intrigue to his intentions. His wallet has seen significant ETH movements in the past week, leaving uncertainty about whether this is routine portfolio management or part of a larger strategy.\n\nLooking at Buterin’s most recent transactions, the mystery surrounding his transfer activity intensifies. His wallet address delivered 300 ETH to Kraken, another well-known cryptocurrency exchange, in addition to the 400 ETH put on Coinbase. Additionally, 200 ETH moved from his wallet into USDC, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar.\n\nPossible Consequences for the Crypto Market\n\nVitalik Buterin’s recent actions are drawing significant attention, particularly in a volatile market. As an Ethereum co-founder, his moves can sway investor sentiment, yet his intentions remain unclear.\n\nEthereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, saw a 3.5% drop last week amidst market turbulence. Key players’ actions can profoundly impact the overall market narrative in such conditions.\n\nHis activities and transactions are being intently watched by market participants and enthusiasts who are trying to determine how they might affect Ethereum and the larger cryptocurrency market.\n\nIn a recent interview , Buterin mentioned that Ethereum might be better equipped to resist government intervention, especially with the current implementation of a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.\n\nButerin clarified that proof-of-stake offers better anonymity and resistance to shutdown attempts than proof-of-work. He pointed out that proof-of-work relies on extensive physical infrastructure and high energy consumption, areas where law enforcement has experience in detection.\n\nIn the midst of market turmoil, Buterin’s recent transactions have sparked interest in the crypto community. Ethereum’s one-day trading volume surged to $4.7 billion, while its price dipped by 0.6% to $1,630.61 at the time of writing, all while his intentions and strategies remain uncertain.\n\nHacked Twitter Account Results in Theft Of $700K\n\nA cyber attacker successfully breached Vitalik Buterin’s official X account, resulting in a loss exceeding $690,000, as detailed by blockchain investigator ZachXBT.\n\nThe hacking method involved compromising Buterin’s account and posting on his behalf, marking the introduction of Proto-Danksharding to the Ethereum platform.\n\nIn a now-infamous post, Buterin shared his intentions to release a series of commemorative NFTs from ConsenSys. Regrettably, the post included a malicious URL and was sent to his 4.9 million followers, resulting in some falling victim to the deception.'}].

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
Based on the news articles provided, there are mixed signals for the Ethereum (ETH) market:

1. The State of Staking: The upgrade made ETH "deflationary" for the first time, with the circulating supply of ETH decreasing. This could potentially lead to increased scarcity and value for ETH.

2. Ethereum Funding Rate Turns Negative: Negative funding rates and concerns about price declines indicate bearish sentiment in the market. However, the potential for a short squeeze could lead to a sudden price rebound.

3. Number Of Ethereum Addresses Losing Money: The increase in the number of addresses in loss and other bearish metrics suggest a challenging environment for ETH holders, with accumulation dropping among investors.

4. This Week in Coins: Stable prices for leading cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, and positive adoption news could provide some stability in the market.

5. Ethereum Co-Founder Buterin Shifts Huge ETH Holdings: Vitalik Buterin's recent transactions have generated interest and uncertainty in the market. His actions could potentially impact investor sentiment and market dynamics.

Overall, the market trend for Ethereum appears to be mixed, with both bullish and bearish factors at play. It is important to closely monitor market developments and investor sentiment to assess the direction of the ETH market accurately.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by the on-chain and news analysts, the market trend for ETH appears to be mixed with both bullish and bearish signals. The on-chain data shows conflicting signals with a buy signal for the short-long moving average but a sell signal for the MACD indicator. The news articles also present a mixed picture with some positive developments such as the upgrade making ETH deflationary, but also negative factors like the increase in addresses losing money.

Considering the overall market sentiment and the potential impact of the recent news on investor behavior, I believe that the market trend for ETH is slightly bearish. The negative funding rates, concerns about price declines, and increase in addresses in loss suggest a challenging environment for ETH holders in the short term.

Therefore, I would recommend selling a portion of ETH to capitalize on the potential downward trend in the market. My suggested action would be to sell 0.4 (sell 40% ETH).

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

They ensure timely and efficient processing, bridging the gap between users and the blockchain by batching and broadcasting transactions. With the exit of Blocknative, the relayer landscape is becoming increasingly concentrated. At time of writing, only four relayers remain active on the network.\n\nFollowing Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake, the roles of block proposing and block building became distinct processes. MEV-boost software was developed to facilitate an efficient market between these proposers, which submit transaction bundles to validators, and builders, which organize the transactions in a specific order.\n\nFollowing the Merge, a group of well-resourced Ethereum block builders, formerly including Blocknative, began running their own relays.\n\nToday, nearly all Ethereum transactions use MEV-boost relays. 93% of Ethereum blocks created in the past 14 days made use of MEV-boost, according to data compiled on mevboost.pics. At the time that data was compiled, five entities were responsible for relaying 98% of the MEV-boosted transactions, per relayscan.io.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nAccording to Blocknative, it dropped its MEV-boost relay because continuing was no longer economically viable. The four remaining relayers collect no fees for their services, making this core piece of Ethereum infrastructure unprofitable for its operators. A recent Flashbots community proposal aims to start a “PBS Guild” which would solicit Ethereum community donations in part to reward relayers.\n\nUri Klarman, CEO of relaying entity Bloxroute, believes that a relayer fee mechanism should be activated, however. He suggests that block validators anticipate this move.\n\n“I heard from multiple validators, like, ‘yeah, we don’t understand how you [haven’t charged] us until this point,’” Klarman told Blockworks.\n\nKlarman said relayer fees would require some level of consensus between the remaining relaying entities and, ideally, the Ethereum community. If the economic incentive problem isn’t fixed, though, Klarman thinks the perceived centralization of MEV-boost relays could grow worse.\n\n“In a year, if everything stays the same […] I think it’s very reasonable that there will be [fewer] relays than there are today,” Klarman said.\n\nElias Simos, the CEO of Ethereum data platform Rated, told Blockworks he is ambivalent toward a future where Ethereum continues to rely on its four major relayers.\n\n“They’re demonstrably long-term actors in the space, so they have a lot to lose [if Ethereum is harmed],” Simos said. “But at the same time, is that enough?”\n\nUpdated Sept. 28, 2023 at 10:22 am ET: Updated to clarify that Ethereum transactions are now handled by four relayers.\n\nDon’t miss the next big story – join our free daily newsletter.'}, {'id': 3, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vbmV3cy9ldGhlcmV1bS1vZmFjLWNvbXBsaWFuY2UtZGlwcy00NS1wb3N0LW1lcmdlLXVwZ3JhZGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Wed, 27 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Ethereum OFAC compliance dips to 45% post-Merge upgrade - Cointelegraph', 'content': 'The historic Merge upgrade from Sept. 2022 — which marked Ethereum’s transition from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) — resulted in the overall decline in compliance with standards laid down by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).\n\nEthereum blocks adhering to OFAC compliance censor certain transactions, which has a negative impact on the neutrality of the Ethereum ecosystem. In early August 2022, OFAC sanctioned Tornado Cash and several Ether (ETH) addresses associated with it due to its ability to mask and anonymize transactions.\n\nBefore the Merge upgrade, Ethereum’s OFAC compliance increased exponentially as entities such as crypto exchanges opted to run censoring MEV-Boost relays on their validators. The list of top censorship offenders is populated by popular platforms such as Binance, Celsius Network, Bitfinex, Ledger Live, Huobi (HTX) and Coinbase, according to MEV Watch data.\n\nList of entities running censoring MEV relays on their validators are actively harming Ethereum’s credible neutrality. Source: MEV Watch\n\nHowever, the overall OFAC compliance of Ethereum blocks has declined significantly. In November 2022, 78% of the total Ethereum blocks complied with OFAC regulations. As of today, Sept. 27, Ethereum’s OFAC compliance dropped to 30%, recording an overall reduction of 57%.\n\nPost-Merge daily OFAC-compliant Ethereum blocks. Source: MEV Watch\n\nCountering OFAC compliance requires operators to use relays that do not censor according to OFAC compliance requirements. There are seven major MEV-boost relays that are most commonly used: Flashbots, BloXroute Max Profit, BloXroute Ethical, BloXroute Regulated, BlockNative, Manifold and Eden. However, not all systems adhere to OFAC compliance, according to MEV Watch:\n\n“Of the 7 available major relays only 3 do not censor according to OFAC compliance requirements.”\n\nIt is also important to note that not all blocks built by OFAC-compliant relays are censoring; however, all blocks built by OFAC-compliant relays will censor when non-compliant transactions are broadcast to the network.\n\nWhile OFAC regulations primarily target United States-based organizations, validators outside the U.S. must consider running non-censoring relays for the benefit of the network.\n\nRelated: US Treasury sanctions Ethereum wallet tied to cartel over ‘illicit fentanyl trafficking’\n\nAmid Ethereum’s reduced OFAC compliance, Grayscale made the decision to abandon all the rights to PoW Ethereum tokens (ETHPoW). However, the decision was attributed to a lack of liquidity in the market. According to an official announcement:\n\n“As such, it is not possible to exercise the rights to acquire and sell the ETHPoW tokens, and on behalf of the record date shareholders, Grayscale is abandoning the rights to these assets.”\n\nOn the other hand, some cryptocurrency investment firms like ETC Group have attempted to launch dedicated EthereumPoW exchange-traded products (ETPs).\n\nMagazine: ‘AI has killed the industry’: EasyTranslate boss on adapting to change'}, {'id': 1, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNjbi5jb20vbmV3cy9ldGhlcmV1bS1iZWF0cy1taWNyb3NvZnQtZmFjZWJvb2stMTBiLXJldmVudWUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Wed, 27 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Ethereum Revenue Soars to $10B, Outshining Tech Titans Microsoft and Facebook - CCN.com', 'content': 'Key Takeaways\n\nDespite uncertainty and a YoY decline, Ethereum has generated $10Bn in income in seven years.\n\nIt surpassed software giants such as Microsoft and Facebook.\n\nAs per sources, Ethereum’s network revenue could grow to $51Bn per year by 2030 from the current $2.6Bn.\n\nSince its inception in 2015, Vitalik Buterin’s cryptocurrency, Ethereum, has amassed $10 billion in income, beating Facebook and Microsoft in terms of growth rate.\n\nIn practice, whereas Ethereum would have taken 7.5 years to reach the $10 billion revenue milestone, Facebook (now Meta) appears to have taken somewhat longer and Microsoft a full 19 years.\n\nAs Crypto Portfolio Manager at cryptocurrency brokerage firm Caleb & Brown points out , such a result suggests that crypto protocols, like software, may be the next to become worldwide.\n\nFactors Influencing Ethereum’s Earnings\n\nEthereum’s popularity is driven by its versatility. Unlike Bitcoin, which primarily serves as a secure transactional network, Ethereum distinguishes itself by enabling the deployment of complex protocols across diverse industries. This adaptability makes Ethereum a preferred platform for applications in finance, gaming, art, and more.\n\nAs of September 26, Ethereum’s native cryptocurrency, ETH was trading at approximately $1,625, with the Ethereum network boasting a market capitalization exceeding $195 billion.\n\nEthereum primarily generates revenue through transaction fees, denominated in gas. The cost of these fees varies depending on the complexity of the transaction.\n\nBasic transfers have lower fees, while smart contract-based transactions, which ensure trustless execution, are usually more expensive. Transaction costs increase with the complexity of network transactions.\n\nEthereum’s transaction fee revenue goes to validators, who secure the network and confirm transactions. They earn block rewards and transaction fees for their role, incentivizing them to maintain network integrity and smooth operations.\n\nPositive ETH Price Outlook\n\nPositive predictions on the price of Ethereum (ETH) appear to be prevalent in September 2023.\n\nThese projections are based on ETH’s past performance in comparison to BTC and its four-year halving cycle.\n\nIn reality, it appears that ETH has outperformed BTC during bull markets, but during bear markets, ETH looks to suffer more than BTC.\n\nAt the time of writing, the price of ETH had increased by more than 15% over the previous year. In fact, ETH is currently valued $1.627 . However, by mid-April 2023, ETH had reached an annual price high of more than $2,000.\n\nA $51 Billion Revenue Projection by 2030\n\nIn conclusion, the projected revenue potential of reaching $51 billion by 2030 not only underscores the untapped opportunities within the Ethereum network but also signifies the promising growth prospects that decentralized platforms may experience in the years ahead.\n\nDespite market uncertainties, Ethereum’s versatility and applications position it for sustained growth, showcasing blockchain’s transformative potential across industries'}, {'id': 4, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vd2F0Y2hlci5ndXJ1L25ld3Mvd2lsbC1ldGhlcmV1bS1yZWNvdmVy0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Wed, 27 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Will Ethereum Recover? - Watcher Guru', 'content': 'Will Ethereum Recover? A Deep Dive into the Future of ETH\n\nCryptocurrencies have taken the financial world by storm, and Ethereum (ETH) has been at the forefront of this revolution.\n\nAs one of the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, Ethereum has gained significant attention from investors, traders, and enthusiasts alike.\n\nHowever, the recent market volatility and regulatory concerns have left many wondering: Will Ethereum recover and continue its upward trajectory?\n\nIn this article, we will explore the future of Ethereum, analyzing key factors such as its transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain, price forecasts, and the overall market sentiment.\n\nAlso read: Cloud & Crypto-Based Gaming the End for Xbox, PlayStation?\n\nSource: CNN\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum’s Current Challenges\n\nBefore diving into Ethereum’s recovery potential, it’s essential to understand its current challenges.\n\nOne of the main concerns is the transition from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain, also known as the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade.\n\nThis transition addresses scalability issues and reduces energy consumption, making the network more sustainable.\n\nThe shift to PoS introduces a new consensus mechanism where validators are chosen to create new blocks based on the number of coins they hold and are willing to “stake” as collateral.\n\nWhile PoS has several advantages over PoW, such as increased security and scalability, the transition process has been complex and time-consuming.\n\nAs a result, Ethereum has faced delays and uncertainty, causing some investors to question its future prospects.\n\nAdditionally, the crypto market has experienced significant volatility, with prices of many cryptocurrencies fluctuating wildly.\n\nConcerns over regulatory actions and potential bans in certain countries have also added to the uncertainty surrounding Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies. These challenges have led to price fluctuations and dampened investor sentiment.\n\nAlso read: Crypto-Friendly Banks in Europe?\n\nThe Potential of Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Blockchain\n\nOne of the key factors driving Ethereum’s ability to recover is the transition to a PoS blockchain. PoS has several advantages over PoW, including reduced energy consumption, increased security, and improved scalability.\n\nPoS allows for a more sustainable and environmentally friendly blockchain network by eliminating the need for resource-intensive mining.\n\nThe shift to PoS is a vital Ethereum milestone, addressing network scalability issues.\n\nAdditionally, PoS will reward users for staking their ETH in the network.\n\nThe PoS shift will introduce staking rewards for users who participate by staking their ETH.\n\nThis incentivizes users to hold and stake their coins, potentially reducing selling pressure and increasing demand for ETH. As more users participate in staking, the network’s security is strengthened, further enhancing Ethereum’s appeal to investors.\n\nPrice Forecasts: What the Experts Say\n\nSource: Forbes\n\nPrice forecasts can provide valuable insights into the future performance of Ethereum.\n\nWhile it’s important to approach these forecasts cautiously, they can help inform investment decisions and shape market sentiment.\n\nLet’s look at some of the price predictions made by experts and analysts.\n\nCoinCodex Study\n\nAccording to a study by CoinCodex, Ethereum could recover to a price of $28,700 by the end of 2025. This analysis considers Ethereum’s price volatility and the cyclical nature of Bitcoin halvings, which historically put upward pressure on the entire crypto market.\n\nCrypto trader Kaleo has predicted that Ethereum could hit $3,000 in 2023. Kaleo has a track record of successful market trend predictions, although predictions should be cautiously approached.\n\nRenowned investor Cathie Wood, CEO of Ark Invest, is massively bullish on Ethereum. She has estimated that Ethereum could reach all-time highs of between $170,000 and $180,000 by 2030.\n\nWood is optimistic because Ethereum can disrupt traditional finance and underpins the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nThese predictions highlight the potential for Ethereum’s price to rise significantly in the coming years. However, it’s important to remember that the crypto market is highly volatile and subject to various external factors, so caution should always be exercised when making investment decisions.\n\nIs Ethereum a Good Investment?\n\nWhether Ethereum is a good investment depends on various factors, including your risk tolerance, investment goals, and market outlook.\n\nWhile Ethereum has shown significant growth and a strong track record, it’s essential to consider both the potential rewards and risks of investing in this cryptocurrency.\n\nOne of the key advantages of Ethereum is its position as the leading smart contract platform. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with predefined conditions, enabling decentralized applications to run on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe widespread adoption of smart contracts has opened up various possibilities, from decentralized finance to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized exchanges (DEXs).\n\nFurthermore, the transition to a PoS blockchain with Ethereum 2.0 has the potential to increase the network’s scalability and security significantly. This upgrade could attract more developers and users to the Ethereum ecosystem, driving demand for ETH and potentially increasing its value.\n\nHowever, it’s important to consider the risks associated with investing in Ethereum. The crypto market is highly volatile, and prices can fluctuate rapidly. Regulatory actions and government interventions can also impact the market sentiment and the value of cryptocurrencies.\n\nAdditionally, technological risks, such as potential vulnerabilities in smart contracts or security breaches, should be considered.\n\nWhether Ethereum is a good investment depends on your circumstances and risk tolerance.\n\nDoing thorough research, consulting with financial advisors, and only investing what you can afford to lose is always recommended.\n\nThe Future of Ethereum: Eth Price Around the Merge\n\nSource: Reuters\n\nOne of the most anticipated events for Ethereum is the upcoming merge, which will combine the existing PoW chain with the new PoS chain.\n\nThis merger aims to bring together the best of both worlds, combining the security and decentralization of PoW with the efficiency and sustainability of PoS.\n\nThe merge is expected to impact the Ethereum network and its price significantly.\n\nAs the network transitions to a more energy-efficient and scalable PoS consensus mechanism, it could attract more investors and developers to the ecosystem. This increased interest and participation could drive up the demand for ETH and positively impact its price.\n\nMoreover, the merger will also introduce changes to the Ethereum supply dynamics. With PoS, users can stake their ETH and earn staking rewards.\n\nThis process incentivizes users to hold onto their coins, potentially reducing the selling pressure and increasing demand for ETH. As the supply of ETH on exchanges decreases, it could create upward pressure on the price.\n\nWhile predicting the exact price movements around the merger is challenging, the general sentiment is optimistic. The market anticipates the merger will unlock new potential for Ethereum, positioning it as a leading blockchain platform and potentially driving its price higher.\n\nTechnical Analysis and Price Forecasts\n\nTechnical analysis can provide valuable insights into the future price movements of Ethereum based on historical data and market trends.\n\nAnalysts can make predictions about the future direction of ETH’s price by analyzing price charts and using various indicators.\n\nBased on artificial intelligence-assisted technical analysis, some price forecasts suggest that Ethereum could experience significant growth in the coming years.\n\nThese forecasts consider historical price patterns, trading volume, and market sentiment.\n\nHowever, it’s important to remember that technical analysis is not foolproof and should be used with other forms of analysis and information.\n\nThe crypto market is highly volatile and can be influenced by various factors, including market sentiment, regulatory actions, and global economic conditions.\n\nLong-Term Ethereum Price Outlook\n\nLooking beyond the short-term price fluctuations, the long-term outlook for Ethereum to recover remains promising. As one of the most established cryptocurrencies with a robust ecosystem, Ethereum is well-positioned to continue its growth and innovation.\n\nGrowing dApp use, DeFi growth, and Ethereum’s industry integration boost its long-term potential.\n\nEthereum’s smart contracts and scalability enhancements attract developers and users alike.\n\nEthereum’s solid foundation and blockchain’s rising appeal hint at a resilient and thriving future despite future challenges.\n\nSource: Pixabay\n\nConclusion: The Future of Ethereum\n\nThis article explores Ethereum’s chance to recover and its future, hinging on PoS transition, price predictions, and market sentiment.\n\nWhile Ethereum faces challenges and uncertainties, it also presents significant opportunities for investors and enthusiasts.\n\nThe shift to a PoS blockchain with Ethereum 2.0 has the potential to address scalability issues, increase security, and reduce energy consumption, making the network more efficient and sustainable.\n\nPrice forecasts and technical analysis suggest that Ethereum could experience significant growth in the coming years, driven by increased adoption, staking rewards, and market sentiment.\n\nHowever, it’s important to cautiously approach investing in Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe crypto market is highly volatile, and prices can fluctuate rapidly. Regulatory actions and technological risks should also be considered. Conduct thorough research, seek advice from financial professionals, and only invest what you can afford to lose.\n\nIn conclusion, while the future of Ethereum is not without challenges, its strong fundamentals, growing ecosystem, and innovation potential make it an exciting cryptocurrency to watch.\n\nAs the crypto market evolves, Ethereum’s recovery and growth potential will be shaped by technological advancements, market dynamics, and investor sentiment.'}].

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, we see conflicting signals with a buy signal from the short-long moving average but a sell signal from the MACD. The Bollinger Bands signal suggests a hold position. The market trend appears to be mixed, indicating uncertainty in the short term.

Considering the news analyst report, there are several key points to consider, such as the impact of Ethereum staking dynamics, decentralization concerns, compliance issues, revenue growth, and price forecasts. These factors could potentially influence market sentiment and demand for ETH.

Taking into account the mixed signals from the on-chain analysis and the potential impact of the news factors, I believe the market trend for ETH is uncertain but leaning towards a bearish sentiment due to the conflicting signals and potential regulatory concerns.

Given the current market trend, I would suggest selling a portion of ETH to mitigate potential downside risk. Therefore, my action would be to sell 0.4 (40%) of ETH.

Show More\n\nWhat is the Difference Between WETH and ETH?\n\nEther (ETH) is the native token of the Ethereum blockchain. If you are looking to use the ERC-20 standard of ETH, you may need to turn your ETH into WETH. This guide shows you how to buy Wrapped Ethereum (WETH).\n\nWhat is WETH?\n\nWrapped Ethereum (WETH) is an ERC-20 token pegged to Ethereum’s native token ETH. The ERC-20 token standard allows for the capability of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. A smart contract is a computer program that enforces the terms of an agreement. ERC-20 tokens allow for all kinds of things. Since both are pegged to Ethereum, ETH and WETH have the same price. If you want to access a service paid for using an ERC-20 token, you need to wrap your ETH. Some platforms automatically swap it for you as a first step in the transaction, but in other cases, you need to do it yourself. WETH is the tradable version of ETH and is frequently used on decentralized finance (DeFi) and decentralized application (dApp) platforms.\n\nBrief History of WETH\n\nWETH launched in 2017 and was pegged to ETH. ETH is the second largest cryptocurrency in the world and may even contest Bitcoin for the top spot. You can check out ETH’s price history here.\n\nETH is unable to be exchanged directly with ERC-20 tokens that live on the Ethereum blockchain. To exchange ETH for these tokens you first wrap it, creating WETH. One of the main reasons WETH was created in the first place was to use dApps in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nHow to Buy WETH\n\nBefore you learn how to buy WETH, you need ETH.\n\nStep 1: Open an Online Account.\n\nStep 1: Open an Online Account\n\nThe first step in getting WETH is to open an account on a crypto exchange to purchase ETH. To open an account, you’ll need to provide things such as:\n\nYour full legal name\n\nYour address\n\nYour phone number and email address\n\nA government-issued ID (includes driver’s license, passport or military ID)\n\nA password of your choice\n\nDepending on the exchange, you may need to provide more personal info. It's a good idea to have the information ready to go when opening an account. Most exchanges allow you to open an account in as little as a few minutes; however, some exchanges may take longer to verify your ID. Once your identity has been verified, you’re ready to begin investing.\n\nPurchase ETH. Being the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, many popular crypto trading platforms support Ethereum. Some of your best options include eToro, Webull and Robinhood Markets Inc. (NASDAQ: HOOD).\n\nStep 2: Buy or Download a Wallet (Optional).\n\nTo obtain WETH, you’ll need a wallet that supports the token. You can choose from two main types of crypto wallets: hardware wallets and software wallets. Software wallets are often easier and faster to use but are less secure than their hardware counterparts. Some of the best options for software wallets on the market right now are the Exodus wallet and MetaMask. Then, you will be able to obtain WETH by connecting your wallet to a decentralized exchange (DEX) like Uniswap and swapping your ETH for WETH in a liquidity pool.\n\nBest Hardware Wallet: Ledger\n\nLedger is one of the top hardware wallets on the market. It is easy to use and supports sending and receiving WETH. Once you have purchased a Ledger hardware wallet, you download its software onto your computer and create an account.\n\nYou’ll be assigned a wallet address (typically a long string of letters and numbers), and then you can send and receive thousands of cryptocurrencies through the wallet. Hardware wallets offer an extra level of security as opposed to software wallets, but they cost money, while software wallets are typically free. Additionally, Ledger provides the convenience of connecting to software wallets such as MetaMask to check your account balance while maintaining absolute custody of your wallet address.\n\nBest Software Wallet: MetaMask\n\nBest For: Ethereum wallet securely through MetaMask's website Get Started with MetaMask\n\nMetaMask is a free and widely used online wallet for Ethereum. It’s available as an extension on Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Brave and Microsoft Edge browsers. It also has an app on iOS and Android phones.\n\nAllows you to swap ETH for WETH directly in the wallet.\n\nClick the wallet extension icon in upper right-hand of Google Chrome.\n\nClick Swap.\n\nSwap as much ETH for WETH as you'd like to.\n\nStep 3: Swap for WETH Through a DEX\n\nLaunch Uniswap.\n\nConnect your wallet with the “Connect Wallet” button in the upper right-hand corner.\n\nSelect ETH on the top and WETH on the bottom as shown below.\n\nEnter the desired amount of ETH you'd like to swap for WETH.\n\nPress Wrap, complete the transaction in the wallet window and in a few seconds your WETH should show up in your wallet\n\nNote: If you don't see your WETH after the swap goes through, you may need to add the token to MetaMask (or whichever wallet you are using). To do this all you need to do is scroll down in the Assets tab in the MetaMask window and click import tokens. You can either search for WETH there or copy and paste the token address from a site like CoinMarketCap.\n\nTrade, Sell or Convert Your ETH to WETH\n\nDeciding on whether to trade, sell or convert your crypto is based on your personal goals and preferences. If you are looking to take profits on WETH, a common strategy is to sell a portion of your WETH on the way up and keep a portion to hold long term to eliminate some risk. Most exchanges allow you to sell your crypto for cash or trade it for USDC, a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar. If you are trying to accumulate more crypto long term, taking profits when crypto prices go up could allow you to accumulate more when prices go back down.\n\nBy following the steps above, you can convert your ETH to WETH using Uniswap. If you are looking to place an offer on OpenSea, you will need to convert your ETH to WETH. If you want to sell your WETH for cash, it's easiest to first convert it back to ETH.\n\nCurrent Crypto Prices\n\nSince reaching all-time highs in November 2021, crypto prices have dropped. In November 2021, Bitcoin saw its all-time high of over $69,000, and Ethereum saw its all-time high of over $4,800. However, in June of 2022, Bitcoin and Ethereum hit multi-year lows. Bitcoin went to $17,601.58, and Ethereum reached $883.15. In 2023, both tokens have been able to rally, putting Bitcoin around $25,000 and Ethereum around $1,700.

Show More\n\nWhat is the Difference Between WETH and ETH?\n\nEther (ETH) is the native token of the Ethereum blockchain. If you are looking to use the ERC-20 standard of ETH, you may need to turn your ETH into WETH. This guide shows you how to buy Wrapped Ethereum (WETH).\n\nWhat is WETH?\n\nWrapped Ethereum (WETH) is an ERC-20 token pegged to Ethereum’s native token ETH. The ERC-20 token standard allows for the capability of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. A smart contract is a computer program that enforces the terms of an agreement. ERC-20 tokens allow for all kinds of things. Since both are pegged to Ethereum, ETH and WETH have the same price. If you want to access a service paid for using an ERC-20 token, you need to wrap your ETH. Some platforms automatically swap it for you as a first step in the transaction, but in other cases, you need to do it yourself. WETH is the tradable version of ETH and is frequently used on decentralized finance (DeFi) and decentralized application (dApp) platforms.\n\nBrief History of WETH\n\nWETH launched in 2017 and was pegged to ETH. ETH is the second largest cryptocurrency in the world and may even contest Bitcoin for the top spot. You can check out ETH’s price history here.\n\nETH is unable to be exchanged directly with ERC-20 tokens that live on the Ethereum blockchain. To exchange ETH for these tokens you first wrap it, creating WETH. One of the main reasons WETH was created in the first place was to use dApps in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nHow to Buy WETH\n\nBefore you learn how to buy WETH, you need ETH.\n\nStep 1: Open an Online Account.\n\nStep 1: Open an Online Account\n\nThe first step in getting WETH is to open an account on a crypto exchange to purchase ETH. To open an account, you’ll need to provide things such as:\n\nYour full legal name\n\nYour address\n\nYour phone number and email address\n\nA government-issued ID (includes driver’s license, passport or military ID)\n\nA password of your choice\n\nDepending on the exchange, you may need to provide more personal info. It's a good idea to have the information ready to go when opening an account. Most exchanges allow you to open an account in as little as a few minutes; however, some exchanges may take longer to verify your ID. Once your identity has been verified, you’re ready to begin investing.\n\nPurchase ETH. Being the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, many popular crypto trading platforms support Ethereum. Some of your best options include eToro, Webull and Robinhood Markets Inc. (NASDAQ: HOOD).\n\nStep 2: Buy or Download a Wallet (Optional).\n\nTo obtain WETH, you’ll need a wallet that supports the token. You can choose from two main types of crypto wallets: hardware wallets and software wallets. Software wallets are often easier and faster to use but are less secure than their hardware counterparts. Some of the best options for software wallets on the market right now are the Exodus wallet and MetaMask. Then, you will be able to obtain WETH by connecting your wallet to a decentralized exchange (DEX) like Uniswap and swapping your ETH for WETH in a liquidity pool.\n\nBest Hardware Wallet: Ledger\n\nLedger is one of the top hardware wallets on the market. It is easy to use and supports sending and receiving WETH. Once you have purchased a Ledger hardware wallet, you download its software onto your computer and create an account.\n\nYou’ll be assigned a wallet address (typically a long string of letters and numbers), and then you can send and receive thousands of cryptocurrencies through the wallet. Hardware wallets offer an extra level of security as opposed to software wallets, but they cost money, while software wallets are typically free. Additionally, Ledger provides the convenience of connecting to software wallets such as MetaMask to check your account balance while maintaining absolute custody of your wallet address.\n\nBest Software Wallet: MetaMask\n\nBest For: Ethereum wallet securely through MetaMask's website Get Started with MetaMask\n\nMetaMask is a free and widely used online wallet for Ethereum. It’s available as an extension on Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Brave and Microsoft Edge browsers. It also has an app on iOS and Android phones.\n\nAllows you to swap ETH for WETH directly in the wallet.\n\nClick the wallet extension icon in upper right-hand of Google Chrome.\n\nClick Swap.\n\nSwap as much ETH for WETH as you'd like to.\n\nStep 3: Swap for WETH Through a DEX\n\nLaunch Uniswap.\n\nConnect your wallet with the “Connect Wallet” button in the upper right-hand corner.\n\nSelect ETH on the top and WETH on the bottom as shown below.\n\nEnter the desired amount of ETH you'd like to swap for WETH.\n\nPress Wrap, complete the transaction in the wallet window and in a few seconds your WETH should show up in your wallet\n\nNote: If you don't see your WETH after the swap goes through, you may need to add the token to MetaMask (or whichever wallet you are using). To do this all you need to do is scroll down in the Assets tab in the MetaMask window and click import tokens. You can either search for WETH there or copy and paste the token address from a site like CoinMarketCap.\n\nTrade, Sell or Convert Your ETH to WETH\n\nDeciding on whether to trade, sell or convert your crypto is based on your personal goals and preferences. If you are looking to take profits on WETH, a common strategy is to sell a portion of your WETH on the way up and keep a portion to hold long term to eliminate some risk. Most exchanges allow you to sell your crypto for cash or trade it for USDC, a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar. If you are trying to accumulate more crypto long term, taking profits when crypto prices go up could allow you to accumulate more when prices go back down.\n\nBy following the steps above, you can convert your ETH to WETH using Uniswap. If you are looking to place an offer on OpenSea, you will need to convert your ETH to WETH. If you want to sell your WETH for cash, it's easiest to first convert it back to ETH.\n\nCurrent Crypto Prices\n\nSince reaching all-time highs in November 2021, crypto prices have dropped. In November 2021, Bitcoin saw its all-time high of over $69,000, and Ethereum saw its all-time high of over $4,800. However, in June of 2022, Bitcoin and Ethereum hit multi-year lows. Bitcoin went to $17,601.58, and Ethereum reached $883.15. In 2023, both tokens have been able to rally, putting Bitcoin around $25,000 and Ethereum around $1,700. Crypto prices seem to be holding on macro levels.\n\nIs WETH a Good Investment?\n\nWETH can be a good investment if you are looking to have tradable ETH to do things like make bids on OpenSea. However, since it is pegged to the price of ETH, its price will follow suit. To read more about if ETH is a good investment please visit here.\n\nClaim Now Get up to $200 in rewards with Coinbase!

The idea is to repurpose ETH tokens staked on the Ethereum blockchain for double duty, using them to provide security for other applications.\n\nThis article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.\n\nEigenLayer has been in the news lately, as the restaking ecosystem starts to take shape. Some top Ethereum figures have also raised flags about the risks; Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin at one point cautioned that the new feature could ultimately pose systemic risks to the main blockchain’s stability.\n\nWe spoke with Kannan last week, where we asked him questions about EigenLayer and restaking. Some highlights include:\n\nOn Kannan’s response to Buterin’s concerns about staking: “Anything that restaking can do, already liquid staking can do.”\n\nOn Ethereum’s plan to slow the rate of new validators coming on line, via the EIP-7514 proposal: “This is a super important thing for Ethereum to be conservative and not have an overflow.”\n\nOn whether Ethereum will ever reach its maximum capacity for shared security: “There's absolutely a limit.”\n\nQ: I saw Vitalik’s blog post about overloading the consensus layer, and how restaking, in his view, could pose systemic risks to Ethereum. I'm curious to hear your take on his take?\n\nKannan: One of the things I think he wants to kind of lay out is that, “Hey don't externalize, and don't create something that, assuming that if the protocol goes wrong, Ethereum is going to fork around it.”\n\nI think that is a pretty reasonable position from Ethereum, that you build protocols and the protocols have to internalize social consensus rather than externalize it to Ethereum.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo I read it as to not overload Ethereum social consensus, which is used only for forking the chain. And don't assume that you can build a protocol that, and because you're too big to fail, Ethereum can fork around that. So that's how I read it.\n\nAnd I think it's a pretty obvious statement in our view. But I think it has to be said, somebody has to say it, so it's good that Vitalik went out and said it.\n\nBecause what we don't want is for calls to deploy code that is not properly audited, doesn't have internal security controls, and then the Ethereum community has to now work hard to figure out how to retrieve it.\n\nI think a lot of people after reading the article have been talking a lot about restaking risks.\n\nI want to make it super clear: anything that restaking can do, already liquid staking can do, so I view restaking as a lesser risk than liquid staking.\n\nQ: Can you expand on that?\n\nKannan: Basically, you can take a liquid staking token and then deposit it into complex DeFi protocols, or you could just deposit it into validating a new layer 2, or a new oracle or any of these things.\n\nSo anything that restaking can do, liquid staking can already do. Because you know, you have the LSD [short for liquid staking derivative] token, and you can do anything with it. And one particular thing you could do with that is, of course, go and validate another network.\n\nSo I view restaking as just one particular use case of liquid staking, but actually reducing the risk of that one particular use case.\n\nQ: Why do you think restaking is having a moment in the news?\n\nKannan: I don't know. I'm glad people are talking about it. Of course, anything that adds new rewards to stakers is something interesting.\n\nI said anything that could be done with EigenLayer could be done with LSTs, but people didn't know what to do with these LSTs.\n\nThey were doing exactly the same thing that people are doing with ether, which is lending, borrowing, the same set of DeFi parameters.\n\nI think one thing that EigenLayer did is by creating this new category, that validation, if I can borrow the Ethereum trust network to do new things: I can build a new layer 1, I can build a new like oracle network, I can build a new data availability system, I can build any system on top of the Ethereum trust network, so it internalizes all the innovation back into Ethereum, or aggregates all the innovation back into Ethereum, rather than each innovation requiring a whole new system.\n\nSo I think that narrative is quite attractive.\n\nQ: I was just reading the news about EIP-7514, which is a short term solution for solving the overcrowdedness of validators, by limiting entries of new validators. How does that affect an EigenLayer?\n\nKannan: I think mostly, it means the same thing for EigenLayer that it means for liquid staking protocols, that there is going to be a smaller rate at which new validators can enter.\n\nThere's a long entry queue right now, and people don't want to wait that long.\n\nAnd making it slower is going to just make the new growth of LSTs slower. But I understand fully that this is a super important thing for Ethereum to be conservative and not have an overflow of validators that may not be able to be handled by the consensus layer.\n\nBut in the long term, if the total staking of Ethereum cannot grow, one of the things that happens is the total yield or the return that stakers are getting is bounded by the Ethereum staking, whereas in the presence of restaking there is a possibility for them to get some of these additional rewards. Other than that, it's pretty similar.\n\nQ: You were making the point that EigenDA is just like in-house AVS (actively validated service) – explain what it is:\n\nKannan: What we decided is, in order to keep this system of shared security, in order to keep EigenLayer as decentralized as possible, we want to make sure that there is a highly scalable data system at its backbone. And that's what EigenDA is, it's a highly scalable data availability system, built on the same ideas that underpin the Ethereum roadmap, particularly what is called danksharding.\n\nOur view is that building an Ethereum-adjacent data availability layer requires first principles thinking, whereas Celestia and Avail are built to be chains by themselves.\n\nIf you're building a data availability system adjacent to Ethereum, you'd want Ethereum validators to participate. So that's just one part of the story. Of course, EigenLayer enables that.\n\nBut then you go beyond that, and then you see, “Oh, it's not just you want to get the Ethereum nodes to participate.”\n\nEthereum already has consensus built in, and Ethereum gives you the ordering of the various transactions. So you should build the data availability system, which doesn't need its own ordering.\n\nWhereas all the existing other protocols like Celestia and Avail, are basically chains that have to do their own ordering; we built a system which doesn't have internal ordering; all ordering is done on Ethereum.\n\nQ: Liquid restaking tokens - once your liquid staking tokens are locked on EigenLayer, they become illiquid?\n\nKannan: That’s correct, the problem that the liquid restaking tokens are trying to solve is, can I just have a restaked position, and then still keep it liquid. So you can take that receipt token of liquid restaking and then transfer it.\n\nWe are not building this kind of liquid restaking but other people are building liquid restaking on top of them.\n\nQ: I think your comment was, you want to use the Ethereum shared security for as many things as possible. I'm curious, now that there's also people building on the back of what y'all are doing, is there a natural limit to how much that you know, Ethereum can support?\n\nKannan: This is a similar kind of question that one could ask already at the application layer of Ethereum: How many applications on Ethereum are smart contracts and how many smart contracts can be built on top of Ethereum?\n\nSo it's the same thing with EigenLayer because people staking and running new applications, but now they do it much more flexibly and programmably with these aliases on top of EigenLayer, all contribute back to Ethereum. Their ETH staking increases rewards, ETH itself potentially increases in value because of all these additional use cases.\n\nSo over time, this can start to accommodate more and more.\n\nBut there's absolutely a limit."}].

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, we can see that the technical indicators are suggesting a "sell" trend for ETH. The market trend is bearish, indicating a potential downward movement in the price of ETH in the near future. On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights positive developments and upgrades in the Ethereum ecosystem, which could lead to increased interest and potentially drive up the price of ETH.

Considering both reports, it seems that there is a divergence in the market sentiment. While the technical indicators point towards a bearish trend, the positive news developments could potentially counteract this and lead to a bullish market trend for Ethereum.

Given the conflicting information, I would lean towards a more conservative approach and suggest a slight sell action to align with the bearish trend indicated by the technical indicators. However, considering the positive news developments, I would recommend a smaller sell action to reflect the potential for growth in the near future.

You are an experienced ETH cryptocurrency trader and you are trying to maximize your overall profit by trading ETH. In each day, you will make an action to buy or sell ETH. You will start with 1 million dollars, half in cash and half in ETH. You are assisted by a few analysts below and need to decide the final action.

ON-CHAIN ANALYST REPORT: Based on the recent information provided, we can see that the open price of ETH has been fluctuating between 1580.48 and 1667.99. The number of transactions, unique addresses, and value transferred have been increasing over time, indicating a growing interest and activity in the ETH market.

The average gas price has also been fluctuating, with a peak at 19272125610.0, which could indicate increased network congestion at that time. The total gas used has remained relatively stable, suggesting that the network is able to handle the increased activity efficiently.

The successful transactions have been consistently high, indicating a healthy market with a high level of participation. However, the short-long moving average signal has recently turned to sell, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend. The MACD signal is also sell, further supporting a bearish outlook.

Overall, based on the information provided, it seems that the market trend for ETH is currently bearish in the short term. Traders and investors should monitor the market closely for any potential changes in the trend.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by the on-chain and news analysts, it is clear that the short-term market trend for ETH is bearish. The on-chain data indicates a potential short-term bearish trend with the short-long moving average and MACD signals both indicating a sell. Additionally, the news analysis suggests that Ethereum is showing strength compared to Bitcoin, but the overall market trend for Ethereum seems more positive compared to Bitcoin.

Considering the bearish trend for ETH in the short term, I would recommend selling a portion of ETH to maximize profit. Given the confidence in the bearish trend, I would suggest selling 0.7 (sell 70% ETH) to take advantage of the potential downward movement in the market.

It brings forth an ecosystem thriving with applications and developments, capturing the attention of millions of users and leading brands.\n\nBitwise CEO Hunter Horsley highlighted Ethereum’s dynamic growth and the momentum it’s gaining and said the ETFs are intended to be a gateway for investors to participate in Ethereum’s expanding landscape through regulated avenues that inspire confidence.\n\nBroader landscape\n\nThe commencement of trading for Bitwise’s ETFs is part of a larger trend, with numerous companies, including Invesco and Valkyrie, exploring Ethereum ETF offerings while awaiting approval for spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThe decisions by the U.S. SEC on these applications are highly anticipated, with outcomes potentially being influenced by related developments such as the Grayscale lawsuit.\n\nThe crypto community is keenly observing what the SEC does, as approval decisions by the watchdog are poised to shape the trajectory of crypto investments in the U.S. for years to come.\n\nNotably, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart revealed that nine Ethereum Futures ETFs, including Bitwise’s, are set to receive expedited approval from the SEC for their launch on Monday, October 2, 2023.'}, {'id': 9, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vZGVjcnlwdC5jby8xOTk2MzUvZXRoZXJldW0tc3VwcGx5LWlzLXN0YXJ0aW5nLXRvLWdyb3ctYWdhaW4tYXMtZ2FzLXByaWNlcy1wbHVtbWV00gFfaHR0cHM6Ly9kZWNyeXB0LmNvLzE5OTYzNS9ldGhlcmV1bS1zdXBwbHktaXMtc3RhcnRpbmctdG8tZ3Jvdy1hZ2Fpbi1hcy1nYXMtcHJpY2VzLXBsdW1tZXQ_YW1wPTE?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Sat, 30 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Ethereum Supply Is Starting to Grow Again as Gas Prices Plummet - Decrypt', 'content': "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nSupply dynamics in Ethereum are constantly being upended amid this year's dizzying drop in DeFi, NFT sales, and meme coin trading.\n\nDepending on which time frame you are looking at, Ethereum can be deflationary or inflationary: on a seven-day model, Ethereum becomes more scarce, whereas on a yearly framework, it issues more than it burns.\n\nWhat’s going on with the network’s supply dynamics, why are transaction fees prices dropping, and how does it look for the future of Ethereum?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBack in August 2021, Ethereum implemented EIP-1559, which introduced a fee-burning mechanism. Since then, the supply has had a direct connection to gas prices. Higher gas prices mean more ETH getting burned and vice versa.\n\nThis set the table for last year’s merge. The transition from proof-of-work to proof of stake ended up reducing the issuance of ETH by 90%, leading many to claim that the network was now “ultrasound money.”\n\nBut that label has been put to the test amid dwindling gas prices and lesser transactional volume.\n\nTransaction fees stand at around $0.28 for sending ETH across the protocol. According to Etherscan data, a trade on Uniswap currently costs $2.76—a far cry from its $4.17 price in early September and a level not seen since the collapse of FTX in late 2022.\n\nAmberdata’s head of research, Chris Martin, told Decrypt that the reasons for declining gas prices are three-fold.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n“The Ethereum Foundation's focus on scaling with Ethereum 2.0 has had enormous benefits for the network, making it cheaper and more secure,” was his first order of things. Martin then referred to the growth of Layer-2s, elucidating how the increase in these scaling solutions has “taken a lot of the volume off the mainchain.”\n\nIn third place, said Martin, is the lack of narrative–something the broader crypto market has been grappling with as of late. “The current market has left many waiting for the next big thing,” he explained, adding that “there are opportunities, only these are less than in 2021.”\n\nJulio Barragan, the director of education at Blocknative—a Web3 tool that lets users price, preview and monitor transactions—thinks the gas situation is only momentary. He told Decrypt that “as soon as volume picks back up, so will competition for block space, and the network will automatically adjust gas prices accordingly.”\n\nWhat’s to come, then? For Barragan, it’s a nebulous future.\n\n“Predicting the future of Ethereum gas prices is further complicated by the gradual acceptance of ERC-4337,” he told Decrypt. Also known as account abstraction, the upgrade will look to make crypto wallets as easy to use as email.\n\nBarragan added that it’s unclear what the long-term impact account abstraction and further adoption of layer-2’s will have on gas prices ”and therefore supply.”\n\nHe concluded that lower fees can bring more users and activity on-chain, but “more users ultimately lead to more congestion.”"}, {'id': 5, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIzLzA5LzMwL2xvb2tpbmctZm9yLXRoZS1uZXh0LWV0aGVyZXVtLTItY3J5cHRvY3VycmVuY2llcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Sat, 30 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Looking for the Next Ethereum? 2 Cryptocurrencies to Buy Now - The Motley Fool', 'content': 'Since its launch in July 2015, Ethereum (ETH -0.21%) has been one of the best financial assets any investor could have owned, as the token\'s price has skyrocketed 53,000% over its roughly eight-year history (as of Sept. 27). The road hasn\'t been a smooth one, as the past couple years have shown, but it\'s hard to deny the rapid rise of this digital asset.\n\nWhile Ethereum might be on your radar as a potential buying opportunity today, especially since it\'s currently 67% below its peak price, it\'s worthwhile to consider two smaller cryptocurrencies to invest in.\n\nThe world\'s decentralized computer\n\nWhat makes Ethereum different from Bitcoin, the world\'s oldest and most valuable cryptocurrency network, is that it was the first blockchain to introduce smart contracts. These are software programs that automatically run when the stakeholders satisfy their ends of a particular agreement. Smart contracts are an innovative feature that underpin the promise that cryptocurrency could disrupt numerous industries by eliminating the need for middlemen.\n\nThis adds tremendous functionality to the Ethereum network, leading some to call it the world\'s biggest decentralized computing platform. In fact, Ethereum has become the undisputed leader in terms of decentralized applications, including for things like non-fungible tokens and decentralized finance protocols.\n\nEthereum\'s development pipeline is also indicative of the sheer number of computer programmers working on its advancement. An upgrade called the Merge transitioned the network to a proof-of-stake consensus system, which is more energy-efficient and an update that could set the blockchain up for better scalability. There are many more phases left on the horizon.\n\nIt might seem like a no-brainer decision to buy this crypto right now, but investors might want to look at these so-called "Ethereum killers."\n\nThe case for Cardano\n\nAs the seventh-most-valuable cryptocurrency, Cardano (ADA 6.69%) immediately comes to mind as a formidable rival to Ethereum\'s dominance. Cardano was launched in 2017 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, and its token has climbed in value by 874% during that time.\n\nWhat makes Cardano unique is not that it also enables the implementation of smart contracts or that it runs a PoS consensus mechanism, but it\'s the blockchain\'s unique development approach. While many cryptos adopt the Silicon Valley mindset of "go fast and break things," Cardano instead emphasizes being cautious and thoughtful when introducing changes to the network.\n\nThe current stage of development is known as Basho, which focuses on things like scaling and interoperability. This is the fourth of five parts, with the last stage focused on governance. Cardano relies on top researchers, computer scientists, and other academics from leading universities across the globe to help push it forward.\n\nCardano already has proven its ability to launch real-world enterprise-level solutions using its innovations. For example, it can better handle KYC/AML checks in the financial services industry. And it can help track supply chains in the agricultural sector.\n\nAs long as Cardano continues making progress on improving the network with new tech features, while also boosting utility in various industry settings, there\'s certainly the potential for its token to rise in value.\n\nThe case for Solana\n\nSolana (SOL 14.20%) was launched in 2020 by ex-Qualcomm engineer Anatoly Yakovenko. Its token has skyrocketed 1,890% since its founding, a wonderful gain. Currently, Solana carries a market cap of $7.8 billion, making it the ninth-most-valuable cryptocurrency in the world.\n\nLike Ethereum and Cardano, Solana also possesses functionality for smart contracts. And in addition to operating a PoS system, this blockchain also runs something known as proof-of-history (PoH). PoH basically eliminates the need to add timestamps to the data included in blocks, which can speed up transaction throughout. Solana is actually known as being the fastest crypto network, with a theoretical capacity to process 50,000 transactions per second (TPS). For comparison\'s sake, Ethereum can only handle less than 15 TPS right now.\n\nNaturally, this makes Solana a prime candidate to disrupt one of the most lucrative areas within the overall financial services space, and that\'s payments. In early 2022, Solana Pay was introduced. This innovative service allows a merchant and consumer to transact with each other directly, with instant settlement and virtually no fees. For businesses that run on thin margins, getting rid of the need to process costly credit card payments can lead to savings that flow straight to the bottom line.\n\nOf course, this puts Solana in direct competition with the likes of Visa and Mastercard. Even so, it\'s easy to get excited about the potential.'}]. Analyze the news and estimate the market trend accordingly.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

Thanks to this, the term “Ethereum killer” gained traction as a way to describe the many competitive layers aiming for the top spot by attempting to overthrow the network’s dominance.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nFast-forward to the present, and Ethereum is still the most dominant PoS blockchain in some key areas. Layer Blockchains like Solana [SOL] and Avalanche [AVAX] have thus failed to dethrone Ethereum.\n\nThe latter’s secret weapon is arguably its Layer-2 networks, which have allowed it to overcome the previously-existing scalability limitations.\n\nA recent Grayscale analysis revealed that Optimism [OP], Base, and Arbitrum [ARB], three Ethereum Layer-2s, have surpassed Avalanche and Solana in TVL.\n\nThis is because Ethereum is already miles ahead of its competition in terms of adoption and the dApps that operate on its network.\n\n?Following a period of strong growth, top performing Layer 2s #Arbitrum, #Optimism and #BASE are surpassing Ethereum competitor Layer 1s like Solana and Avalanche in terms of total value locked (TVL) as of 9/25.\n\nHere’s why that’s important. (1/6) pic.twitter.com/DpTJyLQ5Nj — Grayscale (@Grayscale) September 29, 2023\n\nLayer-2 networks successfully assist Ethereum in bypassing its previous limitations. The L2s facilitate transaction processing, allowing the dApps to operate efficiently and cost effectively. There is one key component that has allowed Layer-2 networks to surpass some Layer-1 blockchains.\n\nWhile the latter have to build up their own dApps and clientele, Layer-2s benefit from Ethereum’s already existing dApps, of which there are plenty. On top of that, the same Layer-2s are also able to attract dApps on their own.\n\nLayer 2 blockchains process transactions from dApps and then “batch” them together before sending a compressed version back to the main network for settlement, acting as a side road or even a dedicated bus lane augmenting a major highway. (2/6) — Grayscale (@Grayscale) September 29, 2023\n\nCan Ethereum Layer-2s secure market cap dominance?\n\nThese observations confirmed that Ethereum was still able to command robust utility and demand at press time. But while its Layer-2 networks enjoyed robust TVL growth, they were still lagging behind Solana and Avalanche in terms of market cap.\n\nAccording to the latest data, Solana’s market cap was slightly over $8.8 billion, while Avalanche had a market cap of $3.27 billion at the time of writing. The closest of the aforementioned Layer-1s was Arbitrum at $1.17 billion, followed by Optimism at $1.06 billion.\n\nBase had the lowest market cap among them, at $530 million.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nIt makes sense that the Layer-2s would have lower market caps, considering that their counterparts are Layer-1 networks that have been around for longer. Nevertheless, the Layer-2 market caps highlighted their rapid growth.\n\nJudging by these factors, it is possible that they will get closer to Solana and Avalanche. These numbers also highlight the fact that it is now more difficult to beat Ethereum than ever before.'}]. Analyze the news and estimate the market trend accordingly.

You are an experienced ETH cryptocurrency trader and you are trying to maximize your overall profit by trading ETH. In each day, you will make an action to buy or sell ETH. You will start with 1 million dollars, half in cash and half in ETH. You are assisted by a few analysts below and need to decide the final action.

ON-CHAIN ANALYST REPORT: Based on the recent information provided, we can see that the open price of ETH has been increasing over time, reaching a peak at 1733.82. The number of transactions and unique addresses have also been increasing, indicating growing interest and adoption of ETH. 

The value transferred has also been increasing, reaching a peak at 1.11956e+24, which suggests a higher level of activity on the network. The average gas price has been fluctuating but generally decreasing, which is a positive sign for users as it reduces transaction costs.

However, the short-long moving average signal, MACD signal, and Bollinger Bands signal are all indicating a sell or hold position. This suggests that there may be some short-term downward pressure on the price of ETH.

Overall, based on the information provided, the market trend for ETH appears to be slightly bearish in the short term. It is important to continue monitoring the indicators and signals to make informed trading decisions.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, we can see that the market trend for ETH appears to be slightly bearish in the short term. The indicators such as short-long moving average signal, MACD signal, and Bollinger Bands signal are all pointing towards a sell or hold position. This suggests that there may be some short-term downward pressure on the price of ETH.

Additionally, the news analyst report highlights some factors that could contribute to this bearish trend, such as the outflow of funds from major exchanges like KuCoin and the discussion around protocol enhancements and ecosystem trade-offs by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin.

Considering the overall analysis, I predict that the market trend for ETH will continue to be bearish in the short term. Therefore, I recommend selling a portion of ETH to maximize profit in this scenario.

Action: 0.6 (sell 60% ETH)

So these are obviously the men and women that are writing all those checks to those private companies.

That is about, Julie, a quarter of the full year tally in each of 2021 and 2022.

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
Based on the news provided, it is evident that there is a significant development in the cryptocurrency market, particularly in the Ethereum (ETH) sector. The introduction of Ethereum futures ETFs by ProShares, VanEck, Bitwise, and Grayscale filing for approval to convert its Ethereum trust into a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund indicates a growing interest in Ethereum-based investment products.

The launch of these ETFs may attract more investors, including financial professionals, family offices, and registered investment advisors, to gain exposure to Ethereum and the broader crypto market. The availability of these investment vehicles could potentially lead to increased trading volume and liquidity in the Ethereum market.

Furthermore, the news also mentions the expansion of ETFs tied to cryptocurrencies, with a focus on Ethereum, which is currently the second most popular cryptocurrency after Bitcoin. The market trend for Ethereum futures ETFs appears to be positive, as evidenced by the interest from various financial institutions and the potential for increased demand from different types of investors.

Overall, the introduction of Ethereum futures ETFs and the growing interest in Ethereum-based investment products suggest a bullish market trend for Ethereum in the near term. Investors may continue to monitor the performance of these ETFs and the overall market sentiment towards Ethereum to make informed trading decisions.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, the market trend for ETH cryptocurrency is currently bearish. The short-long moving average signal, MACD signal, and Bollinger Bands signal are all indicating a sell signal. Additionally, the fluctuating number of transactions and unique addresses, along with the decreasing average gas price, further support the bearish trend.

However, the news analyst report highlights a significant development in the Ethereum market with the introduction of Ethereum futures ETFs and the growing interest in Ethereum-based investment products. This suggests a bullish market trend for Ethereum in the near term, as more investors are likely to enter the market due to the availability of these investment vehicles.

Considering both reports, it is evident that there is a conflicting view on the market trend for ETH. While the on-chain analysis points towards a bearish trend, the news analysis indicates a bullish trend. In this case, I would lean towards the news analyst report as the introduction of Ethereum futures ETFs could potentially drive up demand and liquidity in the market.

Therefore, I would recommend a conservative action of buying ETH with a -0.3 value, indicating a 30% cash investment. This action reflects a cautious approach while still taking advantage of the potential bullish trend suggested by the news analyst report

These six newly launched funds offered investors their first opportunity to invest in Ether-based exchange-traded products.\n\nHowever, the launch of these ETFs didn’t seem to generate significant investor interest, and the ETH spot price has declined by 6.77% since then. While these ETH futures ETFs were expected to fuel a substantial price increase, they instead had a negative impact on the price.\n\nNevertheless, ETH has been in an uptrend since September 11. So, was this decline just a minor setback with $2,000 in its sights, or is it an early indicator that it lacks the strength to sustain its upward trajectory?\n\nETH Futures ETF’s botch\n\nOn the debut day, the combined trading volumes of these ETFs reached $1.92 million. Notably, the ProShares Ether Strategy ETF had the highest trading volume at $878,560, according to data from LSEG .\n\nIn an informative X thread , Vetle Lunde, a Senior Analyst at K33Research, shared some statistics about the underwhelming launch day for futures-based ETH ETFs.\n\nHe focused on trading volumes and made comparisons with similar product launches, particularly BITI and BITO, which are ProShares Bitcoin ETF products.\n\nIn his initial chart, he highlighted that ProShares dominated the trading volume, accounting for the majority of the first-day trading volume, which totaled $1.96 million across EETH (Ether Strategy ETF) and BETE (Bitcoin & Ether Equal Weight Strategy ETF). VanEck’s EFUT, which launched slightly ahead of its competitors, followed suit.\n\nIn his following chart, Vetle Lunde compared the day-one volumes of ETH ETFs with ProShares’ Bitcoin Future ETF products. The initial volumes for the ETH ETFs were considerably lower than those of BITO ($1.01B) and BITI ($7.21M) at their respective launches. The ETH ETFs’ day-one volumes represented only 0.19% of BITO’s launch volume and 27% of BITI’s launch volume.\n\nIn summary, he acknowledged the differences in market conditions during the BITO and BITI launches but still characterized the launch of ETH ETFs as uneventful.\n\nETH Price Analysis\n\nIn our previous analysis of ETH, we discussed the macro view, highlighting two potential scenarios. One possibility was that the price had initiated a new uptrend by breaking out from the descending resistance level.\n\nThe alternative scenario considered the increase from September 11 as a corrective move, suggesting that a new downturn might commence as the price faced rejection at the $1,760 resistance level.\n\nToday, we witnessed a 6.7% decline, measuring from yesterday’s high to today’s lowest point of $1,641. To support a potential move towards $2,000, the price needs to form a complete five-wave pattern starting from September 11.\n\nDespite briefly achieving a higher high yesterday, it faced a sharp rejection and is currently testing the September 18 high, which is considered to be the first wave of this pattern.\n\nCurrent Pattern May Be Invalid\n\nAccording to the Elliott Wave theory, it appears that the current pattern may be invalid. First, the assumed wave 3 fell slightly short of its optimum length, but it is still somewhat longer than wave 1, which adheres to Elliott Wave rules.\n\nWave 4 is typically a consolidative correction, often observed as a sideways movement and should not overlap with wave 2 territory. While it did produce a minor wick on the 4-hour chart, the candle close remained above wave 2. However, given that all three rules are currently stretched, it increasingly resembles a corrective move from September 11.\n\nThis could suggest that another downward trend has begun, with the price of ETH potentially heading below its September 11 low and below $1,500. The key determinant of the future outlook is how the price behaves around the $1,660 level. If it manages to stay above and starts moving upward, it could signal the start of an impulse wave.\n\nOn the other hand, if the descending move continues, it would indicate that sellers have regained control, potentially leading to a lower low.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nPlease note that the contents of this article are not financial or investing advice.

This was a pale shadow of the $1bn of assets that the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) garnered on its first two days of trading in October 2021 when it became the first US ETF trading in futures contracts linked to bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency.\n\n“The ether futures ETFs opened to a rather tame start on Monday.

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
Based on the news articles provided, it is evident that there is a significant focus on the launch of Ethereum ETFs and the potential impact on the cryptocurrency market. The news highlights the introduction of Ethereum-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, with mixed reactions and modest investor interest.

Key points to consider:
1. The launch of Ethereum ETFs did not generate significant investor interest, with combined trading volume being relatively low compared to Bitcoin ETF launches.
2. The price of Ether has experienced a decline following the ETF launches, indicating a lack of immediate positive impact.
3. The market sentiment towards cryptocurrencies, particularly Ethereum, seems to be weak, as reflected in the lacklustre response to the ETFs.
4. Despite the underwhelming debut, there is anticipation for potential growth in the future if retail investors return to the crypto market and more regulated products become available.
5. The SEC's stance on crypto ETFs, particularly spot Bitcoin ETFs, remains a significant factor influencing market dynamics.

Overall, the news suggests a cautious and somewhat bearish sentiment towards Ethereum and the broader cryptocurrency market in the short term. The lack of significant interest in the Ethereum ETFs and the price decline post-launch may indicate a period of consolidation or uncertainty in the market. Investors should

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by the on-chain and news analysts, the market trend for ETH cryptocurrency appears to be bearish in the short term. The on-chain data indicates a downward trend in open prices, decreasing number of transactions and unique addresses, and a decrease in successful transactions. The technical indicators also support a sell or hold position.

The news analyst report highlights the lack of significant investor interest in Ethereum ETFs, the price decline post-launch, and a weak market sentiment towards cryptocurrencies, particularly Ethereum. This suggests a cautious and somewhat bearish sentiment in the market.

Considering both reports, it is clear that the overall market trend for ETH is bearish and downwards. Therefore, I would recommend selling ETH with a positive value to maximize profit in this scenario.

This has been an ongoing debate as the network evolves.\n\nIn the early days, Buterin explains, Ethereum strove to keep its base layer as simple and minimalist as possible. This aligned with the Unix philosophy of creating uncomplicated, flexible software. The goal was for Ethereum to provide a solid foundation for decentralized applications, with most functionality implemented through smart contracts built on top.\n\nOver time, however, some have questioned whether more features should be directly enshrined in the core protocol. But what does “enshrining” mean? Buterin defines it as making something intrinsic to the official Ethereum specification that client developers must implement. The alternative, “de-enshrining,” means removing a feature from the base layer and pushing it out to be handled by smart contracts instead.\n\nPros and Cons of Enshrining Features\n\nButerin analyzes the pros and cons of enshrining several potential features. Enshrining can provide efficiency gains, more robust security, and censorship resistance. But it also risks making transactions more expensive, over-complicating governance, and reducing flexibility to meet unanticipated user needs down the road.\n\nButerin uses account abstraction as a case study to analyze this debate. Earlier proposals like EIP-86 tried to make transactions just simple VM calls, minimizing protocol complexity but increasing miner responsibilities. More recent proposals like ERC-4337 still start outside the protocol but may later enshrine components for efficiency and security.\n\nButerin explores enshrining several other potential features:\n\nZK-EVMs: Could improve efficiency and allow leveraging Ethereum’s governance to manage bugs, but challenges around supporting diverse ZK technologies remain.\n\nProposer-builder separation: Could reduce trust assumptions, but extra-protocol approaches already exist.\n\nPrivate mempools: No current encryption technology seems robust enough to enshrine, but valuable to build at the application layer.\n\nLiquid staking: Could reduce centralization risks and open more staking options, but challenges around governance remain.\n\nMore precompiles: This could improve efficiency, but risks over-complicating the protocol and low usage of past precompiles.\n\nEnshrining features can provide efficiency, security, and censorship resistance. But it can also over-extend the protocol’s governance and make it too rigid for unanticipated user needs.\n\nHow the community may be fractured on enshrining.\n\nWithin the Ethereum community, differing perspectives emerge on this question. Pragmatists may prioritize enshrining features that offer clear benefits to users today, even if complex to govern. In contrast, purists argue that radically minimizing the base layer preserves Ethereum’s vision as a decentralized application platform.\n\nBusinesses and institutions want features that support their use cases quickly enshrined, while decentralization advocates worry that risks unaccountable control by privileged groups. Developers desire expanded base layer functionality to ease app building, but security researchers warn enshrinement may lock in suboptimal technical choices.\n\nAs Buterin thoughtfully lays out, navigating these tradeoffs will only grow more complex as expectations of Ethereum diversify and scale. However, discussing core principles helps anchor the conversation as progress compels reassessment. The full blog post “Should Ethereum be okay with enshrining more things in the protocol?” is well worth the read.\n\nUltimately, Ethereum’s open “soft forking” process allows continued evolution based on emerging community priorities. Buterin’s post thus provides a valuable framework to weigh options and build alignment as Ethereum marches toward its ambitious vision.'}]. Analyze the news and estimate the market trend accordingly.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, the market trend for ETH is currently bearish. The indicators such as the decreasing open prices, declining successful transactions, and sell signals from various technical indicators all point towards a continued downward trend for ETH.

However, the news analyst report provides some positive sentiment towards ETH, especially with the potential introduction of an ETH ETF and the successful transition to proof-of-stake mining. These factors could potentially counterbalance the bearish market trend and lead to a more stable or even bullish outlook for ETH.

Considering the conflicting information from the two reports, I would lean towards a more conservative approach and suggest a slight sell action to align with the bearish market trend indicated by the on-chain analysis.

A Comprehensive Guide to Staking Rewards\n\nThe long-awaited Ethereum Merge has finally arrived, bringing exciting changes to the Ethereum network.\n\nOne of the key components of this upgrade is the transition from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.\n\nThis shift aims to enhance the scalability, security, and energy efficiency of the Ethereum blockchain. But what does this mean for Ethereum holders?\n\nShould you stake your Ethereum and earn staking rewards?\n\nThis comprehensive guide will explore the ins and outs of staking Ethereum, its benefits, risks, and various staking options.\n\nAlso read: Cloud and Crypto-Based Gaming: The End for Xbox and PlayStation?\n\nSource: CNBC\n\nUnderstanding Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Proof-of-Work (PoW)\n\nScalability Improvement\n\nUnder the previous Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, Ethereum had a limited transaction processing capacity of 15 transactions per second (TPS).\n\nThis pales compared to traditional financial payment services like Visa and MasterCard, which handle thousands of transactions per second.\n\nThe transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) will significantly improve Ethereum’s scalability, enabling it to process up to 100,000 TPS.\n\nThis increased capacity opens the doors to a broader range of projects and applications on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nAlso read: Crypto-Friendly Banks in Europe?\n\nEnergy Efficiency Enhancement\n\nAnother significant advantage of PoS over PoW is its energy efficiency. The Ethereum Foundation estimates that the Ethereum blockchain will consume approximately 99.9% less energy under the PoS mechanism.\n\nThis improvement is a crucial step towards addressing the environmental concerns associated with blockchain technology.\n\nAdditionally, there is a growing trend towards using renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, for mining (PoW) and staking (PoS), further reducing the carbon footprint of the Ethereum network.\n\nWhat Does It Mean to Stake Ethereum?\n\nStaking Ethereum on a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain involves actively participating in the validation of transactions.\n\nUnlike the mining process in Proof-of-Work (PoW), where miners compete based on computational power, PoS randomly selects validators based on the amount and duration of their staked Ether.\n\nValidators are responsible for creating new blocks and validating transactions, ensuring the integrity and security of the network. In return for their participation, validators receive staking rewards in proportion to their stake.\n\nPros and cons of staking Ethereum\n\nSource: MARCA\n\nPros\n\nPassive Investment\n\nStaking Ethereum offers a passive investment opportunity. Once you stake your Ether, there is no additional effort required on your part.\n\nYou can sit back and earn staking rewards, currently averaging an annual percentage rate (APR) of around 4%.\n\nFor example, with a minimum requirement of 32 ETH, you could earn approximately 1.3 ETH per year (based on the current price of one ETH being around $1,320).\n\nSense of Community\n\nIf you are passionate about Ethereum and believe in its value, staking allows you to actively contribute to the network’s health and security.\n\nBy validating transactions and participating in the consensus mechanism, you become an integral part of the Ethereum community.\n\nStaking can be a rewarding experience for those who want to support the network while earning a reasonable payout.\n\nComparatively Low Risk\n\nCompared to other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum is a relatively stable staking option. Its popularity, global use, and established security protocols give it an advantage over many other tokens in the market.\n\nWhile the crypto market may experience fluctuations, Ethereum has shown resilience and potential for long-term growth.\n\nStaking Ethereum allows you to earn rewards without exposing yourself to excessive risk.\n\nCons\n\nWithdrawal Restriction\n\nCurrently, staked Ethereum cannot be withdrawn until the release of Ethereum 2.0, which is expected to take 12 to 18 months, assuming no further delays.\n\nIf you have liquidity constraints or anticipate needing immediate access to your funds, staking may not be a suitable option for you.\n\nHowever, some centralized crypto exchanges offer staking options with more flexibility.\n\nFees\n\nStaking Ethereum may involve certain fees, depending on your chosen staking method. Centralized crypto exchanges and other staking services may charge fees for their services.\n\nThese fees can vary, so it’s essential to consider the trade-off between liquidity costs and staking fees when selecting a staking option.\n\nValidator Penalties\n\nWhile rare, validators can face penalties for being offline or validating incorrect transactions. Non-compliance with the network’s rules can result in a reduction or complete loss of staked Ether.\n\nValidators must consistently fulfill their responsibilities to avoid penalties that may affect their returns.\n\nCustodial Staking Risks\n\nWhen staking with a crypto exchange or a staking service, your Ethereum is held in a custodial wallet managed by the platform.\n\nWhile this offers convenience, it also exposes your staked Ether to certain risks, such as hacking, counterparty failure, or government actions.\n\nIt’s crucial to carefully evaluate the security measures and reputation of the platform before staking your Ethereum.\n\nHow to Stake Ethereum: Options and Considerations\n\nSource: Reuters\n\nSeveral options are available for staking Ethereum, each with its own set of considerations. Let’s explore the different staking methods and their associated benefits and risks.\n\nRunning a validator\n\nRunning a validator allows you to earn the highest rewards but requires a significant investment.\n\nIn most cases, you must stake a minimum of 32 ETH, which can amount to a substantial capital outlay.\n\nAdditionally, running a validator involves technical requirements, such as storing data and processing transactions on the blockchain.\n\nYou’ll need reliable hardware and a stable internet connection. While running a validator can be rewarding, it’s essential to assess the costs and technical challenges involved carefully.\n\nValidator Pools\n\nValidator pools offer an alternative to running a solo validator. In a validator pool, multiple participants pool their ETH to reach the minimum requirement of 32 ETH needed to run a validator.\n\nThis pooling of resources allows individuals with smaller amounts of ETH to participate in staking while enjoying many of the benefits of running a validator.\n\nValidator pools offer a lower barrier to entry. They can be a good option for those who want to stake their ETH without the significant financial commitment and technical requirements of running a solo validator.\n\nExchanges\n\nMany reputable crypto exchanges now offer staking services for Ethereum. Staking your ETH through an exchange offers convenience and accessibility.\n\nMost exchanges have low or no minimum staking requirements, making it possible for anyone with any capital to participate. After purchasing Ethereum, you can immediately start staking.\n\nHowever, it’s important to consider the security measures and fees imposed by the exchange.\n\nCustodial staking carries risks, such as platform hacks or unexpected regulatory actions. Conduct thorough research and choose a reputable exchange with robust security measures.\n\nLiquid Staking\n\nOne of the downsides of staking Ethereum is the inability to withdraw your staked ETH until Ethereum 2.0 is fully implemented.\n\nLiquid staking aims to address this limitation by offering tokens that represent your staked ETH and can be freely traded or used for other purposes.\n\nLiquid staking services Swap your ETH for a receipt token, such as stETH, which can be stored in a private crypto wallet. These receipt tokens maintain the staked ETH’s value while allowing you to utilize them for trading or other transactions.\n\nLiquid staking provides a solution for those who seek more flexibility and liquidity while still earning staking rewards.\n\nConclusion: Is staking Ethereum worth it?\n\nThe decision to stake your Ethereum ultimately depends on your investment goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Staking Ethereum offers the potential for passive income and allows you to actively contribute to the Ethereum network.\n\nHowever, it’s important to consider the risks involved, such as withdrawal restrictions, fees, and custodial-taking risks. Conduct thorough research, evaluate your financial situation, and consult with a financial advisor if necessary.\n\nWhile staking Ethereum can be a rewarding experience, it’s essential to approach it with a long-term perspective.\n\nThe crypto market is highly volatile, and short-term price fluctuations should not deter you from the potential benefits of staking.\n\nDetermine your investment objectives, assess the available staking options, and make an informed decision based on your circumstances.\n\nRemember, staking Ethereum involves locking up your ETH for a specified period, so it’s crucial to consider your liquidity needs and investment horizon.\n\nWith proper research and careful consideration, staking Ethereum can be a valuable addition to your investment strategy.\n\nDisclaimer: The views and opinions expressed in this article are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial advice.

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
Based on the news articles provided, it appears that Ethereum (ETH) is experiencing a decrease in gas fees, which could potentially indicate a bottoming out of the price. The average gas fee on Ethereum has dropped to $1.13, the lowest since November 2022. This decrease in fees could lead to a rise in utility and a potential price rebound for ETH.

Additionally, there has been a significant amount of ETH moved off of exchanges, with the non-exchange ETH supply reaching an all-time high. This could indicate a shift towards holding ETH rather than trading it, which may have implications for the price.

Furthermore, the transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism with the Ethereum Merge has the potential to enhance scalability, security, and energy efficiency of the Ethereum network. This transition could attract more investors and increase demand for ETH.

Overall, based on the news provided, the market trend for Ethereum (ETH) appears to be positive, with potential for a price rebound and increased utility due to lower gas fees and the transition to PoS consensus mechanism. Investors may consider monitoring these developments and potential opportunities for investment in ETH.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that the market trend for ETH is currently bearish. The signals from various indicators suggest a sell trend, and the overall market condition is not favorable for buying ETH at the moment.

However, the news analyst report presents a contrasting view, indicating a potential price rebound and increased utility for ETH due to lower gas fees and the transition to a PoS consensus mechanism. These positive developments could lead to a bullish trend in the market.

Considering both reports, I believe that the positive news about lower gas fees and the transition to PoS could outweigh the bearish signals from the on-chain analysis. Therefore, I am inclined to take a bullish stance and recommend buying ETH with a confidence level of 0.7.

Action: -0.7 (buy with 70% cash)

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

The entirety of this significant sum was then transferred to a new destination, identified as address 0x454. Remarkably, despite this sizable transaction, Sun chose not to liquidate his ETH holdings.\n\nIntriguingly, another address associated with HTX (Huobi) conducted a withdrawal of 42,999 ETH from Binance shortly after Sun’s ETH deposit into Binance, subsequently reallocating these assets to Lido for staking purposes.\n\nThis recent development marks another instance of Justin Sun’s impactful financial maneuvers. Two days prior, on October 5, Sun withdrew another substantial tranche of 19,000 ETH, totaling $32.8 million, from Lido Finance, subsequently depositing these funds into Binance.\n\nButerin’s Modest $1.64M Transfer Amid Crypto Cleaning\n\nBefore these actions, Sun had made a notable deposit of 5,000 ETH, equivalent to $9.2 million, into Huobi at an ETH price of $1,841 on August 12, 2023, just before the cryptocurrency market experienced a decline, resulting in ETH prices plummeting by more than 14%.\n\nIn contrast, Vitalik Buterin executed a comparatively modest transfer involving 1,000 ETH with a value of $1.64 million, directed towards address 0x556 on the same day. It’s worth highlighting that Buterin has consistently deposited a cumulative total of 2.6 thousand ETH, equivalent to $4.2 million, into Bitstamp and Paxos through this specific address since September 17.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nJustin Sun’s repeated withdrawals and deposits of significant amounts of ETH may be part of a strategic move to capitalize on market fluctuations.\n\nWith notable amounts of ETH being moved by both Sun and Buterin, there’s potential for these actions to affect Ethereum’s price dynamics.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nThese high-profile Ethereum transactions, involving influential figures like Justin Sun and Vitalik Buterin, underscore the dynamic nature of crypto.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, the market trend for ETH appears to be bearish. The open prices have been decreasing, on-chain activity is fluctuating, and the signals from various indicators suggest a sell or hold position. This indicates a negative market sentiment for ETH.

However, the news analyst report presents a different perspective. It suggests that there could be short-term rebound opportunities for Ethereum, Shiba Inu, and SushiSwap. The positive price movements and potential impact of the Ripple case developments on Ethereum's fate also provide some optimism for the market.

Considering both reports, it seems that there is a divergence in opinions regarding the market trend for ETH. While the on-chain data points towards a bearish trend, the news articles hint at short-term rebound opportunities and positive price movements for Ethereum and related altcoins.

Given the conflicting information, I would lean towards a more conservative approach and suggest a slight sell action to align with the bearish trend indicated by the on-chain analyst report. However, considering the potential short-term rebound opportunities mentioned in the news analyst report, I would recommend a smaller sell action.

The network participation rate is defined as the percentage of validators actively carrying out their duties on the network.\n\nDuring the meeting, the developers noted that the network participation rate was impressively high at 90%.\n\nHowever, Barnabas Busa, a DevOps Engineer for the Ethereum Foundation, mentioned that there were a few bugs with Devnet-9, especially in the execution layer. For context, the execution layer is the part of the network responsible for validating the state in the block header.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ethereum Foundation seemed to be working on fixing the bug as Geth developer Marius van der Wijden said that he was working on updating the block generator for the execution layer.\n\nNext, on the agenda was the Devnet-10, which is primarily to check the next maximum epoch churn limit in EIP-7514. EIP-7514 is designed to slow down the growth of the active validator set by tracking the soaring levels of staked ETH.\n\nDencun Testnet is set before November\n\nAt the time of writing, Santiment showed that the number of validator deposits was 1026. This was a notable decrease from the highs registered some weeks back. Therefore, the decline means that the objectives for Devnet-10 may already be set in motion.\n\nAs expected, Ethereum’s development activity has started to rise again. The Development Activity means the code committed by developers toward upgrades on a network. Over the past month, the metric tumbled. So, the slight rise implies that developers were starting to get back to polishing the network.\n\nRealistic or not, here’s ETH’s market cap in BTC terms\n\nAs per Devnet-10, Parithosh Jayanthi, another DevOps Engineer at the Foundation mentioned that it could launch as early as next week. The Berlin-based developer, however, mentioned that the timeframe could be subject to the quickness of solving outstanding bugs and issues. Busa also weighed in on the matter saying,\n\n“I would like to see all clients being able to participate and no more bugs on Devnet-9 before we proceed with the larger test.

Co. has shed light on how the Ethereum network decentralization has decreased significantly since the Merge event and Shanghai upgrade went live.\n\nThe rise of staking and centralization\n\nSince implementing the Merge and Shanghai upgrades, Ethereum has seen a substantial uptick in staking activities.\n\nStaking, a process where users lock up their crypto assets to support network operations, has its merits. According to a CoinDesk report citing JPMorgan research, this surge in staking activity comes at a cost: centralization.\n\nTraditionally, many in the crypto community prefer decentralized liquid staking platforms like Lido over their centralized counterparts.\n\nLido’s approach included adding more node operators to ensure no single entity controlled a significant portion of staked Ether (ETH). The aim was to address centralization concerns.\n\nHowever, centralization remains a risk. A concentration of liquidity providers or node operators could act as a single point of failure or even collude to create an oligopoly, potentially undermining the interests of the broader Ethereum community.\n\nEthereum, the world’s second-largest crypto, has become more centralized since the Merge and Shanghai upgrades. And JPMorgan is highlighting concerns over a decline in staking yields.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum’s Dencun upgrade: the next major step in scalability\n\nThe menace of rehypothecation\n\nAnother highlight from the report is rehypothecation. This complex term refers to the practice of reusing liquidity tokens as collateral across multiple decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols simultaneously.\n\nDeFi encompasses lending, trading, and other financial activities carried out on the blockchain.\n\nThe problem arises when a staked asset’s value sharply declines or faces a security breach or protocol error.\n\nIn such scenarios, rehypothecation could trigger a cascade of liquidations, jeopardizing the stability of the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nFurthermore, the report points out that the increase in staking has diminished the appeal of Ethereum from a yield perspective.\n\nThis shift is especially noticeable amid rising yields in traditional financial assets. The total staking yield has fallen from 7.3% before the Shanghai upgrade to approximately 5.5%.\n\nFrom a different perspective, the research data presented in December following Ethereum’s Merge upgrade in September 2022 reveals a significant reduction in the network’s energy consumption, akin to the energy usage of entire countries such as Ireland and Austria.\n\nThis decrease in power consumption positively contributes to environmental sustainability, aligning with broader global efforts to reduce the carbon footprint associated with blockchain technologies.\n\nEthereum’s core developers have introduced an Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP-7514) as part of the upcoming Dencun upgrade, scheduled for activation in October 2023.\n\nThis proposal aims to slow down the rate of Ether staking. The intention is to provide the Ethereum community with more time to devise a practical reward scheme for stakers on the network.\n\nETH price analysis\n\nAs of the time of writing, the price of Ethereum (ETH) stands at $1,629, representing a 3.4% decline on the weekly timeframe.\n\nEthereum’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently sitting at 40.4.\n\nThe price of ETH is struggling to maintain the $1600 level after facing rejection at the $1700 resistance level.

If Ethereum scales up globally, using full danksharding for storage might still fall short, with a mere 16 MB per slot accommodating around 64 million stakers.\n\nDrawing inspiration from models implemented by Rocketpool and Lido, Buterin suggests adopting a two-tiered staking system. In this structure, Node Operators and Delegators emerge as central figures.\n\nTo rectify this, Buterin suggests a two-tiered staking model:\n\nA high-complexity slashable tier with frequent activity but limited participants (around 10,000). A low-complexity tier, where members engage sporadically and face minimal or no slashing risk.\n\nThis model would involve the modification of the validator balance cap and implementing a balance threshold to categorize validators into these tiers.\n\nButerin elaborates on potential roles for small-stakers:\n\nRandom selection of 10,000 small-stakers for each slot who sign off on their slot’s head. If divergences arise between the staker and node operator choices, it triggers an error, prompting community intervention.\n\nA system where a delegator declares their online presence, offering to serve as a small-staker for a set duration. For a node’s message to be acknowledged, it needs endorsement from both the node and a randomly picked delegator.\n\nAn approach in which delegators signal their availability, and subsequently, chosen delegators confirm their online status. These delegators can then publish inclusion lists for block validation.\n\nThe roles envisioned for small-stakers are characterized by their sporadic participation and non-slashable nature. Importantly, these roles tackle the significant issue of a potential 51% node operator majority attempting transaction censorship.\n\nButerin also contemplates these solutions in the context of staking pool features. He suggests protocols allowing validators to designate two staking keys: a persistent key and a temporary one, which, when combined, influence the block finalization process.\n\nThe Implications\n\nButerin’s proposal isn’t just technical fixes; it’s a vision for Ethereum’s future. By decentralizing the staking process further and integrating safety nets, he aims to:\n\nEmpower those lacking resources for solo staking, granting them meaningful participation avenues. Reduce the transaction processing load on Ethereum’s consensus layer, making it easier for all to run a validating node.\n\nBy diffusing the staking process and embedding safeguards, the objectives are clear: to empower those who traditionally lack the means for solo staking by offering them a meaningful way to participate and alleviate the transaction processing strain on Ethereum’s consensus layer.

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
Based on the news articles provided, it appears that there are mixed signals in the Ethereum market. 

1. The first article discusses the Ethereum developers' decision to potentially launch Devnet-10 earlier than expected due to bugs in Devnet-9. This could indicate a positive development in terms of network upgrades and improvements, which may have a positive impact on the Ethereum market.

2. The second article highlights concerns about centralization in the Ethereum network following the Merge and Shanghai upgrades. This could potentially have a negative impact on the market sentiment, especially if investors are wary of centralization risks.

3. The third article discusses the decline in Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Dogecoin prices amid geopolitical tensions between Israel and Hamas. This external factor could introduce volatility and uncertainty into the market, leading to a short-term decline in prices.

Overall, the market trend for Ethereum may be influenced by a combination of technical upgrades, centralization concerns, and external geopolitical factors. It is important to monitor these developments closely to assess the impact on Ethereum's price and market sentiment.

You are an experienced ETH cryptocurrency trader and you are trying to maximize your overall profit by trading ETH. In each day, you will make an action to buy or sell ETH. You will start with 1 million dollars, half in cash and half in ETH. You are assisted by a few analysts below and need to decide the final action.

ON-CHAIN ANALYST REPORT: Based on the recent information provided, the market trend for ETH cryptocurrency appears to be bearish. The open prices have been decreasing over time, indicating a downward trend in the price of ETH. Additionally, the number of transactions and unique addresses have also been decreasing, suggesting a decrease in overall market activity.

The value transferred has also been decreasing, indicating a decrease in the value being moved on the Ethereum network. The average gas price has been fluctuating but remains relatively high, which could be a barrier for some users to transact on the network.

The short-long moving average signal, MACD signal, and Bollinger Bands signal are all indicating a sell signal, further supporting the bearish trend in the market.

Overall, based on the provided information, it is likely that the market trend for ETH cryptocurrency is bearish, and investors may want to exercise caution when trading or investing in ETH at this time.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, the market trend for ETH cryptocurrency is bearish. The decreasing open prices, number of transactions, unique addresses, and value transferred all point towards a downward trend in the price of ETH. Additionally, the sell signals from the short-long moving average, MACD, and Bollinger Bands further support the bearish outlook.

On the other hand, the news analyst report provides mixed signals with potential positive developments such as the early launch of Devnet-10, but also negative factors like concerns about centralization and external geopolitical tensions affecting prices.

Considering the overall analysis, the bearish trend in the market seems to outweigh the potential positive developments. Therefore, I would recommend selling ETH with a confidence level of -0.7. 

Action: Sell 70% of ETH.

*** ONCHAIN ANALYST RESPONSE ***
Based on the recent information provided, we can see that the open price of ETH has been fluctuating between 1580.18 and 1656.32. The number of transactions, unique addresses, and value transferred have also been varying, indicating some level of activity in the market.

The average gas price has been decreasing over time, which could potentially indicate a decrease in network congestion. However, the total gas used remains relatively stable.

The signals from the short-long moving average, MACD, and Bollinger Bands are mixed, with some indicating a buy signal and others indicating a sell signal. This suggests that the market is currently in a state of indecision and could potentially be ranging.

Overall, based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine a clear market trend. It is important to continue monitoring the market for further developments to make a more accurate estimation of the market trend.

Geopolitical uncertainty became a factor for traders during this period. The price of BTC exhibited resilience, avoiding significant downward volatility over the weekend. It recovered from a sudden test of the $27,000 level on October 6th, primarily due to surprising employment data in the United States that contrasted with policy adjustments by the Federal Reserve. As the new week began, the $28,000 resistance level became the primary focus for market participants.Bitcoin, after testing the crucial support level of $25,000 (Horizontal Trendline & 50% Fibonacci Retracement Level) has witnessed a relief rally and the prices went up to $28,580.

Once it breaks and sustains above $28,500, it may go up to $32,500 and to witness a rally, BTC needs to break, close and maintain above the key resistance level of $32,500.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
Based on the news articles provided, it is evident that there is a mixed sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, particularly focusing on Bitcoin and Ethereum.

1. Ether is ceding ground to Bitcoin as investors seek refuge in the most widely-held digital asset during the recent downturn in crypto prices. Ether has slumped around 18% since June, while Bitcoin was down around half that amount during the same period. This indicates a shift in investor sentiment towards Bitcoin as a safer investment option during market downturns.

2. Bitcoin has been maintaining firm support at the $27,000 level, with the price hovering close to $28,000. Despite geopolitical uncertainty and market downturns, Bitcoin has shown resilience and is consolidating around the $28,000 resistance level. Analysts suggest that Bitcoin may start moving towards $30,000, indicating a potential bullish trend in the near future.

3. Bitcoin inscriptions on the blockchain have surpassed 35 million, showcasing a growing trend of using Bitcoin for data storage and sharing. This development suggests new and innovative use cases for Bitcoin beyond being a store of value or medium of exchange, potentially impacting its long-term value and utility.

4. The recent market downturn triggered by an escalation in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has led to significant losses for cryptocurrency

You are an experienced ETH cryptocurrency trader and you are trying to maximize your overall profit by trading ETH. In each day, you will make an action to buy or sell ETH. You will start with 1 million dollars, half in cash and half in ETH. You are assisted by a few analysts below and need to decide the final action.

ON-CHAIN ANALYST REPORT: Based on the recent information provided, we can see that the open price of ETH has been fluctuating between 1580.18 and 1656.32. The number of transactions, unique addresses, and value transferred have also been varying, indicating some level of activity in the market.

The average gas price has been decreasing over time, which could potentially indicate a decrease in network congestion. However, the total gas used remains relatively stable.

The signals from the short-long moving average, MACD, and Bollinger Bands are mixed, with some indicating a buy signal and others indicating a sell signal. This suggests that the market is currently in a state of indecision and could potentially be ranging.

Overall, based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine a clear market trend. It is important to continue monitoring the market for further developments to make a more accurate estimation of the market trend.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by the on-chain and news analysts, we can see that the market trend for ETH is currently mixed and indecisive. The on-chain data shows fluctuating prices and activity levels, while the news articles highlight a shift in investor sentiment towards Bitcoin as a safer investment option during market downturns.

Although Bitcoin is showing resilience and potential bullish movement towards $30,000, the overall sentiment in the cryptocurrency market seems uncertain. Given the mixed signals from the on-chain and news analysts, it is challenging to determine a clear market trend for ETH at this moment.

Considering the current market conditions and the lack of a definitive trend, I would take a conservative approach and suggest a neutral action of 0.0. This means maintaining the current position without making any significant changes until a clearer trend emerges in the market.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum Foundation faced a sandwich attack during its recent sale of 1,700 ETH on Uniswap V3. The foundation, which is a key player in the Ethereum ecosystem, was caught off guard, resulting in a loss of U.S. $9,101.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to data from EigenPhi, the Ethereum Foundation\'s transaction was targeted by an MEV Bot (0x00...6B40). This bot, capitalizing on the opportunity, managed to make a neat profit of U.S. $4,060 after covering its costs.\n\nThe foundation\'s sale took place at 16:18 UTC+8, where they exchanged 1.7K ETH for a hefty 2.738 million USDC. A peek into the foundation\'s wallet reveals a balance of 240.68 ETH, 3.238 million USDC, 49,700 DAI and 10,000 ARB, bringing their total assets to a cool $3.687 million.\n\nBut what exactly is a sandwich attack? For the uninitiated, a sandwich attack is a form of front-running tactic used in the world of decentralized exchanges. In this strategy, a malicious actor spots a pending transaction on the Ethereum network and quickly places their own transaction with a higher gas fee, ensuring it gets processed first.\n\nThey then place another transaction right after the target transaction, effectively "sandwiching" the original transaction. This allows the attacker to manipulate the price in a way that they can profit from the victim\'s trade.\n\nThe fact that the Ethereum Foundation, a central entity in the Ethereum space, fell victim to such an attack raises eyebrows. It brings forth questions about the security measures in place and the vulnerabilities that exist even for seasoned players in the crypto arena.\n\nInterestingly, there is a pattern observed on Ethereum Foundation\'s sales. It often liquidates Ethereum just before significant sell-offs occur. While it is speculative to draw conclusions, the timing of its sales in relation to market movements has not gone unnoticed by keen market observers.'}, {'id': 11, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL2RhaWx5aG9kbC5jb20vMjAyMy8xMC8xMC9iZW5qYW1pbi1jb3dlbi1kb3VibGVzLWRvd24tb24tZXRoZXJldW0tY2FsbC1zYXlzLWJpZy1ldGgtY29sbGFwc2UtYnktZW5kLW9mLXRoZS15ZWFyLW1vc3QtbGlrZWx5LW91dGNvbWUv0gGPAWh0dHBzOi8vZGFpbHlob2RsLmNvbS8yMDIzLzEwLzEwL2JlbmphbWluLWNvd2VuLWRvdWJsZXMtZG93bi1vbi1ldGhlcmV1bS1jYWxsLXNheXMtYmlnLWV0aC1jb2xsYXBzZS1ieS1lbmQtb2YtdGhlLXllYXItbW9zdC1saWtlbHktb3V0Y29tZS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Tue, 10 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Benjamin Cowen Doubles Down on Ethereum Call, Says Big ETH Collapse By End of the Year Most Likely Outcome - The Daily Hodl', 'content': "A widely followed crypto analyst is doubling down on his prediction for Ethereum (ETH), the top smart contract platform by market cap.\n\nIn a new strategy session, crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen tells his 787,000 YouTube subscribers that Ethereum is likely to collapse by the end of the year.\n\n“I think Ethereum returns home before it goes on any sustained bull run. A lot of people got excited – I mean, they can get excited all they want about this rally. It’s still just a 2X move. You can celebrate a 2X move if you want, but you can get that in the stock market pretty easily. I mean, a lot of stocks do 2X moves…\n\nYou ride a 50X move up, and then, you know, you take a side, whether you’re bullish or bearish, and everyone celebrates $100 moves in either direction. But that’s not what you’re here for. What you’ll notice is that every time Ethereum made a rally to new highs, it did not happen until Ethereum went home first. ‘Home’ is the lower regression band. Right now, we need to see Ethereum go home for new highs to come.\n\n[We’ve] still got to see ETH go home, my friends, and it hasn’t happened yet. So, I think that it will. And again, you can see on these lower time frames, at least over the last year and a little over a year, that it’s trying to hold those levels. But again, at some point, it likely breaks, and when it does, that’s likely when Ethereum starts to head home.”\n\nAccording to an analysis published almost a year ago, Cowen says “home” for ETH is between $600-$800, where his own version of the logarithmic regression band sits.\n\nCowen says ETH will be coming “home” within the next several months.\n\n“I think the most likely outcome is for Ethereum to drop below $1,200 within the next two and a half months and I mean it could certainly go lower.”\n\nETH is worth $1,572 at time of writing, down 5% in the last week.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

BTC set to Gain More Ethereum Capabilities - CCN.com', 'content': "Key Takeaways\n\nIt has been nearly two years since the Bitcoin upgrade that introduced Ordinals.\n\nAs the network has evolved, new use cases have expanded.\n\nToday, Bitcoin developers are working on new applications.\n\nThese may give the blockchain Ethereum-style capabilities.\n\nMany often credit Bitcoin Ordinals with significantly boosting the transaction volume on the Bitcoin network. Now, nearly 2 years after the upgrade that first enabled Ordinals, developers are using the technology to build Ethereum-style capabilities into the blockchain.\n\nBut with Ethereum advancing its own roadmap toward greater transaction volumes and more complex on-chain functions, does Bitcoin need to keep up?\n\nHow Ordinals Have Already Changed Bitcoin\n\nFirst introduced in November 2021, Bitcoin Ordinals enable the numbering, identification, and inscription of individual Satoshis, each representing one hundred millionth of a Bitcoin.\n\nThanks to Ordinals, the cost of inscribing data on the Bitcoin blockchain has dramatically reduced, and up to a 4 MB limit, it’s possible to inscribe any kind of data on a single Satoshi.\n\nSince the 2021 upgrade, Ordinals have fueled a surge in activity on the Bitcoin network, driven by the development of new use cases like the BRC-20 NFT standard.\n\nAccording to Dune data, over 35M Ordinals inscriptions have occurred to date. Although the vast majority of these are text-based, more complex data formats have also helped power the surge in Ordinals inscriptions.\n\nOrdinals inscriptions\n\nFor example, users have recorded over 760,000 PNG images and more than 229,000 WEBP images on-chain as Bitcoin Ordinals. Advocates assert that Ordinals play a crucial role in diversifying the functionality of the Bitcoin network and are essential for ensuring its long-term survival.\n\nHowever, not everyone has been happy with Bitcoin’s evolution to embrace a wider variety of transaction types. Purists argue that the blockchain should only be for its original purpose: the peer-to-peer transfer of value.\n\nFacing a slew of Bitcoin-based meme tokens and NFTs, critics have pointed out that transactions stemming from Ordinals inscriptions have occasionally clogged the network, leading to higher fees for users.\n\nIs Bitcoin Due a Layer 2 Revolution?\n\nAs well as expanding the range of Bitcoin token types available, the same upgrade that enabled Ordinals inscriptions is also leading to the development of new off-chain protocols.\n\nFor example, several projects have recently made advances toward realizing the vision of Ethereum-style rollups for Bitcoin.\n\nBy moving computation off-chain, recent innovations by Kasar Labs and Chainway could significantly scale transactions on the Bitcoin network and trigger an L2 revolution akin to Ethereum’s.\n\n1/ We're thrilled to share that we're open-sourcing our Bitcoin Data Availability Adapter which allows Sovereign SDK to be compatible with Bitcoin.

The project’s developers claim that BitVM enables the verification of any computable function on Bitcoin. Additionally, unless there are disputes with transactions, the resulting on-chain footprint remains minimal."}]. Analyze the news and estimate the market trend accordingly.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by the on-chain and news analysts, the market trend for Ethereum (ETH) appears to be uncertain with mixed signals. The on-chain data shows fluctuating open prices and varying activity levels, while the trading signals are conflicting with both buy and sell indications. The news articles highlight potential downside risks in the short term due to security concerns, technical factors, and market dynamics.

Considering the mixed signals and potential downside risks, I believe the market trend for ETH is bearish and downwards. Therefore, I will sell ETH with a positive value to maximize profit.

This week’s publication of a research paper outlining the design for BitVM, “a computing paradigm to express Turing-complete Bitcoin contracts,” got bitcoiners buzzing on social-media forums. The big idea is that Ethereum-style smart contracts and might be coming to Bitcoin, raising the possibility of a existential transformation of the originally payments-focused blockchain – perhaps even a bigger development than the advent of NFTs earlier this year via the Ordinals protocol. “Bitcoin is about to become a lot smarter,” according to one post on X. “Something really interesting cooking,” wrote another. The author of the BitVM paper is Robin Linus, a core contributor to ZeroSync, a Swiss non-profit that’s building tools for Bitcoin developers to use zero-knowledge proofs – a type of cryptography that has become one of the hottest trends of 2023 in the Ethereum ecosystem. “BitVM is an amazing breakthrough because while there are many gaping holes right now in the BitVM, they are mostly solvable,” Bob Bodily, CEO of Bioniq.io, a Bitcoin Ordinals marketplace, wrote in a post on X. One person went so far as to inscribe Linus’s paper onto the Bitcoin blockchain. BitVM relies on computations performed off-blockchain and then verified on-chain using a setup similar to those found in so-called optimistic rollups on Ethereum. The details are quite technical, as evidenced by an article on the topic in Bitcoin Magazine that delved into the arcana of “NAND gates.” A poster on X put up a white flag, asking “Can you explain BitVM in plain English?” and then giving only two choices, “No” and “No way.” There were memes aplenty.\n\nStory continues\n\nHARSH WINTER: In the last edition of The Protocol, we recounted the rounds of layoffs coursing through the blockchain industry – at Chia Network, Chainalysis and Yield Protocol. Such moves come as digital-asset markets have stalled over the past several months, prolonging what many experts describe as an unusually harsh “crypto winter.” According to the analysis firm Messari, fundraising for crypto startups has hit a three-year low. Well, over the past week, there’s been more job cuts. CoinDesk broke the news this week that Blocknative, a provider of tools on the Ethereum blockchain, had reduced headcount by a third, which works out to about a dozen people. Last week, the crypto custody firm Ledger cut 12% of staff, or about 88 jobs, citing “macroeconomic headwinds” that are “limiting our ability to generate revenue.” Yuga Labs, the NFT company behind the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection, eliminated an unspecified number of roles, even though it closed a $450 million funding round just 18 months ago, Unchained reported. In a statement on Yuga’s website, CEO Daniel Alegre wrote that the company had “a number of projects that, while well-intentioned, either spread the team too thin or required execution expertise beyond our core competencies.” It bears pointing out that the broader economy doesn’t seem to be suffering in the same way; the U.S. added 336,000 jobs in September, double analysts’ forecasts, a government report last week showed.\n\nISRAELI CRYPTO FIRMS DEAL WITH WAR: The past week’s surprise attack on Israel by Hamas fighters has upended the daily routines of crypto firms based in the Middle Eastern country, known as a haven for startups and tech companies. Several Israeli crypto executives and developers told CoinDesk they weren’t experiencing severe business disruptions, especially since many of them work remotely. But already, many employees of the firms are getting called up to reserve duties in the army. There were the personal elements such as the stress – digesting the scope of the damage, and the tragedies – as well as coping with bare supermarket shelves and repeated siren warnings. One of the largest projects so far to come out of the disaster is Crypto Aid Israel, a campaign led by Israeli crypto firms to gather crypto donations to help citizens who have been affected or displaced by the ongoing war. Separately, a local media outlet reported that Israeli police have frozen cryptocurrency accounts linked to Hamas, working with the crypto exchange Binance. According to the Wall Street Journal, Hamas along with the militant groups Palestinian Islamic Jihad and their Lebanese ally Hezbollah received more than $100 million combined in crypto funding into their digital-currency wallets over the past couple years.\n\nAvalanche social app Stars Arena, which became a sudden sensation when it launched a week ago, generating enthusiasm in the market for the blockchain’s AVAX tokens, suffered a reversal of fortune on Oct. 7 when it got drained of nearly all locked funds, some $3 million worth. The episode was attributed to a “major security breach with the smart contract.” WAIT THIS JUST IN: On Wednesday, the smart-contract address that launched the attack encoded a message into a blockchain transaction: “I would like to cooperate.”\n\nThorswap, a decentralized cross-chain crypto exchange, shifted into “maintenance mode” after the infamous “FTX Exploiter” used a series of Ethereum transactions to move funds onto the platform; project says the action was taken after “consultation with advisors, legal counsel and law enforcement.”\n\nALSO:\n\nActivist crypto investors scored a $2.5M bounty after mounting a campaign on FloorDAO.\n\nTokenized U.S. Treasuries arrive on Coinbase’s Base blockchain with Backed’s RWA token.\n\nBlockticity mints hemp and cannabis certifications on Avalanche blockchain.\n\nTaiwanese crypto trader’s 6-cent fee leads to $310K win in tax-receipt lottery.\n\nProtocol Village\n\nHighlighting blockchain tech upgrades and developments.\n\n1.

Separately, the money-management giant Fidelity’s digital-asset division argued in a report that the cryptocurrency’s “first technological breakthrough was not as a superior payment technology, but as a superior form of money.”\n\nThe Polygon-based stablecoin Real USD (USDR), backed by real estate holdings, saw its value plunge to nearly 51 cents within a few hours after its treasury was drained of DAI.\n\nThe JOE token sank after supermarket chain Trader Joe’s sues the decentralized crypto exchange Trader Joe. The defendants “developed a narrative around a fictionalized \'Trader Joe\' who sells his crops in the local marketplace, further evoking Trader Joe’s business and brand," the suit reads.\n\nCrypto Startup Fundraising in Deep Chill\n\nThe job cuts. The stall-out in this year’s bitcoin price rally. Those are just a couple signs of the prolonged crypto winter. Here’s another: a continued decline in funds raised by blockchain startups. Crypto firms raised $2.1 billion in the third quarter, down 36% from the prior quarter to the lowest in almost three years, according to a report last week from the analysis firm Messari. As the overall pie shrinks, investors are increasingly putting their money into early-stage startups rather than later-stage deals – “indicative of strategic bear-market positioning as investors attempt to fund projects with asymmetric upside that can return greater multiples when market sentiment eventually shifts in a positive direction,” according to Messari.\n\nCalendar'}].

You are an experienced ETH cryptocurrency trader and you are trying to maximize your overall profit by trading ETH. In each day, you will make an action to buy or sell ETH. You will start with 1 million dollars, half in cash and half in ETH. You are assisted by a few analysts below and need to decide the final action.

ON-CHAIN ANALYST REPORT: Based on the recent information provided, we can see that the open price of ETH has been fluctuating between 1564.92 and 1646.39. The number of transactions, unique addresses, and value transferred have also been varying, indicating some level of volatility in the market.

The average gas price has been decreasing over the period, which could indicate a decrease in network congestion. However, the total gas used remains relatively stable.

The signals from the short-long moving average, MACD, and Bollinger Bands are mostly indicating a sell or hold position, with only one buy signal for the MACD. This suggests that the market trend may be bearish or consolidating at the moment.

Overall, based on the information provided, it seems that the market trend for ETH is currently bearish or consolidating. Traders should exercise caution and closely monitor the market for any potential changes in trend.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, we can see that the market trend for ETH is currently bearish or consolidating. The signals from various indicators are mostly indicating a sell or hold position, with only one buy signal for the MACD. This suggests that there may be downward pressure on the price of ETH in the near term.

However, the news analyst report paints a more positive outlook for Ethereum, with forecasts of a significant increase in price driven by factors such as technical upgrades, real-world use cases, and positive sentiment in the market. This indicates a bullish trend for ETH in the future.

Considering both reports, it seems that there is a divergence in opinions regarding the market trend for ETH. While the on-chain analysis suggests a bearish or consolidating trend, the news analysis points towards a bullish outlook.

Given this conflicting information, I will take a cautious approach and assign a neutral value to my action, indicating a hold position until there is more clarity in the market trend.

In early 2024, Ethereum is slated to implement “proto-danksharding,” which would increase the network’s transaction speed and lower transaction costs.\n\n“Layer 2 scaling solutions… are likely to grow in importance over time, particularly as architecture upgrades expected in early 2024 sharply lower fees on these platforms.

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
Based on the news articles provided, there are contrasting views on the current market trend for Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC). 

1. The first article from The Daily Hodl suggests a bullish outlook for Ethereum, with a prediction that it could potentially increase by over 2,100% to reach $35,000 in the next few years. The analyst from Standard Chartered bank cites increasing use cases, layer-2 scaling solutions, and planned upgrades as reasons for the positive price forecast. This news indicates a positive long-term outlook for Ethereum.

2. The second and third articles from The Economic Times and Nasdaq, respectively, highlight a recent decline in the value of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Both cryptocurrencies have experienced a consistent four-day decline, with Bitcoin trading below $27,000 and Ethereum holding above $1,550. The market depth for Bricks (BRICK), a token associated with Reddit's Fortnite community, has also increased significantly, indicating a surge in interest in alternative tokens.

Overall, while the long-term outlook for Ethereum appears positive based on the first article, the short-term trend for both Ethereum and Bitcoin seems to be bearish according to the second and third articles. Traders and investors should closely monitor market developments and price movements to make informed decisions.

You are an experienced ETH cryptocurrency trader and you are trying to maximize your overall profit by trading ETH. In each day, you will make an action to buy or sell ETH. You will start with 1 million dollars, half in cash and half in ETH. You are assisted by a few analysts below and need to decide the final action.

ON-CHAIN ANALYST REPORT: Based on the recent information provided, the market trend for ETH cryptocurrency appears to be bearish. The open prices have been decreasing over time, indicating a downward trend. Additionally, the number of transactions and unique addresses have been fluctuating, but there is no clear indication of a significant increase in activity.

The value transferred has also been varying, but it is worth noting that it has not shown a consistent upward trend. The average gas price has been relatively high, which could potentially impact transaction costs and overall market activity.

The technical indicators such as the short-long moving average signal, MACD signal, and Bollinger Bands signal all suggest a sell sentiment. This further supports the bearish outlook for the market.

Overall, based on the information provided, it is likely that the market trend for ETH cryptocurrency is currently bearish. Investors and traders should proceed with caution and closely monitor the market for any potential changes in trend.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, the market trend for ETH cryptocurrency appears to be bearish. The open prices have been decreasing, the number of transactions and unique addresses have been fluctuating, and technical indicators suggest a sell sentiment. This indicates a downward trend in the market.

However, the news analyst report presents a mixed view on the market trend. While there is a bullish long-term outlook for Ethereum based on the first article, the short-term trend for both Ethereum and Bitcoin seems to be bearish according to the second and third articles.

Considering both reports, it is evident that the short-term trend is bearish, but the long-term outlook for Ethereum is positive. Given this information, I would take a cautious approach and sell a portion of my ETH holdings to capitalize on the current bearish trend in the market.

Action: 0.4 (sell 40% ETH)

For all users of LBank Exchange, the ETE/USDT trading pair is now officially available for trading.\n\n\n\n\n\nETE Listing Banner\n\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\n\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8831/183884_bd0534eb549c89e1_001full.jpg\n\nEthereum Express (ETE) is a blockchain network that employs innovative consensus mechanisms, sharding, and cross-chain communication protocols to achieve scalability, security, and interoperability in the world of decentralized applications (DApps) and digital assets.\n\nIntroducing Ethereum Express\n\nLBank Exchange is thrilled to announce the listing of Ethereum Express (ETE), a cutting-edge blockchain network designed to address some of the most pressing challenges facing the world of decentralized applications (DApps) and digital assets. At its core, Ethereum Express leverages a hybrid randomized DPOS (Delegated Proof of Stake) consensus protocol known as "Chaos Consensus." This unique consensus mechanism combines elements of DPOS and BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerance), introducing a random selection process for validating nodes. This innovation not only enhances decentralization but also significantly boosts transaction confirmation speed, enhancing the overall throughput of the network.\n\nOne of Ethereum Express\'s standout features is its data availability sharding mechanism. By dividing complete blocks into smaller, verifiable pieces or shards, this approach maximizes decentralization while simultaneously improving scalability. Users can choose to store either all data or a subset of shards, ensuring that every node can participate in securing the network and that capacity scales with the addition of new nodes. Ethereum Express also introduces a robust proof of data availability system, utilizing Merkle proofs to ensure the validity and accessibility of data across the network.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum Express emphasizes cross-chain communication and interoperability. The "Time Crossing" protocol facilitates trustless interactions between chains by establishing a root of trust between them, enabling secure cross-chain asset transfers and automatic verification of state changes. Additionally, Ethereum Express incorporates multi-chain architecture, allowing application-specific chains to be built on top of its infrastructure, providing flexibility and customization for various projects, especially those in the GameFi sector. Moreover, Ethereum Express supports cross-chain contract calls, enabling DeFi applications on one chain to be directly invoked from another.\n\nIn summary, Ethereum Express is a forward-looking blockchain network that addresses scalability, security, and interoperability challenges within the blockchain and DApp ecosystem. Its innovative consensus mechanisms, data availability sharding, and cross-chain communication protocols make it a promising platform for the future of blockchain technology, catering to a wide range of applications and use cases.\n\nAbout ETE Token\n\nETE token, short for Ethereum Express Token, is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum Express blockchain network. ETE plays a pivotal role within the ecosystem, serving as both a medium of exchange and a store of value. Users can utilize ETE tokens for transaction fees, staking, and participating in the network\'s governance processes. Additionally, ETE tokens are essential for incentivizing network security and validators, ensuring the integrity and robustness of the Ethereum Express network. As a fundamental element of this innovative blockchain platform, ETE token underpins its functionality and contributes to its vibrant and decentralized ecosystem.\n\nBased on ERC20, ETE has a total supply of 100 million (i.e. 100,000,000). The distribution of ETE tokens is designed to be fair and equitable, with a portion allocated for initial investors, validators, ecosystem development, and user adoption, fostering a balanced and sustainable growth of the Ethereum Express network.

At its core, Ethereum Express leverages a hybrid randomized DPOS (Delegated Proof of Stake) consensus protocol known as "Chaos Consensus." This unique consensus mechanism combines elements of DPOS and BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerance), introducing a random selection process for validating nodes. This innovation not only enhances decentralization but also significantly boosts transaction confirmation speed, enhancing the overall throughput of the network.\n\nOne of Ethereum Express\'s standout features is its data availability sharding mechanism. By dividing complete blocks into smaller, verifiable pieces or shards, this approach maximizes decentralization while simultaneously improving scalability. Users can choose to store either all data or a subset of shards, ensuring that every node can participate in securing the network and that capacity scales with the addition of new nodes. Ethereum Express also introduces a robust proof of data availability system, utilizing Merkle proofs to ensure the validity and accessibility of data across the network.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum Express emphasizes cross-chain communication and interoperability. The "Time Crossing" protocol facilitates trustless interactions between chains by establishing a root of trust between them, enabling secure cross-chain asset transfers and automatic verification of state changes. Additionally, Ethereum Express incorporates multi-chain architecture, allowing application-specific chains to be built on top of its infrastructure, providing flexibility and customization for various projects, especially those in the GameFi sector. Moreover, Ethereum Express supports cross-chain contract calls, enabling DeFi applications on one chain to be directly invoked from another.\n\nIn summary, Ethereum Express is a forward-looking blockchain network that addresses scalability, security, and interoperability challenges within the blockchain and DApp ecosystem. Its innovative consensus mechanisms, data availability sharding, and cross-chain communication protocols make it a promising platform for the future of blockchain technology, catering to a wide range of applications and use cases.\n\nAbout ETE Token\n\nETE token, short for Ethereum Express Token, is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum Express blockchain network. ETE plays a pivotal role within the ecosystem, serving as both a medium of exchange and a store of value. Users can utilize ETE tokens for transaction fees, staking, and participating in the network\'s governance processes. Additionally, ETE tokens are essential for incentivizing network security and validators, ensuring the integrity and robustness of the Ethereum Express network. As a fundamental element of this innovative blockchain platform, ETE token underpins its functionality and contributes to its vibrant and decentralized ecosystem.\n\nBased on ERC20, ETE has a total supply of 100 million (i.e. 100,000,000). The distribution of ETE tokens is designed to be fair and equitable, with a portion allocated for initial investors, validators, ecosystem development, and user adoption, fostering a balanced and sustainable growth of the Ethereum Express network. It is listed on LBank Exchange at 10:00 UTC on October 13, 2023.

That said, just as the equity ETF market has evolved to offer a plethora of sophisticated products beyond simple price tracking offerings, so too must the Ethereum ETF space.\n\nWith that understanding, a particular vision emerges — one where, just as an investor in an equity ETF demands a pro-rata dividend, an Ethereum investor assertively seeks out staking rewards. To omit such rewards is akin to denying oneself a full, comprehensive return on investment.\n\nStaking is Ethereum’s beating heart. It is the mechanism that rewards any ETH holder for bonding their holdings to validators, who then propose and attest to new blocks on the Ethereum blockchain, and in return are rewarded with newly minted Ethereum as well as a portion of the transaction fees in the block.\n\nTo put it plainly, staking is the modern-day operating system for Ethereum. And therefore staking must play a role in an ideal Ethereum ETF.\n\nAs an example, a fund with a balance of 9,600 ETH (approx. $15 million) could earn an additional 32 ETH on a monthly basis by staking. This not only enhances the fund’s revenue, but also contributes to Ethereum’s network security. Staking ensures validators are actively participating and making the network more resilient against potential attacks.\n\nIncorporating staking rewards also gives investors a fuller experience of Ethereum ownership. These rewards can potentially provide enhanced returns over time when compared to solely tracking Ethereum’s price performance, as has historically been the case.\n\nStaking rewards can offer a unique avenue for fund managers. They can be innovative in compensating investors, either by directly distributing the rewards pro-rata to investors like a dividend, or by reducing management fees and adding staking rewards to the fund’s total allocation, thus increasing the net asset value (NAV) for each investor. This creates a win-win scenario for both the fund and the investor.\n\nWhy staking matters\n\nSince the Merge in 2022, Ethereum’s supply has been on a decline. A portion of the transaction fees paid by Ethereum users is burned, the amount of which is usually higher than the new supply issuance. This deflationary nature makes ETH scarcer by the day, increasing its inherent value.\n\nAn ETF that stakes and captures new issuance might, in essence, be capturing an increasingly valuable asset.\n\nA staking-centric approach reinforces Ethereum’s network. As more ETH is staked and more validators join the network, the cost to attack Ethereum rises exponentially, fostering a more secure environment for transactions and smart contracts.\n\nStaking is not without its challenges. The dynamic unbonding period of Ethereum means that once staked, the assets aren’t immediately liquid. To address this, an Ethereum ETF could strategically stake only 50% of its holdings.\n\nFurthermore, by incorporating a liquid staking protocol which adheres to KYC/AML norms, the ETF could allocate another 30% — ensuring the requirements of institutional investors are met without compromising liquidity.\n\nRead more from our opinion section: DeFi has a reputation problem\n\nLiquid staking is a mechanism where users stake their crypto assets — in this case, ETH — and receive a token representing their staked amount in return. These tokens can then be traded, sold or used in other decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, essentially making them a liquid counterpart to an otherwise locked asset.\n\nIt’s essential that institutional investors look for protocols who fulfill KYC/AML requirements. The remaining 20% could be maintained in spot ETH, offering additional immediate liquidity.\n\nAs Ethereum ETFs gain momentum, their success will hinge on delivering returns while addressing liquidity concerns.\n\nAn intelligent combination of staking platforms and liquid staking protocols can be the bridge between these two worlds, ensuring Ethereum investors get the complete value they deserve, analogous to the dividends stock investors have come to expect. This vision paves the way for an Ethereum ETF that truly resonates with the modern investor’s needs.\n\nFor informational and advertising purposes only.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, the market trend for ETH cryptocurrency is currently bearish, with indicators suggesting a sell sentiment. The open prices have been decreasing, and while there is a potential for a reversal indicated by the recent MACD signal turning to a buy, the overall trend remains downward.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights positive developments within the Ethereum ecosystem, such as the listing of Ethereum Express on LBank Exchange and the approval of Spark tradability on Ethereum. These developments could attract more users and investors, leading to increased trading activity and market interest in Ethereum-related assets.

Considering both reports, I believe that the positive developments in the Ethereum ecosystem may have the potential to counteract the bearish market trend in the short term. Therefore, I am inclined to take a slightly bullish stance and recommend a conservative action of buying ETH with 10% cash.

Action: -0.1 (buy with 10% cash)

This will possibly be in parallel with testing efforts on public testnets.\n\ngm, here\'s my writeup of this week\'s Ethereum dev call where devs talked about ongoing issues and bugs on Devnet #9 and had a long debate on the merits of EOF.https://t.co/CbYKBaFlmZ — Christine Kim (@christine_dkim) October 13, 2023\n\nEthereum developers are gearing up for the upcoming release of Devnet #10. According to the article, Devnet #10 might be ready, hopefully next week.\n\nBarnabas Busa, an Ethereum engineer, underlined that developers are still working through "big questions" in the process of testing Dencun.\n\nDevelopers may not proceed with the launch of Devnet #10, likely the final devnet for Dencun, before the upgrade is launched on public Ethereum testnets like Goerli, until these questions are answered.\n\nThe forthcoming Devnet #10 will include a large validator set, maybe with 330,000 active validators. Its launch criteria include updated trusted setup files from the EIP 4844 KZG ceremony, improved visibility for blob transactions, the MEV pipeline and network stability.\n\nThe current Devnet #9 has a 93% participation rate, which means that 93% of validators are actively participating in network consensus. The 7% of invalidators that are not operational are mostly Geth (EL) and Teku (CL) validator nodes.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade contains the eagerly awaited Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844, often known as proto-danksharding, which seeks to improve scalability and lower transaction costs on Layer 2 rollup solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism.'}, {'id': 5, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vbmV3cy9ldGhlcmV1bS1iaXRjb2luLTE1LW1vbnRocy1ldGgtcHJpY2UtcmV2ZXJzZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Sat, 14 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Ethereum losing streak vs. Bitcoin hits 15 months — Can ETH price reverse course? - Cointelegraph', 'content': 'The price of Ethereum’s native token, Ether (ETH), is trading around a 15-month low versus Bitcoin (BTC), and the lowest since Ethereum switched to proof-of-stake (PoS).\n\nWill it continue to weaken for the remainder of 2023? Cointelegraph takes a closer look at the charts.\n\nEthereum price breaks below critical support vs. Bitcoin\n\nThe ETH/BTC pair dropped to as low as 0.056 BTC earlier this week. In doing so, the pair broke below its 200-week exponential moving average (200-week EMA; the blue wave) near 0.058 BTC, raising downside risks further into 2023.\n\nThe 200-week EMA has historically served as a reliable support level for ETH/BTC bulls. For instance, the pair rebounded 75% three months after testing the wave support in July 2022. Conversely, it dropped over 25% after losing the same support in October 2020.\n\nETH/BTC weekly price chart.

But with it still being down significantly from its peak, some enthusiasts are hoping for huge returns in the years ahead.\n\nAs of this writing, Ethereum\'s price is sitting at about $1,500. For it to reach the $5,000 mark, that would translate to a gain of about 230%. Is this even a possible scenario? Let\'s take a closer look at this top digital asset.\n\nIt\'s gotten close\n\nEthereum\'s all-time high price was about $4,892, which was set in November 2021. At that point, the token\'s price skyrocketed 153,000% from its initial launch date in mid-2015. Some lucky early adopters got rich.\n\nBut it\'s worth pointing out that this huge price run-up happened during a major bull market in both the equity markets and the cryptocurrency industry. Monetary policy was still loose after the depths of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nSince then, it\'s been a difficult ride for investors. Ethereum is currently 68% below its peak price. The so-called "crypto winter" was in full effect after a string of companies in the industry failing. Rapidly rising interest rates have also pressured riskier assets.\n\nWhile impossible to predict, investors can\'t ignore macroeconomic factors. They can both positively and negatively influence Ethereum\'s price action.\n\nThe bull case\n\nWithout a doubt, Ethereum has huge potential, according to the most supportive bulls.\n\nThanks to the added functionality and programmability of smart contracts, Ethereum is trying to become the world\'s decentralized computing platform. This blockchain innovation allows for two parties to transact for different use cases without the need for an intermediary. If it gains broader adoption, industries known for having expensive intermediaries are prone to disruption.\n\nSo far, the use cases have included various decentralized applications like financial protocols and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). While activity here has cooled off, developers continue working on trying to make the network better. According to a report by venture firm Electric Capital, Ethereum has 1,901 active developers working on it, significantly more than any other cryptocurrency. This bodes well for its ability to introduce advancements.\n\nSpeaking more to the development aspect, Ethereum\'s Merge upgrade is what many consider to be a positive step, particularly as it relates to scalability. Ethereum can only process 11 transactions per second, and when demand is high, transaction fees can soar.\n\nThe Merge transitioned Ethereum to a proof-of-stake (PoS) system, which can lower energy expenditures and set it up for further scaling enhancements. Future upgrades could add more capabilities to Ethereum. And in turn, this could drive usage and demand for the token, causing its price to rise.\n\nReasons to avoid Ethereum\n\nAs is the case with any unproven asset or new technology, there is a ton of uncertainty around the ultimate outcome.\n\nWith any cryptocurrency, there\'s always inherent technical risk. What happens if there\'s a bug in the software code that exposes private keys? Then everyone\'s crypto holdings can be stolen.\n\nIn Ethereum\'s case, its complex development roadmap introduces the possibility of errors to being made. This means its technical risks are even higher compared to a simpler and more straightforward crypto like Bitcoin.\n\nOne of the biggest bear arguments for Ethereum is that it\'s becoming more centralized, which goes against the entire premise of cryptocurrencies as tools for decentralization and giving power back to the users. The PoS consensus mechanism leads to larger pools of token holders controlling the processing of transactions.\n\nMoreover, a single person, co-founder Vitalik Buterin, has major influence over the direction of Ethereum. He can make decisions to his benefit at the expense of the average Ethereum user. And this can be a detriment to the integrity of the network.\n\nEthereum has promise, but the uncertainty remains sky-high. So I think investors hoping for the token to reach $5,000 should temper expectations. Unless wild enthusiasm takes over the crypto market again, that\'s a very lofty price target to set your eyes on'}]. Analyze the news and estimate the market trend accordingly.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, we see mixed signals in the market for ETH. The short-long moving average signal is indicating a sell trend, while the MACD signal is showing a buy trend. The Bollinger Bands signal is suggesting a hold trend. This conflicting information suggests uncertainty in the market, and it is advisable to closely monitor the situation before making any trading decisions.

On the other hand, the news analyst report provides some bullish sentiment for Ethereum. The articles mention potential rebounds in price, increased whale activity, and positive developments in the Ethereum ecosystem. This indicates a more positive outlook for ETH in the near future.

Considering the mixed signals from the on-chain analysis and the bullish sentiment from the news articles, I believe that the overall market trend for ETH is slightly bullish. Therefore, I would recommend buying ETH with a moderate confidence level.

So, it’s not beyond the realm of possibilities at all.\n\nBut what’s even more strange is we got above the 10% threshold already in the past.\n\nThis is the SOL upside chart… You can see here the yellow line is the 10% of ETH market cap, and the Solana price in blue breached that back in October 2021.”\n\nAt time of writing, SOL is trading for $21.99.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

With the recent downturn in the crypto market, the ETH price has dropped to the bottom support of the aforementioned range.\n\nOn October 13th, the buyers tried to rebound from this support but could not push the price above the $1573 level. Today, with an insignificant intraday loss of 0.05%, the daily candle shows uncertainty among market participants.\n\nTherefore, for traders to gain a better confirmation of a bullish reversal, the price should surpass the October 13th high of $1573. Under the influence of this range pattern formation, this bullish reversal should surge the prices 12.4% higher to rechallenge the $1745 mark.\n\nWill ETH Price Break Below $1500 Mark\n\nWhile the ETH price struggle to bounce back from the $1,530 mark suggests tepid bullish sentiment, a further slip below this support could find immediate support around the $1,500 level, which aligns with a longstanding trendline. This trendline forms the lower boundary of a rising channel pattern that has historically guided this altcoin’s recovery phases for nearly 500 days. Should market participants continue to respect this pattern, the Ethereum coin could find a footing at $1,500, aiming for a more ambitious target above the last significant swing high of $2,138.\n\nRelative Strength Index: Despite the sideways action, the daily RSI slope rising with a pair for new higher highs and lows reflects the buyers.

Since December 2022, the supply of Ether has been on an upward trajectory. Several factors have contributed to this inflationary trend in Ethereum. Notably, the decreased transaction fees, paired with an increased daily issuance, have accelerated the rise in ETH\'s supply.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe provided graphical representation highlights Ethereum\'s deflationary trend, juxtaposed with its network activity. An analysis of this chart brings forth some striking revelations. The burn rate is currently at 402K ETH per year, indicating that while transactions are ongoing and fees are being paid, a significant portion of Ether is being destroyed or "burned" but it is still not enough.\n\nOn the other hand, the supply growth shows an increase of 0.36% over a 30-day time frame. Moreover, the issuance sits at 834K ETH per year, which underscores the increasing creation of new Ether in the ecosystem.\n\nHowever, even with these factors pushing Ethereum toward an inflationary stance, it is crucial to note that the net issuance for Ethereum stands at a mere 0.44% annually. When juxtaposed with Bitcoin\'s inflation rate, Ethereum\'s figure is still considerably lower.\n\nFrom a pricing perspective, Ethereum has recently faced some challenges. The cryptocurrency has seen a retreat below the $1,600 mark, sparking concerns among investors and traders. With the current trajectory, Ethereum\'s price is inching closer to the critical $1,400 support level, which historically played a pivotal role in March as a point of trend reversal.\n\nFor now, Ethereum\'s price movement indicates downward pressure. While it is showing some resilience around the $1,575 zone, the continuous testing of this support suggests a potential breakdown. If ETH fails to maintain this stance, the road toward the $1,400 mark might be its next destination.'}, {'id': 7, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYm9sZC5jb20vY2FuLWV0aGVyZXVtLWV0aC1wcmljZS1yZWJvdW5kLW5leHQtd2Vlay_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Sun, 15 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Can Ethereum (ETH) price rebound next week? - Finbold - Finance in Bold', 'content': 'Ethereum’s (ETH) value has experienced another decline this week, dropping to $1,557. This represents a 5% decline over the course of a week that has generally seen negative trends in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nETH last 7 days performance. Source: Finbold.com\n\nThe loss of momentum extends further, as Ethereum’s price has fallen by 8% in the last two weeks and 2% over the past 30 days. However, it’s important to note that despite recent setbacks, the market’s top altcoin has still managed to maintain a year-to-date increase of 29.6%.\n\nEthereum’s situation remains somewhat mixed, but recent overselling may position the asset for a potential rebound in the coming weeks, particularly when considering the fundamental strength of the Ethereum network, and the potential inflow of investors.\n\nIs the bearish trend set to continue?\n\nEthereum’s price has been on a downward trajectory for a couple of months, showing significant weakness in its indicators since mid-August, coinciding with a broader market downturn.\n\nThe relative strength index (RSI) for ETH, represented by the purple line, has dropped from nearly 70 at the beginning of the month to 35 today. Although there has been a slight uptick in the past few hours, it remains weak, indicating that the token is currently oversold.\n\nA similar situation can be observed with ETH’s 30-day exponential moving average (EMA) in yellow, which continues to slide further below its 200-day average (blue). This emphasizes the presence of substantial selling pressure.\n\nOne of the most discouraging signals at present is the decline in the token’s support level, denoted by the green line, over the past few days. This suggests that ETH may struggle to resist further declines in the coming days.\n\nETH last 2 months performance. Source: TradingView\n\nHowever, despite the potential for minor drops in the very near future, the fact that ETH has been heavily sold recently makes it likely that traders will eventually seize the opportunity to purchase the token at an attractive discount.\n\nIn fact, ETH is currently undervalued relative to its underlying fundamentals, making it a favorable time to invest in the cryptocurrency, which is expected to make a full recovery, particularly given its dominant position in the crypto ecosystem.\n\nEthereum maintains a significant share of the Total Value Locked (TVL) in the industry, with its network and major layer-twos like Optimism (OP), Polygon (Matic), Arbitrum (ARB), and Base accounting for approximately 63% of the sector’s total TVL.\n\nEthereum also continues to evolve and expand, as evidenced by the upcoming launch of the Holesky testnet, a development that will contribute to Ethereum’s progress toward the eventual implementation of Proto-Danksharding, which promises significant improvements in scalability.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

However, historical trends show the tides could be changing soon, with Ethereum possibly on the brink of entering an accumulation phase.\n\nEthereum Price Action\n\nEthereum is trading at $1600, marking a 22% decrease from its price last August. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is 8% up over the same period.\n\nThis is a common trend that happens during bear markets. Coins with larger market capitalizations tend to be more resilient against price decreases as investors become more risk-averse and look to preserve their capital. While Ethereum isn’t short at a market capitalization of $187 billion, it’s still considerably lower than Bitcoin at $525 billion.\n\nDuring bull markets, coins with lower market capitalization outperform Bitcoin again as investors lean towards assets with greater potential returns.\n\nEthereum Price Compared Against Bitcoin\n\nWhen comparing ETH’s value to BTC, it’s evident that Ethereum has been trading within a descending channel since last August. This pattern, characterized by its lower highs and lower lows, often indicates a bearish trend in the market.\n\nETH's valuation against BTC over time. Source: ETHBTC on TradingView\n\nThe chart above highlights three other distinct phases:\n\nAccumulation phase: During this phase, price tends to stabilize, hinting at an upcoming change in momentum\n\nAscending channel: Here, the price experiences a significant reversal, often on a parabolic trajectory, characterized by highs and higher lows.\n\nDistribution phase: In the final phase, the price ceases its upward movement. Investors typically use this phase to capitalize on their gains and liquidate their positions.\n\nThe accumulation phase is typically the best time for investors to convert their Bitcoin into Ethereum. This phase is marked by price holding on at the bottom and then showing signs of reversal. Ethereum is still forming lower lows against Bitcoin, so it has not entered the accumulation phase yet. However, the last cycle shows that this could be changing soon.\n\nLast Cycle\n\nReflecting on the last cycle, Ethereum was in a descending channel against Bitcoin for 17 months. The accumulation phase then occurred from September 2019 up until February 2020. Based on the four-year theory, which suggests similar phases in the market occur every four years, this shows that the accumulation phase should also be approaching very soon in this cycle.\n\nYet, while the last cycle offers valuable insights, it’s important to note that no two cycles are the same. In the current cycle, ETH’s price action has not seen as much of a drop as in the previous cycle, which could be attributed to changing fundamentals and asset maturation.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nWhile an accumulation phase for Ethereum has not been confirmed yet, there remains the potential for its price to drop even further relative to Bitcoin. However, if the previous cycle is anything to go by, we could enter the accumulation phase soon. This phase typically presents prime buying opportunities for Ethereum.\n\nInvestment Disclaimer: The content provided in this article is for informational and educational purposes only.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report and news analyst report, we can see that there is a mixed signal in the market for Ethereum (ETH). The short-long moving average signal is indicating a sell trend, while the MACD signal is showing a buy trend. The Bollinger Bands signal is suggesting a hold trend. The news articles also provide a mixed sentiment with potential for a bullish reversal in Ethereum's price.

Considering the conflicting signals and the potential for a bullish reversal in Ethereum's price, I would take a slightly bullish stance and recommend a cautious buy action. Given the uncertainty in the market, I would suggest buying ETH with a small percentage of cash to capitalize on any potential upward movement in the price.

Action: -0.2 (buy with 20% cash)

A Beginner's Guide - Unchained - Unchained", 'content': 'Wrapped Ethereum (ETH) enables ETH holders to wrap their tokens and use them in Ethereum’s decentralized finance market in accordance with the ERC-20 token standard.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain’s native cryptocurrency, ether (ETH), follows different rules from those of the ERC-20 token standard. Wrapped Ethereum helps bridge this gap by offering a more versatile version of ETH.\n\nRead on as we discuss Wrapped Ethereum, how to wrap and unwrap ETH, and the various use cases.\n\nWhat Is Wrapped Ethereum (WETH)?\n\nWrapped Ethereum (WETH) is an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain pegged 1:1 to ETH.\n\nETH plays a critical role in the network by paying gas fees for transactions. However, with ERC-20 tokens following different rules, users cannot use their ETH in the same way as ERC-20 tokens.\n\nWETH’s ERC-20 infrastructure opens this path, allowing compatibility across the blockchain and eliminating the need to develop new smart contracts.\n\nHow Does Wrapped Ethereum Work?\n\nETH preceded the development of the ERC-20 standard, and the lack of compatibility means customized programming for each dApp, which can be costly. With the wrapping technology, an ERC-20 wrapper envelopes the ETH. This eliminates the need for custom programming to ensure compatibility with ERC-20 contracts.\n\nHere’s how you can wrap your ETH, turning it into WETH:\n\nSend the desired amount of ETH to a WETH smart contract.\n\nThe smart contract then returns equal WETH and locks your ETH.\n\nUse the WETH for investment purposes such as providing liquidity , lending, staking, NFT trading, and much more.\n\nWhen you want your ETH back, send the WETH to the smart contract, unlocking your ETH and sending it to your wallet.\n\nThe smart contract then automatically burns the WETH to ensure the 1:1 peg remains.\n\nInstead of exchanging the WETH for your ETH, you can also use a crypto exchange such as Uniswap or SushiSwap to swap it for another token or cryptocurrency.\n\nBenefits & Drawbacks for WETH\n\nWETH presents two key advantages:\n\nDeploy ETH in DeFi: ETH holders can deploy their holdings in decentralized protocols incompatible with ETH. Wrapped ETH presents an ERC-20 version of Ethereum that the holders can use to trade and lend in various DeFi protocols, for example.\n\nNo need to sell ETH: Investments are possible without losing access to ether holdings. Since investors can retrieve the ETH locked in the smart contract at any time, they don’t have to sell their holdings for investment and trading purposes.\n\nThere are some risks associated with WETH:\n\nThe need to trust a third party : The protocol for wrapping Ethereum is not Turing-complete. That means automation via a smart contract on the blockchain is not possible. Centralized programs host the wrapping smart contracts, allowing certain parties to control the assets. This opens the door for potential manipulation and abuse of power.\n\nTarget for hackers : The centralized nature of the WETH smart contracts incentivizes bad actors to exploit any existing vulnerabilities since all the assets are in one place.\n\nWrapped Ethereum Use Cases\n\nThere are two key use cases for WETH:\n\nLiquidity Pools : On decentralized exchanges such as UniSwap, users can add their WETH to liquidity pools and earn fees. The fees come from other users who opt to swap their tokens.\n\nLending : Platforms such as AAVE offer collateralized crypto loans. You can lend your WETH to other users and earn interest. You can recall your assets at any time, provided the smart contract for the lending agreement allows it.\n\nWrapped Ethereum on Other Blockchains\n\nSo far, we have only mentioned the Ethereum blockchain, which may leave you wondering if you can wrap ETH on other blockchains. At its core, wrapping technology aims to achieve interoperability. Therefore, it is possible to wrap Ethereum outside the native blockchain.\n\nBlockchains such as Polygon, Avalanche, and BNB Chain contain different versions of wrapped ETH.\n\nBlockchain bridging services\n\ncan also enhance cross-chain interoperability. A smart contract stores the ETH on the native blockchain and then mints an equivalent amount on the destination blockchain. The bridging process has its risks, with the key being the vulnerability of the smart contracts. Ensure you have all the information about the bridging service you intend to use before risking your ETH.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nWrapped Ethereum provides a user-friendly way to bridge Ethereum’s native token and the blockchain ERC-20 token standard, enabling ETH to be used in wrapped form across the entire dApp ecosystem on Ethereum.'}, {'id': 25, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hc2RhcS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvYml0Y29pbi1ldGhlcmV1bS1kb2dlY29pbi1zcGlrZS1hcy1mYWxzZS1ibGFja3JvY2stZXRmLXJ1bW9yLXNwYXJrcy0kMTA0bS1zaG9ydHPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Mon, 16 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin Spike As False BlackRock ETF Rumor Sparks $104M Shorts Liquidation: Analyst Says ... - Nasdaq', 'content': 'Major cryptocurrencies experienced a significant surge on Monday evening, triggered by a false rumor on X, claiming that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had approved BlackRock’s (NYSE:BLK) spot bitcoin ETF application.\n\nCryptocurrency Gains +/- Price (Recorded 9:30 p.m. EDT) Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) +4.21% $28,393 Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) +1.97% $1,593 Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) +0.81% $0.060\n\nWhat Happened: On Monday, BlackRock, an investment management firm, provided an update regarding its ETF application for the iShares Spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nA BlackRock spokesperson told Benzinga that a decision on the application has not yet been made, and it is still under review by the SEC.\n\nThis news has had an immediate impact on Bitcoin, as its value quickly declined to around $28,000\n\nWhile the rumor may not have had a real impact, the financial implications were tangible.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, we see conflicting signals with the short-long moving average indicating a sell trend, the MACD signal indicating a buy trend, and the Bollinger Bands suggesting a hold trend. The market appears to be mixed with fluctuating indicators, making it challenging to determine a clear trend.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights positive developments in the cryptocurrency market, such as the SEC's decision not to appeal against the Bitcoin ETF and the increasing adoption of cryptocurrencies by mainstream businesses like Ferrari. However, the market is also influenced by rumors, leading to short-term fluctuations and volatility in prices.

Considering both reports, it seems that the overall sentiment in the market is positive, driven by fundamental news and positive developments. Despite the conflicting signals from technical indicators, the positive news and growing adoption of cryptocurrencies suggest a bullish trend in the market.

Given the positive sentiment and bullish trend, I would recommend buying ETH with a confidence level of 0.7.

Action: -0.7 (buy with 70% cash)

ETH gained traction like Bitcoin and spiked above the $1,600 resistance level. It even climbed above $1,620, but the bears appeared near $1,650.\n\nA high was formed near $1,669 before there was a fresh decline. Ether trimmed gains and settled below the $1,600 level. It tested the $1,575 support and is currently consolidating near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $1,669 swing high to the $1,574 low.\n\nEthereum is now trading just above $1,575 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support near $1,572 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nOn the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $1,605 level. The first major resistance is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $1,669 swing high to the $1,574 low at $1,620. A close above the $1,620 resistance might start a decent increase.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nIn the stated case, Ether could rise and recover toward the $1,665 resistance. Any more gains might open the doors for a move toward $1,750.\n\nAnother Decline in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,605 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,575 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThe next key support is $1,550. A downside break below the $1,550 support might send the price further lower. In the stated case, the price could drop toward the $1,520 level. Any more losses may perhaps send Ether toward the $1,440 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level – $1,575\n\nMajor Resistance Level – $1,620\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

5. Technical indicators for Bitcoin and Ethereum show a mix of bullish and neutral sentiments, with potential for further upside if key resistance levels are breached.

Overall, the market trend appears to be cautiously optimistic, with potential for further gains if key levels are surpassed. Traders and investors should closely monitor price movements

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by the on-chain and news analysts, the market trend for ETH appears to be uncertain and experiencing some volatility. The technical indicators are giving mixed signals, with the short-long moving average on a sell, MACD on a buy, and Bollinger Bands indicating a hold. The news analyst report shows a cautiously optimistic sentiment in the market, with potential for further gains if key levels are surpassed.

Considering the mixed signals and uncertainty in the market, I believe it is best to take a conservative approach. However, given the cautiously optimistic sentiment and potential for further gains if key levels are breached, I would lean towards a slightly bullish outlook.

Therefore, I would suggest a conservative action of buying ETH with 20% cash. This action reflects a cautious optimism in the market trend, with a slight inclination towards a bullish sentiment.

Action: -0.2 (buy with 20% cash)

Drawing insights from a report by Odaily news, the discourse ranged from technical advancements to acknowledgments of decentralized projects, weaving a narrative of Ethereum’s evolving landscape.\n\nForemost, Buterin delved into the intricacies of quantum resistance—a burgeoning concern in the blockchain community given the potential of quantum computing to challenge existing cryptographic systems. He discussed the role of account abstraction, specifically through Ethereum’s proposal ERC-4337.\n\nThis initiative, according to Buterin, can imbue users’ accounts with quantum-resistant properties, fortifying Ethereum against future threats posed by quantum computers. Such a development underscores the proactive approach the Ethereum community is taking to ensure the blockchain’s continued security and relevance.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin calls for privacy and decentralization\n\nBeyond the technical realm, Buterin also spotlighted some decentralized projects that exemplify innovation and impact within the Ethereum ecosystem. Polymarket, a decentralized prediction market platform, garnered Buterin’s praise for its strides in decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nThe platform allows users to speculate on future events, illustrating the versatility of DeFi applications. PoolTogether, a no-loss lottery system built on Ethereum (ETH), similarly caught Buterin’s attention. This unique model lets users pool funds, earn interest and stand a chance to win prizes—a testament to the creative possibilities of blockchain technology.\n\nOn a more personal tangent, Buterin expressed his admiration for several cities around the globe. Singapore, Taipei, Vienna, Toronto and the New York State’s City of Ithaca made the list, each resonating with Buterin for their distinctive mix of technological innovation and cultural vibrancy.\n\nIn wrapping up, the insights from Buterin’s AMA serve as a compelling indicator of Ethereum’s forward momentum, with an emphasis on both technological foresight and the value of innovative decentralized projects.\n\nFollow Us on Google News'}, {'id': 6, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hc2RhcS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvY3J5cHRvLWJ1bGwtc2NhcmFtdWNjaS1zZWVzLTN4LWdhaW5zLWZvci1iaXRjb2luLWV0aGVyZXVtLWFuZC1hbGdvcmFuZC1oZXJlcy13aHnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Wed, 18 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Crypto Bull Scaramucci Sees 3X Gains For Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Algorand — Here's Why - Nasdaq", 'content': "SkyBridge Capital founder, Anthony Scaramucci has shed a bullish light on the future price trajectories of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), and Algorand (CRYPTO: ALGO), suggesting hearty targets for these cryptocurrencies, detailing the intrinsic factors that could drive such a bullish trend.\n\nThis optimistic outlook comes just ahead of Benzinga's Future of Digital Assets conference on Nov. 14, which aims to delve into the evolving dynamics of digital assets.

The restaked tokens can then help secure and validate other protocols.\n\nProponents believe restaking can squeeze additional security and rewards from already staked ETH and grow the crypto ecosystem in a healthier way based on Ethereum’s existing trust mechanisms. Restaking could serve as a security primitive for exporting Ethereum’s trust generated by its validators to other projects.\n\nYet Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and a number of key devs worry that restaking is a house of cards that will inevitably tumble. Some of those Ethereum devs have even proposed a fork to head off restaking platform EigenLayer.\n\nWhy the project’s founders promote “trust as a service” from Ethereum without the Ethereum founder and others’ willingness to participate is still to play out. Will the whole concept result in an Ethereum fork to protect the network from catastrophic failure?\n\nThe way eth Community turned on EigenLayer should be studied, it’s not for building, just side @BanklessHQ deals with canto n other grifters, we gonna keep forking yall ideas tho on other non zuzalu shit https://t.co/7Erh6qKVSE — ⟠yumatrades.eth⟠ – #6585 (😈,😇) (@yumatrades) May 22, 2023\n\nStaking and restaking\n\nStaking is a crypto-native concept. On Ethereum, it means putting up a security bond in ETH so that the validator (validators of new transactions who maintain the security of the blockchain) will behave honestly in verifying transactions rather than lose their staked tokens. Stakers are then paid rewards for locking up this ETH.\n\nIn essence, stakers lock up their tokens to commit to producing Ethereum blocks — an on-chain way of supporting development, regardless of fluctuations in highly volatile token prices.\n\nSo what is restaking?\n\nIn short, restaking works in that already staked Ethereum tokens can be rehypothecated (when a lender re-uses collateral posted from one loan to take out a new loan) to secure a wider variety of applications and accrue additional rewards.\n\nBut restakers also get penalized or slashed for non-performance of their staking tasks. (More on that below).\n\nSo restaking is a crypto primitive for generating economic security from Ethereum’s nine years of concerted developer activity and project track record.\n\n“It’s an extension protocol to extend what Ethereum can do, scaling out Ethereum stakers beyond Ethereum to other bridges and oracles that need to be secured,” EigenLayer founder Sreeram Kannan tells Magazine.\n\n\n\nHe says EigenLayer is commoditizing ETH staking to make it more general purpose, as, in crypto parlance, “staking is the root of trust.”\n\nKannan is an academic on leave from the University of Washington, and EigenLayer began as academic research into “exported trust” as a consensus protocol. Basically, he sought to piggyback the trust generated by Ethereum to other ecosystems.\n\nKannan essentially seeks to export the “trust” generated by Ethereum for other projects across the ecosystem and other chains. “In crypto, mechanisms for trust mean that investors need skin in the game. The pseudonymous world needs carrots and sticks whereby validators are distributed.” He calls it “permissionless innovation.”\n\nThe best each chain has to offer\n\nThe big idea for EigenLayer is to bridge blockchains and create super applications, taking the best each chain has to offer. Kannan says “every ecosystem is better in some dimension, but not all dimensions,” and EigenLayer enhancing decentralized tech stacks will actually benefit the industry.\n\nKannan said that what can be built with EigenLayer fits roughly into two categories.\n\n\n\nFirstly, EigenLayer allows for the construction of bridges from chain to chain, say Ethereum to Avalanche. EigenLayer acts as a marketplace for “decentralized trust,” connecting stakers seeking yields, projects built on EigenLayer offering risk-reward structures for yields, and operators acting as bridges between stakers and projects.\n\nSecondly, a set of smart contracts on Ethereum’s chain lets ETH stakers opt to run other software. EigenLayer could, for example, improve Ethereum transaction finality speeds. ETH stakers can now take the layer-1 blockchain Fantom chain (for better transaction finality times) and fork it on EigenLayer, thereby running a layer as a super fast finalization layer with an EigenLayer trust layer.\n\nBut it’s all still theoretical.\n\nThe idea of restaking makes sense theoretically, helping projects build off Ethereum’s security layer — but the problems worry many.\n\nIn theory, “it’s like the NATO security alliance; each country is still a sovereign country, but their mutual defense pact is secured by the sum of their military power,” Sunny Aggarwal, co-founder of Osmosis Labs and creator of a similar restaking system — Mesh, on Cosmos’ chain — told Magazine.\n\nIn practice, EigenLayer provides two ways to restake: whitelisted liquid staking derivatives can be restaked with EigenLayer or an EigenPod (a smart contract can be created to run a validator while restaking). But most restakers won’t run their own validator, so new networks can build projects without their own communities of validators.\n\nEigenLayer isn’t live yet, and it’s impact is still highly speculative, according to Anthony “0xSassal” Sassano, a full-time Ethereuem educator, founder of YouTube channel The Daily Gwei and an early investor in EigenLayer.\n\nTo date, there’s only a smart contract for staked ETH to bootstrap the EigenLayer network, and perhaps given EigenLayer’s hype, people are depositing their ETH into that network, expecting to farm an unconfirmed airdrop of native EigenLayer tokens.\n\nA force for good or evil?\n\nTo be successful, new consensus protocols need a balanced alignment of incentives. Trust is like a scale weighing competing interests. And trying to export Ethereum security layers to different blockchain ecosystems worries some. Many are still trying to understand if it’s a force for good or evil — or both.\n\n“There are two camps: those excited by broadening the use case of ETH staking, and then there are those that worry about potential attack vectors on Ethereum and potential negative consequences for Ethereum if something goes wrong with EigenLayer. My view is in the middle; I understand the concerns and the excitement.” Sassano says.\n\n“Inherently, all of this is complex; it depends which rabbit hole you want to go down. The simple answer is that Ethereum, as a network, currently has over 25 million ETH at stake — that’s tens of billions of dollars. So restaking is asking, what if we could harness that economic security for other purposes than just securing the Ethereum chain?”\n\nSassano continues: “That’s exactly what EigenLayer is trying to do, to generalize the security that Ethereum has with its stakers and expand that to other things like an oracle network or a data availability network. It’s inherently more technical and complex than that, but that’s the gist of it.”\n\nThere are two types of danger that restaking could pose: first for “restakers” and then for Ethereum itself.\n\nRestaking creates too much leverage\n\nRestaking is controversial as it is akin to leveraged investing through borrowing. Some argue that the danger here is that the hunger for “real yields” or actual revenue that emerged in crypto in 2022 leads to unsavory developments, like restaking.\n\nJae Sik Choi, portfolio manager at Greythorn Asset Management, told Magazine that securing networks through restaking could work, but restaking is akin to leverage:\n\n“Just like how Terra’s over-leveraged ‘safe’ collateralization of Luna was, there would always be a risk of participants over-leveraging into this new concept, and such a risk won’t be quantifiable until we see more data sets throughout the emergence of this new restaking narrative.”\n\nDan Bar, chief investment officer at Bitfwd Capital — a boutique crypto assets hedge fund — agreed that restaking amounts to leverage, telling Magazine: “While moderate schemes of restaking could be beneficial for capital efficiency purposes, any crypto assets manager and finance professional worth their salt knows too well how easily and quickly leverage can turn into a slew of synthetic toxic financial instruments that bring disasters into even the most healthy of ecosystems.”\n\n\n\nAnd maybe that’s the first major problem. Investors will only see restaking as quick, easily leveraged financial products. EigenLayer building an open-source, decentralized network security may fail to convince doubters.\n\nRisks to Ethereum itself\n\nOne fear is that slashing on EigenLayer will affect Ethereum itself.\n\n\n\nEthereum’s proof-of-stake trust system keeps everyone in check with slashing conditions — essentially non-performance penalties. Programmable slashing means restakers have additional computational responsibilities and face consequences for non-execution.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin fears an overload of the chain’s consensus, basically, computational overloads, if the blockchain’s computational power is suddenly redirected elsewhere.\n\nKannan admits that Vitalik’s concerns are valid. “We don’t want to shard Ethereum’s trust layer, and we don’t want contagion of nefarious actors leveraging Ethereum’s trust system.”\n\n\n\nSassano also notes that the functionality of Ethereum proof-of-stake was designed to make sure that there won’t be a sudden influx or outflux of validators, which would affect the core properties of Ethereum’s consensus mechanism.\n\nThe issue is that EigenLayer will decide where to take ETH from, but they can’t slash a validator on Ethereum.\n\n“In Ethereum, there’s also a queue for validators to enter or exit each day. So let’s say, in an extreme example, 30% of all staked ETH begins staking with EigenLayer and say that all 30% gets ‘slashed’ by EigenLayer. While it depends on what the slashing condition was, let’s say all this ETH was lost because they tried to do something really bad. Even if all 30% had to be exited, there’s a limit on how much can exit per day. It would take literally years to exit 30% of ETH stake. So I understand people’s concerns, but at the same time, other things built on top cannot dictate what happens on Ethereum.”\n\nSo, restakers should have to play by Ethereum’s rules.\n\nYet Sassano’s biggest concern is around the calculus of ETH staking, which may one day become a question of whether stakers get more from staking on EigenLayer than Ethereum itself. This could erode the Ethereum staking model in time.\n\nHe is confident, though, that Ethereum’s tech offsets those systemic risks: “It’s not a critical risk to Ethereum if you are slashed on EigenLayer. You are not slashed on Ethereum. EigenLayer cannot cause you to be slashed on Ethereum because Ethereum has its own slashing conditions built into the protocol. And EigenLayer has its own separate slashing conditions built into its protocol as well.”\n\nAnything built on top of Ethereum introduces additional complexity and risk. Juan David Mendieta Villegas, co-founder and chairman at crypto market maker Keyrock, tells Magazine:\n\n“EigenLayer is an interesting development but creates additional attack vectors without providing explicit benefits to the Ethereum ecosystem itself. If we take a step back, it’s important to note that ETH staking has introduced a base benchmark yield for the industry, and that is a good development. You can almost think of it as a ‘risk-free’ rate. Any additional layers, such as liquid staking derivatives and re-staking mechanisms, of course, can carry more concerns such as concentration risk, security and smart contract.”\n\nBut Villegas wishes EigenLayer well. “Overall, we’re advocates of the innovations that are happening around staking and want to see multiple protocols win as this will assist in the decentralization and democratization of the network.”\n\nIn other words, he wishes for competitors to EigenLayer to create similar products.\n\nGreat conversation. The TLDR is that basically Justin, Vitalik, and Dankrad all agree that restaking is a giant existential threat to Ethereum if it gets big (if it even works at all). These guys are all way too nice, but this was a brutal takedown of Eigenlayer. The takeaway… https://t.co/kY8gKmzxrF — the_fett (@themandalore9) June 30, 2023\n\nRestaking could make or break new projects\n\nCosmos’ Aggarwal believes restaking will only benefit those blockchains with existing network effects for those with existing economic alliances or overlapping communities.\n\nHe also sees restaking protocols akin to a venture capital arm for layer 1s that might discourage solo stakers and further centralize networks.\n\nIn the end, competing layer-1 blockchains probably won’t engage in restaking across chains. For that reason, he feels that EigenLayer’s design could be improved.\n\nWhile EigenLayer is designed as a security system importing trust from Ethereum, builders will create their own tokens and revenue models. This has pluses and minuses.\n\nIn some cases, dodgy new tokens may benefit from Ethereum’s trust layer. Choi thinks “this trust layer benefit could potentially be moot due to the tokenomics that these alt layer 1s would want to try and attain (i.e., the use of their own token — their own agendas) could be problematic and so any supposed trust exported from Ethereum is lost anyway.”\n\nOn the other hand, experimental, well-meaning projects may now have a chance at success thanks to EigenLayer. That’s why Choi thinks the ultimate potential benefit EigenLayer is proposing is that other blockchains that do not want to spin up their own validator and staker sets have a chance at scaling to success.\n\nAggarwal also notes that with appropriate checks, restaking should be set within parameters to control risk. Restaking primitives need cleverly programmed governance, such as discounted voting power to restaked tokens on another chain. For example, one restaker can’t have more than 20% of the vote for another chain.\n\nSo, is restaking a good thing for Ethereum?\n\n“The purists would say Ethereum should only be securing the Ethereum Beacon Chain and nothing else. [They] shouldn’t be exporting Ethereum security to anything else. But I don’t think that is necessarily a bad thing to get node operators to do other work,” says Sassano.\n\n\n\n“If it can happen on the Ethereum network, it will happen. If the network can’t resist it and Ethreuem’s chain becomes insecure because of it, and there are adverse effects because of it, then Ethereum as a protocol was not designed correctly and needs to be improved.”\n\nWe’ll find out soon enough.'}].

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, the market trend for ETH appears to be bullish. The open prices have been increasing steadily, along with the number of transactions, unique addresses, and value transferred. Technical indicators also support a buy recommendation, indicating a positive outlook for ETH.

However, the news analyst report presents a mix of positive and negative factors that could influence the market trend for Ethereum. While there are positive sentiments from Vitalik Buterin and Anthony Scaramucci, the controversy surrounding EigenLayer's restaking innovation and the end of Reddit's Community Points program could introduce uncertainty.

Considering both reports, the overall market trend for ETH seems to be bullish, with more positive factors outweighing the negative ones. Therefore, I would recommend buying ETH with a confidence level of -0.6 (buy with 60% cash).

- The Motley Fool", 'content': "It's hard to deny how wonderful an investment Ethereum (ETH 4.70%) has been. As of this writing, the token's price is up more than 52,000% since its public launch in July 2015.\n\nThat's an impressive gain, but it hasn't been a smooth ride for investors. Ethereum currently sits 68% off its all-time high price, set in November 2021.\n\nIs it smart to buy this top cryptocurrency while it's still below $2,000? Let's look at the reasons both for and against this decision.\n\nBuying the dip could be a smart move\n\nThe obvious reason to be a buyer right now is how beaten-down Ethereum's price is. During the huge bull run in 2021, crypto markets drew a lot of enthusiasm from the investment community looking for quick profits. Things certainly look to have been in bubble territory. In the years since, there has been a bit of a normalization, which might be a good thing.\n\nRapidly rising interest rates crushed the stock and crypto markets in 2022. And it introduced a prolonged market downturn in digital assets, even though Ethereum has climbed this year.\n\nAll else equal, investing in something when its price is lower is a better move. Should things still play out as hoped, the upside is greater than if you had bought at a higher price. This could be the situation with Ethereum right now.\n\nSome investors are bullish on Ethereum for its game-changing potential, primarily in the world of decentralized applications (dApps). That this blockchain has capabilities to build smart contracts has caused many believers to see a lot of use cases developing over time.\n\nWhile the activity around decentralized finance protocols and non-fungible tokens has cooled off, Ethereum remains the leader in these innovations. Thus, when the market rebounds, as it has done in the past, demand for the blockchain could soar once again with a growing dApp ecosystem.\n\nEthereum's transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism 13 months ago might have won over a lot of people. This move reduced the network's energy usage by more than 99%, which will certainly go over well with climate activists. It paves the way for a more sustainable future.\n\nEthereum is too risky\n\nThere are also some clear reasons not to buy Ethereum -- despite its price being below $2,000 at the moment. Cryptocurrencies might simply be way too volatile for some investors. This issue is more of a concern for those who are near or in retirement. Owning Ethereum exposes the portfolio to wild valuation swings, which could be too hard to stomach.\n\nSome naysayers might also argue that there isn't even a need for Ethereum. In other words, it's a solution looking for a problem to solve.\n\nTake financial services, for example. DeFi promises to remove intermediaries, which might lead to better consumer pricing and rates. But as we've seen with the failures of major crypto firms, things are opaque and too complex to understand. For all its faults, the current financial system is adequate for most people, and that could eliminate the demand for DeFi services.\n\nEthereum faces regulatory uncertainty, too. Is it a security? If the Securities and Exchange Commission one day rules that it is, that means Ethereum will have to abide by comprehensive reporting requirements. And this could result in heightened public scrutiny of the crypto.\n\nThere's even a possibility that Ethereum won't get back to its all-time high ever. The euphoria that characterized the market in 2021 might be a one-hit wonder.\n\nOn one hand, I can see why some investors might be interested in starting a tiny position in Ethereum, primarily as a result of its potential. But I'm in the camp that says it's better to probably be a bit more critical and avoid the crypto altogether or await further developments."}].

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

It claims assets — including its web3 wallet MetaMask, partly developed by some of the plaintiffs — were transferred out of Consensys AG, leaving them with worthless shares.\n\nLubin allegedly arranged to move the assets to a new U.S.-based company, CSI, in 2020, so it could solicit outside investment, with the help of Consensys General Counsel Matt Corva, enabling Lubin to replace the plaintiffs with Wall Street investors.\n\nLubin also brought in investment bank JPMorgan, who, in exchange for its own blockchain business, Quorum, received 10% of CSI, according to the complaint. Corva, JPMorgan and Umar Farooq, Global Head of Blockchain at JPMorgan, are also listed as defendants.\n\n'He broke his word'\n\nWhen Lubin established Consensys in 2014, many employees accepted lower salaries with the understanding they would receive company equity, according to the suit. Lubin reportedly dedicated 30% of the company to employee stock, with the suing party holding about 9% of that portion.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nLegal representatives for the former employees argue that while Lubin prospered, those who believed in his early vision and accepted stock over higher pay ended up with empty promises. “He broke his word,” the lawyers wrote. “In the process, he violated his legal commitments and duties. While Lubin got rich, plaintiffs got nothing.”\n\n“Plaintiffs in an ongoing shareholder case against the Swiss-based web3 incubator and investor Consensys AG, which operates as Consensys Mesh, have just filed suit against U.S. blockchain software developer Consensys Software Inc. in New York state court,” a Consensys spokesperson told The Block via email.\n\n“After two years of getting nowhere with their frivolous claims against Consensys Mesh in a Swiss court, plaintiffs now believe their meritless claims stand a better chance of yielding a pay day if they game U.S. courts and entangle Consensys Software and other unrelated parties in litigation,” the spokesperson added. “We fully expect that the plaintiffs, who were never employees of Consensys Software, will soon find this gambit is another fruitless attempt to enrich themselves from the success of others.”\n\nCSI has raised at least $726.7 million from investors, according to the suit, with its valuation rising to more than $7 billion following Series D financing."}, {'id': 8, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vY3J5cHRvLm5ld3MvZXRoZXJldW0tbmV0d29yay1mZWVzLWhpdC0yMDIzLWxvd3Mtb24tY2hhaW4tYWN0aXZpdGllcy1yaXNpbmcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Fri, 20 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Ethereum network fees hit 2023 lows, on-chain activities rise - crypto.news', 'content': 'Ethereum network fees are currently at their lowest point in 2023.\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) blockchain witnessed a significant reduction in network fees, with users paying a mere $1.15 per transaction, Santiment data shows. The current decline in Ethereum’s transaction fees carries with it a historical pattern that bodes well for the network’s utility.\n\nAs transaction fees drop, Ethereum becomes a cheaper choice for users to interact with its versatile platform. This development holds the promise of boosting Ethereum’s overall market value.\n\nLately, there has been a notable rise in the level of on-chain transactions within the Ethereum network. The figure, totaling 1,089,893 user active wallets (UAW), marks the second-highest activity level in Ethereum’s history. Blockchain analysts at Santiment noted that such spikes in on-chain activity could be a signal for potential price rebounds.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum unveils new testnet called ‘Holešky’\n\nThis increased activity suggests growing interest and utility in the Ethereum network, which may positively impact its market capitalization in the coming months.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1705401195152789888\n\nWhile the wider cryptocurrency landscape sees significant price dips, Ethereum has remained above the $1,500 mark.\n\nIn June, analysts expressed optimism in the world’s second-largest crypto, with some predicting Ethereum’s ascent to a historic high of $3,000. What fuels this bullish sentiment is the remarkable dwindling of ETH reserves on exchanges, plunging to an unprecedented low of 12.6%.\n\nThis scarcity of Ethereum in exchange wallets underscores the platform’s robust demand, offering a compelling narrative amidst turbulent crypto seas. This scarcity of tokens available for sale on centralized exchanges is considered a bullish sign of Ethereum’s future performance.\n\nGrayscale floats Ethereum Futures ETF application\n\nIn a significant move, Grayscale recently filed an application for an Ethereum futures-based exchange-traded fund (ETF). This application follows a previous filing under the Securities Act of 1933, the same regulatory framework governing commodities and spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs.\n\nNotably, Grayscale‘s filing for an Ethereum futures ETF marks an important distinction, as the SEC has previously approved Bitcoin futures ETFs under both the Securities Act of 1933 and the Investment Company Act of 1940, which regulates most security-based ETFs. This move by Grayscale reflects the growing institutional interest in Ethereum.\n\nIn the midst of Ethereum’s journey, co-founder Vitalik Buterin’s voice resonates with a clear vision. Buterin places a strong emphasis on two pivotal pillars: privacy and decentralization. These principles, he asserts, are not mere aspirations but core priorities guiding Ethereum’s path forward.\n\nIn a crypto landscape marked by change, Buterin’s commitment to these ideals illuminates Ethereum’s enduring quest for a more private, decentralized, and inclusive digital future\n\nHe expressed concerns about the vulnerability of centralized entities like custodial exchanges, which can be easily corrupted. Buterin advocates for direct transactions on the Ethereum blockchain to empower users and enhance security.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum goes red as active addresses, deposits spike\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nAfter facing resistance on July 14, Ethereum’s (ETH) price has been on a downward trend. Today, ETH is trading at $1,593, reflecting a 2.7% price decline in one week. Ethereum’s market capitalization stands above $191 billion, according to CoinGecko.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) of Ether on the weekly timeframe currently stands at 21.8, indicating a potential oversold condition. Ethereum has a critical support level of $1,500.\n\nWhile Ethereum’s recent price decline may worry investors, its fundamental developments and growing institutional interest suggest a promising future.\n\nFollow Us on Google News'}, {'id': 4, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vYmxvY2t3b3Jrcy5jby9uZXdzL2xpZG8tY2VudHJhbGl6YXRpb24tZGViYXRlLWV0aGVyZXVt0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Fri, 20 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Did Lido fly too close to the sun? Inside the centralization debate - Blockworks', 'content': 'Lido, the largest liquid staking service provider on Ethereum, is approaching 33% market dominance. This state of affairs has raised concerns about centralization and the protocol being a threat to Ethereum’s security.\n\nAt the time of writing, Lido’s staking market share sits at 31.76%. This means that of all the staked ether on Ethereum, almost one-third of it is staked with Lido.\n\nDanny Ryan, an Ethereum Foundation researcher, noted in a 2022 blog post that if a liquid staking derivative (LSD) exceeds the 33% threshold, it has the theoretical capability to manipulate block space, potentially creating an economic monopoly.\n\nThis sentiment is shared by the Ethereum Foundation’s Mike Neuder, who identified in a blog post three possible attack vectors on the network: holders of Lido’s stETH product, node operators who run validators for the network, and Lido’s DAO.\n\nOf the three, Neuder said the DAO presents the greatest risk, writing that the “soft power” held by DAO members would allow them undue influence over the protocol.\n\nIn a series of interviews, Blockworks spoke with those who’ve raised the alarm that Lido’s dominance may be a pernicious force, as well as members of the Lido development team who argue that the threats to Ethereum’s economic security are overstated.\n\nRead more: Lido Finance drops Solana staking after DAO decision\n\nWhy Lido might present cause for concern\n\nLido DAO’s largest token holders include several funds. Paradigm holds 7% of the total supply of LDO, Lido’s governance token, making it the second-biggest whale, according to a dashboard from Arkham Intelligence. FalconX and Dragonfly Capital are also among the top holders of LDO.\n\nIan Unsworth, contributor to the liquid staking firm Stride, said the funds holding Lido (LDO) tokens are unlikely to liquidate their positions or maliciously attack the DAO. Still, investment funds have to return value to clients, and value creation could, someday, theoretically conflict with the principles of Ethereum.\n\n“At the end of the day, you should probably assume everyone is a profit maxi,” Unsworth said. “People aren’t going to [govern the DAO] because they like the ethos.”\n\nIf profit maximization means passing proposals meant to degrade Ethereum for personal gain, the DAO is not equipped to stop it, according to Nixo, the pseudonymous executive director of EthStaker.\n\nDAO members typically delegate votes to larger holders, meaning proposals can pass without much attention. This could lead to under-the-radar misdeeds, Nixo said.\n\n“It could be Apple knocking on the door and saying, ‘Hey, we would really like to push this [proposal] through in some sort of clandestine way,’” Nixo said, adding that nefarious DAO actors could also punish node operators who act against their wishes.\n\nNotably, the damage Lido’s ability to censor transactions or attack Ethereum grows at 50% and 66% of staked validator share, according to Ryan’s blog post. Nixo said hitting 33% dominance would signal to potential bad actors that higher thresholds are possible without excessive community pushback.\n\nEven if Lido’s DAO is composed of model Ethereans, growing dominance from the liquid staking provider threatens one of the network’s chief value propositions — its censorship resistance.\n\n“[Lido dominance] erodes the credible neutrality of Ethereum, which in turn devalues Ethereum itself,” Kevin Weaver, a backend engineer at Metropolis, said.\n\nLido’s response to centralization concerns\n\nKasper Rasmussen, a Lido Community Contributor, told Blockworks that Lido itself is an intermediary layer that facilitates interaction between Ethereum users and transparent, well-known Node Operators (NOs).\n\n“This process is underpinned by a network of 37 legitimate and autonomous NOs. These NOs are not only geographically dispersed, but each of them individually holds less than 1.5% of the total staked assets,” Rasmussen said.\n\nBroader community governance will be achieved through the development of dual governance, Rasmussen said. Dual governance means LDO holders are not the only ones with governing power — Lido staked ether (stETH) holders can apply veto to votes if they choose to.\n\nThis means it’s possible for stETH holders to engage in protocol governance without holding LDO tokens.\n\n“This ensures the protocol remains transparent, accountable and representative of the entire user base,” Rasmussen said.\n\nThe Lido team is also working to expand the Lido Protocol’s validator set. In September, it onboarded seven new node operators, Rasmussen noted.\n\n“This diversification serves as a protective measure against any single entity gaining control,” he said.\n\nLido as an ‘ideal’ villain for Ethereum?\n\nEnshrining liquid staking decentralization in the protocol’s code has generated buzz in Ethereum circles. Enshrinement could theoretically implement protocol updates that would make it impossible for liquid staking to become overly centralized.\n\nLido’s DAO also considered, and ultimately rejected, a proposal that would have self-limited its staking dominance.\n\nWhether the solution to Lido dominance is reached through social pressure or by code updates, Lido says it is taking steps to stay aligned with Ethereum’s ethos. For this reason, Nixo said Lido is an “ideal actor to be in the villain position” on Ethereum.\n\nRead more: Ethereum is ‘much more centralized than folks realize’: Blocknative’s Matt Cutler\n\n“This is highlighting a problem that the Ethereum protocol has — it’s not a problem of an evil actor coming in,” Nixo said. “So in a way this is good that this is happening…the fact that ideas like that are coming to the surface in light of this debate from all sorts of sources is exactly what this social layer is meant to elicit.”\n\nUpdated Oct. 20, 2023 at 11:30 am ET: A previous version of this article attributed information to “the company” instead of a “Lido contributor.”\n\nUpdated Oct. 20, 2023 at 11:12 am ET: Clarified for additional context.\n\nDon’t miss the next big story – join our free daily newsletter.'}].

Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report and news analyst report, it is clear that the overall market trend for ETH is currently bullish. The on-chain indicators such as increasing open prices, number of transactions, unique addresses, and value transferred, along with the buy signals from the short-long moving average, MACD, and Bollinger Bands, all point towards a bullish phase in the market. Despite the potential short-term correction indicated by the MACD signal, the positive news surrounding Ethereum's milestone moment for crypto adoption and the reduction in network fees suggest a strong upward trend for ETH.

Considering the bullish market trend and positive news catalysts, I am confident in predicting a further increase in the price of ETH. Therefore, I recommend buying more ETH to maximize profit in this scenario.

Amid this consolidation, the daily chart shows the forming of what appears to be a double-bottom pattern, a bullish reversal indicator.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

*** ONCHAIN ANALYST RESPONSE ***
Based on the recent information provided, it appears that the ETH market trend is currently bullish. The open prices have been increasing over the past few days, indicating a positive momentum. The number of transactions and unique addresses are also showing an upward trend, suggesting growing interest and activity in the market.

The value transferred has been fluctuating but remains at a relatively high level, indicating significant value being moved on the network. The average gas price has been increasing, which could be a concern for users but also reflects high demand for transactions on the network.

The signals from the short-long moving average, MACD, and Bollinger Bands all indicate a buy signal, further supporting the bullish trend. However, it is worth noting that the MACD signal recently turned to sell, which could indicate a potential short-term correction in the market.

Overall, the market trend for ETH appears to be bullish, but traders should monitor the MACD signal for any potential changes in momentum.

This breakout has caused panic among investors, and if the outlook does not improve for ETH, more downside is likely. While the weekend price action has given bulls some hope, ETH needs to overcome two key resistance levels before investors can breath a sigh of relief.\n\nRead more: Ether crosses $1.6K, Bitcoin SV leads Altcoin gains with 30% bump\n\nEthereum price at crossroads\n\nEthereum (ETH) price set up four higher lows and three equal highs since May 2022. Connecting key swing points using trend lines reveals an ascending triangle pattern. This technical formation is bullish, and a decisive breakout forecasts an uptrend equal to the distance between the first swing high and swing low.\n\nBut for Ethereum price, the breakout was bearish, which forecasts a 45% crash to $998. This target is obtained by adding the distance between the first swing high and swing low to the breakout point at $1,825.\n\nIn its descent, Ethereum price has already breached the $1,639 support level, which has been key for the past year. If buyers fail to overcome this hurdle, it is likely ETH will continue its southbound move and eventually tag the $1,000 psychological level. From the current position of $1,598, this descent would constitute a 38% crash.\n\nAlso read: Solana vs. Ethereum: Renewed debate erupts over efficiency, development and scalability\n\nETH/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum price has produced three distinctive higher lows over the past month, which are not confirmed by the Relative Strength Index (RSI). This non-conformity is termed as bullish divergence and often leads to a small rally to the upside.\n\nDue to the aforementioned bullish signal, if Ethereum price manages to flip the $1,639 hurdle into a support floor on the daily or three-day time frame, it could provide bulls a respite. This move could likely attract more sidelined buyers and potentially trigger a minor rally to retest the next key resistance levels at $1,767 and $2,000.'}, {'id': 12, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL2RhaWx5aG9kbC5jb20vMjAyMy8xMC8yMi9vbmUtZXRoZXJldW0tcml2YWwtaXMtdGhlLWJlc3Qtbm9uLWNvbnNlbnN1cy1wbGF5LWZvci1uZXh0LWJ1bGwtcnVuLXNheXMtY3J5cHRvLWludmVzdG9yLWNocmlzLWJ1cm5pc2tlL9IBjQFodHRwczovL2RhaWx5aG9kbC5jb20vMjAyMy8xMC8yMi9vbmUtZXRoZXJldW0tcml2YWwtaXMtdGhlLWJlc3Qtbm9uLWNvbnNlbnN1cy1wbGF5LWZvci1uZXh0LWJ1bGwtcnVuLXNheXMtY3J5cHRvLWludmVzdG9yLWNocmlzLWJ1cm5pc2tlL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Sun, 22 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'One Ethereum Rival Is the Best ‘Non-Consensus’ Play for Next Bull Run, Says Crypto Investor Chris Burniske - The Daily Hodl', 'content': "A venture capitalist who called the bottom of the crypto bear market last year says that one of Ethereum’s (ETH) biggest rivals is the best contrarian altcoin play for the next bull run.\n\nCrypto investor Chris Burniske says that Solana (SOL) is the best “non-consensus” opportunity for an upcoming market expansion in the digital asset space.\n\nBurniske, the former head of crypto at Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest, says that SOL’s non-consensus status today is similar to ETH’s in the bear market of 2018.\n\n“ETH was non-consensus in 2018/2019, but is now consensus and anyone worth their salt as a crypto investor is there – quality asset.\n\nBut SOL is the strongest non-consensus asset of this bear. Watch out for when it becomes a consensus long, lots of momo investors will be scrambling.”\n\nLooking at Solana versus Ethereum (SOL/ETH), the investor says the pair looks like it may have enough steam to finally overcome the level that it lost during the collapse of the now-defunct crypto exchange FTX. FTX had close ties to Solana and its collapse brought uncertainty to the Ethereum competitor’s ecosystem.\n\n“SOL/ETH putting in some work to make 0.02 [ETH] happen, would close the FTX gap.”\n\nAt time of writing, SOL is trading for $29.51, up over 9% in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe crypto investor also says that other venture capitalists (VCs) are distracted with artificial intelligence (AI) and are missing out on the potential gains that could be had by picking up the discounts currently in the digital asset space.\n\n“VCs that are smug about crypto getting trashed, while AI has become the hot new thing, don’t realize the majority of overpriced AI rounds will be a graveyard for capital as the data incumbents mop the floor, while the low valuations we see in Web3 today will mint legends tomorrow.”\n\nDon't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The open prices have been increasing over the past few days, indicating a positive momentum. The number of transactions and unique addresses are also showing an upward trend, suggesting growing interest and activity in the market.

The value transferred has been fluctuating but remains at a relatively high level, indicating significant value being moved on the network. The average gas price has been increasing, which could be a concern for users but also reflects high demand for transactions on the network.

The signals from the short-long moving average, MACD, and Bollinger Bands all indicate a buy signal, further supporting the bullish trend. However, it is worth noting that the MACD signal recently turned to sell, which could indicate a potential short-term correction in the market.

Overall, the market trend for ETH appears to be bullish, but traders should monitor the MACD signal for any potential changes in momentum.

NEWS ANALYST REPORT: Based on the news articles provided, here is an analysis of the market trend for Ethereum (ETH) cryptocurrency:

1. **Ethereum Price Forecast**: The article mentions that Ethereum price breached its multi-month consolidation pattern, favoring the bears. The theoretical forecasting method suggests a 45% crash for ETH after the bearish breakout. The article highlights the importance of overcoming key resistance levels at $1,639 and $2,000 for a potential rally. The current price is at $1,598.

2. **One Ethereum Rival Is the Best ‘Non-Consensus’ Play**: The article discusses Solana (SOL) as a potential altcoin play for the next bull run. The investor believes that SOL is currently a non-consensus asset with strong potential for growth. SOL is trading at $29.51, up over 9% in the last 24 hours.

3. **Forecast: Ethereum (ETH) Price Could Overtake Bitcoin This Week**: The article mentions that Ethereum (ETH) price has surged by approximately 3.10% to $1,678. It also discusses the positive impact of Bitcoin's performance on altcoins, including Ethereum. The global crypto market cap stands at $1.11 trillion, reflecting an increase of

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, the ETH market trend is currently bullish. The open prices have been increasing, the number of transactions and unique addresses are on the rise, and the signals from various indicators all point towards a buy signal. However, it is important to note that the MACD signal recently turned to sell, indicating a potential short-term correction.

On the other hand, the news analyst report mentions a bearish outlook for Ethereum, with a theoretical forecasting method suggesting a 45% crash after a bearish breakout. Despite this, there are positive mentions of Solana (SOL) as a potential altcoin play and the possibility of Ethereum overtaking Bitcoin in price.

Considering both reports, the overall market trend for ETH appears to be bullish in the short term, despite the potential for a short-term correction. Given the conflicting signals, I would lean towards the on-chain analyst report which indicates a bullish trend.

Therefore, I would recommend buying ETH with a confidence level of -0.6.

An examination of its daily chart indicates a pivotal juncture at which Ethereum currently finds itself.\n\nFirst and foremost, a glance at the chart reveals a potential resistance level that Ethereum seems to struggle with. This is evident from the multiple touchpoints that gravitate toward this price ceiling. Historically, consistent inability to break through such resistance has often led to sharp retraces. For Ethereum, the implications could be more pronounced, given the other market dynamics currently in play.\n\nOne concerning trend is Ethereum\'s low network activity. Despite being a hub for countless decentralized apps, the recent lull in on-chain operations signals waning interest or, perhaps, a temporary shift of focus toward newer blockchain platforms. A thriving network is not just about transactions — it is also about development, upgrades and new projects. Low network activity might hint at a pause in these endeavors.\n\nMoreover, while Ethereum wrestles with its price, competitors like Solana are making substantial gains. With a 34% price increase since its local low, Solana is outpacing Ethereum in the race. This divergence is noteworthy. Ethereum\'s hegemony in the decentralized space is being tested, and these performance metrics might force investors to reconsider their portfolios.\n\nSolana takes stage\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is no stranger to spectacular price movements, and Solana (SOL) has recently been at the center of attention. Experiencing an astounding 34% price surge, SOL is definitely not staying on the sidelines. But with such rapid appreciation, investors and traders are inevitably asking: When might this bullish rally slow down or reverse?\n\nSolana\'s recent price action can be attributed to a variety of factors. Labeled as going through its "second youth," the digital asset is enjoying tremendous growth in network activity. This vitality and resurgence can be seen as a testament to the resilience and potential of the Solana blockchain.\n\nOne key element backing this sentiment is Solana\'s survival through the FTX crisis. Such events can be a death knell for many other cryptos, but not Solana. Its ability to bounce back and even thrive post-crisis underscores its robustness, making it a formidable player in the crypto arena.\n\nA glance at the Solana price chart indicates a powerful uptrend, characterized by higher highs and higher lows. The recent bullish candles reflect the strong buying interest and momentum. However, as with all significant price surges, there is always the possibility of a pullback or correction.\n\nThe chart showcases a potential resistance point, where traders might take profits, leading to a temporary slowdown in the price ascent. Moreover, while the relative strength index (RSI) is not in the overbought territory yet, continued upward movement could push it into that zone, indicating that a potential price correction might be on the horizon.\n\nCardano remains neutral\n\nRecently, Cardano (ADA) has shown promising signs, primarily by its ability to maintain its position above a crucial technical marker — the 50 exponential moving average (EMA). This development cannot be understated, as it often signifies a crucial pivot in sentiment and price direction.\n\nThe 50 EMA serves as a dynamic support or resistance level, depending on where the price stands in relation to it. In Cardano\'s case, remaining above the 50 EMA can be interpreted as a bullish sign, indicating that recent price averages are higher than the longer-term averages.\n\nTraders and analysts often regard this positioning as an affirmation of an asset\'s resilience and potential for upward momentum. In layman\'s terms, it is a line in the sand, one that ADA is currently on the favorable side of.\n\nAn observable aspect in the current ADA price chart is the downtrend\'s gradual flattening. After periods of pronounced decline, this leveling out can often precede a trend reversal. Essentially, it can be seen as the market taking a breather, consolidating and potentially gearing up for the next move.'}, {'id': 6, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvaW5kZXNrLmNvbS92aWRlby9iaXRjb2luLWNvdWxkLWdldC1ldGhlcmV1bS1zdHlsZS1zbWFydC1jb250cmFjdHMtdW5kZXItYml0dm0tcGxhbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Mon, 23 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Bitcoin Could Get Ethereum-Style Smart Contracts Under 'BitVM' Plan - CoinDesk", 'content': "The protocol is presented by Garand Fill today with Algo Kit. Welcome back to first mover. Our next guest is out with a recent white paper that outlines a new paradigm to bring Ethereum style smart contracts to the Bitcoin network. Joining us now is zero sync co-founder Robin Linus Robin. Welcome to the show. Hi, thanks for having me. All right. Talk to us about this white paper in it. You know that bit VM is a computing paradigm to express turn complete Bitcoin contracts. Explain to us what's going on here and what the real world problem is that we're solving. Well, the very high level rework problem that we are solving is Bitcoin scalability. Um Yeah, we would love to scale Bitcoin to millions of transactions per second. And currently that's not possible on the main layer unfortunately. And yeah, if we had more expressive smart contracting capabilities on Bitcoin, um we could bridge Bitcoin to like side chain systems or other feature-rich systems such that we can uh essentially scale BT C transactions more or less indefinitely. Uh So this is not the first proposal for smart contracts on Bitcoin correct on the Bitcoin network. So what makes this different than any, anything else that's out there right now. Mm So the scripting capabilities of Bitcoin, they are quite limited. Um It's not a very feature-rich platform in comparison to let's say Ethereum or other smart contracting platforms that we know. And um yeah, actually Bitcoin script is intentionally limited to reduce the attack surface of Bitcoin. And um what BIT BM does, it's uh it's kind of like hacking around these limitations. It's like uh a compilation of a couple tricks that allow you to uh overcome the limitations of Bitcoin script. And yeah, to express more uh expressive smart contracts on Bitcoin. OK. But in terms of what, what's out there right now, what's the difference? Um Yeah, you can express more stuff than you, you were used to like um in Bitcoin script, you can mostly express stuff like multi signatures, maybe also hash logs and um the basic stuff that enables also lightning and stuff like that. But um you cannot, for example, bridge Bitcoin to a side chain that is not possible today. Um But BIT VM might enable that. And, and how do you see it differing from what's available on the Ethereum chain right now? When, when, when you, if this were to to be launched, uh what, what kind of structure makes it either comparable, better or worse if you will uh than what's, what's on Ethereum. Um Yeah, Ethereum is designed to facilitate this smart contracts and Bitcoin is not um what we are doing here is um we are, we are, we are applying tricks to mimic what Ethereum is doing. So, uh in the end, it will not be quite as expressive as Ethereum is. Um however, these bridges uh they can enable or like they, they can allow you to bridge Bitcoin to a side chain and that side chain could run essentially the same code as assume and then you could have essentially um yeah, BT C in uh the EBM in, in, in the same smart contracting machine as on a theory, what would be the need for doing it on Bitcoin and not on Ethereum? Yeah. Well, Bitcoin is a hard asset. Bitcoin is hard to change and Bitcoin is by far the number one asset in the world, it's the strongest brand and it's uh the currency that we all love, I think. And that's why we should do it with B BT C and with it, what are some of the potential applications you see here that would be better run in the Bitcoin ecosystem than the Ethereum? One of course, um you mentioned a bunch of problems that you're trying to solve that exist in the Ethereum network. Of course, layer twos have solved, solved some of the issues that you're trying to solve. What are some of the potential applications that might attract developers and users to Bitcoin versus Ethereum? Yeah, I'm personally mostly interested into scalability um uh I wanna see Bitcoin scaling to, as I said, a million transactions per second. And um yeah, I think that would be great to uh see Bitcoin being used as a currency for, yeah, daily, daily life payments and uh for basically any kinds of payments. And uh it would be great if we could um process that many transactions. And are there any limitations here with uh bit VM that you anticipate? Oh yeah, it's, as I said, it's like that's uh it's piling tricks on top of each other to mimic what Ethereum is doing. And um one thing that is very different than the EVM is that um in, in BVM, you always need a verifier. Um So there is like some party doing this, this pack doing this bridge and then there is um there could be like hundreds of very fires and um all of them, they are uh surveilling uh the uh the person that is facilitating the bridge and they are verifying that um they stay honest and if they don't stay honest, then the verifier can punish um the bridge. So this is a white paper. How, how long do you think it would take to get it uh on the ground? Um Yeah, we are developing um the first version of it. Hopefully, hopefully by the end of this week we have like something that's like very early uh like uh like developers can, can start playing around with um there won't be anything that uh will be usable by, by, by regular people. But um yeah, we, we hope we can get something into the hands of, of developers who uh I really want to go into the nitty gritty and like uh check out all the details of how it works under the hood. And um yeah, from there, we will advance it as, as quickly as possible. Many people are excited about it, many people are supporting it. Uh Many people are contributing ideas and uh also code and um yeah, hopefully by the end of the year, we will see the first experimental use cases. Robin, thank you very much for joining us and unpacking your white paper. We look forward to seeing some of those use cases by the end of the year. Thanks a lot for having me.

Both platforms cater to testing processes involving staking, validation, and essential network enhancements. Furthermore, there exists another testnet, Sepolia, tailored for developers keen on examining their Ethereum-centric applications. Testnet ETH: Tokens on these testnets, commonly referred to as testnet ETH, can be accessed freely through faucets and typically lack real-world monetary worth.\n\nThis summary explains recent challenges and developments regarding Ethereum’s Holesky testnet. Let’s now examine the technical outlook of Ethereum.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction\n\nEthereum‘s current price trajectory indicates potential for an upward shift above the critical $1,650 mark against the US Dollar. A consolidation above this level, particularly between $1,650 and $1,670, could herald a bullish momentum.\n\nHaving built a foundation above $1,580, Ethereum progressed past the $1,620 resistance, aligning its trajectory with Bitcoin.\n\nPresently, it hovers above the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average and the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement from its recent swing, positioning itself favorably against the pivotal $1,650 resistance.\n\nEthereum Price Chart – Source: Tradingview\n\nAscending beyond this could propel it towards $1,670, and, eventually, the significant $1,750 resistance.\n\nConversely, failure to breach the $1,650 threshold may see it retract to supports at $1,630, $1,610, or even $1,580. A further decline could risk a downturn to approximately $1,520.\n\nIn addition to Ethereum, exploring investment options in the realm of cryptocurrency has become a popular trend among investors.\n\nWall Street Memes – The Alternative Coin Worth Considering\n\nOne of the emerging investment options that has caught the attention of many is the $WSM presale, which represents a meme coin.\n\nThis coin has generated significant excitement among the investment community, originating from the Wall Street Memes online community that caters to enthusiasts in this field.\n\nThe Wall Street Memes crypto project began its presale on May 26, 2023, and can be accessed through their official portal wallstmemes.com.\n\nDuring its initial stage, the WSM token was offered for $0.025.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, the market trend for ETH cryptocurrency is currently bullish. The open prices have been increasing, the number of transactions and unique addresses are on the rise, and there is strong participation from investors. The technical indicators also show a buy sentiment, with potential for further price increases in the near term.

However, the news analyst report highlights some potential negative factors that could impact the market, such as increased scrutiny on cryptocurrency transfers to extremist organizations and challenges faced by Ethereum's Holesky testnet launch. These factors could create uncertainty and negative sentiment in the market.

Taking into consideration both reports, the overall market trend for ETH cryptocurrency appears to be bullish, with some potential risks to consider. Given the bullish sentiment and positive technical indicators, I am confident in the upward trend of ETH and will take a slightly aggressive approach.

The recent pump in Bitcoin above the $34,000 resistance sparked more upsides in ETH. There was a steady increase above the $1,720 and $1,750 resistance levels.\n\nThe price even cleared the key $1,800 resistance zone. A high is formed near $1,849 and the price is now consolidating gains. It is trading well above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,660 swing low to the $1,849 high.\n\nEthereum is now trading above $1,780 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support near $1,750 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The trend line is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,660 swing low to the $1,849 high.\n\nOn the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $1,850 level.

It embarked on a recovery journey, marking a higher low in November and subsequently achieving a higher peak in April compared to its August high.\n\nPost its $2,100 zenith, Ethereum managed to maintain its value above the $1,500 threshold, charting its course within a descending channel. This resilience stands in stark contrast to several altcoins that plummeted to new bearish lows post-April.\n\nThis descending trajectory Ethereum found itself in likely represented a corrective phase, characterized by a five-wave pattern. However, the tide seems to be turning. Starting from October 11, Ethereum has been exhibiting bullish signals, culminating in a breakout from this channel.\n\nThe rise of Ethereum from November 21 to mid-April presents an analytical conundrum. The movement, characterized by a five-wave impulse, is somewhat ambiguous in its interpretation due to the higher low on November 21.\n\nThis could mean that the surge is merely an extension of the previous ascending structure, rendering it a corrective phase rather than a new bullish cycle.\n\nHowever, there’s an alternative, more optimistic perspective. If we consider this rise as a smaller segment within a broader framework, it could be interpreted as just the initial sub-wave of a more extensive five-wave impulse.\n\nUnder this assumption, the descending channel that followed would represent the second wave of this larger cycle. If this interpretation holds, Ethereum could be poised for a significant upward trajectory. Wave 3, in this context, could propel the price to around $3,310. And if the momentum sustains, wave 5 could push the price even further, breaking previous boundaries.\n\nGiven the undeniable corrective nature of the descending channel, the odds currently favor a continuation of the upward trend for Ethereum. But does this imply an imminent new yearly high?\n\nThe current high, just a touch above $2,000, remains shy of the July 14 peak. By the tenets of technical analysis, this positions Ethereum in a downtrend since mid-April.\n\nHowever, a breach above the $2,000 mark, resulting in a higher high, would disrupt this bearish narrative. Such a move would not only signify a reversal of the downtrend but also set the stage for a potential new yearly high. Conversely, if the current surge falters and pivots into a decline, Ethereum might be subjected to further losses before it can embark on a genuine bull run.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nPlease note that the contents of this article are not financial or investing advice.

A testament to its struggles is the drastic dip in ETH’s total value locked (TVL) — plummeting from a whopping $108 billion in November 2021 to a mere $20 billion by October, marking an almost 82% drop.\n\nLet’s delve into the dynamics surrounding Ethereum and try to understand the current market sentiments, key metrics, and insights into what lies ahead for this crypto.\n\nDeclining NFT market\n\nIn Jan. 2023, Ethereum’s NFT space witnessed significant headwinds. The bustling activity that saw more than 28,000 NFTs being minted daily on Ethereum at the beginning of the year took a sharp downturn.\n\nETH NFT mints | Source: The Block\n\nAs of Oct. 20, that enthusiasm has waned, with daily mintings dropping below 3,500. This significant 88% decline can be attributed to increased competition from other blockchain networks, a possible oversupply, and the general volatility of the crypto market.\n\nTrading hasn’t been spared either. Platforms like OpenSea, once brimming with sales, observed a slowdown, particularly after the first quarter, hitting their lowest ebb by Sep. Moreover, from Q1 to Q2 2023, Ethereum’s NFT trading volume shrank by 39.6%, according to CoinGecko.\n\nParallel to the ebb in NFT momentum, 2023 also marked the entry of Ethscriptions. Launched in June, this platform aimed to transform the NFT space by allowing users to inscribe “non-financial data” on Ethereum’s network.\n\nHowever, its journey was riddled with hurdles. A major setback occurred when a prominent collection named Ethereum Punks had to be withdrawn from Ethscriptions’ official platform.\n\nAt the request of Yuga Labs, the owner of CryptoPunks, I am taking down the Ethereum Punks website, removing all Ethereum Punks images from https://t.co/ZcR9HKlexS, and deleting my Tweets that reference Ethereum Punks, including my Tweet introducing the Ethscriptions Protocol. — Middlemarch (@dumbnamenumbers) July 11, 2023\n\nThis action was taken upon a request from Yuga Labs, the entity behind CryptoPunks. The ripple effect of this removal was evident as it led to the deletion of numerous tweets by the creator of Ethscriptions, Middlemarch, including the pivotal one introducing the Ethscriptions Protocol.\n\nThese challenges faced by Ethereum’s NFT and Ethscriptions hint at broader concerns within the Ethereum ecosystem, shedding light on competitive, regulatory, and inherent protocol-based challenges.\n\nWhat do the metrics suggest?\n\nSeveral critical metrics can gauge Ethereum’s health and vibrancy. Let’s delve into these to unravel their story about Ethereum in 2023.\n\nETH daily transactions\n\nThese represent the number of transactions processed on the Ethereum blockchain within a day. In May 2023, this number averaged around 1.14 million, but by Oct. 20, it had diminished to 980,000, marking a 14% decline.\n\nEthereum daily transactions | Source: The Block\n\nWhy does this matter? A high transaction count typically indicates robust network usage and utility, making it a bellwether of network health.\n\nYou might also like: Vitalik Buterin discusses Ethereum’s future and innovative projects in AMA\n\nThe reduction hints at a reduced activity level, possibly due to competition from other blockchains or waning enthusiasm from users and developers.\n\nDaily active addresses\n\nThis metric denotes the number of unique addresses that actively send or receive Ethereum on a given day. In April 2023, the daily active addresses averaged 471,000, but this number dwindled to 369,000 by Oct. 20, showcasing a 21.7% drop.\n\nEthereum active addresses | Source: The Block\n\nIts significance lies in its ability to act as a pulse check for user engagement and network popularity. A declining trend in active addresses might imply that fewer users or entities are interacting with the Ethereum network, possibly signaling a shift of interest or a consolidation phase.\n\nDaily onchain volume\n\nRepresenting the total value (in USD) of all transactions on the Ethereum blockchain in a day, the daily onchain volume has witnessed a steady decline. From a substantial $3.92 billion in March, it shrank to $1.41 billion by Oct. 20, reflecting a 64% reduction.\n\nEthereum daily on-chain volume | Source: The Block\n\nThis metric is crucial because it sheds light on the monetary value of assets moving within the network. A decline might suggest that fewer high-value transactions are taking place or that the value of assets on Ethereum has decreased.\n\nETH transaction fee\n\nTransaction fees are payments made by users to compensate for the computational energy required to process and validate transactions on the Ethereum network. These fees had reached a staggering annual peak of $21.89 in May but have since nosedived to a mere $1.99 by Oct. 20, indicating a 90.9% decline.\n\nEthereum transaction fee | Source: The Block\n\nWhile high fees can be discouraging for users, leading to decreased network usage, the sharp decline might indicate improved network efficiency or reduced demand.\n\nNonetheless, it’s a double-edged sword. While it’s more cost-effective for users, it might be less profitable for miners, possibly leading to decreased network security in the long run.\n\nEthereum’s layer 2 evolution in 2023\n\nIn 2023, Ethereum’s layer 2 solutions (L2s) saw increased activity. As Ethereum faced various challenges, L2s emerged as an alternative solution, particularly in addressing scalability.\n\nThe TVL of Ethereum’s L2 platforms reached $10.62 billion as of Oct. 2023. Of these platforms, Arbitrum One recorded a market share of 54.76%. This TVL growth suggests a heightened activity within the L2 platforms.\n\nMeanwhile, centralized exchanges have begun to integrate L2 solutions. Coinbase‘s introduction of layer 2 Base indicates a growing interaction between centralized platforms and L2s.\n\nYou might also like: Coinbase launches Ethereum L2 network, Base\n\nIn terms of transaction activity, L2s recorded a higher transaction count than Ethereum’s mainnet during the year. This shift might be attributed to factors such as scalability issues and transaction costs on Ethereum’s mainnet.\n\nOn the financial front, Ethereum’s network revenue experienced a decline, decreasing by 33.3% from $1.27 billion in Q2 2022 to $847 million in Q2 2023. The value of ETH burned also saw a reduction of 35% over the same period. These changes align with the fluctuations observed in the broader crypto market.\n\nEthereum’s position in the decentralized finance sector, however, continues to be notable. The platform constitutes a considerable portion of DeFi’s TVL and is used for multiple on-chain stablecoins.\n\nIn summary, 2023 observed varied dynamics in Ethereum’s ecosystem, with L2 solutions gaining traction amid the platform’s overarching challenges.\n\nEthereum and the influence of spot ETFs\n\nMeanwhile, ETFs have taken center stage recently, with their potential to impact the price and adoption of cryptocurrencies significantly.\n\nGalaxy Digital Fund and Invesco have recently joined forces to delve into the Ethereum spot ETF market in the U.S. This makes them the fifth major player to do so, following in the footsteps of renowned entities like VanEck, ARK Invest, Hashdex, and Grayscale.\n\nHowever, it’s crucial to note that the road ahead for Ethereum spot ETFs is not without hurdles. In many ways, these spot ETFs’ fate is tied to that of Bitcoin spot ETFs.\n\nBefore Ethereum can enjoy the green light for its spot ETFs, Bitcoin spot ETFs are awaiting clearance from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Essentially, Ethereum’s move is pegged to Bitcoin’s lead in this dance of financial products.\n\nTheir introduction could play a pivotal role in influencing Ethereum’s price, adoption, and mainstream acceptance in the financial market.\n\nEthereum price prediction\n\nStandard Chartered’s Geoff Kendrick is optimistic about Ethereum, predicting it could surge past $8,000 and possibly reach between $26,000 and $35,000 by 2025-2026. He cites Ethereum’s growing use cases and the support from layer 2 blockchains as drivers for this growth.\n\nContrarily, analyst FieryTrading expects Ethereum to dip to around $900.\n\nWith such varied forecasts, traders should tread cautiously. It’s vital to remember: never invest more than you can afford to lose.\n\nThe road ahead\n\nAs we approach the end of 2023, Ethereum’s journey has been a roller coaster of highs and lows. From a peak TVL of $108 billion in 2021 to a significant dip to $20 billion this year, it reflects the volatility and uncertainty surrounding the crypto realm.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum’s once-booming NFT market has also faced headwinds, with daily mintings witnessing a sharp decline.\n\nLayer 2 solutions, like Arbitrum, have provided a silver lining, offering scalable alternatives and showing promise for Ethereum’s scalability concerns.\n\nEthereum’s next significant catalyst might lie in the realm of spot ETFs. With major players like Galaxy Digital Fund and Invesco entering the fray, the potential for Ethereum spot ETFs to drive price, adoption, and mainstream acceptance is palpable.\n\nYet, amidst optimistic forecasts of Ethereum reaching dizzying heights, caution is crucial. The crypto market remains unpredictable, and prudent decision-making remains the order of the day.\n\nYou might also like: Fake news on Bitcoin ETF approval: How rumors can sway the crypto market\n\nFollow Us on Google News'}].

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, it seems that the market trend for ETH may be turning bearish in the short term. The MACD signal and Bollinger Bands signal both indicate a potential bearish trend, suggesting a downward movement in the price of ETH.

However, the news analyst report paints a more positive picture for Ethereum, with potential for growth and positive momentum in the cryptocurrency market. The price of ETH has been on the rise, with key resistance levels being surpassed and potential for further gains. The SEC review of Grayscale's spot Ether ETF could also have a positive impact on Ethereum prices.

Considering both reports, it appears that there is a divergence in the market sentiment. While the on-chain analysis suggests a bearish trend, the news analysis points towards a bullish outlook for ETH.

Given the conflicting signals, I will take a cautious approach and lean towards the more conservative on-chain analysis. Therefore, I will sell 30% of my ETH position to capitalize on the potential bearish trend in the short term.

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
Based on the news articles provided, it can be observed that there are positive developments in the Ethereum ecosystem that could potentially impact the market trend positively. 

1. The first news article discusses the price prediction for Ethereum (ETH) and indicates a bullish sentiment in the market. The article mentions that Ethereum broke through its last swing high resistance at $1,745, signaling more room for an upward journey. The presence of supply pressure near the $1,800 level suggests a possible short-term pullback, but if the $1,745 level is validated as new support, it could pave the way for an extended rally targeting the $1,970 to $2,000 range. The Global In/Out of the Money metric also indicates that a significant majority of ETH holders are in a profitable position, reducing the likelihood of fear selling in the near term.

2. The second news article discusses Nocturne Labs raising $6 million in seed funding to bring private accounts to the Ethereum ecosystem and enable anonymous transactions. This development could potentially enhance privacy and security within the Ethereum network, which could be viewed positively by investors and users.

3. The third news article talks about Polygon Labs deploying the POL token on the Ethereum mainnet as part of the Polygon 2.0 upgrade.

ON-CHAIN ANALYST REPORT: Based on the recent information provided, we can see that the open price of ETH has been increasing over time, reaching a peak at 1785.56. The number of transactions and unique addresses have also been increasing, indicating growing interest and adoption of ETH. 

However, the value transferred has been fluctuating, with some peaks and dips along the way. The average gas price has been increasing steadily, which could potentially impact transaction costs for users. 

In terms of trading signals, the short-long moving average signal has been consistently indicating a buy, while the MACD signal has been fluctuating between buy and sell. The Bollinger Bands signal has also been changing, with the latest signal being a sell.

Overall, based on the information provided, it seems that the market trend for ETH is currently mixed. While there are some bullish indicators such as increasing open prices and number of transactions, there are also some bearish signals such as the sell signals from MACD and Bollinger Bands. Traders should proceed with caution and closely monitor the market for any potential changes in trend.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by the on-chain and news analysts, we can see that the market trend for ETH is currently mixed. While there are some bullish indicators such as increasing open prices, number of transactions, positive price predictions, and positive developments in the Ethereum ecosystem, there are also some bearish signals such as the sell signals from MACD and Bollinger Bands.

Considering the overall context, it seems that the positive developments and bullish sentiment in the market outweigh the bearish signals. Therefore, I predict that the market trend for ETH will be upwards in the near future.

Given this prediction, I suggest buying ETH with a confidence level of -0.6. This means that I am fairly confident in the upward trend and recommend investing 60% of the cash into buying ETH.

Action: -0.6

Rather, it’s occurring across other major cryptocurrencies as well.\n\n“At the same time, Bitcoin (BTC), Cardano (ADA), and Dai (DAI) are witnessing massive increases in whale activity themselves, with Bitcoin recording 14,833 of $100,000+ transactions on October 24, the most since June’s news of the multiple filings for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), according to the blockchain platform’s analysis,” observed Finbold.\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Beyond Basic Beta Channel.\n\nPOPULAR ARTICLES AND RESOURCES FROM ETFTRENDS.COM\n\n\n\nREAD MORE AT ETFTRENDS.COM >'}, {'id': 3, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8venljcnlwdG8uY29tL2V0aGVyZXVtLWZhY2VzLWNyaXRpY2FsLXRlc3QtYXQtMTk2MC1hcy1tYXNzaXZlLTMzLW1pbGxpb24tZXRoLXJlc2lzdGFuY2UtZW1lcmdlcy_SAWtodHRwczovL3p5Y3J5cHRvLmNvbS9ldGhlcmV1bS1mYWNlcy1jcml0aWNhbC10ZXN0LWF0LTE5NjAtYXMtbWFzc2l2ZS0zMy1taWxsaW9uLWV0aC1yZXNpc3RhbmNlLWVtZXJnZXMvP2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Thu, 26 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Ethereum Faces Critical Test At $1,960 As Massive 33 Million ETH Resistance Emerges - ZyCrypto', 'content': 'Advertisement\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has been making significant strides in recent weeks, riding on the wave of positive developments in the crypto industry.\n\nOver the past seven days, Ether has witnessed a remarkable surge of 16%. However, its primary rival, Bitcoin, has outpaced it with a 20% surge during the same period. Notably, this surge saw Ethereum breaking key resistance at $1,745, sparking optimism among investors and analysts.\n\nDespite these gains, Ethereum’s upward momentum is now at a critical juncture. The crypto community is closely monitoring a formidable resistance level at $1,960, which has raised concerns.\n\nOn Thursday, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez took to Twitter to shed light on this impending challenge, stating, “When will Ethereum break out? Well, you may need to wait for $ETH to overcome the huge supply wall at $1,960. Here, 1.14 million addresses bought nearly 33 million ETH, according to data from Into the Block.”\n\nThis said resistance level, often referred to as a “buy wall,” represents a level where a substantial amount of Ethereum was bought in the past. Investors who bought then may be inclined to sell their Ethereum at this price point, which can act as a significant barrier to further price appreciation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, the close correlation between Ethereum and Bitcoin has been evident, where changes in one frequently impact the other. In another tweet, Martinez pointed out that Bitcoin’s potential 5% correction to $33,000, driven by its formation of an ascending triangle on the hourly chart, a move that could trigger a similar selloff in Ethereum.\n\nAdding to Martinez’s views, crypto analyst ‘Cryptotony’ also presented a bearish perspective on Ethereum, telling his 346,000 X followers that the cryptocurrency might gain momentum and test the $2,500 resistance zone before entering a distribution phase and possibly decline leading up to the next halving event.\n\nAnother analyst, ‘Cryptonary,’ emphasized the significance of Ethereum’s ongoing test, stating that it was crucial to determine whether the bulls could break through the resistance at $1,960 or if Ethereum would echo Bitcoin’s overbought signals.\n\nNotably, the pundit’s technical analysis revealed that Ethereum had been oscillating between support at $1,745 and resistance at $1,823-$1,853, with no clear breakout yet. Additionally, he noted that the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) was overbought but not as extended as Bitcoin’s.\n\nThat said, as Ethereum faces a pivotal moment along the $1,960 resistance level, the outcome of this test will determine whether Ethereum can continue its recent bullish trend, plunge or face a period of consolidation.\n\nEther was trading at $1,796 at press time after a 0.32% increase over the past 24 hours.'}, {'id': 6, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vYmxvY2t3b3Jrcy5jby9uZXdzL2V0aGVyZXVtLWRldmVsb3BlcnMtaGFyZC1mb3Jr0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Thu, 26 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Core devs rule out Dencun fork this year - Blockworks', 'content': 'Ethereum client developers confirmed on Thursday that the anticipated Dencun upgrade will not be implemented in a network hard fork before the end of 2023.\n\nAlready last month, when the new Holešky testnet was successfully launched behind schedule, the consensus was that putting the upgrade through its paces by the time December holidays rolled around was unlikely.\n\nWhen an optimistic scenario was put forward on today’s All Core Developers call, the consensus was evidently with pseudonymous Prysm developer Potuz, who commented, “there is no way we are forking mainnet in 2023.”\n\nHe pointed to consistent consensus issues arising on the 10 developer networks (devnets) that have been spun up so far to test the upgrade over the past few months, adding that “not a single one went well.”\n\nRead more: Devnet, testnet, mainnet: Ethereum’s next upgrade progresses — slowly\n\nEthereum clients are divided into two main camps, one for the execution layer and the other the consensus layer, with the distinction reflected in the name of the upgrade — consensus teams use cities where Ethereum’s major conference, Devcon, has been held (e.g. Cancun), while execution client developers opt for star names (e.g. Deneb) — hence “Dencun.”\n\nIn contrast to the consensus teams, execution layer client teams reported being in good shape for the upcoming testnets.\n\n“We are in a pretty good place, a lot of things are also on Master now,” said Geth developer known as Lightclient, referring to the Go Ethereum project’s digital workspace where the code, files, and revision history are stored.\n\nDevnet 10 was launched this week, with plans for the execution clients to transition to a larger test on the Goerli testnet. But Prysm’s Potuz is not on board with that idea.\n\n“I’m definitely not comfortable at all having a full client fork on Goerli,” he said. “I see very large and deep changes still being pushed in the branch,” he added regarding Prysm, the software currently runs 45% of the consensus layer clients.\n\nA smaller Devnet 11 is planned, but it now appears the move to testnets will be put off until after Ethereum’s Devconnect developer conference, which will be held in Istanbul in mid-November.\n\nCelebrating the KZG ceremony\n\nThe Dencun upgrade required a bit of fancy cryptography to ensure the Ethereum scaling improvement, known as Proto-Danksharding, a key feature, remains secure.\n\nThe KZG Ceremony involved multiple participants, each concocting a secret and performing a computation to blend it with preceding contributions. This process results in the formation of a “structured reference string” (SRS), which is crucial for the KZG Commitments cryptographic scheme, and integral to Proto-Danksharding.\n\nThe final outcome of this chain of contributions is then put into the upgrade. The whole setup remains secure so long as there is at least one honest participant in the ceremony. After months of soliciting contributions, a total of 141,416 makes that all but certain.\n\nCarl Beekhuizen, who coordinated the ceremony for the Ethereum Foundation, invited participants to verify that their contributions are, in fact, included, by visiting ceremony.ethereum.org.\n\nThere, one can input a contributing wallet address, and receive a commemorative POAP NFT.\n\nDon’t miss the next big story – join our free daily newsletter.'}].

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, the market trend for ETH cryptocurrency is currently uncertain, with mixed signals from various indicators. The short-long moving average signal is indicating a buy trend, while the MACD signal is showing a sell trend, and the Bollinger Bands signal is also indicating a sell trend. This conflicting information suggests that the market is currently in a state of indecision.

On the other hand, the news analyst report paints a more positive picture for Ethereum in the short term, with signs of a potential rally and positive sentiment surrounding the cryptocurrency. The news of Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin's gains, increased activity from Ethereum whales, and the potential for a significant price surge all point towards a bullish outlook for ETH.

Considering both reports, while the on-chain indicators are showing mixed signals, the positive sentiment and potential rally highlighted in the news analyst report suggest a more bullish trend for Ethereum in the short term. Therefore, I would recommend buying ETH with a confidence level of 0.7 to take advantage of the potential price appreciation in the near future.

Three of the most popular digital assets out there, Bitcoin (BTC 7.29%), Ethereum (ETH 4.41%) and Dogecoin (DOGE 24.05%), each saw impressive gains. As of 12:45 p.m. ET on Friday, these three top-10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization rose 14.7%, 10.4% and 15.4%, respectively, over the past seven days.\n\nIt shouldn\'t be surprising for many investors to see Bitcoin lead the market higher, as that\'s par for the course for this space. With roughly half the market cap of the entire crypto sector, the direction Bitcoin moves on a given week typically determines how other digital assets perform.\n\nAccordingly, one might view this week\'s news that a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) could be hitting the market sooner than thought as the rising tide that\'s lifting all boats. I certainly think there\'s something to that.\n\nWith that said, let\'s dive into what specifically drove these three cryptos higher over the past week and where they may be headed from here.\n\nBitcoin ETF launch dominates the crypto news cycle\n\nIt\'s been a busy week in the world of crypto, with the Sam Bankman-Fried trial ongoing, various macro-data releases impacting monetary policy decisions released, and a flurry of token-specific news that\'s been enough to make the heads of many investors in the market spin. Of course, this week\'s Bitcoin news has dominated the headlines, and for good reason.\n\nEssentially, a number of hints that Blackrock\'s spot Bitcoin ETF will finally be pushed over the goal line have materialized this week, with this ETF reportedly being listed on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation database under the ticker IBTC.\n\nThis ticker appears to have been taken down and put back up again, but the fact that we\'re seeing this ticker listed is apparently enough of a catalyst for crypto bulls to point to. Many believe this could be the moment Bitcoin is officially viewed as \'open for investment\' for institutional investors, much in the same way gold ETFs made investing in precious metals much simpler and more attractive for money managers.\n\nOn that note, I\'ve been reading a number of interesting analyses on this topic, with many experts attempting to quantify what a spot Bitcoin ETF could mean for the digital currency in terms of capital inflows into Bitcoin and the broader sector as a whole. Right now, I think most of these reports require a great deal of guesswork, so I\'m not sure how much credence to give these. However, I do think it\'s true that Bitcoin and Ethereum (assuming a spot Ethereum ETF is next, which would be 100% logical) will receive a big boost from a rush of capital into these alternative assets.\n\nOther, more speculative altcoins, such as Dogecoin, may be well positioned to ride a wave of momentum higher. Dogecoin\'s price action typically takes its cue from the directional forces created by Bitcoin and Ethereum in a given week.\n\nIndeed, the fact that Dogecoin has moved even higher than Bitcoin and Ethereum on broadly bullish market sentiment outlines the value this token provides traders as a higher-beta option in this space. A number of experts continue to point to "irrational exuberance" when discussing Dogecoin\'s price action over the past few days as the key driver of this token. I tend to agree.\n\nWhere are these three tokens headed from here?\n\nIt\'s clear that there\'s robust reason for Bitcoin and Ethereum to be up this week. As for the rest of the market, animal spirits appear to remain high, which is a great thing for crypto speculators banking on yet another catalyst-driven bull run over the near term.\n\nThat said, the extent to which this rally can be sustained beyond a few days remains to be seen. Once a spot Bitcoin ETF is launched (and maybe a similar Ethereum option), it\'s unclear whether the bullish momentum that\'s driven valuations higher can continue. Indeed, it could be the latest "buy the rumor, sell the news" event. We\'ll see.\n\nIt\'s my view that now may be a good time to take a cautious view of this space and wait for the dust to settle before stepping in. These three tokens have made nice moves over the past week, for sure. Let\'s just see whether these gains will be held before jumping in to ride this latest leg higher.'}].

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by the on-chain and news analysts, it is clear that the market trend for ETH is currently bearish. The fluctuating open prices, sell signals from the MACD and Bollinger Bands, and overall uncertainty in the market suggest that caution should be exercised.

The news of Ethereum's Dencun upgrade and positive price movements in Bitcoin and Ethereum are positive factors, but the potential impact of the Bitcoin and Ethereum options expiry and the launch of a spot Bitcoin ETF could introduce volatility and uncertainty into the market.

Considering the bearish trend and potential volatility, I would recommend selling ETH to minimize risk and potentially capitalize on any downward movement in the market. Given the current market conditions, I would suggest selling 0.7 (sell 70% ETH).

Despite this, the asset is facing headwinds as Bitcoin struggles to break past the $35,000 mark, leading to increased selling pressure across the crypto market.

If the ETH price can maintain a price above $1,750, there might be an opportunity for buyers to break out from the falling wedge pattern’s upper trendline.

While both projects share many similarities, there are still major differences between them. Understanding the key differences between SOL and ETH can help investors and traders make informed decisions to maximize their investments. But what factors should one take into consideration when doing a Solana vs Ethereum analysis? Here, we deep dive into the key aspects that differentiate SOL from ETH and vice versa.\n\nAbout Solana\n\nSolana, or SOL, was created by software developer Anatoly Yakovenko, who first proposed the project in 2017 and finally launched it in 2020. The coin takes inspiration from Etherum and was eventually created to improve upon Etherum. Many crypto enthusiasts and experts considered Solana a potential ‘Ethereum killer.’\n\nSolana emerged as a new-generation crypto coin that addressed several shortcomings of popular tokens launched before it. The coin’s transactions are conducted on the Solana blockchain, which uses a proof-of-history consensus mechanism instead of a proof-of-work mechanism used by popular initial coins like Bitcoin.\n\nIn layman’s terms, the proof-of-work mechanism depends on miners to unearth the next block and is slow and has a high energy demand. In comparison, the proof-of-history consensus mechanism is fast and requires 99.9% less energy. This is one of the main reasons why Solana took on the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum right from the beginning.\n\nAbout Ethereum\n\nEthereum, or ETH, which was first proposed by Vitalik Buterin in his white paper in 2013, was finally launched in 2015. Buterin was joined by Gavin Wood, Charles Hoskinson, Amir Chetrit, Anthony Di Iorio, Jeffrey Wilcke, Joseph Lubin, and Mihai Alisie, who further developed and popularised the project its way to the second-largest blockchain project in the world, only behind Bitcoin.\n\nETH is the native currency of Ethereum, a decentralized blockchain that offers smart contract functionality. However, the project was also plagued with issues related to proof-of-work until September 2022, when it shifted to a proof-of-stake mechanism. The move helped it become more fast and reduced its energy needs by over 99%, making it more efficient.\n\nSolana Vs. Ethereum : An Overview\n\nSolana and Ethereum are two of the most widely used crypto tokens globally. But to better understand how these two crypto coins are pitting against each other, we have taken several factors into consideration to provide you with a detailed snapshot.\n\nGoogle Trends: Solana Vs Ethereum\n\nGoogle Trends is one of the key metrics to determine the interest of crypto enthusiasts in particular coins. For the past 12 months in 2023, Ethereum clearly has the edge over Solana in terms of search volumes and interest of the global crypto community.\n\nCaption: Interest over time of Solana and Ethereum {Solana (Blue); Ethereum (Red)}\n\nActive Addresses: Solana Vs. Ethereum\n\nActive Addresses is another important metric that can give you an insight into the adoption of a coin. In simple terms, an active address is a crypto address that has become a direct participant in a successful transaction. It can be either the sender’s or receiver’s address.\n\nActive Addresses Solana\n\nSolana’s active addresses, which peaked at around 39.64 million in April 2022, are nowhere close to its days of glory. However, the token has witnessed a decent rise in active addresses in the last 30 days. In October 2023, active addresses on Solana stood at 5.33 million as of 28 October.\n\nActive Addresses Ethereum\n\nThere’s no doubt that Ethereum is a more popular crypto coin than Solana. Therefore, naturally, the former has a more stable number of active addresses than the latter. In October, Ethereum’s number of active addresses was 10.35 million as of 28 October.\n\nMonthly Transactions (Solana & Ethereum)\n\nMonthly transactions in crypto refer to the buying, selling, and exchanging of digital currencies within a given month. Comparing Ethereum and Solana’s monthly transactions will help you understand which coin is being preferred for transactions by crypto enthusiasts.\n\nSolana Monthly Transactions\n\nNon-vote Solana transactions peaked in November 2021 at 1.5 billion. The last time it was near the 1 billion mark was in July 2022. The number of non-vote transactions has kept fluctuating since then. In October, the number of non-vote transactions showed improvement. As of 28 October, the number of non-vote transactions was up at 550.4 million from 494.7 million in September and 519.83 million in August 2023.\n\nEthereum Monthly Transactions\n\nIn terms of monthly transactions, Ethereum made a record in May 2021, when the token was involved in 20.27 transactions. While ETH’s number of transactions has fallen since then, it has remained stable in the range of 12 million to 17 million. However, in October, the number of Ethereum-based transactions could see a serious fall as it stands at 10.35 million as of 28 October.\n\nAlso Read : Shiba Inu Vs Dogecoin : A Deep Dive Into The Ecosystem\n\nPrice Chart: Solana Vs Ethereum\n\nAnalyzing and comparing Solana and Ethereum price charts can provide key insights that can help in making informed decisions. CoinGape price comparison chart above demonstrates price trend and market performances of both Solana and Ethereum. While Ethereum price is up by over 85%, Solana price is surging significantly by more than 450% as of December 2023 in the last 12 months.\n\nMarket Cap & Trading Volume: Solana Vs Ethereum\n\nThe market cap of cryptocurrencies gives an indication of the coin’s value and size. Ethereum, being the more popular crypto coin, clearly has a higher market cap of over $284 billion while Solana has a market cap of $32billion. On the other hand, Ethereum’s circulating supply at present stands at 120.2 million and that of Solana’s is at 425.9 million.\n\nComing to the trading volume of both the cryptocurrencies, Ethereum’s trading volume stands at over $12 billion with a decrease of 23% in the last 24 hours as of December 9, 2023. And, Solana’s trading volume is more than $3 billion and is down by 21% in the last 24 hours.\n\nConclusion : Which coin is more popular ?\n\nEthereum and Solana are two of the most popular cryptocurrencies in today’s time. Both the coins have found several use cases, and are witnessing an increased adoption in multiple areas. At present, with a larger market cap and higher active addresses, it’s clear that Ethereum is finding more traction among crypto users.

Based on the news articles provided, it appears that Ethereum (ETH) is experiencing positive developments in terms of Total Value Locked (TVL) in Layer-2 platforms, with a new all-time high reached. Additionally, there are indications of a potential price breakout for Ethereum, with a price prediction suggesting a possible cross of $2,000 in the near future. On the other hand, Solana (SOL) is also showing signs of a breakout and potential outperformance compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum, according to a top analyst.

Taking into consideration the positive developments for both Ethereum and Solana, it is likely that the overall market trend for ETH and SOL could be bullish in the short to medium term. Investors and traders may consider monitoring these cryptocurrencies closely for potential trading opportunities.

You are an experienced ETH cryptocurrency trader and you are trying to maximize your overall profit by trading ETH. In each day, you will make an action to buy or sell ETH. You will start with 1 million dollars, half in cash and half in ETH. You are assisted by a few analysts below and need to decide the final action.

ON-CHAIN ANALYST REPORT: Based on the provided information, we can see that the open price of ETH has been fluctuating between 1664.57 and 1804.16. The number of transactions, unique addresses, value transferred, average gas price, total gas used, and successful transactions have also been varying over the given period.

The technical indicators such as short-long moving average signal, MACD signal, and Bollinger Bands signal are showing mixed trends. The short-long moving average signal has been switching between buy and sell, while the MACD signal and Bollinger Bands signal have consistently been indicating a sell or hold.

Overall, the market trend for ETH appears to be uncertain and volatile. It is recommended to closely monitor the technical indicators and market conditions to make informed trading decisions.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, we can see that the market trend for ETH is uncertain and volatile. The technical indicators are showing mixed signals, with the short-long moving average signal switching between buy and sell, while the MACD signal and Bollinger Bands signal consistently indicating a sell or hold. This suggests that the market for ETH is currently indecisive and could potentially go either way.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights positive developments for Ethereum, such as the increase in Total Value Locked in Layer-2 platforms and a potential price breakout towards $2,000. Additionally, Solana is also showing signs of a breakout and potential outperformance compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum. This indicates a bullish market trend for both ETH and SOL in the short to medium term.

Considering the conflicting signals from the technical indicators and the positive news developments, I believe that the overall market trend for ETH is likely to be bullish in the near future. Therefore, I would recommend buying ETH with a confidence level of 0.7. 

Action: -0.7 (buy with 70% cash)

Based on the provided information, we can see that the short-long moving average signal has been consistently indicating a "sell" trend. Additionally, the MACD signal and Bollinger Bands signal have also been indicating a "sell" trend. 

The number of transactions, unique addresses, and value transferred have been fluctuating, but overall, they have been relatively stable. The average gas price has been increasing, which could indicate increased activity on the Ethereum network.

Considering all these factors, it seems that the market trend for ETH is currently bearish. Traders and investors may want to exercise caution and consider selling or holding their positions until there is a clear indication of a trend reversal.

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
Based on the news articles provided, it is evident that there is a positive sentiment surrounding Ethereum (ETH) and Cosmos (ATOM) in the cryptocurrency market.

For Ethereum (ETH), the price has seen a significant rally, with key levels to watch being $1,727 and $1,650. If ETH can hold above these levels, there is potential for a move towards $2,000 and beyond. However, a breakdown below $1,650 could invalidate the bullish thesis and lead to a potential retest of lower support levels.

On the other hand, Cosmos (ATOM) has experienced a notable increase in active users, with a growth of 182% in the last 30 days. This positive development has not yet reflected in the price of ATOM, which has remained relatively stable. The expansion of the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol and the project's focus on development activity are contributing factors to the increased user adoption.

Overall, the market trend for Ethereum (ETH) appears to be bullish if key support levels are maintained, while Cosmos (ATOM) is showing positive growth in user adoption and development activity. Traders and investors may consider monitoring these key levels and developments to make informed decisions in the cryptocurrency market.

Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, we can see that the short-long moving average, MACD signal, and Bollinger Bands signal are all indicating a "sell" trend for ETH. This suggests that the market trend for ETH is currently bearish. Additionally, the news analyst report highlights a positive sentiment surrounding Ethereum, with potential for a move towards $2,000 and beyond if key support levels are maintained.

Considering both reports, it is clear that there is a divergence in the market sentiment. While the on-chain analysis points towards a bearish trend, the news analysis suggests a bullish outlook for ETH. In this case, it is important to weigh the technical indicators against the fundamental news to make an informed decision.

Given the conflicting signals, I would lean towards the on-chain analysis as it provides a more concrete indication of the current market trend. Therefore, I would recommend selling ETH with a confidence level of -0.6. This means selling 60% of the ETH holdings and holding onto the remaining 40% in cash.

They presented a range of scenarios, with the most conservative estimate being $9.81 and the most optimistic projection reaching a remarkable $3,211.28, depicting a 10,000% surge in price.\n\nOne of the most compelling aspects of VanEck’s prediction is their belief that Solana could become the first blockchain to host an application that onboards over 100 million users. As per the firm, this achievement would be a significant milestone in the blockchain industry and a game-changer for SOL’s adoption and value.\n\nNotably, the report assumed that Solana will monetize at only 20% of Ethereum’s take rate, indicating that even a relatively modest market share could result in substantial returns for SOL token holders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFurthermore, the firm suggested that Solana might achieve less than half of Ethereum’s market share due to fundamental differences in community philosophy. This perspective highlights that while Ethereum emphasizes decentralization and community governance, Solana has taken a more pragmatic approach to scalability and speed, which could attract a different set of users and developers.\n\nVanEck’s optimistic outlook is based on its vision of a credible path to $8 billion in revenues for SOL token holders by 2030. If this prediction materializes, it would not only be a significant achievement for Solana but also a testament to the growth and potential of the broader blockchain ecosystem.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has been characterized by its volatility and rapid changes, making long-term predictions a challenging endeavour. However, VanEck has positioned itself to take on the crypto market with safer vehicles.\n\nLast Friday, the New York-based firm submitted a revised application for the highly-anticipated Bitcoin Spot ETF, aligning itself with industry leaders such as BlackRock, Ark Invest, and Fidelity, all eager to capitalize on the promising future of the world’s largest cryptocurrency.\n\nAt press time, SOL was trading at $34.65, marking an impressive 6.8% gain in the last 24 hours, possibly spurred by the recent report. Notably, the cryptocurrency has been the top performer among the top 20 coins in the past week, with a substantial 19% increase, according to CoinMarketCap data.'}, {'id': 13, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vY3J5cHRvcG90YXRvLmNvbS9kb2dlY29pbi1ldGhlcmV1bS1hbmQtZXZlcmxvZGdlLXBvaXNlZC10by1zdXJnZS1oZXJlcy13aHkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Mon, 30 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Dogecoin, Ethereum, and Everlodge Poised to Surge: Here's Why - CryptoPotato", 'content': 'Dogecoin, Ethereum, and Everlodge are amongst the more interesting altcoins to watch in the ongoing crypto rally.\n\nAlbeit different, all of these projects are attempting to position themselves the best they can for what seems to be a much-anticipated bull market.\n\nSummary:\n\nDogecoin’s price pumps 5.2%.\n\nAli Martinez predicts Ethereum to reach $1,900.\n\nEverlodge’s price has increased from $0.02 to $0.023.\n\nVisit the Everlodge presale and win a luxury holiday to the Maldives\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) Aiming To Surpass the $0.07 Level\n\nDogecoin, the original meme coin has been popular ever since its launch back in 2021.

The meme coin hit an all-time high of $0.7376 in May 2021 before plummeting to the $0.06 level in October 2023.\n\nDespite this significant price drop, Dogecoin still remains a top ten largest crypto ranked by market capitalization. As of the time of this writing, the price of Dogecoin recently jumped by 7.7% to reach $0.069.\n\nAlso, there was an increase in DOGE’s trading volume, highlighting increasing support for the meme coin. As a result, some analysts have predicted that the Dogecoin price could aim for the $0.07 mark and potentially surpass it in the coming days.\n\nEthereum (ETH) To Reach $1,900\n\nOn October 20th, crypto analyst, Ali Martinez, told his Twitter followers that Ethereum is heading for the $1,900 level. According to the analysts, ETH has formed an ascending triangle pattern, which is a bullish formation.\n\nAli said Ethereum is “ready” to bounce off the ascending triangle’s hypotenuse. Moreover, the analyst emphasized that the Ethereum coin must close above the 18-day SMA (around $1,745) to reach $1,900. As of October 30th, the price of Ethereum has increased by 8.1% in the past week to hit $1,818.\n\nEthereum’s price has shown great recovery together with the rest of the crypto market.

Everlodge is working on a blockchain real estate marketplace. It will allow more people to invest in vacation homes, hotels, and fancy villas.\n\nWhat makes Everlodge unique over traditional platforms is its NFT fractionalization approach to property co-ownership.

Besides, users get extra benefits on the platform.\n\nIn addition, investors can trade their NFTs on Everlodge or other ERC-20 compatible marketplaces.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report and news analyst report, the overall market trend for ETH appears to be bearish. The technical indicators such as the short-long moving average signal, MACD signal, and Bollinger Bands signal all point towards a sell trend. Additionally, the news articles highlight potential challenges and competition for Ethereum in the future, which could further impact its price.

Considering the bearish market trend and the potential challenges ahead for Ethereum, I would recommend selling ETH to maximize profit. Given the current market conditions and the negative outlook, I would suggest a confident sell action with a value of 0.8 (sell 80% ETH). This indicates a high level of confidence in the bearish trend and the decision to reduce exposure to ETH in order to mitigate potential losses.

Most recently, the dYdX Chain has marked a significant milestone by launching a native chain and moving to an L1 token, DYDX.\n\nThe project departed from its previous ERC-20 token framework on Ethereum’s layer two protocol. The project says the migration means better network governance, heightened security, and functionality, and a new revenue distribution model for validators and stakers.\n\ndYdX Chain’s Transition to L1 Token, DYDX\n\nOn Wednesday, October 26, the dYdX Chain mainnet finally went live after the unveiling of its new L1 token. The first block was created by the Genesis Validators, as announced by the Operations subDAO (Ops subDAO). The move is a significant paradigm shift from its previous reliance on an ERC-20 token on Ethereum’s layer two protocol.\n\nThis transition, following a community vote, expands the staking opportunities, which aims to bolster the blockchain. Moreover, the project claims that the shift amplifies the protocol’s governance capabilities and reallocates the protocol’s revenue streams.\n\nThrough this transition, the dYdX Chain says its framework will be more closely with the decentralized ethos of blockchain technology. The L1 token also marks a step towards a self-sustained, community-driven blockchain ecosystem. Importantly, all fees collected by the protocol, which include trading fees denominated in USDC and gas fees for DYDX-denominated transactions or USDC-denominated transactions, are distributed to Validators and Stakers, creating a direct financial benefit for network participants.\n\nWhat Is dYdX?\n\nAt its core, dYdX is a leading decentralized exchange supporting perpetual trading. It operates on smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, allowing users to trade without intermediaries.\n\nThe project’s features include perpetual trading on Layer-2 with up to 20x leverage, offering pairs like BTC-USD, ETH-USD, and LINK-USD, among others\u200b2\u200b. This aspect of dYdX demonstrates its commitment to providing advanced financial services in a decentralized manner.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nEthereum, where dYdX initially operated, is one of the most decentralized networks in the blockchain space.\n\ndYdX Chain might face an uphill battle to prove its chain is more decentralized than Ethereum.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nThe emergence of dYdX Chain and its L1 Token, dYDx, is a significant stride towards achieving a self-sustainable and community-governed blockchain ecosystem. It showcases the potential for blockchain projects to evolve and adapt to community needs while enhancing network security and governance.\n\nRead more about decentralized exchanges like dYdX:\n\nDecentralized Exchanges: Crypto’s Wild West or Blockchain Essential?\n\n\n\nRead more about Solana’s positive performance:\n\nUnpacking Solana’s 7% Price Jump: What You Need to Know'}, {'id': 18, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NidGMuY29tL25ld3MvZXRoZXJldW0vZXRoZXJldW0tYmVhcmlzaC1tdnJ2LWVudGVyZWQtZGFuZ2VyLXpvbmUv0gFUaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmV3c2J0Yy5jb20vbmV3cy9ldGhlcmV1bS9ldGhlcmV1bS1iZWFyaXNoLW12cnYtZW50ZXJlZC1kYW5nZXItem9uZS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Tue, 31 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Ethereum Bearish Signal: MVRV Has Entered The “Danger” Zone - NewsBTC', 'content': 'On-chain data shows the Ethereum Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio has entered inside a danger zone that has historically led to tops.\n\nEthereum MVRV Ratio Has Surged Into The Danger Zone Recently\n\nIn its latest insight post, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has talked about some underlying metrics related to ETH. First, the firm has pointed out how the trading volume of the cryptocurrency has gone down since Ethereum’s surge from a few days back.\n\nThe value of the metric has been sharply going down recently | Source: Santiment\n\nThe trading volume observing a significant decline while the price is trying to continue its rally could indicate that momentum is weakening for the cryptocurrency.\n\nOne positive for the asset, though, could be the fact that the supply on exchanges has gone down since the rally started, implying that the investors have made net withdrawals.\n\nLooks like the metric has plunged | Source: Santiment\n\nGenerally, investors transfer their Ethereum out of these central entities to hold onto it in self-custodial wallets for extended periods, so this decline in the supply on exchanges could be a sign of fresh accumulation.\n\nFollowing the latest rise in the asset, its social dominance has also seen a jump. The “social dominance” here refers to the mindshare that Ethereum occupies on social media platforms among the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap.\n\nInterest around ETH has grown in the last few days | Source: Santiment\n\nIt would appear that more eyes have been turning at Ethereum recently, which can be a sign that hype is building up among the traders. Historically, too much hype has been negative for the asset, as it has often led to top formations.\n\nSo far, though, the social dominance is still notably below the levels it was at when ETH hit its local top at the start of this month, as is apparent in the above chart. According to Santiment, this “may suggest there can be some room for it to go before things cool down.”\n\nA signal that is more concretely bearish for Ethereum, however, is the 30-day MVRV ratio. In simple terms, what this ratio tells us is how the value that investors are holding (the market cap) compares against the capital that they invested into the asset (the realized cap).\n\nThe indicator appears to have entered the danger zone | Source: Santiment\n\nHere, Santiment has used the 30-day MVRV ratio, which means this indicator only keeps track of the investors/addresses who bought their coins within the last 30 days.\n\nAs shown in the chart, this Ethereum indicator has recently risen into a territory that the analytics firm labels as a “danger zone.” Historically, the price has seen a correction not too long after the metric has reached this zone so another local top may be due for Ethereum right now.\n\nETH Price\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at around $1,800, up 1% in the past week.\n\nETH has been stuck in consolidation recently | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Kanchanara on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, Santiment.net\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Its smart contract functionality revolutionized the crypto space and enabled the birth of countless decentralized applications and platforms. The recent surge in DEX volumes underscores its pivotal role in facilitating crypto trading.\n\nAs the crypto world closely watches developments surrounding BlackRock’s potential ETFs, Ethereum’s future appears promising.

Buterin also highlights “almost-EVMs” like zkSync, extensions like Arbitrum Stylus and zero-knowledge proof pioneers Starknet as important players driving scaling technology for the ecosystem:\n\n“One of the inevitable consequences of this is that we are seeing a trend of layer 2 projects becoming more heterogeneous. I expect this trend to continue, for a few key reasons.”\n\nButerin notes that some projects currently existing as independent layer 1s are looking to bring themselves closer to the Ethereum ecosystem and potentially become ecosystem layer 2s.\n\nRelated: Polygon’s ‘holy grail’ Ethereum-scaling zkEVM beta hits mainnet\n\nThis type of transition remains difficult, as an “all at once” approach would cause a decrease in usability given that technology is not at a stage where it can be completely included in rollup technology. Meanwhile, postponing such a transition runs the risk of “sacrificing momentum and being too late to be meaningful.”\n\nButerin also notes that some centralized, non-Ethereum projects want to give users greater security assurances and are looking to blockchain-based solutions. Historically, these types of projects would have looked to “permissioned consortium chains” to achieve this:\n\n“Realistically, they probably only need a “halfway-house” level of decentralization. Additionally, their often very high level of throughput makes them unsuitable even for rollups, at least in the short term.”\n\nLastly, Buterin considers non-financial applications like games and social media platforms that want to be decentralized but do not need high levels of security. Highlighting a social media use case, Buterin notes that different parts of the app would require separate functionality:\n\n“Rare and high-value activity like username registration and account recovery should be done on a rollup, but frequent and low-value activity like posts and votes need less security.“\n\nHe adds that a chain failure leading to a user’s post disappearing would be an “acceptable cost,” while a similar failure leading to the loss of an account would be far more serious.\n\nRelated: Vitalik Buterin voices concerns over DAOs approving ETH staking pool operators\n\nButerin also notes that the costs associated with paying for rollup fees might not be acceptable for non-blockchain users, while previous blockchain users are used to paying far higher prices for on-chain interactions.\n\nAn excerpt from Buterin’s latest blog post on the Ethereum ecosystem titled “Different types of layer 2s.” Source: vitalik.eth.limo\n\nThe Ethereum co-founder then delves into the trade-offs between different rollup solutions and systems that offer varying scaling capabilities to the ecosystem. The “connectedness” to Ethereum hinges on the security of withdrawing to Ethereum from layer 2s and the security of reading data from the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nRelated: Ethereum’s proto-danksharding to make rollups 10x cheaper — Consensys zkEVM Linea head\n\nButerin notes that high security and tight connectedness are important for some applications, while others require something looser in exchange for greater scalability:\n\n“In many cases, starting with something looser today, and moving to a tighter coupling over the next decade as technology improves, may well be optimal.”\n\nEthereum’s next scheduled hard fork is set to introduce EIP-4844, commonly referred to as “proto-dank sharding.” The EIP is expected to drastically increase the amount of data availability of the network. Buterin also notes that improvements in data compression enable greater functionality.\n\nMagazine: Ethereum restaking: Blockchain innovation or dangerous house of cards?'}].

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by the on-chain and news analysts, it is clear that the market trend for ETH is currently bearish. The technical indicators, such as the short-long moving average signal, MACD signal, and Bollinger Bands signal, all suggest a sell sentiment. Additionally, the news of FTX moving a significant amount of ETH, the bearish MVRV ratio, and the potential impact of dYdX Chain transitioning away from Ethereum's layer two protocol all point towards a downward trend in the near future.

Considering the bearish market trend and the potential negative impact of the recent news on ETH, I would recommend selling ETH to maximize profit. Given the confidence in the bearish trend, I would suggest a sell action with a value of 0.8 (sell 80% ETH).

Starknet is also down 53% from its Sep. 9 high at 4.7 TPS.\n\nThe top L2s by total value locked, long-standing incumbents Arbitrum and Optimism, suffered similar retracements. Arbitrum closely follows ZkSync Era with 7.3 TPS, down from a record high of 31.6 TPS amid the airdrop for its ARB token in March.\n\nThe OP Mainnet currently sits at 2.5 TPS, down from 10.4 in late July.

Based on the news provided, there are a few key points to consider for the ETH cryptocurrency market:

1. Ethereum Mainnet Reclaims Dominance From Layer 2s: The daily activity on Layer 2s has fallen by one-third in the last six weeks, indicating a shift back towards the Ethereum Mainnet. This could potentially lead to increased activity and transactions on the Ethereum network.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, the technical indicators are all signaling a "sell" trend for ETH. This indicates a bearish market sentiment and a potential downward trend in the price of ETH in the short term. Additionally, the news analyst report presents a mixed market trend for ETH, with the potential for increased activity on the Ethereum Mainnet but also uncertainty surrounding the impact of the transition to Proof-of-Stake and the introduction of a new cryptocurrency project.

Considering both reports, it seems that the overall market trend for ETH is bearish and there is a higher likelihood of a downward movement in the price of ETH. Therefore, I would recommend selling ETH to maximize profit in this scenario.

Action: 0.7 (sell 70% ETH)

*** ONCHAIN ANALYST RESPONSE ***
Based on the recent information provided, it appears that the market trend for ETH is currently bearish. The open prices have been decreasing over the past few days, and the number of successful transactions and unique addresses have also been declining. Additionally, the average gas price and total gas used have been relatively high, indicating a high level of network activity.

The technical indicators such as the short-long moving average signal, MACD signal, and Bollinger Bands signal all suggest a sell trend. This, combined with the overall bearish market sentiment, indicates that the price of ETH may continue to decrease in the near future.

Therefore, as an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst, it would be advisable to exercise caution and consider selling or holding onto existing positions, rather than buying at this time. It is important to closely monitor the market trends and indicators for any potential changes in direction.

This article will delve into why Bitcoin Spark and Ethereum could one of the gainers this cycle.\n\nEthereum - Layer Zero Potential\n\nEthereum, since its inception, has gained considerable attention due to powerful smart contracts and scalability. Experts believe that Ethereum has ‘Layer Zero potential,’ functioning as the foundation of DeFi that enables the existence of numerous other blockchains and applications to run on it.\n\nThe potential of Ethereum lies in its decentralized, secure, and scalable infrastructure for a new generation of applications. It enables the creation of smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and even other cryptocurrencies. Developers can build and launch their projects and create a thriving ecosystem of innovation within the Ethereum ecosystem. However, the Ethereum network can only process a limited number of transactions per second, leading to congestion and high fees during peak times. Once these obstacles are resolved, Ethereum is likely to be a top gainer this upcoming bull season.\n\nBitcoin Spark Fusing PoW and PoS\n\nBitcoin Spark is another contender for one of the biggest gainer this cycle, thanks to its innovative fusion of Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms. This combination aims to harness the strengths of both systems and mitigate their weaknesses, creating a more secure, efficient, and sustainable blockchain.\n\nPoW, used by Bitcoin, involves miners solving complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and create new blocks. While this system has proven secure, it is resource-intensive, leading to criticisms about its environmental impact. On the other hand, PoS, employed by Ethereum, allows coin holders to validate transactions based on the number of coins they hold and are willing to 'stake' as collateral. This system is less resource-intensive but has been criticized for potentially favoring the 'rich' who can stake more coins.\n\nBitcoin Spark's fusion of PoW and PoS aims to create a balance, offering the security of PoW with the efficiency of PoS. This innovative hybrid approach culminates in the Proof-of-Process (PoP) consensus mechanism and could make Bitcoin Spark a significant player in the cryptocurrency market, leading to substantial gains in this cycle.\n\nTraders Convinced Smartphone Mining Is The Next Big Thing\n\nThe rise of smartphone mining is another trend that traders are keeping a close eye on. As the name suggests, smartphone mining involves using smartphones to mine cryptocurrencies. This method makes mining more accessible to the masses, as it does not require expensive hardware or high energy consumption.\n\nThe potential of smartphone mining lies in its convenience and accessibility. With billions of smartphone users worldwide, the potential user base for smartphone mining is massive. Furthermore, smartphone mining apps are typically user-friendly, making it easy for even non-tech-savvy individuals to participate in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThis is where Bitcoin Spark convinces new but also veteran crypto traders to be on top of the next bull run with its innovative Spark App that will enable users to simply mine BTCS via their smartphones.\n\nBottom Line\n\nIn conclusion, the cryptocurrency market is dynamic and ever-evolving, with Bitcoin Spark and Ethereum potentially being the one of the gainers this cycle. Ethereum’s Layer Zero potential and the upcoming upgrades promise a more scalable and efficient platform, while Bitcoin Spark's fusion of PoW and PoS offers a balanced and innovative approach to blockchain technology.\n\nFor more information:\n\nWebsite: https://bitcoinspark.org/\n\nBuy BTCS: https://network.bitcoinspark.org/register\n\nThis post was authored by an external contributor and does not represent Benzinga's opinions and has not been edited for content.

2. However, macro guru Raoul Pal predicts a 75% surge in Ethereum's price, with other analysts also expressing bullish sentiments towards ETH. This suggests a positive outlook for Ethereum in the near future.

3. MicroStrategy, a business intelligence firm, has reported substantial gains from its Bitcoin holdings but could have potentially earned more if they had invested in Ethereum instead. This indicates that there is potential for Ethereum to outperform Bitcoin in terms of returns.

4. The article on Bitcoin Spark and Ethereum highlights the innovative technology and potential gains for both cryptocurrencies in the current market cycle. This suggests a positive outlook for both Bitcoin Spark and Ethereum.

Overall, the market trend for Ethereum appears to be mixed, with some indicators pointing towards a bearish sentiment while others suggest a bullish outlook. It is important to consider both perspectives and monitor market developments closely to make informed trading decisions.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, the market trend for ETH is currently bearish. The open prices have been decreasing, network activity is high, and technical indicators all suggest a sell trend. On the other hand, the news analyst report presents a mixed outlook with some indicators pointing towards a bearish sentiment and others suggesting a bullish outlook.

Considering the conflicting information, I believe that the overall market trend for ETH is more bearish than bullish. The technical indicators and on-chain data point towards a downward trend in the price of ETH in the near future. While there are some bullish sentiments expressed in the news articles, the majority of the information leans towards a bearish outlook.

Therefore, I would recommend selling ETH with a confidence level of -0.7. This indicates a high level of confidence in the bearish trend and suggests that selling a significant portion of ETH holdings would be a prudent decision at this time. 

Action: Sell 70% ETH

*** ONCHAIN ANALYST RESPONSE ***
Based on the provided information, the market trend for ETH appears to be bearish. The open prices have been fluctuating around the $1800 range, with a slight decrease in value transferred over time. The number of transactions and unique addresses have been increasing, indicating continued activity in the market.

However, the average gas price has been on the rise, reaching a peak of 30502115045.0, which could potentially deter some users from engaging in transactions. The total gas used has also been consistently high, suggesting a high level of network activity.

The technical indicators such as the short-long moving average signal, MACD signal, and Bollinger Bands signal all point towards a sell recommendation. This, combined with the overall bearish sentiment in the market, suggests that the price of ETH may continue to decline in the near future.

As an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst, it would be advisable to closely monitor the market conditions and consider implementing risk management strategies to navigate the current bearish trend.

At the time, the 30,000 ETH was worth a mere $9,000, but its current value has surged to more than $54 million as of press time.\n\nIn addition to Ethereum, Castelluzo also obtained 30,000 Ethereum Classic (ETC) in 2016, which he used to acquire other cryptocurrencies.\n\nSubsequent to his arrest and incarceration, Castelluzzo attempted to launder the 30,000 ETH while in prison. However, U.S. authorities foiled this scheme by intercepting recorded prison telephone calls in 2021, ultimately leading to the seizure of the assets.\n\nU.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger stated:\n\n“The civil action we are taking today seeks to recover millions of dollars of cryptocurrency, which the defendant allegedly obtained from drug sales. Whether it’s as simple as bags of cash or as sophisticated as cryptocurrency, we will take the steps necessary to seize financial gains defendants obtain from criminal activity.”\n\nJames E.

While other cryptos have been soaring in value of late, Ethereum has not. Currently trading at just under $1,800, Ethereum has repeatedly failed to surge past the $2,000 price mark this year and is now significantly underperforming Bitcoin (BTC 4.25%).\n\nAll of which makes Ethereum an intriguing investment right now. It\'s still the second-largest digital asset in the world (trailing only Bitcoin), and there are at least two good reasons Ethereum\'s price could start to move upward as we head into 2024.\n\nThe clear market leader\n\nFirst and foremost, Ethereum is still the 800-pound gorilla of the blockchain world. Ever since it pioneered the concept of smart contracts back in 2015, Ethereum has consistently been the first to market with just about every new blockchain innovation. And that has given Ethereum an enviable first-mover advantage in key areas such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nIn both areas, Ethereum is still the clear leader. For example, Ethereum is responsible for an eye-popping 54% of total value locked (TVL), arguably the single-best metric for measuring overall DeFi strength. No other blockchain even comes close.\n\nUntil rival blockchains, such as Solana or Avalanche, begin to chip away at Ethereum\'s market dominance at a faster pace, it\'s safe to say Ethereum will remain entrenched as the premier Layer 1 blockchain in the world. And that\'s exactly what I\'m looking for in a long-term investment prospect: a clear market leader with an established track record of excellence.\n\nContinuous cycle of improvement\n\nEthereum\'s success to date has not been an accident. Ethereum boasts the largest developer network in the world, and these developers are highly focused on maintaining Ethereum\'s market-leading position. Case in point: Last year, Ethereum pulled off The Merge, one of the most difficult and complex technical achievements ever in the blockchain world. Some compared its difficulty to that of changing the engine of an airplane while mid-flight.\n\nWhat makes Ethereum particularly enticing to long-term investors is that it has a very detailed roadmap for future development. Even after The Merge, Ethereum has plans for new technical changes to its blockchain to boost performance, lower fees, and improve overall scalability. The next major upgrade (known as Dencun) is now tentatively scheduled for the first quarter of 2024 and has already received plaudits from Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs.\n\nWhy has Ethereum fallen out of favor?\n\nSo the obvious question becomes, "If Ethereum is so great, why has it fallen out of favor with investors?" While there are several possible explanations, the most likely is that The Merge may have over-promised and under-delivered. There was so much buzz and speculation surrounding The Merge that it couldn\'t possibly live up to the hype.\n\nInvestors woke up the next day to find that nothing really seemed to have changed with the Ethereum blockchain. Transaction processing times were faster but only marginally so. Transaction fees were still high, and there were still pressing questions about the future of staking on the blockchain (something Ethereum fixed in April). On top of all that, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin himself acknowledged that a lot of work still had to be done. So, The Merge wasn\'t some kind of magic rocket fuel that was going to send Ethereum soaring. That lack of immediate sizzle certainly disappointed a lot of investors.\n\nAdd in that many of the blockchain sectors that initially generated a lot of buzz for Ethereum -- such as NFTs and the metaverse -- fell out of favor with users, developers, and investors in 2022. And don\'t forget, the unprecedented rise of ChatGPT out of seemingly nowhere late last year led to a tremendous swing in investor sentiment. Suddenly, generative artificial intelligence (AI) became the talk of the investment world, and Ethereum admittedly didn\'t have much to offer in this regard.\n\nInvest in Ethereum for the long haul?\n\nFrom my perspective, Ethereum remains a great long-term investment play. Right now, investor sentiment seems to be at a low point, but that could change soon. Buying Ethereum now, while it\'s still below $2,000, seems like a fantastic bargain. You\'re getting a proven market leader at a discount price, combined with a potential catalyst (the new Dencun tech upgrade) to start off the New Year with a bang.'}].

However, the average gas price has been on the rise, reaching a peak of 30502115045.0, which could potentially deter some users from engaging in transactions. The total gas used has also been consistently high, suggesting a high level of network activity.

The technical indicators such as the short-long moving average signal, MACD signal, and Bollinger Bands signal all point towards a sell recommendation. This, combined with the overall bearish sentiment in the market, suggests that the price of ETH may continue to decline in the near future.

As an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst, it would be advisable to closely monitor the market conditions and consider implementing risk management strategies to navigate the current bearish trend.

NEWS ANALYST REPORT: Based on the news articles provided, there are a few key points to consider for analyzing the market trend for Ethereum (ETH) cryptocurrency:

1. Seizure of $54M worth of Ethereum linked to illegal narcotics business: This news may have a negative impact on the market sentiment as it highlights the association of Ethereum with illegal activities. However, the seizure of assets could also be seen as a positive step towards regulating the cryptocurrency space.

2. Ethereum Price Breaking Confluence Resistance: The technical analysis of Ethereum's price movement suggests that there is potential for a fresh surge in price towards resistance levels at $1,850 and $1,875. This indicates a bullish trend in the short term.

3. Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Dogecoin Consolidation: The article discusses the consolidation of Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Dogecoin near important technical levels. Ethereum is trading below strong resistance at $2,000, which could indicate a bearish sentiment in the short term.

4. Should You Buy Ethereum While It's Below $2,000?: This article provides a bullish perspective on Ethereum, highlighting its position as a market leader in the blockchain space and its continuous cycle of improvement. The article suggests that buying Ethereum below $2,000 could be a good long-term investment opportunity

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, the market trend for ETH appears to be bearish. The technical indicators, such as the short-long moving average signal, MACD signal, and Bollinger Bands signal, all point towards a sell recommendation. Additionally, the average gas price has been on the rise, which could potentially deter users from engaging in transactions. 

However, the news analyst report provides a mixed perspective on the market trend. While there are indications of a potential surge in price towards resistance levels in the short term, there are also discussions about Ethereum trading below strong resistance at $2,000, which could indicate a bearish sentiment.

Taking into consideration both reports, it seems that the overall sentiment is leaning towards a bearish trend for ETH. Therefore, I would recommend selling ETH with a confidence level of -0.6.

*** ONCHAIN ANALYST RESPONSE ***
Based on the recent information provided, it appears that the market trend for ETH is currently bearish. The open prices have been fluctuating within a relatively narrow range, with the average gas price and total gas used remaining high. The number of successful transactions is also decreasing, indicating a potential decrease in trading activity.

Additionally, all three technical indicators (short-long moving average signal, MACD signal, and Bollinger Bands signal) are showing a "sell" signal, further supporting the bearish trend.

Therefore, it is likely that the price of ETH may continue to decline in the near future. Traders and investors should exercise caution and consider implementing risk management strategies to protect their investments in this market environment.

If that happens, the crypto founder believes that the broader crypto market could follow suit.\n\nAs to how these crypto tokens could go, he noted that they could rise enough to make people believe that they could hit new all-time highs soon, but that may not be the case as these investors could endure a “final wipeout” soon after (possibly in the first quarter of next year) with these tokens steady declining to higher lows.\n\nTo drive home his point, Burniske suggested that Bitcoin and Ethereum’s current price action shared similarities to the period between December 2019 and January 2019 before the “painful descent into March 2020 lows.” According to him, although that period was the COVID era, “everything is also the same about the actors on the stage.”\n\nBurniske seemed to be certain about his assertions.

Burniske responded to the post as he agreed that those were the points he was trying to drive home.\n\nOne of these macro scenarios, which was alluded to, could be the rising inflation and how the Federal Reserve and other authorities globally are increasing interest rates to battle the economic downturn. Bloomberg analyst Mike McGlone had once mentioned how Bitcoin could crash to $10,000, with inflation being one of the factors that could lead to the decline.\n\nAnother crypto analyst, Nicholas Merten, had also noted that Bitcoin could decline further if the Feds do not do enough to curb the rising inflation.\n\nFeatured image from The Street, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

It allows creators to continue earning from their digital assets as they change hands in the secondary market, providing an ongoing source of income and incentivizing artists and content creators to participate in the NFT space.\n\nMagic Eden co-founder and CEO Jack Lu noted in the statement:\n\n“We remain committed to the betterment of the web3 creator ecosystem, steadfast in our belief that we should champion creators who are the heart and soul of the industry… Right now, it’s a priority to provide creatives with the support they deserve with creator royalty programs.”\n\nThe press release claimed that the new platform will be the first major Ethereum NFT marketplace that is “contractually obligated” to pay royalties to creators for secondary sales. The “unified vision” of the companies involves “creating a fair and rewarding ecosystem for imaginative content contributors.”\n\nCreator royalties are non-negotiable\n\nMagic Eden and Yuga Labs have unequivocally announced that “respecting creator royalties is non-negotiable.” Therefore, Yuga Labs will exclusively work with marketplaces that pay royalties for all its future collections, according to the press release.\n\nBoth firms emphasized that the new Ethereum-based platform will be a testament to their long-term “commitment to protecting creator royalties.” The jointly launched platform will also aim to encourage innovation by boosting the number of builders and creators.\n\nDaniel Alegre, CEO of Yuga Labs, said:\n\n“Magic Eden is putting their money where their mouth is, and together we are supporting the building of an Ethereum marketplace that will back creators, without whom web3 would not exist.”\n\nLu added that the new marketplace will “reset” the royalty allocation standard and hopes that its principles will be adopted throughout the ecosystem.\n\nIn a post on X, Lu also noted that Magic Eden has already “managed to solve” the problem of royalties on Solana. The firm partnered with Metaplex, the protocol that enables NFT minting on Solana, to roll out royalty protection protocols.\n\n“Now, Royalties are the norm on SOL. And we believe we can do the same on Eth.”\n\nOpen taunt to OpenSea\n\nThe press release seemingly taunted OpenSea, one of the largest NFT marketplaces that made royalties optional in August. Highlighting their firm stance in favor of royalties, Yuga Labs and Magic Eden noted that they have “a clear stance amidst a sea of other marketplaces who turn their backs on creative entrepreneurs.”\n\nYuga Labs has publicly criticized OpenSea’s stance on royalties before. In August, Yuga Labs said it would shortly end support for Seaport, OpenSea’s marketplace contract, indicating that its NFTs will not be available on the marketplace in the future.'}, {'id': 4, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5meHN0cmVldC5jb20vY3J5cHRvY3VycmVuY2llcy9uZXdzL2JpdGNvaW4tYW5kLWV0aGVyZXVtLXByaWNlLXJpc2UtaGFsdGluZy1tYWtlcy13YXktZm9yLWxheWVyLTItZGVmaS10b2tlbnMtdG8tY2hhcnQtb3Zlci00MC1nYWlucy0yMDIzMTEwNDA1MDjSAaABaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZnhzdHJlZXQuY29tL2FtcC9jcnlwdG9jdXJyZW5jaWVzL25ld3MvYml0Y29pbi1hbmQtZXRoZXJldW0tcHJpY2UtcmlzZS1oYWx0aW5nLW1ha2VzLXdheS1mb3ItbGF5ZXItMi1kZWZpLXRva2Vucy10by1jaGFydC1vdmVyLTQwLWdhaW5zLTIwMjMxMTA0MDUwOA?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Sat, 04 Nov 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Bitcoin and Ethereum price rise halting makes way for layer-2 & DeFi tokens to chart over 40% gains - FXStreet', 'content': 'Share:\n\nEthereum price, along with Bitcoin, is presently moving sideways after hitting $1,857 and $35,000 respectively.\n\nSmall-cap cryptocurrencies are making gains fuelled by high investor participation.\n\nThe total value of all other cryptocurrencies, excluding BTC and ETH, has risen by 14% but needs another 9.3% increase to recover all the recent losses.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum price initiated the bullish momentum that pulled up the entire cryptocurrency market.

Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, the market trend for ETH is currently bearish. The indicators are showing a "sell" signal, and there is a potential for the price of ETH to continue declining in the near future. On the other hand, the news analyst report suggests a positive outlook for Ethereum, with predictions of price increases and positive developments in the market.

Considering both reports, it is important to note that technical indicators are currently signaling a bearish trend, which carries more weight in determining the market direction. While the news may indicate positive sentiment, the technical analysis is a more reliable indicator of the current market conditions.

Given the bearish trend indicated by the on-chain analyst report, I would recommend selling ETH to capitalize on the potential price decline. I am confident in this trend prediction, and I would suggest selling 0.7 (sell 70% ETH) to maximize profit in this market environment.

Nerayoff claims that their fraudulent activities by far exceed the criminal scheme of former Boy Wonder Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nSteven Nerayoff Accuses Ether Founders Of Massive Fraud\n\nSteven Nerayoff has boldly alleged that Ethereum founders Vitalik Buterin and Joseph Lubin are bigger fraudsters than the now-convicted Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nNerayoff made this wild allegation regarding Buterin and Lubin in a recent post on X (formerly known as Twitter). According to the ex-Ethereum advisor, the pair committed more fraudulent activities regarding the ETH coin than Bankman-Fried.\n\n“Ethereum is the fraudulent elephant in the room in plain sight 1000x bigger than SBF,” Nerayoff opined.\n\nBankman-Fried orchestrated one of the biggest financial frauds in American history, involving his crypto exchange FTX and its sister trading firm Alameda Research. SBF’s scheme to pilfer funds from FTX customers and lenders to purchase luxury property, Binance’s stake in FTX, and political favor unraveled, taking the 31-year-old MIT graduate down with it. He was recently convicted on all seven counts and faces up to 110 years in prison.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDo Ethereum Founders Have Ties To Corrupt SEC Officials?\n\nNerayoff did not offer any substantial evidence to back up his explosive allegations against Ethereum’s Buterin and Lubin, but he cited key figures in the U.S. government such as ex-SEC chair Jay Clayton and current chair Gary Gensler, who reportedly had private dealings with the duo.\n\n“Joe Lubin & Vitalik Buterin have been the front with corrupt officials at the highest levels of federal agencies such as Clayton, Gensler & many others. Cover this now,” Nerayoff asserted.\n\nNerayoff’s claims imply that Ethereum’s executives likely bribed high-ranking government officials, giving the project an unfair advantage in the cryptocurrency market. The bribery claim is that Ethereum execs gave the U.S. Securities and Exchange hush money to turn a blind eye to the network’s ICO and thus not lodge securities violation charges.\n\nAll in all, the credibility of Nerayoff’s allegations isn’t helped by his own reputation for often stretching the truth: He has labeled himself as one of the eight Ethereum co-creators in the past, which has been dismissed as baloney by other early Ethereum contributors.'}, {'id': 5, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vdS50b2RheS9ldGhlcmV1bS1ldGgtbmV0d29yay1oaXRzLW5ldy02LW1vbnRoLWhpZ2gtaGVyZXMtaG930gFIaHR0cHM6Ly91LnRvZGF5L2V0aGVyZXVtLWV0aC1uZXR3b3JrLWhpdHMtbmV3LTYtbW9udGgtaGlnaC1oZXJlcy1ob3c_YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Sun, 05 Nov 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Ethereum (ETH) Network Hits New 6-Month High, Here's How - U.Today", 'content': 'Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today.

Over the last week, the mainnet alone settled over $213 billion in transactions, underscoring a robust uptick in on-chain activity. Layer 2 solutions such as Arbitrum, Optimism and Base have further buoyed this growth, adding another $16 billion to the aggregate volume. This uptrend reflects growing confidence and utility in the Ethereum ecosystem, suggesting an increasingly vibrant blockchain landscape.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe spike in transaction volume has come with other noteworthy metrics, such as an increase in transaction fees. While higher fees can indicate network congestion and increased demand for block space, they also reflect the economic activity on the network. Investors and users should monitor these fees as they can affect the cost-effectiveness of conducting transactions on the Ethereum network.\n\nOver the past week, the network burned an average of 855,000 ETH per year, a mechanism that could contribute to deflationary pressure on the token\'s supply over time. This "burn" counteracts the issuance of new ETH, aiming to create a balance that can benefit the asset\'s long-term valuation.\n\nLooking at the daily chart, Ethereum\'s price action appears bullish. The price is maintaining a consistent pattern above both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, indicating sustained buyer interest. The chart showcases a series of higher lows and higher highs — a classical uptrend signal. The recent price has surpassed local resistance levels, potentially aiming for higher price points.\n\nThe increase in on-chain activity, coupled with the reduction in supply due to the burn mechanism, are both fundamental factors that could be driving optimism in the market.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

Unraveling A 70,000 ETH Sale - NewsBTC', 'content': 'A video has surfaced on social media where Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin revealed he sold 70,000 ETH tokens during its price all-time high.\n\nButerin Acknowledges Shorting Ethereum\n\nCrypto community member, MetaMan X, published a video post on X (formerly Twitter), disclosing a conversation where Ethereum Founder, Vitalik Buterin admitted that he had sold about 70,000 ETH tokens, essentially shorting the cryptocurrency during a major all-time high.\n\nIn the podcast with American hedge fund director, Eric Ross Weinstein, Buterin spoke on the price of Ethereum and Bitcoin in 2017. During Ethereum’s previous all-time high in 2017, when the price of ETH rose as high as $1,600 and Bitcoin’s price was up $20,000, Buterin voiced doubts about whether the significant price surge truly aligned with the crypto market’s modest achievements over the years.\n\n“The crypto space has reached half a trillion dollars, does it deserve it?” Buterin stated.\n\nWhen asked if he had shorted Ethereum during the all-time high, Buterin stated that he had convinced the Ethereum Foundation to sell a considerable amount of ETH tokens, and the result of the decision made a huge impact on the cryptocurrency later.\n\n“I did get the Ethereum Foundation to sell 70,000 ETH like basically at the top, and that’s doubled our runway now, so it was one good decision that had a lot of impact,” Buterin said.\n\nETH price at $1,886 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nCommunity Worries Over Buterin’s ETH Sell-Offs\n\nMany crypto community members have raised concerns about the multiple ETH transactions said to be conducted by Ethereum’s founder. Recently, Buterin was spotted making a transfer of 100 ETH, worth about $181,000 to Coinbase, one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges.\n\nThe motive behind the transaction has sparked curiosity among Ethereum investors and the crypto community. Earlier in August, Buterin was also reported moving 600 ETH worth $1 million to Coinbase.\n\nHowever, the Ethereum Founder had publicly clarified in October that he had not sold any ETH tokens for personal gain since 2018. He also stated that most ETH transactions were not him selling, but rather the recipients of his charitable donations selling the ETH tokens.\n\nThe founder has also been caught in controversy over the weekend when Ethereum whistleblower Steven Nerayoff alleged that Buterin was involved in some sort of fraud involving ETH.\n\nNerayoff says Ethereum is linked to corrupt SEC officials to carry out this fraud which he says is on a larger scale than what happened with FTX. For reference, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried has been found guilty of fraud charges after the exchange filed for bankruptcy in 2022 with a $9 billion hold in its balance sheet.\n\nFeatured image from Crypto News, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Economic news last week gave investors reason to move further out on the risk curve, and that meant in part bidding up the value of cryptocurrencies.\n\nThree of the biggest movers were Ethereum (ETH 2.02%), Dogecoin (DOGE 0.50%), and Shiba Inu (SHIB 2.63%). Ethereum rose as much as 5.4% between Friday's close and noon ET on Monday and is now up 4.8% over that time. Dogecoin had a more pronounced move, climbing 10.2% and currently trading 9.1% higher. Shiba Inu is at its high point, up 7.1%.\n\nEconomic data driving markets\n\nThe economic news last week helped push markets, including cryptocurrencies, higher to end the week. Investors saw the Federal Reserve's decision to pause rate hikes as a positive and there was a lot of speculation that rates would be kept flat through the end of the year.\n\nOn top of that, a weaker-than-expected jobs report was seen as a positive for markets. As the thinking goes, if job growth is slowing, the economy may not be overheating -- which means the Federal Reserve will stop raising rates to slow the economy.\n\nIt may seem counterintuitive, but lower interest rates are currently seen as very bullish for riskier assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies. And short term, that's driving values higher.\n\nETF speculation continues\n\nTrading momentum continues to be strong on speculation that more crypto ETFs will be approved. We know the SEC is considering multiple Bitcoin ETFs, and that could pave the way for both more crypto ETFs and more funds flowing into the industry more broadly.\n\nBlackRock is one of the leading institutions applying for a spot ETF. The company controls $9 trillion in assets under management, so it could lead to a big inflow of funds to the crypto industry. That's the speculation.\n\nMany institutions have shied away from crypto because of the legal grey area it operates in, especially in the U.S. So, approval by the SEC would be generally bullish for crypto broadly at a time when many countries are writing specific rules on how cryptocurrencies can be traded and how blockchain companies can operate.\n\nWhile the market is speculating that a Bitcoin ETF would eventually be bullish for tokens like Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu, it's not clear if they would eventually get spot ETFs as well.\n\nSpeculation rules the day\n\nThe reality is that everything I discussed above is speculation about the value of cryptocurrencies. There's no increased utility or ability to pay for goods using the blockchain. Investors are simply bidding up digital assets because of what the Federal Reserve did and what they think the SEC might do.\n\nIf any of this speculation ends up being false, it's possible that crypto values could crash again. I would like to see more real world utility being built into the blockchain and tokens like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu find real use cases. Until they do, this is just a speculative asset.\n\nEthereum still has the potential to be a valuable blockchain, but it also struggles with high costs and slow transactions. Upgrades could change that, but that will take time. Investors seem to be glossing over that utility need today."}, {'id': 14, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9iaW5nLXZlbnR1cmVzLXByZXNlbnRzLWV0aGVyZXVtLTIwMzAtMTQwMDAwMzk3Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Mon, 06 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Bing Ventures Presents Ethereum 2030, Devconnect's Premier Event - Yahoo Finance", 'content': 'Singapore --News Direct-- Bing Ventures Limited\n\nBing Ventures, a Singapore-based pioneering venture capital firm backing early projects in Web3 and Blockchain, is joining hands with leading crypto exchange BingX to present Ethereum 2030: Unraveling Tomorrow’s Innovations, a premier event during Devconnect 2023 on Wednesday, November 15, 2023, at 2:00 pm GMT+3 in Istanbul.\n\nEthereum 2030 will bring together industry heavyweights, visionaries, and trendsetters for a half-day of engaging keynote speeches, in-depth panel discussions, valuable networking opportunities, and audience engagement – all focused on inspiring and nurturing entrepreneurs for a new era of innovation.\n\nThe event will be held at Sofitel Istanbul Taksim, which sits in the heart of the city, with unique views of Taksim Square and the mesmerizing Bosphorus and has the capacity to welcome up to 1,000 attendees.\n\nThe agenda covers various topics, including decentralized finance, Ethereum scalability, Web3 security, and the crypto landscape in Turkey.\n\nEthereum 2030, a Devconnect 2023 event\n\nFeatured speakers include:\n\nYajin (Andy) Zhou, CEO of Blocksec\n\nAzeem Khan, Head of Impact at Gitcoin\n\nJack He, Co-founder at Aspecta\n\nBertuğ Oymak, Co-Founder and CEO of Utilify\n\nDougie DeLuca, Investor at Figment Capital\n\nFatih Taşdemir, Co-Founder of Koin Bülteni\n\nVolkan KORKMAZ, CEO and Co-Founder at Altcointurk\n\nLuca (Moss) Mossini, BD at Avantgarde & Enzyme Finance\n\nSeraphim Czecker, Head of Taking Risk\n\nVaruni Trivedi, Editor in Chief at Voice of Crypto\n\nAnıl Öz, Chief Technology Officer at DATS Project\n\nArif Kalem, Brand Ambassador of Turkey at BingX\n\nÖzge ERDEMİR, Web3 Advisor, Business Developer\n\nSima Baktas, Web3 Attorney at GlobalB Law / Co-Founder of CryptoFemale\n\nDaria Krasnova, Managing Editor at BeInCrypto\n\nWayne Wu, Partner of Bing Ventures highlighted the purpose of the conference, saying:\n\n“As the largest and most established decentralized programmable blockchain in the world, Ethereum has been at the forefront of ground-breaking trends.

Despite the current bullish trend, Ether’s 17% return over the last 30 days falls short of Bitcoin’s (BTC) impressive 27% gain during the same period.\n\nRegulatory hurdles and ecosystem centralization critiques linger\n\nAnalysts attribute some of Ether’s underperformance to uncertainty surrounding Consensys, a key player in the Ethereum ecosystem. Former employees have filed a lawsuit against the company and its co-founder Joseph Lubin. Over two dozen shareholders of the Swiss holding company, Consensys AG, claim that Lubin, who is also a co-founder of Ethereum, violated a “no-dilution promise” made in 2015.\n\nConsensys is responsible for developing and hosting infrastructure projects crucial to the Ethereum network. It was founded in October 2014, about nine months before the Ethereum blockchain launched in mid-2015. Furthermore, the High Court of Zug in Switzerland ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, exacerbating the current uncertainty.\n\nRegulatory challenges have hampered the growth of the Ethereum ecosystem. The latest concern centers around PayPal’s U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, PYUSD, which operates on the Ethereum network. This token is designed for digital payments and Web3 applications. On Nov. 2, PayPal disclosed a subpoena it received from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nIn addition to regulatory pressures, there has been notable criticism of the decentralization of financial applications within the Ethereum network. Chainlink, a preferred solution for oracle services, quietly reduced the number of participants in its multisignature wallet from four out of nine to four out of eight. Analysts have highlighted the lack of governance by regular users as a significant issue.\n\nEther’s underperformance to altcoins is evidence of other issues\n\nSeveral major altcoins — including Solana’s SOL (SOL), XRP (XRP) and Cardano’s ADA (ADA) — have outperformed Ether, with returns of 75.5%, 37% and 35% in the last 30 days, respectively. This discrepancy suggests that the factors holding back ETH are not solely related to regulatory pressure or reduced demand for the decentralized finance and nonfungible token markets.\n\nOne pressing issue for the Ethereum network is the high gas fees associated with transactions, including those executed by smart contracts. The latest seven-day average transaction fee was $4.90, negatively impacting the usage of decentralized applications (DApps).\n\nMoreover, the total deposits on the Ethereum network, measured in Ether, have dropped to their lowest levels since August 2020. It’s essential to note that this analysis does not consider the effects of native Ethereum staking.\n\nEthereum network applications' total deposits in ETH. Source: DefiLlama\n\nAccording to DefiLlama data, Ethereum DApps had a total value locked (TVL) of 12.7 million ETH on Nov. 5, down 4% from the 13.2 million ETH two months earlier. In comparison, the TVL on the Tron network increased by 13% during the same period, while Arbitrum deposits remained at 1 million ETH. Data on DApp activity on the Ethereum network supports the notion of reduced activity.\n\nEthereum network top DApps, 30-day active addresses. Source: DappRadar\n\nEven excluding the significant 60% decline in the Uniswap NFT Aggregator, the average number of active addresses across the top Ethereum network DApps decreased by 3% compared with the previous month. In contrast, Solana’s top applications saw an average 18% increase in active users during the same period, according to DappRadar data.\n\nRelated: Aave pauses several markets after reports of feature issue\n\nFinally, on-chain activity indicates increased user deposits of ETH at exchanges. While this data doesn’t necessarily signal short-term selling, the mere availability of coins is typically viewed as a precautionary measure by analysts.\n\nAverage 7-day daily ETH deposits at exchanges, ETH thousands. Source: Coin Metrics\n\nThe present daily ETH deposit average of 255,614 represents a 30% increase from two weeks earlier, indicating that holders are more inclined to sell as Ether’s price approaches $1,900.\n\nThe data suggests that reduced TVL, declining DApps activity and a higher rate of ETH exchange deposits are negatively impacting the likelihood of Ether breaking the $1,900 resistance. The price level could be more challenging than initially expected, and for now, Ether bears can take a breath.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

The investigator highlighted the deep involvement of entities affiliated to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in Ethereum’s genesis, mining network, and protocol development.\n\nWith Ethereum having transitioned to a proof-of-stake consensus model, the spotlight is back on the token distribution. The investigator argues that the outsized control of tokens by Chinese entities poses a severe threat to Ethereum’s decentralization credentials. Let’s analyze the cybersleuth’s claims to understand the implications for Ethereum.\n\nEthereum’s China Links\n\nTruthLabs points out that Chinese conglomerate Wanxiang group was an early backer of Ethereum. The group purchased $500,000 worth of ETH from Vitalik Buterin in 2015 and helped him set up the network’s original wallets.\n\nThat donation was later converted to 416,000 ETH tokens. Since then, there has never been any explanation of what Wanxiang received in return for this generous support.\n\nEthereum's hidden Centralization problem: The Chinese Communist Party. The same party using blockchain to track and control everything, Implementing Social Credit Scores, CBDC's, and a number of other surveillance protocols. The CCP, thru Wanxiang, and a number of other CCP… https://t.co/uYxIqUY6n5 — TruthLabs \U0001fae1 (@BoringSleuth) November 5, 2023\n\n“Vitalik was out of cash, and he found it by selling ETH’s decentralized future to the CCP,” said TruthLabs.\n\nWanxiang Group was founded in 1969 by Lu Guanqiu as an agricultural machinery company in China. It has grown into one of China’s largest non-state-owned companies with over $30 billion in revenue.\n\nWanxiang Raising Concerns\n\nWanxiang entered the US market in 1994 and now has over 5,000 employees across the country. More recently, Wanxiang has shown strong interest in blockchain and crypto, establishing Wanxiang Blockchain Labs in 2017.\n\nIts deep ties with the CCP raise concerns that the Chinese government may be covertly running Ethereum nodes despite the network’s pseudonymous structure. Beyond holding large chunks of ETH, Chinese mining entities are also allegedly controlling over 80% of Ethereum’s mining power.\n\nA complete guess, 66.6%. I found 12 Genesis Block Wallets today, alone where they ended up with the majority of the ETH from. Its so hard to know. They were invested in over 500 projects by EOY 2021, and in many cases got the pre-ICO tokens prior to both ETH/altcoin price waves. — TruthLabs \U0001fae1 (@BoringSleuth) June 28, 2023\n\nWhile the shift to proof-of-stake limits the influence miners can exert, critics argue that the excessive ETH hoarded by Chinese players still poses a threat. According to TruthLabs, entities linked to the CCP may hold up to 66% of all ETH in circulation. Although, the account has qualified that statement by saying it is a “complete guess.”\n\nIf true, this enormous, opaque concentration of ETH in wallets associated with the Chinese regime increases the risk of a centralized attack on the network. It also undermines Ethereum’s credibility as a decentralized ecosystem.\n\nAs TruthLabs has pointed out on multiple occasions, Ethereum’s China links are not breaking news. On top of early Chinese investment, Buterin also appeared preoccupied with learning Chinese as early as January 2014, according to Laura Shin’s book The Cryptopians—the period shortly before Chinese backers came on board.\n\nFurthermore, Buterin became the chief scientist of Wanxiang Blockchain Labs, a subsidiary, in the latter half of 2015. A 2016 Facebook post identified Buterin as a co-founder of WBL, alongside Xiao and Bo Shen, co-founders of the Bitshares decentralized exchange.\n\nTransparency Needed To Avoid Centralization Risks\n\nEthereum has firmly established itself as the leading smart contract platform, with an impressive array of DeFi and NFT projects built on it. However, for understandable reasons, lingering doubts remain around just how decentralized its network really is.\n\nThe concentration of nodes is an issue, as Buterin himself acknowledges. Transparency around the top ETH wallets is even more critical in light of the transition to proof-of-stake. A few unknown whales potentially hold enough ETH to sway votes or even attack the network.\n\nA quick 🧵showing that Wanxiang, Chinese auto and early Ethereum Investor funded and setup Vitalik Buterins official wallets. 1/6https://t.co/4uMLLnzguq pic.twitter.com/Ec1cjLOLz2 — TruthLabs \U0001fae1 (@BoringSleuth) January 29, 2023\n\nWhile Ethereum downplays its ties to China today, evidence shows deep involvement of Chinese entities, including state-linked ones, during its early days.\n\nHowever, greater transparency on who the major ETH holders are could go a long way in reassuring users. Any blockchain touting decentralization credentials needs to identify and mitigate centralization risks proactively. For Ethereum, providing clarity on its relationship with Chinese entities is an important first step."}]. Analyze the news and estimate the market trend accordingly.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

Despite this strategic shift, the protocol emphasized that Evmos is not exiting the Cosmos ecosystem. Additionally, Evmos’ founder suggested that the move could help bring Ethereum developers to the IBC.\n\nEvmos functions as an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible blockchain that integrates the Cosmos IBC protocol, allowing it to operate as an EVM within the Cosmos network. Evmos raised $27 million via token sale in late 2022.\n\nRead more: Uniting the blockchain ecosystems: Q&A with Cosmos founder Ethan Buchman\n\nThe project’s co-founder Federico Kunze Küllmer said that by only supporting Ethereum transactions, Evmos hopes to make it easier for Ethereum developers to start working in Cosmos.\n\n“The wallets and the tools that they are already used to on Ethereum do not work easily on Cosmos,” Küllmer said. “We want to make it very easy for the developers and users that are already interacting with Ethereum wallets to interact with any Cosmos application specific blockchain.”\n\nThe Interchain Foundation, a non-profit focused on Cosmos adoption, made onboarding Ethereum developers a large part of its 2024 roadmap, Blockworks previously reported.\n\nIn the lead-up to fully embracing Ethereum-formatted transactions by Q3 2024, the protocol has committed to burning all Cosmos transaction fees during this interim period. This action will effectively remove these fees from circulation, signaling a shift towards revised token economics for the EVMOS token.

The average predictions were down compared to a previous Finder survey conducted in July 2022.\n\nThe panel predicted Ether will be worth $1,840 on average by the end of 2023, down from a prediction of $2,451 in July. The 2025 forecast fell to $5,824 from $5,845 previously, and the 2030 prediction declined to $14,411 versus $16,414 in the earlier survey.\n\nFinder calculates the average forecasts by removing the top and bottom 10% of responses and taking the mean of the rest, a technique known as the truncated mean.

You are an experienced ETH cryptocurrency trader and you are trying to maximize your overall profit by trading ETH. In each day, you will make an action to buy or sell ETH. You will start with 1 million dollars, half in cash and half in ETH. You are assisted by a few analysts below and need to decide the final action.

ON-CHAIN ANALYST REPORT: Based on the recent information provided, it can be observed that the open price of ETH has been fluctuating between 1800 and 1900. The number of transactions, unique addresses, and value transferred have also been varying, indicating some level of activity in the market.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the market trend for ETH is currently bearish. The signals from various technical indicators suggest a sell trend, indicating a potential downward trend in the price of ETH in the near future. Additionally, the news analyst report highlights positive developments within the Ethereum ecosystem, which could potentially attract more users and developers to the platform, leading to an upward trajectory in the market trend for Ethereum.

Considering both reports, it is important to note that while the on-chain analysis indicates a bearish trend, the positive developments within the Ethereum ecosystem could potentially counteract this and lead to a more bullish market trend in the near future. Therefore, I believe that the overall market trend for ETH is more likely to be bullish.

Given this analysis, I would recommend buying ETH with a confidence level of 0.7. This suggests a moderate level of confidence in the bullish market trend for Ethereum. 

Action: -0.7 (buy with 70% cash)

Speculation arose around a “flippening” and institutional investors waited in the wings.\n\nBut ether’s price did not end up meeting these expectations. NFTs tested new lows, and the bear market muted DeFi engagement. Bitcoin continued to outpace ether in 2023 — recently reaching dominance levels not seen since 2021. Meanwhile, institutional inflows are largely yet to materialize.\n\nBlockworks spoke with Justin Drake, a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, about the network’s current standing and future prospects. Keep reading for more excerpts from Blockworks’ interview with Drake.\n\nBlockworks: You can see variations of this stat in different places, but the rewards paid out by Ethereum were larger than the transaction fees that were burned in both September and October. It looks like that’s turned around a little bit, but how should people think about issuance versus burn and when that flips negative?\n\nDrake: The fee market is exceptionally volatile. What you really want to be doing is zooming out, because when you zoom out, you’re smoothing your data over a longer period of time.\n\nIf you look at ultrasound.money, you’ll notice that when it’s profitable, it’s like printing money. It’s really, really profitable. Ethereum has about a profit margin of 50% which is outstanding for a business. Now okay, on some days, especially weekends, it won’t be profitable. In some months, if you’re in the absolute depth of the bear market, then it won’t be profitable. But over a long period of time, it’s extremely profitable.\n\nBlockworks: How important is this deflationary aspect of Ethereum and Ethereum’s ability to generate fees? Because obviously Ethereum is not a company in the traditional sense where your revenues need to outweigh costs. So how should people think about revenue versus issuance? And how important is that metric as a way to gauge the success of the network?\n\nDrake: Broader than just as a company, some people think of ether, the asset, as money for the internet. And in that context, scarcity as a meme is extremely important. There’s this almost obsession with the 21 million Bitcoin meme precisely because it’s all about scarcity. And for the first time in history pretty much, we have money which not only has a fixed supply but actually has a decreasing supply.\n\nSo now there’s what I call memetic potential. Memes are ideas that spread. The 21 million meme is one that spreads far and wide because it’s kind of an attractive thing intellectually. There’s an opportunity potentially for this meme to spread that ether is the scarcest money on Earth. Its supply is going down over time.\n\nBlockworks: And who benefits from this meme?\n\nDrake: Ether the asset is the basis of two very fundamental public goods in any programmable blockchain.\n\nPublic good number one is economic security. We’re trying to build systems here which have a lot of longevity. We want to be in a position where it’s extremely difficult even for the most powerful nation-states out there to attack Ethereum.\n\nAnd then there’s this second really important public good for blockchains which is called economic bandwidth, and that’s the ability to be used as collateral within DeFi. Ether is especially valuable as collateral money because it’s the only so-called pristine collateral. Pristine means that there’s no contract risk. There’s no governance risk. There’s no oracle risk. It’s the one risk free asset.\n\nBlockworks: It sounds like you’re saying the idea of ultrasound money is a means to these larger ends that you described.\n\nDrake: Exactly. It’s a Trojan Horse, but ultimately the value is utilitarian through economic security and economic bandwidth.\n\nBlockworks: Ethereum’s validator queue has been in the hundreds of people waiting to stake ether (ETH), and that’s down from tens of thousands over the summer and even into September. What do you make of this?\n\nDrake: The churn, which is basically the amount of validators that can be processed by the queue, is proportional to the amount of staked ETH. As the amount of staked ETH grows, the churn grows and it becomes easier and easier to clear the queue. And so in that sense, looking at the queue is kind of a totally irrelevant game. The fact that the queue is very low just means that ether is very efficient at processing deposits.\n\nThe better metric is what’s called deposits. Every single day on average, there’s 40,000 ETH coming in, which is a huge amount of money.\n\nBlockworks: How concerned are you about staking yields being down?\n\nDrake: I mean in a way, the lower the better, right? Because it means that we’re not spending as much to secure Ethereum. Ethereum is already extremely secure.\n\nThe security ratio is the value secured by Ethereum, which is all the ETH, all the NFTs, all the ERC-20s divided by the value securing Ethereum, and it’s 7.5, which is extremely healthy. If we were to have more staked ETH, this ratio would keep on going down. But there’s no real need for that. And so having more staked ETH in the way is wastefully paying for security.\n\nBlockworks: Post-Merge, there was a lot of excitement about Ethereum. In 2023, ether’s price has gone up, but especially compared to bitcoin, not as much as some had predicted. Why is that?\n\nRead more: The flippening: Will ether flip bitcoin in the next year?\n\nDrake: What tends to happen, generally speaking, is that during bear markets, dominance of bitcoin goes up, and then during bull markets, it drops down precipitously and then it reaches a new low, so this is all standard behavior.\n\nWhat I’ll say is that bitcoin dominance hasn’t grown as much as what would have been expected in the bear market. So I think expectations were unreasonable thinking that during a bear market, ether will outperform [bitcoin].\n\nThis is all speculation, but my guess is that there will be a flippening in the next bull run.\n\nInterview responses were edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nDon’t miss the next big story – join our free daily newsletter.'}].

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, the technical indicators suggest a bearish trend for ETH. The market sentiment is leaning towards selling or holding positions, indicating a potential downward trend in the price of ETH. Additionally, the news analyst report highlights factors such as competition in the layer-2 network space, potential increase in staking rates for ETH, and the impact of Bitcoin ETF approval on the overall crypto market sentiment.

Considering the overall market trend and the information provided, I predict that the market trend for ETH is bearish and likely to continue downwards. Therefore, I would recommend selling ETH with a high level of confidence in this prediction.

Everything from decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to enterprise blockchain solutions relies on Ethereum's technology. Ethereum's native token, Ether, is the second-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin (BTC 5.7%). The Ethereum Merge, the network's long-awaited shift to a proof-of-stake system, is expected to make the technology remarkably more energy-efficient. The Ethereum Foundation has predicted the shift will cut energy usage by around 99.95%. If you want to profit from the growing use of Ethereum, there are several ways you can invest. The most direct option is buying Ethereum itself. Because it's extremely volatile, this carries the greatest risk but also the greatest potential profits. Another option is buying Ethereum stocks, including managed funds that invest in Ethereum for you and companies with large exposure to Ethereum technology.\n\nWhat is Ethereum? Ethereum is an open-source blockchain technology in the form of software. Software developer Vitalik Buterin originally proposed the idea in 2013, and Ethereum launched in 2015. Any developer making an application that would benefit from blockchain technology can build it on the Ethereum network. While Ethereum is most associated with its native Ether token and other cryptocurrencies, its technology is also enabling widespread innovation in industries as diverse as insurance, logistics, and healthcare. Developers write programs on Ethereum using self-executing, self-enforcing protocols called smart contracts, which are deployed to Ethereum-powered blockchains. The blockchain's network of computers executes the smart contract by performing specified actions when the conditions of the contract are met. Blockchain data can't be modified after it's created, and that gives users confidence in the technology. Although early cryptocurrencies, most notably Bitcoin, are merely stores of value that can be transferred, Ethereum has more uses. If Bitcoin is a smartphone app, Ethereum is more like the device maker. Ethereum's cryptocurrency benefits from its technology because transaction fees for decentralized applications on its blockchain are paid in Ether. What is the Ethereum Merge? The Ethereum Merge is the term for the network's switch from its original proof-of-work system to a proof-of-stake system, scheduled to occur in mid-September 2022. When Ethereum launched, it used proof of work, the same system used by Bitcoin, to validate and record transactions. A notable drawback of this system is extremely high energy usage, which has led to Bitcoin using more power per year than some entire countries. In 2020, Ethereum introduced the Beacon Chain, a proof-of-stake network. However, it continued using its original proof-of-work mainnet for processing transactions. The Merge is when Ethereum will combine the Beacon Chain with the mainnet and make the transition to proof of stake. The primary benefit of The Merge is energy efficiency. Transaction speeds will change a small amount but not enough for most users to notice.\n\nTop Ethereum stocks Here are the best stocks to buy if you want to add Ethereum to your portfolio: 1. Grayscale Ethereum Trust The Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE 2.67%) is a managed fund that makes it easy to add Ethereum to your brokerage account. Each share is backed by a fixed amount of Ether tokens (approximately 0.01 Ether per share). Keep in mind that the fund's share price is often lower than the value of Ethereum at the prevailing conversion rate. Grayscale also charges a somewhat expensive annual management fee of 2.5%. Shareholders can't exchange shares for Ethereum, so there's no price arbitrage opportunity. 2. Bitwise Ethereum Fund Bitwise is the world's biggest crypto index fund manager. It offers managed funds for multiple types of cryptocurrency, and one option is the Bitwise Ethereum Fund. The fund is available to accredited investors and has a minimum investment of $25,000. The fund's managers seek to minimize transaction costs, and they hold the fund's Ethereum offline in cold crypto storage, making it a cost-efficient and secure Ethereum stock. There's an annual management fee of 1.5%. If you want a more diverse digital asset portfolio, check out the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund (BITW 4.43%), which includes a mix of several of the top cryptocurrencies. 3. Coinbase Coinbase (COIN 2.72%) is the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S. The company charges transaction fees to buyers and sellers of a wide range of cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum. In addition to Ethereum, many other cryptocurrencies traded on Coinbase use the Ethereum blockchain. The exchange rolled out Ethereum staking in 2021, allowing investors to lock up their Ether and earn rewards on it during the upgrade to a proof-of-stake system. Coinbase's staking program is expected to significantly benefit from the completion of The Merge. Analysis from Goldman Sachs (GS 0.15%) predicts that Coinbase will generate $250 million to $600 million in additional revenue from Ethereum staking. 4. Staked ETH Trust The Staked ETH Trust is the first traditional investment vehicle that allowed shareholders to get Ethereum exposure and receive staking rewards. It's open by private placement to accredited investors, with a minimum investment amount of $25,000 and an expense ratio of 1%. Considering the attention that Ethereum staking is getting from The Merge, the fund could become very popular. The staking rewards allow the trust's underlying Ether holdings to grow about 7.5% annually, helping it to outperform non-staking funds. The biggest advantage of the Staked ETH Trust is how much it simplifies staking for investors. You invest in it by buying shares, like any traditional investment vehicle, and the staking itself is handled by the fund administrator. 5. Robinhood Markets Robinhood Markets (HOOD 4.23%) may be best known as the discount broker that ushered in the age of commission-free trading. That's not the only way it has been ahead of the game. In 2018, it began offering crypto trading of Bitcoin and Ethereum. The broker has since expanded its selection to include a few other cryptocurrencies, including Litecoin (LTC 0.18%) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH -1.93%). Although Robinhood isn't a pure cryptocurrency play, it does offer some exposure to Ethereum.\n\nHow to invest in Ethereum If you want to directly invest in Ethereum, you can buy it through a crypto exchange, a stock broker, or even a payment app that carries it. Since Ethereum is one of the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, it's available on almost all platforms that sell crypto. Here are the different types of platforms you can use to buy Ethereum: Cryptocurrency exchanges : The exchanges let users buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies. Examples of popular crypto exchanges include Coinbase and Gemini.\n\nThe exchanges let users buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies. Examples of popular crypto exchanges include Coinbase and Gemini.

Payment apps: You can buy and sell crypto, including Ethereum, on PayPal ( PYPL 1.4% For serious crypto investors, a crypto exchange is usually the best option. Exchanges offer the widest selection of cryptocurrencies and the most features. They also let you transfer your crypto off the exchange to a crypto wallet that you control. Stock brokers and payment apps often don't let you transfer your crypto anywhere. Related investing topics:\n\nShould you invest in Ethereum? Ethereum technology is at the core of most blockchain applications. Many believe blockchain will play a significant role in the future of finance and other industries, making exposure to Ethereum technology a potentially profitable addition to your investment portfolio. The value of Ether as a digital currency is much more volatile and unpredictable than the growth of Ethereum technology. You can mitigate some of that risk and should take steps to guard against hacking, but, ultimately, the value of any investment directly linked to Ether is likely to fluctuate. Any of the above investment recommendations deserves consideration, especially if you believe that the development of blockchain technology is only just beginning.\n\nEthereum FAQs What is ethereum? angle-down angle-up Ethereum is a blockchain technology in the form of software.

You are an experienced ETH cryptocurrency trader and you are trying to maximize your overall profit by trading ETH. In each day, you will make an action to buy or sell ETH. You will start with 1 million dollars, half in cash and half in ETH. You are assisted by a few analysts below and need to decide the final action.

ON-CHAIN ANALYST REPORT: Based on the recent information provided, it can be observed that the open price of ETH has been fluctuating between 1834.17 and 2128.61. The number of transactions, unique addresses, value transferred, average gas price, total gas used, and successful transactions have also been varying over time.

The short-long moving average signal, MACD signal, and Bollinger Bands signal have consistently indicated a sell trend for ETH. This suggests that there is downward pressure on the price of ETH in the market.

Additionally, the increase in average gas price and total gas used could indicate increased network activity and demand for ETH, but this has not translated into a positive price trend.

Overall, based on the provided information and signals, it can be estimated that the market trend for ETH is bearish, and investors may want to exercise caution when trading or investing in ETH at this time.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the market trend for ETH is bearish. The signals from the short-long moving average, MACD, and Bollinger Bands all indicate a sell trend for ETH, suggesting downward pressure on the price. Additionally, the fluctuating open price and other on-chain metrics do not show a positive price trend for ETH.

However, the news analyst report presents a contrasting view, indicating a bullish market trend for Ethereum. The news of BlackRock's confirmation of plans to launch an Ethereum Spot ETF has led to a surge in the price of Ethereum and positive market sentiment. This news is likely to attract more investors and increase demand for Ethereum, potentially leading to an upward trend in the near future.

Considering the conflicting signals from the on-chain and news analyst reports, I would lean towards the bullish market trend indicated by the news. The significant positive sentiment surrounding Ethereum due to the ETF announcement could outweigh the bearish signals from the on-chain data.

Therefore, I would suggest a conservative action of buying ETH with 20% cash, indicating a moderate confidence in the bullish market trend predicted by the news analyst report.

Action: -0.2 (buy with 20% cash)

Nasdaq also filed a proposal on Thursday to list and trade shares of the trust.\n\nThe price of ethereum was last up 9.18% at around $2,062.8, its highest level since April.

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
Based on the news provided, it is evident that there is a significant focus on the development of Ethereum ETFs, particularly with BlackRock filing for a spot Ethereum ETF. This news has led to a surge in the price of Ethereum, reaching its highest level since April. Additionally, the filing of a proposal by Nasdaq to list and trade shares of the Ethereum trust further indicates a growing interest in Ethereum-based investment products.

The news also mentions the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which could pave the way for similar approvals for Ethereum ETFs. The market sentiment seems positive towards the approval of these ETFs, with analysts and investors anticipating further growth in the cryptocurrency market.

Overall, the news suggests a bullish trend in the cryptocurrency market, particularly for Ethereum, as the development of ETFs and increased institutional interest could drive prices higher. Investors may consider monitoring the approval process of these ETFs and the market reaction to further assess the potential market trend.

You are an experienced ETH cryptocurrency trader and you are trying to maximize your overall profit by trading ETH. In each day, you will make an action to buy or sell ETH. You will start with 1 million dollars, half in cash and half in ETH. You are assisted by a few analysts below and need to decide the final action.

ON-CHAIN ANALYST REPORT: Based on the recent information provided, it can be observed that the open price of ETH has been fluctuating between 1855.45 and 2128.61. The number of transactions, unique addresses, and value transferred have been increasing over time, indicating a growing interest and activity in the ETH market.

The average gas price has also been increasing, which could be a result of higher demand for transactions on the Ethereum network. The total gas used has remained relatively stable, suggesting that the network is able to handle the increased activity efficiently.

The signals from the short-long moving average, MACD, and Bollinger Bands all indicate a sell trend. This could suggest that the market is currently in a bearish phase, with potential downward pressure on the price of ETH.

Overall, based on the information provided, the market trend for ETH appears to be bearish in the short term. However, it is important to continue monitoring the market for any changes in trend or new developments that could impact the price of ETH.

NEWS ANALYST REPORT: Based on the news provided, it is evident that there is a significant focus on the development of Ethereum ETFs, particularly with BlackRock filing for a spot Ethereum ETF.

Investors may consider monitoring the approval process of these ETFs and the market reaction to further assess the potential market trend.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, we can see that the market trend for ETH is currently bearish in the short term. The signals from various indicators such as the short-long moving average, MACD, and Bollinger Bands all point towards a sell trend. This indicates potential downward pressure on the price of ETH.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights a bullish trend in the cryptocurrency market, particularly for Ethereum, due to the development of Ethereum ETFs and increased institutional interest. This positive sentiment could drive prices higher in the near future.

Considering both reports, it seems that the bullish news sentiment may outweigh the bearish on-chain indicators in the short term. Therefore, I would suggest a slightly bullish action of buying ETH with 20% cash.

Action: -0.2 (buy with 20% cash)

Solana is an example. These all got beaten up real bad during the bear market. As such, they will levitate off extreme lows and provide great returns for intrepid investors. But, they are still all overhyped, me-too, pieces of sh*t that won’t overtake Ethereum in terms of active developers, decentralized applications (DApps) activity, or Total Value Locked.\n\nFinally, all manner of DApps and their respective tokens will pump.

Superimposing this percentage difference on the weekly chart puts a target objective of $4,736.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) spurs optimism, moving north to signify rising momentum while its position at 64 shows there is still more room to the north.

Prices are still trending above the $2,000 psychological support, a critical reaction level.\n\nA look at the Ethereum candlestick arrangement in the daily chart shows that while there is a notable spike in daily revenue, prices are still below July 2023 highs. Then, the coin soared to as high as $2,100 before pulling back as the momentum triggered by the broader crypto’s expectation of a Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) approval faded. However, prices have since sharply recovered, adding roughly 40% from October lows and shaking off the weakness registered on August 17 when the coin plunged by 14%.\n\nToken Terminal data shows that Ethereum’s daily revenue has steadily risen in the first ten days of November. Looking at trends, the average daily income has doubled from $5 million in the first five days of the month. Usually, an uptick in daily average revenue in a network points to increasing on-chain activity either through smart contract deployment or simple transfers, which necessitates the payment of gas fees.\n\nImproving Scalability In The Long Term\n\nHow the widespread adoption of Ethereum layer-2 and sidechain scaling solutions will impact the network revenue is not immediately apparent. }\n\nWhat’s clear is that the more protocols leverage the protocol, deploying multiple solutions, the more revenue the network will generate for validators and stakers. Staking rewards are drawn partly from transaction fees paid as gas, new issuance, and burned miner extractable value (MEV).\n\nStill, the dollar value of ETH minted as revenue depends on spot rates. If the uptrend is sustained, this figure will continue expanding. Even so, there might be more demand for the network, which is still struggling to scale on-chain.\n\nEthereum 2.0 aims to resolve these challenges in the coming years by increasing the general throughput via solutions like Sharding. Sharding will split Ethereum into small but interconnected networks called shards. Each shard will independently process each set of transactions and maintain its state, allowing the mainnet to scale.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

He pointed out how the ETH/BTC pair finally broke the wedge to the downside, highlighting that it’s akin to what happened in the last cycle.\n\nAs he connects the dots, the Ether-Bitcoin pair is potentially backtesting the trendline that served as support in October 2022, March 2023, June 2023, and September 2023. Since the ETH/BTC pair is now testing from beneath the wedge in November 2023, it could offer a significant resistance level.\n\nHowever, Cowen cautions that even if ETH/BTC manages to move above the trendline, the pair will encounter several resistance levels to the upside. These levels must be successfully flipped as support to convincingly reverse the downtrend.\n\nHe further explained, stating that, there are numerous resistance levels. Whether one opts to depict them horizontally or analyze them differently, ETH/BTC still faces a significant challenge. It must have to overcome these resistance levels to indicate a meaningful reversal.\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH/BTC is valued at 0.05578 BTC, equivalent to $2,068.80 on Tradingview. Meanwhile, BTC/USDT is valued at $37,112, according to Coingecko.\n\nETF expectations\n\nThe recent surge in Bitcoin and Ethereum has significantly influenced the cryptocurrency market.\n\nBitcoin has reached $37,000, marking highs not seen since May 2022. This may be driven by the ongoing expectation that U.S. regulators approve a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nSimultaneously, Ethereum has rallied close to $2,100, reclaiming the $2,000 level for the first time since mid-July. The rise in digital assets, especially XRP, may also be attributed to Bitcoin surpassing $35,000.\n\nAdditionally, news about BlackRock planning to file for an ETH-based ETF may have also fueled Ethereum’s upward momentum.\n\nFollowing the anticipation of the ETF approval, which has propelled cryptocurrency prices and related stocks, This rally could be part of a broader uptrend in the crypto sector, recognized as a significant $17.7 trillion opportunity by market strategists.\n\nHowever, altcoins like XRP, DOGE, UNI, and XLM have experienced declines, possibly due to a pause in capital rotation towards smaller tokens.\n\nFed chair Jerome Powell recently delivered a policy address to the Economic Club of New York, providing insights into the current state of the US economy and monetary policy.\n\nThis statement is significant given the critical juncture of the U.S. economy, marked by improving inflation figures alongside surging Treasury yields, creating conflicting signals about the direction of monetary policy.\n\nInterpreted as a signal, Powell’s statement suggests that the Fed might persist with its tightening cycle, contrary to recent market expectations of a more dovish approach.\n\nRead more: Bitwise withdraws bitcoin and ethereum ETF application\n\nFollow Us on Google News'}].

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, we can see that the market trend for ETH is currently bearish. The short-long moving average signal, MACD signal, and Bollinger Bands signal all indicate a "sell" recommendation, suggesting a potential downward trend in the market. Additionally, the open price of ETH has been fluctuating, and the indicators point towards a possible decrease in price.

On the other hand, the news analyst report presents a bullish sentiment towards Ethereum, with predictions of significant price increases and positive technical analysis indicators supporting a bullish thesis for ETH.

Considering both reports, it is important to note that technical analysis indicators and market sentiment can sometimes conflict. In this case, the bearish trend indicated by the on-chain analysis seems to outweigh the bullish sentiment from the news articles.

Therefore, I would suggest a conservative approach and recommend selling ETH with a moderate confidence level to align with the bearish market trend.

This was because BlackRock filed for an Ethereum ETF, triggering a breakout for ETH as the coin rose above $2,000.\n\nAs expected, the increase led the broader market to assume that it is the altcoin season to shine. But while the market was fixated on the price action, the Ethereum blockchain was also hitting landmarks that it had previously dropped from.\n\nReturns get back to the highs\n\nOne such milestone was the Ethereum revenue. Eric Smith, Chief Investment Officer at 401 Financials, posted that the revenue had hit $10 million again. From the data coined from Token Terminal, the last time the Ethereum blockchain hit such levels was in July.\n\nETH price wasn’t the only thing that was up yesterday.

Hence, the increase in revenue means that there was a surge in activity on the blockchain during the week.\n\nThe surge in revenue also means that there must have been an increase in the average gas price. According to information from Etherscan, ETH’s average transaction fee tapped 57.1 on 9th November.\n\nThe Ethereum gas measures the amount of computational effort required to make transactions on the network. It also serves as a way of incentivizing validators on the blockchain. For context, validators are people responsible for keeping the Ethereum network working.\n\nActivity rises, then dips\n\nThis value was the highest in the last 30 days, meaning that there was an increase in demand for ETH. Elsewhere, Ethereum’s network growth rose to 78,500. Network growth shows the number of new addresses being created on the blockchain.\n\nWhen the metric increases, it means user adoption is growing on the network. A decrease implies that traction has reduced. So, the initial jump suggests that new addresses were transacting actively on Ethereum.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nBut at the time of writing, the network growth had dropped to 29,300. Like the network growth, active addresses on the Ethereum network also climbed to 459,000 on 10 November. Active addresses show the level of interaction or speculation around a token.\n\nTherefore, the metric at that time means that deposits on the network were at impressive levels. However, the press time state of the active addresses showed that the metric had decreased.\n\nLooking at the current state of Ethereum, the drop in gas fees has affected the revenue. Going forward, to surpass the $10 billion, the demand for ETH needs to increase more than it has recently.'}]. Analyze the news and estimate the market trend accordingly.
*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
Based on the news articles provided, it is evident that there is a significant increase in institutional and whale demand for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies. The surge in large-scale transactions, particularly in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polygon, indicates growing interest from institutional investors. The upcoming launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs and BlackRock's plans to introduce a spot Ethereum ETF further support the notion of renewed institutional demand in the crypto market.

Additionally, the analysis by a top trader suggests that rallies are expected for Ethereum and an artificial intelligence-focused altcoin, Fetch.ai. The trader's chart indicates potential resistance levels to watch for Ethereum and FET, which could lead to price increases if surpassed.

Furthermore, the news about BlackRock challenging the SEC regarding spot market Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs highlights the push for regulatory approval of these investment products. BlackRock's argument that spot market crypto ETFs are no different from futures ETFs could potentially pave the way for more accessible investment vehicles in the crypto market.

Overall, the news articles suggest a positive market trend for Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, driven by increasing institutional demand, potential price rallies, and regulatory developments. Investors may consider monitoring these developments closely to make informed trading decisions.

You are an experienced ETH cryptocurrency trader and you are trying to maximize your overall profit by trading ETH. In each day, you will make an action to buy or sell ETH. You will start with 1 million dollars, half in cash and half in ETH. You are assisted by a few analysts below and need to decide the final action.

ON-CHAIN ANALYST REPORT: Based on the recent information provided, it can be observed that the open price of ETH has been fluctuating between 1887.32 and 2128.61. The number of transactions, unique addresses, value transferred, average gas price, total gas used, and successful transactions have also been varying.

The technical indicators such as short-long moving average signal, MACD signal, and Bollinger Bands signal are all indicating a sell trend. This suggests that the market sentiment is bearish and there is a potential downward trend in the price of ETH.

Overall, based on the current data and technical indicators, it is likely that the market trend for ETH is bearish and traders may consider selling or holding their positions. It is important to keep monitoring the market conditions and indicators for any potential changes in the trend.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, the technical indicators are signaling a bearish trend for ETH. The fluctuating open price, along with the sell signals from the short-long moving average, MACD, and Bollinger Bands, indicate a potential downward movement in the price of ETH. This suggests that it may be wise to consider selling or holding positions in ETH.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights a positive market trend for Ethereum, driven by increasing institutional demand, potential price rallies, and regulatory developments. The surge in institutional and whale demand, along with the upcoming launch of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, indicate a bullish sentiment in the market.

Considering both reports, it seems that there is a divergence in the market sentiment. While the technical indicators point towards a bearish trend, the news articles suggest a bullish outlook for Ethereum. In this case, I would lean towards the news analyst report and the positive market trend it indicates.

Therefore, I would recommend buying ETH with a confidence level of 0.6.

The milestone was driven by a sharp uptick in activity on Solana, with the network hosting only 208,000 active addresses on Nov. 7.\n\nFor comparison, Ethereum consistently hosted between 290,000 and 350,000 users daily over the majority of the past three months, with two brief spikes above 400,000 and a surge to more than 1M wallets.\n\nSolana Overtakes Ethereum By Active Users After 70% Spike\n\nThe milestone is the latest sign of Solana’s recovery following last year’s brutal bear and the fallout from the collapse of its major investor, FTX.\n\nThe price of SOL plummeted more than 96% from its November 2021 all-time high of $250 to less than $10 in January, according to CoinGecko.

The total value locked in Solana-based DeFi protocols is up 62% over the same period, according to DeFi Llama, while NFT sales volume grew 35% in the past 30 days, according to Crypto Slam.\n\nThe move followed progress towards Solana's firedancer upgrade in the form of a testnet, and dissipating expectations that the FTX bankruptcy estate would soon offload large sums of SOL on the markets.\n\nEthereum’s Layer 2s\n\nWhile some analysts have been quick to pronounce that Solana has flipped Ethereum by active users in response to the recent uptick in activity. However, the Ethereum ecosystem has expanded beyond its base-layer, with the majority of activity now taking place on Layer 2.\n\nAccording to data from Token Terminal, more than 800,000 users were active on the top seven Layer 2 networks over the past day combined. Coupled with the Ethereum mainnet, the data suggests more than 1M wallets were active across the Ethereum ecosystem. However, said data does not account for users operating the same wallet across multiple networks.\n\nAccording to L2beat, Layer 2 networks are driving 80% of activity in Ethereum’s broader ecosystem, which is driving roughly 60 transactions per second.\n\nTo continue reading this as well as other DeFi and Web3 news, visit us at thedefiant.io"}, {'id': 10, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hc2RhcS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvc29sYW5hLWhpdHMtbmV3LWFubnVhbC1oaWdoLWF0LSQ1OC1hbmFseXN0LXByZWRpY3RzLWV0aGVyZXVtLWtpbGxlci1jb3VsZC1za3lyb2NrZXQtdG8t0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Mon, 13 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Solana Hits New Annual High At $58 — Analyst Predicts 'Ethereum Killer' Could Skyrocket To $1000 - Nasdaq", 'content': 'Solana (CRYPTO: SOL), once called an ‘Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) killer\' has experienced a remarkable surge in price, surging by 40% in the past week and reaching a new high for the year 2023 at approximately $58.\n\nWhat Happened: Crypto analyst Jacob Canfield has conducted a comprehensive analysis suggesting that Solana could be on the verge of an unprecedented market surge.

The popular digital currency has recently surged to levels not seen in almost eighteen months.\n\nSince taking out the $32,000 level of resistance near the end of October, the price of one bitcoin has surged to $38,000. The last time the bitcoin price traded near this level was over a year ago, in May 2022.\n\nBitcoin and another leading, popular digital currency, Ethereum (ETH), have also been in the headlines for reasons other than price surges. The world\'s largest asset manager, BlackRock, recently filed for an Ether exchange-traded fund. This move created further optimism that the crypto markets could see greater access, more significant institutional involvement, and liquidity.\n\nSo, as the price leading cryptocurrency’s trade higher in part due to the potential of a regulated exchange-traded product tied to the spot price of Ethereum, it’s worth looking closer at some individual stocks tied to digital currency and also noting where the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) stands with regards to approving a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nBlackRock takes steps toward launching Ethereum ETF\n\nBlackRock has officially confirmed its plans for a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) through a filing with the SEC. The filing, submitted by Nasdaq on behalf of BlackRock, proposes an ETF named the "iShares Ethereum Trust." This move signifies BlackRock\'s intention to expand its ETF offerings beyond Bitcoin, marking a significant step in its cryptocurrency investment strategy.\n\nThe filing comes after BlackRock registered the corporate entity "iShares Ethereum Trust" in Delaware, hinting at the imminent submission of a spot Ether ETF filing. Several financial firms, including BlackRock, have shown interest in cryptocurrency-backed ETFs, with at least five firms vying for SEC approval for a spot Ethereum ETF, according to Bloomberg’s James Seyffart.\n\nSpeculation grows about the SEC approving a spot Bitcoin ETF\n\nSpeculation is growing about the SEC approving a spot Bitcoin ETF. Analysts have estimated a January approval at the earliest, emphasizing the SEC\'s cautious stance. Recent speculation suggests potential decisions on applications from BlackRock and Fidelity, but the SEC extended the timeline for the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF to Jan. 10.\n\nSo, as speculation grows and the price for several popular digital currencies surges, here’s a list of four crypto-related stocks that could see rapid price appreciation should breaking news occur.\n\nFour crypto-related stocks to keep an eye on\n\nMarathon Digital (NASDAQ: MARA)\n\nMara is a Las Vegas-based digital asset technology company. The company specializes in blockchain-based mining and produces digital assets such as Bitcoin. Shares of the crypto company have skyrocketed this year, up about 180%. However, the stock has failed to join the latest crypto uptrend and, over the previous three months, fell almost 36%.\n\nMicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR)\n\nMicroStrategy is a global provider of enterprise analytics software and services. MicroStrategy is actively involved with Bitcoin, holding and acquiring the cryptocurrency as part of its strategic investment strategy. As of November 1, 2023, MicroStrategy possesses 158,400 bitcoins, acquired at an average purchase price of $29,609.65 per bitcoin, resulting in a total investment of $4.69 billion.\n\nCoinbase Global (NASDAQ: COIN)\n\nCoinbase Global is a major cryptocurrency exchange offering tools for trading over 200 cryptocurrencies. COIN shares have performed exceptionally on the year by any standard, up almost 163% and recently rallying double-digits off key support in the $70s. However, analysts are not bullish on the stock, with a consensus Hold rating and a price target of $75.64, predicting almost 19% downside.\n\nRiot Platforms (NASDAQ: RIOT)\n\nRiot is a U.S. blockchain technology company that strives to be the premier provider of Bitcoin mining services in North America. The company offers cryptocurrency mining hardware, hosting services, and proprietary software. Shares of RIOT have impressed this year, to say the least, up 205%. However, the stock has failed to catch a bid off the recent sector headlines and has fallen almost 32% over the previous three months.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.'}, {'id': 17, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy90b2tlbnVtLXVudmVpbHMtaW5ub3ZhdGl2ZS1nYXNsZXNzLXBsYXRmb3JtLTE1NTUwMDQ5Ny5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Mon, 13 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Tokenum Unveils Innovative Gasless Platform for the Ethereum Blockchain - A Game-Changer for the World of ... - Yahoo Finance', 'content': 'Tokenum\n\nTOKYO, JAPAN, Nov. 13, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\n\nTokenum, a pioneering cryptocurrency platform, is proud to introduce its groundbreaking "gasless technology." This revolutionary innovation simplifies cryptocurrency transactions and token offerings on the Ethereum blockchain, ushering in a new era of user-friendly accessibility.\n\nThe platform has already embarked on alpha testing, with an accelerated beta version scheduled for release within a week.\n\nRevolutionary Technology\n\nTokenum\'s gasless technology marks a significant advancement in the cryptocurrency landscape for several compelling reasons.\n\n1) Innovative Gas-free Transactions\n\nIn traditional banking, transaction fees are paid using the same currency that is being transacted. However, in the world of cryptocurrency, fees are often paid in another, blockchain-specific digital currencies. Such fees are referred to as "gas." Tokenum\'s gasless technology eliminates the need for users to grapple with this complex concept, making cryptocurrency more accessible to a broader audience.\n\n2) Supercharged Token Sales\n\nNew cryptocurrency projects face various challenges, including scheduling, legal compliance, compatible wallets, and sale regulations. Additionally, for users to participate in project sales, users must first acquire specific coins to cover blockchain gas fees. Tokenum\'s gasless technology simplifies this process, making it easier for crypto projects to attract users and maximize revenue from each sale.\n\n3) NFT Industry Transformation\n\nTokenum\'s gasless technology presents an opportunity to reshape the NFT industry. NFT creators and owners can now prepay for NFT transfers, removing the burden of gas payments for users. This opens the door to entirely new audiences and streamlines the process, making it as effortless as managing digital art on Instagram or Pinterest.\n\n4) Removal of Entry Barriers for New Ecosystems\n\nTokenum also benefits new blockchains by allowing users to leverage the tokens they already have, eliminating the need to acquire blockchain-specialized coins for different networks and ecosystems. This significantly simplifies the sophisticated process of navigating and using new blockchains, platforms, or even metaverses.\n\nStory continues\n\nAll Gas No Brakes and Light-Years Ahead\n\nOne of the most notable aspects of Tokenum is its current full-fledged operational status. While other industry players, such as Circle Inc., Auros, 0xGasless, Open Zeppelin, and more, are still in the developmental stages, Tokenum is live and fully functional on the Ethereum network. The platform\'s future plans include expanding its support to encompass additional networks.\n\nThe AI-Powered CEO Behind Tokenum\n\nTokenum\'s powerful technology is spearheaded by a distinctive team, represented by Takeshi Tokenai, an AI-powered CEO. Notably, Takeshi was formally appointed as the leader on July 1, 2021, making him the world\'s first AI CEO. Conversely, Tokenum\'s technological prowess is underpinned by the collective expertise of its international team, boasting two decades of experience in the realms of cybersecurity, high technology, and blockchain. When asked to share their comments on the matter, Takeshi Tokenai\'s only statement was: "Tokenum is here to take the crypto world by storm."\n\nWhat Lies Ahead\n\nIn summary, Tokenum\'s gasless technology is reshaping the cryptocurrency landscape by simplifying transactions, facilitating token sales, and supporting the growth of new blockchains. Now the project is already integrated with CyberWallet, the one of the most secure wallets at the market, and HyperID, the single identity solution. Together, they creates seamless entrance to any web3 project, space or activity for any user, regardless of their crypto skills. Tokenum is poised to become a major player in the future of cryptocurrency.\n\nCurrently, the company is offering giveaways and opportunities on its X channel (formerly Twitter), as well as on Zealy and QuestN, prominent crypto-community platforms. In the cryptocurrency world, such initiatives often signal preparations for rapid expansion and the potential launch of their own token.\n\nFor further updates and insights, please visit Tokenum\'s official website: https://tokenum.net\n\n\n\nJoin the conversation on Tokenum\'s X channel (formerly Twitter) by following @tokenum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more information, press inquiries, or collaboration opportunities, please contact:\n\nTakeshi Tokenai at info (at) tokenum.net\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, or intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: N/A

Start your response with your reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, the technical indicators are signaling a bearish trend for ETH. The open price of ETH has been fluctuating, and the market sentiment is currently negative. Additionally, the news analyst report highlights the positive momentum and growth of Solana, suggesting a bullish trend in the broader cryptocurrency market.

Considering the contrasting information from the on-chain and news analyst reports, I believe that the bullish trend in Solana and the positive sentiment in the cryptocurrency market may outweigh the bearish trend in ETH. Therefore, I predict that the overall market trend is upwards.

Given my confidence in the bullish trend, I will take a significant action to buy ETH with 70% cash.

Based on the recent information provided, it appears that the market trend for ETH is currently bearish. The open prices have been decreasing over the past few days, and the number of successful transactions has also been declining. Additionally, all three technical indicators (short-long moving average signal, MACD signal, and Bollinger Bands signal) are indicating a sell signal.

The average gas price has been fluctuating but remains relatively high, indicating high network activity. The total gas used has also been consistently high, suggesting a high level of demand for Ethereum transactions.

Overall, the market trend for ETH is bearish, and it is likely that the price may continue to decline in the near future. Traders and investors should exercise caution and consider selling or holding their positions accordingly.
