Overall, I need to reassess my trading strategy and potentially take a more aggressive approach in order to generate higher returns in the future.

Start your response with your brief reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Given the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, the market trend for ETH appears to be bullish in the short term, with buy signals indicating positive momentum. The news analyst report also supports this bullish trend, with positive developments such as the migration of Celo to Ethereum Layer 2 and the potential for a new recovery cycle for Ethereum.

Reflecting on my recent trading performance, it is clear that a more aggressive approach may be necessary to maximize returns in the current market conditions. Therefore, I will take a more confident stance on the bullish trend and make a bold trading decision.

This pushes it past palladium and brings it to just $17 billion behind platinum, indicating a notable surge among global assets.\n\nBitcoin also retains a substantial rank as the 12th largest global asset by market capitalization, with a valuation of approximately $570 billion. Although it’s still significantly away from the top group—occupied by tech stocks and precious metals such as silver and gold—its stature remains among the world’s leading assets.\n\nThese advancements highlight the growing impact of cryptocurrencies on the global financial stage.

Meanwhile, Plutus is the platform’s smart contract language, which powers decentralized applications (DApps). These elements are designed to ensure secure and cost-efficient transactions, which is key to the overall utility and adoption of a blockchain network.\n\nThe lower transaction cost is a major point of contention between Cardano and Ethereum, the latter of which has faced criticism for its high transaction fees, particularly during periods of network congestion. Cardano, which is known as the "Japanese Ethereum," is aiming to offer a more accessible, affordable, and permissionless blockchain.\n\nHoskinson\'s comments align with his previous criticisms of Ethereum, where he notably challenged the staking mechanism of the blockchain he once helped to create.\n\nHe has been known to contrast the approaches of the two platforms, suggesting that Cardano\'s proof-of-stake protocol is designed more effectively, contributing to its superiority over Ethereum.\n\nIn a series of critical remarks, Hoskinson has also described Ethereum as "a dumpster fire" and suggested that it could become obsolete.'}, {'id': 6, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vdS50b2RheS9ldGhlcmV1bS1ldGYtcmFjZS1nYWlucy1zdGVhbS1zaXgtYXNzZXQtbWFuYWdlcnMtZmlsZWQtd2l0aC1zZWPSAVNodHRwczovL3UudG9kYXkvZXRoZXJldW0tZXRmLXJhY2UtZ2FpbnMtc3RlYW0tc2l4LWFzc2V0LW1hbmFnZXJzLWZpbGVkLXdpdGgtc2VjP2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Tue, 01 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Ethereum ETF Race Gains Steam, Six Asset Managers Filed With SEC - U.Today', 'content': 'Advertisement\n\nEric Balchunas, Bloomberg\'s senior analyst for exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and his colleague James Seyffart summarized all approval requests for Ethereum (ETH) futures ETFs that are under review by the U.S. Securities and Exchanges Commission.\n\nVanEcks, ProShares, Grayscale, who else?

In TradFi, security dealers will find short-term repos to manage both their own assets and their client’s assets. In the case of Term Finance, the security dealer will be replaced by smart contracts.\n\nBilly Welch, the co-founder of Term Labs, the team behind Term Finance, told Blockworks its ability to scale fixed-term lending sets it apart from other fixed-term lending protocols.\n\nMany existing fixed-term lending protocols today utilize automated market makers and liquidity pools to originate fixed-term loans.\n\n“From a borrower’s perspective, when you’re trying to borrow (for example) $500,000, $1 million, $2 million, there is significant slippage,” Welch said. “It’s not scalable for an institutional level user, then from [a liquidity provider] or lender’s perspective, you only make returns as borrowers interact against that pool. So your real returns are half a percent per year.”\n\nTerm Finance, on the other hand, uses a double-sided blind auction process where the protocol matches borrowers and lenders depending on how much they are willing to bid, Welch said.\n\n“We conduct these auctions where borrowers and lenders can submit their bids and offers to borrow and lend over a period of time, and once the auction closes, we take the bids and offers and create a supply-demand curve,” Welch said. “Any borrower that’s willing to bid at or above the clearing rate gets a loan, and any lender willing to receive the clearing rate or less makes a loan.”\n\nWith this model, liquidity providers will not have to trap their liquidity in an automated market maker for an indefinite amount of time.\n\n“All you have to do is lock it up for the period of when you submit your bid, if you get done in an auction you get a loan, and if you don’t you can take your tokens back and send it to another DeFi lending protocol and get variable rate lending in that capacity,” Welch said.\n\nThe first public auction on Ethereum mainnet will be a one-month loan maturing Aug. 31 on wstETH collateral borrowing USDC. The auction will begin at 11 am ET today, and interested participants will have 48 hours before Thursday at 11 am ET to place their bids.\n\n“The long-term vision is we have a repo token maturing every week, every month, going out to one year. This can serve as a basis for a DeFi native benchmark yield curve,” Welch said.\n\nDon’t miss the next big story – join our free daily newsletter.'}].

Start your response with your brief reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

Based on the news articles provided, it is evident that there is a significant interest in Ethereum (ETH) futures-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) among asset managers. Six asset managers have filed applications with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for ETH futures-based ETFs, indicating a growing demand for investment products related to Ethereum.

The filings include applications from Volatility Shares, Bitwise, VanEck, Roundhill, ProShares, and Grayscale Investments. These ETFs would invest in futures contracts of Ethereum traded on the CFTC-regulated Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), rather than holding the underlying asset directly.

When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Given the information provided by the on-chain and news analyst reports, it is clear that the market trend for ETH is currently bullish. The technical indicators are showing buy signals, and there is a growing interest in Ethereum futures-based ETFs among asset managers, which could potentially drive up the demand for ETH.

Considering the positive trend in the market, I am confident in my prediction that ETH will continue to rise in value. Therefore, I will take a more aggressive approach and buy more ETH with a higher confidence level.

*** ONCHAIN ANALYST RESPONSE ***
Based on the recent information provided, it appears that the ETH cryptocurrency has been consistently showing buy signals across various indicators such as short_long_ma, macd, and bollinger bands. This suggests that there is a positive sentiment in the market and that the price of ETH may continue to rise in the near future.

The bollinger bands signal of "hold" indicates that there may be some consolidation or sideways movement in the price before a potential breakout. However, the overall trend seems to be bullish based on the buy signals from the other indicators.

Therefore, it is likely that the market trend for ETH is upward and traders may consider buying or holding onto their positions in anticipation of further price increases. It is important to continue monitoring the market and adjusting strategies accordingly to capitalize on potential opportunities.

Vann added:\n\n“This is a significant step forward for our multichain strategy, as it will enable our token to access the rich and diverse ecosystems on both chains.”\n\nAdditionally, the Ethereum and BNB Chain cross-chain bridges will offer users of the two networks a chance to join the emerging WMT ecosystem. BNB Chain and Ethereum are two of the most used smart contract networks, with both networks having more than 200 million unique addresses, respectively.\n\nWMT eyes liquidity\n\nIn addition to its primary objective, the initiative is set to bolster WMT liquidity. Compared to its native Cardano network, Ethereum and BNB Chain currently demonstrate higher levels of liquidity.\n\nNotably, the World Mobile sidechain AyA will see seamless integration with these two prominent networks, further enhancing its potential and accessibility.\n\nWith the creation of the new bridges, WMT now has three cross-chain bridges connecting it to other networks. The third bridge connects World Mobile to Conflux (CFX) blockchain.\n\nDespite a slight drop of 0.93% in the last 24 hours, WMT’s price holds steady at $0.11489, as per the data from CryptoSlate.\n\nMentioned in this article'}, {'id': 8, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NidGMuY29tL25ld3MvZXRoZXJldW0vb24tY2hhaW4tbWV0cmljLXN0YWduYXRpb24tZXRoZXJldW0tYnJlYWstMjAwMC_SAVlodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzYnRjLmNvbS9uZXdzL2V0aGVyZXVtL29uLWNoYWluLW1ldHJpYy1zdGFnbmF0aW9uLWV0aGVyZXVtLWJyZWFrLTIwMDAvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Thu, 03 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Key On-Chain Metric Points to Stagnation, Will Ethereum Ever Break $2,000? - NewsBTC', 'content': 'According to Etherscan data, the number of active ERC-20 addresses has not changed much in 2023. It has stayed between 200,000 and 300,000 while Ethereum prices stagnate below July 2023 highs. As of August 2, there were about 275,000 active ERC-20 addresses, up from 156,000 on June 18. Although activity has been low overall, there was a significant increase on June 11, with over 446,000 active ERC-20 addresses.\n\nEthereum’s price trajectory has been tumultuous in tandem with this activity pattern, looking at the charts. For instance, Ethereum bulls have failed to breach the $2,100 liquidation level posted in the latter stages of H1 2023.\n\nEthereum Prices Volatile, Few Coins Burned\n\nAt the moment, ETH prices hover around the $1,800 range, teetering precariously and likely to drop, looking at candlestick arrangements in the daily chart. Although Ethereum has been bullish in the past two months, bulls have been tamed, and a drop below the $1,800 level may signal a shift from bullish to bearish in the medium term.\n\nWith ETH under pressure, the number of active ERC-20 addresses remains constant and relatively lower than the 2021 peaks. This means there is less demand for ETH, which is used to pay transaction fees. As a result, gas fees are lower because there is less competition for block space. Typically, this would encourage more people to participate and even deploy complex contracts in decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nWith EIP-1559 in the equation, low activity means fewer coins are taken out of circulation. Despite low network activity, the protocol continues to issue 2 ETH after each validated block, watering down deflationary effects enforced by EIP-1559.\n\nDeFi Activities Falling\n\nFalling activity could be attributed to the waning interest in decentralized finance (DeFi) activities over recent months. As of August 2, the total value locked (TVL) remains below $50 billion, with a significant portion of assets tied in Ethereum. DeFi projects like LidoDAO, Curve, and Uniswap facilitate the trading of ERC-20 tokens.\n\nFurthermore, on-chain data highlights USDT as the most actively transacted token. Given its position as the third-largest coin by market cap, with substantial circulation in Ethereum and Tron networks, such a trend is expected.\n\nLooking back at ERC-20 transactions from June and July, it is evident that transfers stayed constant despite temporary price increases. Ethereum prices rose from $1,630 to $2,000 between mid-June and mid-July 2023, but ETH is now lower.\n\nOn-chain ERC-20 activity has remained stable despite price volatility. It’s unclear whether there will be a change in activity as prices continue to drop. However, lower prices may force token holders to wait and see, leading to less activity.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Identify key trends and indicators in the current cryptocurrency market that are likely to influence future trades. Also assess whether a more aggressive or conservative trading approach is warranted. 
*** REFLECTION ANALYST RESPONSE ***
Reflecting on my recent trading performance, it is evident that my more aggressive approach to buying ETH with higher confidence levels has not yielded the desired results. Despite the bullish trend in the market and positive news surrounding Ethereum, the daily returns have been negative in both instances. This suggests that perhaps a more conservative trading approach may be more appropriate in the current market conditions.

Key trends and indicators in the current cryptocurrency market that are likely to influence future trades include the on-chain analysis, technical indicators such as moving averages and MACD, as well as news surrounding developments and interest in Ethereum. These factors have consistently pointed towards a bullish trend for ETH, indicating potential opportunities for profitable trades.

Moving forward, it may be beneficial to take a more cautious approach and carefully assess the market conditions before making trading decisions. While it is important to capitalize on bullish trends, it is equally important to manage risk and avoid potential losses. By striking a balance between aggressiveness and conservatism in trading strategies, I can better navigate the volatile cryptocurrency market and maximize returns.

At the time of writing, CRV currently has a token liquidity of $6.75 million, a significant dip from $70.42 million before the hacks.\n\n“LPs (liquidity providers) are moving to other pools, so you’re seeing a lot of volume go to other DEXes,” Fish told Blockworks. “We want to join and put ourselves into that mix.”\n\nCapturing the stablecoin market\n\nFish notes that Trader Joe’s initial plan was to deploy on Ethereum in a month or two, around the beginning of Q4, after working on improving its auto pool technology.\n\n“But this opportunity came up, and we felt this is the best time to deploy,” he said.\n\nAuto pools are designed to help automate the balance of liquidity for users passively.\n\n“Ethereum runs a little bit slower, it is gas intensive, and our AMMs also use a lot of gas,” Fish explained. “If you’re managing positions in a concentrated liquidity AMM, which requires you to rebalance often, and make a lot of transactions every day, then for the average Joe it’s going to be very uncomfortable for him to market make.”\n\nLuckily, managing positions in a stable stablecoin market is relatively simple, Fish said.\n\n“The price of USDC and USDT isn’t going to vary that much,” he said. “So in most cases, people can just deploy in that range and then earn fees from within that range.”\n\nTrader Joe’s initial launch on Ethereum will include stablecoin pools USDC/USDT and USDC/DAI.\n\nHow Trader Joe compares to Uniswap\n\nLike Uniswap v3, Trader Joe is a concentrated liquidity AMM, providing constrained liquidity within a tight range for its users.\n\nCompared to its competitor, its unique edge is that it offers dynamic fee components, Fish noted.\n\nOn Uniswap v3, liquidity providers are offered three fee tiers, ranging from 0.05%, 0.3% and 1%.\n\nBy contrast, on Trader Joe, there is a base fixed fee and a variable component which is dependent on the volatility within the past few seconds to minutes.\n\nTrader Joe is currently deployed on Avalanche, Arbitrum and BNB chains.\n\nAccording to data on DeFiLlama, Trader Joe has a $57.45 million TVL on Avalanche, making it the largest DEX on the network.\n\nOn Arbitrum, however, it sports a TVL of $31.9 million, a significantly less amount compared to Uniswap v3, which currently reports volumes of $261.7 million.\n\nDon’t miss the next big story – join our free daily newsletter.'}, {'id': 39, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZW56aW5nYS5jb20vbWFya2V0cy9jcnlwdG9jdXJyZW5jeS8yMy8wOC8zMzU4Mzk5NC9hLWxvb2stYXQtYml0Y29pbi1ldGhlcmV1bS1hbmQtZG9nZWNvaW4taW50by10aGUtd2Vla2VuZC1hcy1zdG9jay1tYXJrZXQtdHVybnMtbG93ZXLSAS1odHRwczovL3d3dy5iZW56aW5nYS5jb20vYW1wL2NvbnRlbnQvMzM1ODM5OTQ?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Fri, 04 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'A Look At Bitcoin, Ethereum And Dogecoin Into The Weekend As Stock Market Turns Lower - ProShares Trust U - Benzinga', 'content': "Loading...

Provide a brief reflection on your recent trading performance with a focus on the effective strategies and information that led to the most successful outcomes, and the ineffective strategies and information that led to loss of profit. Identify key trends and indicators in the current cryptocurrency market that are likely to influence future trades. Also assess whether a more aggressive or conservative trading approach is warranted. 
*** REFLECTION ANALYST RESPONSE ***
In reviewing my recent trading performance, it is evident that my decision to buy ETH with a higher confidence level during a bullish trend resulted in successful outcomes, as seen in the first action where I bought with 80% cash. This decision was supported by positive on-chain and news analyst reports, as well as technical indicators signaling a buy. However, my more aggressive approach in the subsequent actions did not yield as profitable results, as the daily returns were negative.

Moving forward, key trends and indicators in the current cryptocurrency market that are likely to influence future trades include on-chain analysis, technical indicators, news sentiment, and market demand for Ethereum-related products such as ETFs. These factors can provide valuable insights into market trends and help inform trading decisions.

In terms of trading approach, a more balanced strategy that combines both aggressive and conservative elements may be warranted. While taking advantage of bullish trends with a higher confidence level can lead to profitable outcomes, it is also important to exercise caution and not overextend in more uncertain market conditions. By carefully evaluating the available information and adjusting the trading approach accordingly, I can strive for more consistent and successful trading outcomes in the future.

Start your response with your brief reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

Almost 90% of its aggregated total value locked (TVL) is controlled by three networks. Here\'s how Arbitrum (ARB) keeps its supremacy in this field.\n\nArbitrum succeeds since it remains "credibly neutral," Patrick McCorry says\n\nCryptocurrency researcher Patrick McCorry, former assistant professor at King\'s College London, is sure that "credible neutrality" is one of the reasons behind Arbitrum (ARB), Ethereum-based network\'s success. Its team has never launched "official" decentralized applications on Arbitrum (ARB), leaving space for open competition.\n\nIn my opinion as an observer, one of the reasons why Arbitrum has been successful to date is that the ecosystem did not pick a favourite and remained credibly neutral.\n\n\n\nWithout favourites, it allows anyone to feel like they can deploy on the chain and compete as an equal. https://t.co/fcM5IMVQ55 — Patrick McCorry (💙,🧡) (@stonecoldpat0) August 5, 2023\n\nWith no "favorite" applications officially supported by Arbitrum DAO and Offchain Labs, any team can come to the blockchain and start deploying "like an equal."\n\nMcCorry\'s position echoes that of the Arbitrum (ARB) community head, who slammed the L1s and L2s that created their own applications on corresponding blockchain networks:\n\nThe worst thing a chain team can do is start creating their own native dApps or products on top of it. You just end up being in direct competition with teams building on your chain within that vertical\n\nArbitrum (ARB) has never endorsed any applications as its "native": All crucial protocols using it as a technical basis are created by third-party teams.\n\nAs covered by U.Today, there is strong evidence that Arbitrum\'s (ARB) growth is fueled by real usage in DeFi: Airdrop hunters are only responsible for 5-6% of its transactions.\n\nArbitrum vs Optimism rivalry gains traction\n\nBy press time, Arbitrum (ARB) remains the largest Ethereum-based network by TVL: It has accumulated $5.93 billion in liquidity across all of its verified protocols. This is equal to 56.16% of the whole Ethereum L2s ecosystem. Its closest competitor Optimism (OP) is responsible for $2.95 billion, or 27.8% of liquidity.\n\nHowever, in the past week, Optimism (OP) has surpassed its rival in a number of crucial metrics, starting from the number of daily on-chain transactions.\n\nIt was also closer to surpassing Arbitrum (ARB) in the net number of daily active addresses. However, both metrics might only be rallying due to the hype around Worldcoin (WDC), a controversial eye-scanning project by OpenAI\'s Sam Altman.\n\nThat is why analysts are sure that nothing poses a threat to Arbitrum\'s (ARB) dominance in the L2s segment it has kept for a couple of months.'}, {'id': 6, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vYW1iY3J5cHRvLmNvbS9ob3ctY2FyZGFuby1rZWVwcy1kb21pbmF0aW5nLWV0aGVyZXVtLWRlc3BpdGUtcHJpY2UtZGVjbGluZS_SAVZodHRwczovL2FtYmNyeXB0by5jb20vaG93LWNhcmRhbm8ta2VlcHMtZG9taW5hdGluZy1ldGhlcmV1bS1kZXNwaXRlLXByaWNlLWRlY2xpbmUvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Sat, 05 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'How Cardano keeps dominating Ethereum despite price decline - AMBCrypto News', 'content': 'Cardano’s development activity was substantially higher compared to Ethereum.\n\nADA’s price dropped by 6% last week, but there was a possibility of a trend reversal.\n\nCardano [ADA] has outperformed the king of altcoins, Ethereum [ETH], by a huge margin in terms of development activity. In fact, data suggested that ADA’s development activity consistently remained three times higher than Ethereum.\n\nRead Cardano’s [ADA] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nThis metric has been reflected in the blockchain’s efforts to push out new updates over the last few months, the latest being the Mithril mainnet upgrade.\n\nCardano’s development activity remains high\n\nIt was interesting to note that Cardano’s development activity rose substantially over the last month. Its development activity contributor count also remained high.\n\nA major reason for this uptrend can be attributed to the recent Mithril mainnet launch, which aimed to reduce the time required for nodes to sync with the blockchain.\n\nAfter the mainnet update was pushed, Cardano’s multiple teams continued to work on other projects, which were highlighted in the blockchain’s latest edition of its weekly development report.\n\nAs per the report, Mithril mainnet has been consistently producing new certificates and snapshots. The Mithril team also worked on upgrading the Cardano node to v.8.1.2, fixing the release-preprod network that stopped producing certificates.\n\nThis week’s #Cardano development update is live on #EssentialCardano!

The Lace team continued the implementation of Posthog analytics and dedicated efforts to add Trezor support and implement the multi-delegation feature.\n\nThe report also mentioned updated statistics of the Cardano blockchain. The blockchain’s total transactions reached 72.7 million, while its native tokens exceeded 8.6 million.\n\nMoreover, the number of projects building on ADA reached 1,271, while the number of projects launched touched 136.\n\nADA investors aren’t content\n\nWhile development activity remained high, the native token’s price action turned bearish. As per CoinMarketCap, ADA’s price declined by more than 6% over the last week. At press time, it was trading at $0.2915 with a market capitalization of over $10 billion.\n\nThe price drop caused its MVRV Ratio to plummet. Additionally, negative sentiment around Cardano also remained relatively high. However, the whales continued to show interest in ADA, as evident from its high whale transaction count.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Cardano Profit Calculator\n\nThe good news was that the bearish price trend might come to an end in the coming days. This possibility was pointed out by Coinglass. According to the chart, Cardano’s Open Interest was declining.\n\nA drop in the metric usually means that the on-going market trend might change, giving hope for a price uptick.'}, {'id': 1, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NidGMuY29tL25ld3MvZXRoZXJldW0vZXRoZXJldW0tZXRmLXJhY2UtZ2V0cy1ob3R0ZXIv0gFIaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmV3c2J0Yy5jb20vbmV3cy9ldGhlcmV1bS9ldGhlcmV1bS1ldGYtcmFjZS1nZXRzLWhvdHRlci9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Sat, 05 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Ethereum ETF Race Gets Hotter As SEC Receives 11 Filings In One Week - NewsBTC', 'content': 'The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been flooded with many applications for Ethereum (ETH) Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in just one week. The applications currently stand at 12, with the latest addition coming from ProShares, a popular fund manager.\n\nThe platform filed four applications for Ether-based ETFs, including a dual Ether and Bitcoin futures strategy ETF, an Ether Strategy ETF, and a short Ether Strategy ETF.\n\nWill The SEC Approve An Ethereum Futures ETF?\n\nThe recent surge in applications started on the 28th of July this year after Volatility Shares filed its application. Ever since, other asset management companies, including ProShares, Roundhill Financial, Bitwise, Van Eck, and Grayscale Investment, have filled submissions, with some bringing multiple applications.\n\nThe most recent application, filed on August 3 by ProShares, proposes an equal-weight Bitcoin and Ether ETF to measure the performance of holding long positions in the nearest maturing monthly Ether and Bitcoin contracts.\n\nAccording to renowned Financial Expert at Bloomberg Intelligence, James Seyffart, ProShare filed four separate applications with the SEC. Bitwise also submitted three applications, while Grayscale Investments filed two applications.\n\nHowever, despite the growing optimism, it remains to be seen if the Securities and Exchange Commission will approve these filings. The SEC has never approved an ETF that tracks Ether Futures contracts, unlike Bitcoin Futures ETFs that have been around since October 2021.\n\nMany market experts have argued that these applications are a mere gamble by these asset management companies, who do not want to miss out on being the first Ethereum ETF in the United States.\n\nETH price holds steady above $1,830 amid ETF race | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nThe likelihood of receiving the SEC’s approval remains slim as the regulatory body has never approved an Ethereum futures ETF filing. Add to the mix the consistent refusal of SEC’s Chair, Gary Gensler, consistent refusal to answer if the agency considers ETH a security. This has further compounded regulatory uncertainty around the network.\n\nIf none of the applications before the SEC get denied, the Ether ETFs will launch 75 days from their respective filing dates. Analysts expect the Volatility Shares ETF to lead the charge on 12th October.\n\nUnderstanding The Difference Between Futures And Spot ETF Products\n\nThe primary difference between futures and spot ETF products lies in the fact that while the former tracks the price of futures contracts, the latter requires the issuers to purchase the underlying assets. Spot ETFs are generally considered more valid since they require the fund manager to purchase and hold underlying assets.\n\nThe current spike in Ether-based applications comes amidst a wave of filings from leading asset management companies, including BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, among others. These companies are looking to offer the first spot in Bitcoin ETF in the US.\n\nInvestors and members of the crypto community remain expectant of the outcome of the SEC’s consideration of the applications lying before it. Whatever decision the agency takes is likely to affect the attractiveness and accessibility of crypto investments, especially for larger institutional investors.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

Discover SCENE\n\nA series of transactions on the NFT marketplace Blur has captivated Crypto Twitter and sparked questions of legality after a prolific trader going by the name of Hanwe Chang duped a competitor into buying certain Azuki NFTs at an inflated price.\n\n“[I] noticed that someone\'s bot was copying my bids on Blur, so I decided to trick him,” Chang said on Twitter, adding he had made a profit of 800 Ethereum with the strategy, netting close to $1.5 million.\n\nA relative newcomer compared to NFT marketplaces like OpenSea and SuperRare, Blur surged ahead in terms of trading volume earlier this year due to gamified incentives that reward users with tokens based on trade-related activity.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis includes rewards for users that bid on NFTs by trait, a practice in which Chang has become established, according to Blur’s leaderboards. Profile picture NFTs, including those from Azuki, often have unique qualities that can impact their value based on rarity, like eye color or clothing.\n\nOn Saturday, 12 Azuki NFTs that shared the specific background color “Off White A” sold simultaneously for 50 Ethereum worth $91,500 each. The previous Azuki NFT with an “Off White A” background had sold for less than 5 Ethereum or around $9,000—making it a massive, eye-catching markup.\n\nThe 12 NFTs appear to have been gathered by Chang in a digital wallet. A large chunk of the trades’ profits was then sent to a wallet labeled as “hanwe.eth” using the Ethereum Name Service after they had been completed, according to Ethercan.\n\nKnowing there were bots out there copying his trait bids, Chang likely duped an unsuspecting trader into buying the Azuki NFTs at an elevated price by placing a bid on his own NFTs, an account that goes by A Raving Ape theorized on Twitter.\n\nContext on how @HanweChang executed a plan to perfection and made 800e by selling "Off White A - Background color" azuki at 50e each and azuki elementals at 15e each.

But it seems not everyone involved was entertained.\n\nThe bot’s apparent owner, “elizab.eth,” stepped forward on Twitter to claim the “funds were stolen form [their] bot.” The trader wanted to discuss the possibility of bounty and said Chang could keep 10% of the funds if they agreed to return the rest.\n\nThe pseudonymous NFT influencer Dave III said Chang’s statement wasn’t very wise and warned others not to “brag about committing fraud,” calling his trick “illegal market activity.”\n\nThese 2 crypto twitter posts will go down as the dumbest of all time. #1: Hanwe admits to ‘Bid Spoofing’ or ‘Shill Bidding’ — an illegal market activity of Fraud or Wire Fraud #2: Avi admits to Market Manipulation.

Backed by a strong team of developers, software engineers, and researchers, it constantly upgrades over time. But, have you ever wondered who is deciding and implementing these upgrades?\n\nA decision or a proposal to make a change to the network has to be agreed upon by the entire development community of Ethereum. Only then, they can put it into action. The Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) concept was introduced to make this process smooth. Let us help you understand everything about Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) in this article.\n\nWhat are Ethereum Improvement proposals (EIPs)?\n\nEthereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) are standard potential changes, new features, or processes that improve the Ethereum ecosystem as a whole.\n\nThey were first introduced in October 2015 following the footsteps of the Bitcoin Improvement Protocols (BIPs) process, which itself followed Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs). EIPs have all the information of an upgrade and act as a “source of truth” to the community.\n\nDecentralization is the core feature of Ethereum and hence anyone can suggest a change to the network. But, you must follow the guidelines included in EIP-1 to suggest a proposal. Till now, most of the EIP authors are application developers or protocol developers. And, EIP editors like Gavin Wood and Vitalik Buterin, review them, correct them, and format issues.\n\nSignificance of Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs)\n\nWhether it’s the transition of Ethereum from a PoW network to a PoS network or the creation of non-fungible tokens, everything started with an EIP. They play a key role in every upgrade happening around the Ethereum network.\n\nSome of the top Ethereum Improvement Proposals that were already implemented are EIP-1559 (fee market change), EIP-20 (ERC-20 token standard), and EIP-721 (ERC-721 standard). The historical “The Merge” event was proposed by the EIP-3675. Similar to these, every upgrade happening on the network consists of a set of EIPs.\n\nEIPs allow the network to change, improve, and adapt to the increase in its usage. This makes Ethereum flexible and constantly updates to changes in the industry and meets changing demands of the users. By going through the review process by the whole community, EIPs make sure that these decisions are inclusive and accurate.\n\nTypes of Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs)\n\nThere are 3 types of EIPs which we are going to discuss here.\n\nStandards Track EIP\n\nThe Standards Track EIPs change almost all of the Ethereum implementations. These proposals make changes directly to the Ethereum network protocol. They include changes in block or transaction validity rules, changes that affect the interoperability of Ethereum dApps, etc.\n\nStandards Track EIPs have 3 parts of implementation – a design document, an implementation, and an update to formal specification. Furthermore, we can categorize these EIPs into Core, Networking, Interface, and ERC proposals.\n\nMeta EIP\n\nUnlike Standards Track EIPs, Meta EIPs do not make direct changes to the Ethereum network protocol. These are more like procedures, guidelines, or changes in the decision-making process. We can also call them Process EIPs and these changes require community consensus as they are more than just recommendations.\n\nInformation EIP\n\nThese EIPs neither make changes to the network protocol nor require community consensus. These proposals suggest general guidelines or information to the Ethereum community. Members of the community and implementers can ignore informational EIPs or follow their advice based on their choice.\n\nHow are EIPs Processed?\n\nSimilar to how a law must pass some stages to be finally implemented, an EIP must also go through some stages. Every EIP must pass through the following steps.\n\nDraft – In this phase, the EIP is still in the hands of the author. Once it follows all the guidelines of proposing an EIP like having no errors, proper format, and making technical sense, it can now be submitted to the Ethereum repository on GitHub for review.\n\nIn this phase, the EIP is still in the hands of the author. Once it follows all the guidelines of proposing an EIP like having no errors, proper format, and making technical sense, it can now be submitted to the Ethereum repository on GitHub for review. Review – After being checked officially by an editor, the author can publish the EIP on GitHub. The next step is to mark the EIP as suitable for peer review. After passing through the early stages of review, the proposal needs a review by a wider public.\n\nAfter being checked officially by an editor, the author can publish the EIP on GitHub. The next step is to mark the EIP as suitable for peer review. After passing through the early stages of review, the proposal needs a review by a wider public. Last Call – Any EIP must at least be in the review stage for a minimum of 2 weeks so that the community has enough time to read, review, and suggest changes. In this stage, the proposals can be sent back and forth for changes by the author. If the EIP remains in this phase for more than 6 months, it will move to “stagnant.”\n\nAny EIP must at least be in the review stage for a minimum of 2 weeks so that the community has enough time to read, review, and suggest changes. In this stage, the proposals can be sent back and forth for changes by the author. If the EIP remains in this phase for more than 6 months, it will move to “stagnant.” Final stage – When the EIP clears all the stages of review, non-core EIPs reach the final standard. But, core EIPs need to go through another phase. The core development team will implement the approved proposal into the software to enable it.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum Improvement proposals (EIPs) are an important part of Ethereum’s development over the years. The network is still under various upgrades to improve the overall scalability. All of these upgrades started with EIPs and are now making huge changes to the network. Overall, EIPs bring flexibility and adaptability to Ethereum which are essential to increase its adoption.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat is the most popular EIP?\n\nEIP-20, EIP-721, EIP-137, and EIP-1559 are popular EIPs. However, many EIPs exist today that are included in the upgrades of Ethereum.\n\nWhat is the purpose of EIPs?\n\nEthereum Improvement Proposals make changes to the network to make Ethereum better. They make the network flexible, efficient, and adaptable to the changing needs of users.\n\nWhat is the difference between EIP and ERC?'}].

In reviewing my recent trading performance, it is evident that my decision to buy more ETH during bullish trends based on on-chain and news analyst reports has been successful in generating positive returns. The effective strategy of leveraging buy signals and positive market developments has led to profitable outcomes. However, my decision to buy with a higher percentage of cash in the second trade resulted in a slight loss, indicating that a more conservative approach may have been more appropriate in that instance.

Key trends in the current cryptocurrency market that are likely to influence future trades include the increasing interest in Ethereum ETFs, positive developments in the Ethereum ecosystem, and overall bullish sentiment in the market. These factors suggest that a more aggressive trading approach may be warranted in the short term to capitalize on the upward momentum of ETH.

You are an experienced ETH cryptocurrency trader and you are trying to maximize your overall profit by trading ETH. In each day, you will make an action to buy or sell ETH. You will start with 1 million dollars, half in cash and half in ETH. You are assisted by a few analysts below and need to decide the final action.

ON-CHAIN ANALYST REPORT: Based on the recent price and auxiliary information provided, it appears that the ETH cryptocurrency has been consistently showing bullish signals. The short-long moving average signal, MACD signal, and Bollinger Bands signal all indicate a buy recommendation. 

The open prices have been fluctuating slightly, but overall, they have been relatively stable. This suggests that there is a strong support level for ETH at the current price range.

Considering the bullish signals and the stable price movement, it is likely that the market trend for ETH will continue to be positive in the near future. Traders and investors may consider taking advantage of the current buy signals to potentially profit from the expected upward movement in the price of ETH.

NEWS ANALYST REPORT: Based on the news articles provided, it is evident that there are significant developments in the cryptocurrency market, particularly in relation to Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC). Here are some key points to consider:

1. Valkyrie, a cryptocurrency exchange-traded fund (ETF) provider, is planning to convert its existing Bitcoin Technique ETF into a dual Bitcoin and Ether ETF. This move is seen as a strategic decision to capitalize on the growing popularity of both Bitcoin and Ethereum. The introduction of this ETF ahead of schedule is expected to have a positive impact on the market.

2. The cryptocurrency market is showing positive signs, with Bitcoin remaining above the $29,000 mark and Ethereum above $18,000. Other altcoins like Litecoin and Dogecoin are also experiencing minor gains. ApeCoin emerged as the top gainer with a 24-hour jump of over 14.20%.

3. A trader on the NFT marketplace Blur managed to make a profit of 800 Ethereum (equivalent to $1.5 million) by tricking a competitor into buying certain Azuki NFTs at an inflated price. This incident has sparked discussions about the legality of such actions in the market.

4. Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) play a crucial role

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: In reviewing my recent trading performance, it is evident that my decision to buy more ETH during bullish trends based on on-chain and news analyst reports has been successful in generating positive returns. The effective strategy of leveraging buy signals and positive market developments has led to profitable outcomes. However, my decision to buy with a higher percentage of cash in the second trade resulted in a slight loss, indicating that a more conservative approach may have been more appropriate in that instance.

Key trends in the current cryptocurrency market that are likely to influence future trades include the increasing interest in Ethereum ETFs, positive developments in the Ethereum ecosystem, and overall bullish sentiment in the market. These factors suggest that a more aggressive trading approach may be warranted in the short term to capitalize on the upward momentum of ETH.

Moving forward, I will continue to closely monitor on-chain and news analyst reports to inform my trading decisions and adjust my strategy accordingly based on market conditions. It is important to strike a balance between aggressive and conservative approaches to maximize profits while managing risk effectively in the volatile cryptocurrency market.

Start your response with your brief reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Given the bullish signals from the on-chain analyst report, positive market developments highlighted in the news analyst report, and the successful trading strategy based on previous performance outlined in the reflection analyst report, it is clear that the overall market trend for ETH is upwards.

Considering the increasing interest in Ethereum ETFs, positive price movements of both Bitcoin and Ethereum, and the general bullish sentiment in the market, it is likely that ETH will continue to experience upward momentum in the near future.

Therefore, I suggest a confident buy action with 0.8 (buy with 80% cash) to take advantage of the expected positive trend in the price of ETH.

They will also be able to fund purchases with PayPal USD.\n\nThe stablecoin will be available starting Monday, and PayPal customers will be able to purchase, send, convert and fund purchases in the “coming weeks.”\n\nThe announcement marks the first time that a major US financial company has created a stablecoin. PayPal’s leadership confirmed the existence of the project in early 2022. PayPal began integrating crypto services in early 2021, allowing users to buy, sell and hold major digital assets like bitcoin and ether.\n\n“The shift toward digital currencies requires a stable instrument that is both digitally native and easily connected to fiat currency like the U.S. dollar,” said Dan Schulman, PayPal’s president and CEO.\n\nPaxos will be in charge of publishing a monthly Reserve Report on the stablecoin, as well as an “attestation of the value of PayPal USD reserve assets.” PayPal said the stablecoin will be “fully backed by U.S. dollar deposits, US Treasuries and similar cash equivalents.”\n\n“PayPal USD is the most significant leap forward for digital assets and the financial industry and Paxos is proud to enable this transformative product,” Paxos CEO Charles Cascarilla said in a statement.\n\nA blockchain-based digital asset, PayPal USD will be issued on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token.\n\n“Our commitment to responsible innovation and compliance, and our track record delivering new experiences to our customers, provides the foundation necessary to contribute to the growth of digital payments through PayPal USD,” said Schulman.\n\n“Clear regulations and robust consumer protections are essential to enabling stablecoins to achieve their full potential.

This incident, which transpired on July 26, has captivated the cryptocurrency community, prompting many to ponder the rationale behind this significant burn.\n\nThe occurrence came to light on August 6 when “degeneratewisdom”, a blockchain analyst, tweeted the query: “Can anyone on here explain this tx to me Looks like nd4.eth sent 2500 ETH to a dead address. Doesn’t look like a noob error either. Thoughts?”\n\nThis tweet thrust nd4.eth’s substantial 2500 ETH transfer to an inactive address into the spotlight, prompting speculation within the crypto community about the underlying intention behind this deliberate and seemingly calculated move.\n\nThe concept of “burning” tokens entails sending tokens to an address where they are rendered permanently unspendable, thereby diminishing the overall supply of the specific cryptocurrency. However, the reasoning behind nd4.eth’s decision to annihilate such a sizable sum of Ethereum remains veiled in obscurity.\n\nLaurence Day, the innovator behind the Wildcat Protocol, infused an element of humour into the situation, tweeting, “If you didn’t arise this morning and express gratitude to nd4.eth for contributing to the ultrasound money narrative, I urge you to engage in profound introspection regarding your objectives.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDelving deeper into the incident, analysts from the on-chain analysis company Lookonchain disclosed additional particulars about the persona behind nd4.eth.\n\n“The guy who transferred 2,500 $ETH($4.58M) to a dead address on July 26th is a whale with 34,287 $GMX($1.84M) and 311,003 $GNS($1.43M). He spent 5,330 $DAI to buy $GMX and $GNS on July 29 and also transferred 34.9 $GMX ($1,989) and 600 $GNX ($2,733) to the dead address,” Lookonchain wrote on Monday.\n\nWhile the exact motives of the address owner are still unknown, accidentally sending crypto or NFTs to a burn address has occurred before, albeit occasionally. Last March, an NFT collector called Brandon Riley accidentally sent his CryptoPunk #685, purchased for 77 ETH ($129,437), to a burn address while attempting to wrap it for trading on NFTfi. The irreversible error wiped out a third of Riley’s net worth. Although unrecoverable, Riley’s CryptoPunk was “resurrected” as a Bitcoin ordinal on the blockchain.\n\nLast September, cryptocurrency exchange Kucoin accidentally sent a substantial amount of Ethereum (ETH), valued at tens of millions of dollars, to the Ethereum burn address. This unexpected move, spanning over three days and involving more than 3,500 USDT and ETH transactions, left the cryptocurrency community puzzled with the exact motive behind this burn remaining unknown.'}].

Around 6.5 million ETH coins have been issued since the merge, and over 3.5 million of them have been burned.\n\nEthereum currently has a supply of about 120.2 million coins. And since the model is still inflationary, more coins are added every year. As of now, the network adds about 580,000 ETH each year. However, the Ethereum network burns about 1.75 million ETH each year, lowering the supply by roughly 0.98%. This makes the platform somewhat deflationary because the circulating ETH amount reduces as coins get actively burned on the network.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum: These ETH Futures ETFs Are Awaiting Approval\n\nPresently, gas fees generated by ETH transfers and smart contract operations are the main drivers of these burns. Additionally, NFT and DeFi platforms like OpenSea and UniSwap, also play a role. Additionally, the transfer of USDT, an ERC-20 token on the ETH network, also adds to ETH burns.\n\nWill Ethereum prices react to the burns?\n\nSource: Forbes\n\nSo far, ETH’s prices have not heavily responded to the burns. This could be because of less demand as of now. Burns without demand will do little to push the asset’s price. However, the project’s end goal is for the burn rate to outpace the rate of issuing new coins. This would effectively turn Ethereum (ETH) deflationary.\n\nAlso Read: How To Check An Ethereum Transaction?\n\nMoreover, many argue that ETH has become more deflationary than Bitcoin (BTC) after the implementation of the EIP-1559 protocol. This protocol is responsible for burning a fraction of the gas fee from each transaction. However, ETH does not have a fixed cap on its supply, unlike BTC which is capped at 21 million coins. Therefore, ETH’s burn rate will have to outpace its issuance in order for it to be truly considered a deflationary asset.

This price correction emerged as the initial enthusiasm within the crypto market, fueled by a bullish streak in June primarily driven by institutional investors, gradually subsided.\n\nEven though Lido’s TVL experienced a decline from its impressive $15 billion benchmark, it retains its position as the foremost DeFi protocol. Notably, Lido continues to command a substantial 36% share of the aggregate TVL encompassing all DeFi projects.\n\nPredicts staked Ether to grow beyond 8M\n\nThe DeFi protocol predicted that the total number of staked Ethereum via its platform will surpass eight million in August, as it has consistently experienced large monthly net inflows despite the activation of withdrawals.\n\nDeFillama data shows that this prediction has come to pass with the total value of assets locked on Lido in terms of Ethereum currently at 8.08 million ETH, an all-time high. However, Lido’s website places the number at around 7.9 million as of press time.\n\nCurve Finance exploit impact Lido\n\nIn the wake of the recent exploit of Curve Finance, several liquidity providers withdrew their assets from the platform’s stETH-ETH pool.\n\nDespite the fact that this specific pool remained untouched by the exploit, stETH’s usage in DeFi experienced a decline of 2.88% compared to the previous month of June. Consequently, the overall share held within the liquidity pools also underwent a substantial contraction, plummeting by 53.07%.\n\nOther metrics\n\nLido’s increasing adoption has also translated into the growing adoption of its staked ETH. The number of unique addresses holding stETH increased by 9.26% from June to 255,000. The amount in lending pools also increased by 3.63%, while wstETH in Layer-2 networks jumped by 12.83%.\n\nThe demand for wrapped staked ETH on the layer-2 networks has also increased, with Arbitrum and Optimism bridges witnessing more wstETH deposits.\n\nHowever, Lido’s LDO token struggled considerably in July, falling 7% amid the contagion fears that gripped the DeFi market.\n\nMentioned in this article'}, {'id': 14, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvaW50cmlidW5lLmNvbS9lbi9jcnlwdG8tZXRoZXJldW0tbGVtcGlyZS1kdS1jeWJlcmNyaW1lLTIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Tue, 08 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Crypto: Ethereum, the empire of cybercrime - Cointribune EN', 'content': "Tue 08 Aug 2023 ▪ 4 min of reading ▪ by Evans S.\n\nIn the crypto sector, Ethereum presents itself not as an idyllic asylum, but rather as an unsuspected empire of cybercrime. On this digital stage, an alarming manifestation of crime thrives, the titanic scale of which was recently unveiled by insightful researchers.\n\nThe proliferating shadow of cybercrime on Ethereum\n\nThe spectre of cybercrime is spreading in the shadow of the Ethereum network. While bitcoin remains the undisputed behemoth of the cryptosphere, Ethereum stands out for the complexity of its fraudulent activities, according to researchers.\n\nIts ability to host smart contracts offers a wider range of digital crimes. This characteristic transforms Ethereum into a veritable cybercrime empire.\n\nAccording to information extracted from blockchain explorers such as Etherscan, an alarming number of over 5,600 Ethereum addresses have been identified as being linked to cybercrime activities.\n\nWhat’s more, these findings find a powerful echo in the rigorous analyses carried out by Whale Alert’s ScamAlert. Together, these data reveal the frightening extent of cybercrime in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nThese tagged addresses traced over 1.78 million transactions from unsuspecting victims, totaling a staggering $1.65 billion in stolen funds. This figure is almost 16 times greater than self-reported losses to the FTC, revealing the severe extent to which crypto cybercrime is under-reported by regulators.\n\nThe many faces of cybercrime on Ethereum\n\nOn the throne of Ethereum crime, Ponzi schemes reign supreme. They account for 60% of stolen funds, far surpassing the scale of traditional financial Ponzi schemes. Fraudulent donations follow at 18%, followed by mining (13%) and hacking (5%).\n\nThe pseudonymity offered by blockchain has given Ponzi scams a mask of anonymity. This makes them harder to detect and crack down on.\n\nWhat’s more, the global reach of cryptocurrencies has widened the scope of these scams. As a result, crypto-Ponzi scams have become a ubiquitous and worrying threat to investors worldwide.\n\nBut the evil doesn’t stop there. New cybercrimes are emerging, specific to the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Rug pulls”, for example, lure investors into new projects only to abandon them abruptly, draining all liquidity. Phony token scams create worthless imitations of real coins to fool traders.\n\nRepercussions and the need for a shift in direction\n\nBeyond simple quantification, the researchers analyzed the impact of cybercrime on investor behavior.\n\nIn the short term, victims obtain higher returns by taking greater risks. But over the long term, their risk-adjusted returns significantly underperform those of non-victims.\n\nImproved consumer protection is urgently needed to safeguard mainstream investors as cryptocurrency adoption grows. Regulators must also step up their efforts to curb illicit crypto activity, before it seriously undermines confidence in blockchain technology as a whole.\n\nOnly increased diligence on the part of legislators and investors will enable decentralized finance innovation to continue to flourish. What’s more, Bitcoin’s spectacular spike to $150k during its halving could attract an influx of newcomers, unfortunately opening the door to a potential multiplication of scams.

However, the hope remains it could hit the high price level of $5,000 sometime in the future.\n\nAs it happens, Ethereum managed to get close to this mark on November 9, 2021, when it reached its all-time high (ATH) of $4,815.01, climbing by 168.25% from the $1,794.97 where it stood on July 21, 2021, which is close to its price at present and suggests a very real possibility of repeating this success.\n\nWith this in mind, Finbold has analyzed the main factors that could (but do not necessarily have to) lead Ethereum closer to the $5,000 price level and eventually overtake it – either by themselves or together with other influences.\n\nMass adoption of Ethereum-based applications\n\nWith Ethereum being the most popular blockchain choice to build a wide range of decentralized applications (dApps) on, such as in the sector of decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and gaming, it could help its cryptocurrency grow further in price, thanks to the growing demand.\n\nFor instance, one of the major companies building on the Ethereum blockchain is PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL), which has recently announced the launch of its own ERC-20 United States dollar-pegged stablecoin PayPal USD (PYUSD), issued by crypto firm Paxos Trust Company, as Finbold reported on August 7.\n\nImproved scalability\n\nWith the launch of the better-performing, more accessible ‘Ethereum 2.0,’ the network has improved its scalability, helping it handle more transactions per second and making it more attractive to users and developers. If this trend continues, it could lead to growing demand for Ethereum and its higher price.\n\nIndeed, the Ethereum development team has been working hard on boosting the network’s usability, the work that also brought a shift from the proof-of-work (PoW) to the proof-of-stake (PoS) model with an aim to reduce energy waste and transaction times, as well as improve scalability.\n\nInstitutional adoption\n\nOn top of that, more institutional investors recognizing Ethereum’s potential and buying more ETH could drive the price higher simply by following the rules of supply and demand – the more desirable an asset is, the higher its price, and institutions can have the power to contribute in shaping market trends.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum’s advance could also happen under the influence of the Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) and X (formerly Twitter) CEO, Elon Musk, supporting the bold prediction on the future of the crypto market that could see both Ethereum and Bitcoin (BTC) surge massively.\n\nRegulatory environment\n\nAmid increased regulatory pressure, particularly in the US, which has culminated in multiple lawsuits against some of the industry’s largest representatives, the cryptocurrency market as a whole can feel its effects, which is why positive regulatory developments and favorable regulations for digital assets could help drive their prices, including Ethereum.\n\nOne example of such positive developments is the refusal of the British financial services minister, Andrew Griffith, to agree with the Treasury Committee’s recommendation to regulate retail trading and investing in unbacked crypto assets as gambling in late July and his support of their treatment as other financial services.\n\nMarket sentiment\n\nFinally, the atmosphere in the wider crypto and macroeconomic landscape can often influence the price of particular assets, including cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, for instance, with positive (or negative) developments and news coverage about the industry.\n\nIndeed, the above factors could contribute to the bullish sentiment, and when people are feeling bullish about digital assets in general, they are more likely to invest in them, and the positive sentiment could affect the price of ETH, which is more likely to increase.\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum was at press time changing hands at the price of $1,828.2, the same as the day before, in addition to losing 0.29% in the last week and declining 2.05% on its monthly chart, as per the latest information retrieved on August 8.\n\nEthereum 7-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nIn conclusion, time will tell if the above factors are truly powerful enough to push the price of Ethereum toward $5,000. But one thing is for certain – they could, indeed, contribute to its strengthening and, in time, possibly reaching this coveted price level.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

It’s built on Ethereum and “designed for digital payments and Web3,” with the firm saying it will soon be available to United States customers.\n\nThe launch has been seen as a boon for Ethereum adoption.

Based on the analysis of the news articles related to Ethereum (ETH), the following key points can be highlighted:

1. Ethereum is turning deflationary due to the burning of coins on the network. Over 3.5 million ETH coins have been burned, reducing the circulating supply and making the platform somewhat deflationary.

2. Despite the deflationary aspect, Ethereum's price has not significantly responded to the burns. This could be due to less demand at the moment. The project's goal is for the burn rate to outpace the rate of issuing new coins to make Ethereum truly deflationary.

3. Lido adoption has surged with 10,000 new stakers joining in July, indicating continued growth despite Ethereum's price struggles. Lido's TVL briefly exceeded $15 billion but fell below due to Ethereum's price challenges.

4. The launch of PayPal's Ethereum-based stablecoin, PYUSD, has been seen as a boon for Ethereum adoption. However, concerns have been raised about centralization and control of assets with the new stablecoin.

5. Factors that could potentially send Ethereum to $5,000 include mass adoption of Ethereum-based applications, improved scalability with Ethereum 2.0, institutional adoption, regulatory environment, and market sentiment.

The open prices have been fluctuating slightly, but overall, they have been relatively stable. The bollinger_bands signal is indicating a hold, which could suggest a potential consolidation phase in the near future.

Start your response with your brief reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

According to data from Glassnode, this metric which counts only externally owned addresses just reached an all-time high of 104,127,318. But what does this mean for the price of Ethereum?\n\nEthereum Non-Zero Addresses Reach New All-Time High\n\nMore addresses mean more people are using the network and Ethereum is in the driver’s seat when it comes to most application aspects of the crypto industry. As a result, the Ethereum blockchain has seen the highest growth rate in new addresses in recent years.\n\nThis growth has been particularly high as more people flock to decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), the majority of which are built on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nAs of the time of writing, there are now 104,127,318 Ethereum addresses holding at least one wei, the smallest unit of ETH. Just around two years ago in 2021, this metric was around 50 million addresses, showing a 100% jump during this time.\n\nAlthough only a fraction of these wallets are active, the high number of non-zero addresses shows the sheer increase in ETH adoption. In the same vein, the number of non-zero Bitcoin addresses only recently reached an all-time high of 47.8 million addresses.\n\nMore Addresses Means Increased Network Activity and Adoption\n\nThe growing interest in trading, smart contracts, DeFi, and NFTs will continue to boost the number of Ethereum users and non-zero addresses, especially now that the industry sits on the cusp of a possible bull run.\n\nETH bulls continue to hold above $1,800 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nAccording to a similar metric by Glassnode Alerts, the amount of Ethereum supply last active within a seven to 10-year timeframe also just reached n new all-time high of 4.312 million ETH. This extended state of inactivity is suggestive of HODLing and long-term faith on the part of investors.\n\nBullish For The Price Of ETH\n\nIn the past, major rallies in Ether’s price have coincided with a surge in new addresses on the network. During the 2021 bull run, Ethereum saw a flurry of new addresses and non-zero addresses, as its price reached an all-time high of $4,810.\n\nAs mainstream interest and adoption of Ethereum grow, the value and price of Ether (ETH) are likely to increase. Non-zero addresses mean activity on many addresses is increasing, which can create buy pressure in addition to other factors that should push ETH’s price higher.\n\nAdditionally, investment companies are looking to launch exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tied to Ethereum futures, which could propel a spike in ETH’s price.\n\nRight now, ETH is currently trading at $1,852 and is looking to break above the resistance being mounted at $2,000 by the bears.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

This remarkable lack of volatility has instilled a sense of uncertainty and skepticism among investors, despite recent positive developments, which include the launch of PayPal’s Ethereum-based stablecoin and a surge in requests for Ether-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nPayPal’s entrance into the world of cryptocurrencies could signify a major step toward mainstream adoption for Ethereum. However, this move also raises concerns about centralization and the potential loss of control over personal assets.\n\nAt the same time, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission has recently witnessed a surge in applications for Ether (ETH) ETFs, which mirrors a trend of major asset management firms seeking to establish spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs.\n\nETH’s drop in DApp deposits and active users is concerning\n\nThe Ethereum network is having problems because of high gas fees, which are the costs for transactions, including those done with smart contracts. For the past two months, the average transaction fee has been more than $4, which limited the demand for its decentralized apps (DApps).\n\nEthereum network applications' total deposits in ETH. Source: DefiLlama\n\nThere has been a noticeable decline in the total value locked (TVL) of deposits on the Ethereum network. This decrease marked the lowest TVL level observed over the past three years, as reported by DefiLlama.\n\nWhile there may have been some shifts in this trend over the past week, the current scenario still reflects a substantial reduction in Ether deposits, specifically around 12.9 million, in contrast to the 14.75 million recorded three months ago.\n\nTo ascertain whether the decline in Ethereum’s TVL correlates with a decline in its user base, investors should monitor the utilization of DApps. It’s important to note that certain DApps, such as gaming platforms and marketplaces, do not require substantial deposits.\n\nEthereum's 30-day DApp activity. Source: DappRadar\n\nThe number of active addresses using DApps is down, which is concerning. In the last 30 days, the main DApps on Ethereum had 25% fewer active users. This might reflect that investors aren’t satisfied with how much it costs to transact on the network.\n\nExamining Ether derivatives can help to figure out whether the $1,800 level could actually prove a reliable support level based on how ETH investors are positioned.\n\nDerivatives metrics show balanced demand between bulls and bears\n\nEther quarterly futures are popular among whales and arbitrage desks. However, these fixed-month contracts typically trade at a slight premium to spot markets, indicating that sellers are asking for more money to delay settlement. As a result, ETH futures contracts in healthy markets should trade at a 5 to 10% annualized premium — a situation known as contango, which is not unique to crypto markets.\n\nEther 3-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nAs per the futures premium, also referred to as the basis indicator, professional traders in the Ether market have remained unable to adopt a bullish stance since July 16. The current level of 5% hovers on the brink of a neutral-to-bearish threshold, indicating a state of equilibrium in demand between leveraged long and short positions.\n\nRelated: NFT project y00ts to return $3M grant as it ditches Polygon for Ethereum\n\nThe unveiling of Coinbase's Base network on Aug. 9 could contribute to Ether’s challenge of surpassing the $1,900 mark. Several development teams within the ecosystem have announced their offerings for the Base network, which presently incorporates a version of the decentralized exchange Uniswap.\n\nWhile Ether’s bullish prospects are fueled by the potential approval of an ETF and the substantial user base facilitated by PayPal’s stablecoin, the network finds itself confronted by competition from existing smart contract platforms and challengers with ample resources. Such a scenario introduces an element of uncertainty surrounding the resilience of the $1,800 support level.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Visa believes the contract could make transactions more accessible to a wider range of users.\n\n“Our experiment aims to offer a promising approach to substantially addressing the challenges of blockchain-based transactions,” Visa’s technical team wrote. “By leveraging the innovative concept of a paymaster, in conjunction with account abstraction and the ERC-4337 standard, we explored the potential for a process that could redefine blockchain-based transactions.”\n\nA paymaster contract is a specialized type of smart contract within the blockchain ecosystem, designed to manage the payment of gas fees.\n\nThe company said merchants or decentralized applications (dapps) could run their own paymaster solution, or existing wallet and paymaster service providers could offer a card-based gas fee payment choice alongside their other paymaster offerings.\n\nThe experiment is part of Visa’s ongoing development within the industry. The company has been working on ways to make blockchain payments more user-friendly and accessible.\n\nVisa reportedly began experimenting with converting digital assets into fiat payments on the Ethereum blockchain earlier this year. The aim is to parallel its current foreign currency exchange processes, as part of its broader push to build proficiency in global settlements involving both digital and traditional currencies.\n\nIn the context of transactions on blockchains like Ethereum, every operation conducted incurs a cost known as a “gas” fee, representing the computational effort required to execute the operation. Gas fees help keep the Ethereum network secure by making it costly for bad actors to spam the network.\n\nSince inception, network fees have been a fundamental part of ensuring security and encouraging adoption within first-generation blockchain systems. Though, following ten years of user growth, the hope is the trajectory of Web3 will move towards a “gasless” future.\n\nDon’t miss the next big story – join our free daily newsletter.'}, {'id': 30, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvYmFua2luZy9maW5hbmNlL2FuYWx5c3RzLWJ1bGxpc2gtb24tZXRoZXJldW0tZXRmcy1idXQtaG93LWlzLWV0aC1wZXJmb3JtaW5nLXBvbWVyZG9nZS1wcmVkaWN0ZWQtdG8tMjAwMC1pbi0yMDIzL2FydGljbGVzaG93LzEwMjY1NDgxNS5jbXPSAbIBaHR0cHM6Ly9tLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuY29tL2luZHVzdHJ5L2JhbmtpbmcvZmluYW5jZS9hbmFseXN0cy1idWxsaXNoLW9uLWV0aGVyZXVtLWV0ZnMtYnV0LWhvdy1pcy1ldGgtcGVyZm9ybWluZy1wb21lcmRvZ2UtcHJlZGljdGVkLXRvLTIwMDAtaW4tMjAyMy9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvMTAyNjU0ODE1LmNtcw?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Fri, 11 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Analysts Bullish on Ethereum ETFs, but How Is ETH Performing?

A world where decentralized applications empower individuals, and the potential for innovation knows no bounds. Against a highly equivocal and chaotic macroeconomic landscape, this is the world that the prophets of Ethereum dream of.\n\nBut little do they know this world is like an unrealized dream. Why? Let’s dig deeper.\n\nReflecting on the Ethereum liquid staking landscape\n\nCentralized liquid staking protocols are at the forefront of the liquid staking revolution on Ethereum, and it shouldn’t come as a surprise. Why? Because they are highly scalable — thanks to the centralized validator set that they have. The biggest liquid staking protocol on Ethereum currently has a limited node operator set of 29 operators. It must then be a no-brainer that they hold a hegemony over the network. Any protocol claiming to be decentralized but running its operations as a business is also able to offer much higher standards of composability. While this composability that is offered to users is a feature, it can be counter-productive as well — primarily because of the systemic risks this can cause.\n\nOn the flip side, decentralized protocols do exist, but they are highly unscalable. And thus, they have a fraction of ETH staked in them compared to what is often staked via the centralized ones.\n\nWhile decentralized protocols have attempted to reduce the minimum capital required to run a validator node from 32 to 8 ETH, that is still a sizeable amount for the wider ecosystem. Admittedly, this does open up opportunities for a wide number of stakers to start staking on the network, however, we contend that 8 ETH is still a sizeable amount. This reintroduces the problem of scalability, and thus a significant portion of ETH gets staked through a select group of professional node operators. This leads to the further concentration of staked ETH. The presence of these centralized node operators across different liquid staking protocols undermines the censorship resistance of the underlying network.\n\nThe inflow of ETH post-Shapella is a good indicator of users’ liquid staking preferences. One would hope that a lot of the incoming ETH would go to decentralized liquid staking; however, the figures state otherwise.\n\nMaking Ethereum liquid staking scalable\n\nOne of the biggest challenges for the existing liquid staking protocols today is that they are tuned for either scalability alone or decentralization alone. The ones that are tuned for scalability alone are not decentralized, and the ones that are tuned for decentralization are not scalable. There are several examples of this — from protocols having a concentrated node operator set to those having high minimum capital requirements to run validator nodes for Ethereum.\n\nWhile there have been attempts by these protocols to move towards either making their architectures scalable or decentralized, making that is quite difficult given the huge amounts of ETH that are already staked via them. Moreover, these protocol-level changes require a lot of internal deliberations (at-least for decentralized protocols) before they are rolled out.\n\nMoreover, a core objective of any business is to make sure that they hold the hegemony over the industry to persistently retain that. This is reflected by the feigned attempts at a willingness to decentralize — but then having them falling on their head. Perhaps, there is no reason why this would happen. A centralized liquid staking protocol often operates as a business whose core objective is to compromise decentralization to achieve profitability. While I do not condemn the latter, I do feel that it comes — almost always — at the cost of decentralization.\n\nWhat Ethereum needs\n\nEthereum prophets often call for the need to diversify staking across a multitude of protocols. And perhaps, it wouldn’t be remiss to credit those protocols that have emerged that are attempting to realize that vision. However, I must provide a caveat that any emerging protocols need strategic and critical analysis. No one would want shabby architecture being polished and presented as a resilient solution and risking the stability of Ethereum. I believe that there are two things that need immediate attention to drive growth to Ethereum liquid staking:\n\nReducing the minimum capital requirements to run a validator node: This is perhaps easier stated than executed. Reducing the minimum capital requirements incentivizes a wider spectrum of users to participate in network validation.\n\nThis is perhaps easier stated than executed. Reducing the minimum capital requirements incentivizes a wider spectrum of users to participate in network validation. Building censorship resistance: This is perhaps common knowledge, but it often gets overlooked. With the pace at which the macroeconomic landscape is evolving, it is a dire need for protocols to integrate solutions that build the censorship resilience of the protocol. This is akin to hedging against potential future slowdowns in validator architecture and building a high-performant architecture that keeps the network secure.\n\nAdmittedly, I find myself at crossroads while writing these solutions because, while I assert that being aware of the existing challenges as well as the solutions is of paramount importance, it is not enough to persistently echo them. It is essential that we engage in extensive research and relentlessly test and build solutions that help solve these challenges and build a resilient architecture.\n\nMohak is the founder of ClayStack.

Based on the news articles provided, it is evident that there is a significant focus on Ethereum (ETH) and its potential impact on the cryptocurrency market. The articles highlight various developments related to Ethereum, including Visa's testing of a way to make paying Ethereum gas fees easier, the emergence of Ethereum ETFs, and the challenges and opportunities in Ethereum liquid staking.

Visa's initiative to simplify the process of paying gas fees using Ethereum's ERC-4337 standard could potentially increase accessibility and usability of Ethereum for a wider range of users. This could lead to increased adoption and usage of Ethereum, which may have a positive impact on its market value.

The introduction of Ethereum ETFs is seen as a bullish sign by analysts, with predictions of a potential bullish run for Ethereum in the future. This could attract more investors and financial institutions to Ethereum, further boosting its market value.

On the other hand, the challenges in Ethereum liquid staking, particularly the trade-off between scalability and decentralization, highlight the need for innovative solutions to drive growth in this area. Addressing issues such as reducing minimum capital requirements and building censorship resistance could enhance the stability and security of Ethereum, potentially attracting more stakeholders and investors.

Analysts foresee that by the year of 2026, Ethereum\'s L2 rollups will generate the majority of fees. Here\'s how this major indicator increased in seven months in 2023.\n\nEthereum (ETH) fees "outperformed" Ether price; bullish sign?\n\nIn the last seven months, the cumulative volume of Ethereum (ETH) fees increased by 176%. Over a similar period, the price of the second largest cryptocurrency only grew by 53%. Last time this "imbalance" was registered in 2020 after two years of the Crypto Winter.\n\nIn 2023 #Ethereum fees have climbed 176% vs. the price, up 53%. The relationship between the two was instructive for the last bull market when fees outpaced price in 2020 after a two year decline. -@Jamie1Coutts pic.twitter.com/0oIF54OgOK — Chris Burniske (@cburniske) August 12, 2023\n\nCryptocurrency veteran and seasoned blockchain researcher Chris Burniske posted these observations commenting on a thesis by Bloomberg Intelligence\'s analyst Jamie Coutts. Burniske also admitted that the correlation between these two indicators was "instructive" in previous rallies.\n\nAt the same time, migration of users from Ethereum\'s L1 to various L2 ecosystems is a dominant process in the ecosystem that heavily affects the indicators of fees.\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, the second largest Ethereum L2 Optimism (OP) surprisingly flipped Arbitrum (ARB), the #1 scaler, in a number of metrics thanks to the overhyped Worldcoin (WDC) token release.\n\nOptimism (OP) exceeded Arbitrum (ARB) in the daily transactions volume and almost managed to eclipse it in the number of active wallets.\n\nL2s on fire in 2023, but we are still early\n\nHowever, by printing time, Arbitrum\'s (ARB) TVL is more than twice as high as that of Optimism (OP). Arbitrum\'s DeFi protocols total $5.94 billion in locked assets, while Optimism-based protocols only logged $2.82 billion.\n\nThings have only just started for L2s though. In seven months only, their share in Ethereum (ETH) ecosystem fees increased by more than 3x and almost reached 14%. The number of active addresses across L2s exceeded 900,000, Coutts\' report says.\n\nShould L2 adoption keep this pace, major scaling solutions like Arbitrum (ARB), Optimism (OP) and zkSync will be responsible for 20% of Ethereum (ETH) fees by the end of 2023.\n\nIn three years, they will surpass L1\'s numbers, analysts conclude.'}, {'id': 14, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL2RhaWx5aG9kbC5jb20vMjAyMy8wOC8xMi9vbmUtbWlkLWNhcC1ldGhlcmV1bS1hbmQtc29sYW5hLXJpdmFsLWlzLWZsYXNoaW5nLWEtYnVsbGlzaC1zaWduYWwtYWNjb3JkaW5nLXRvLWNyeXB0by1hbmFseXRpY3MtZmlybS1zYW50aW1lbnQv0gGVAWh0dHBzOi8vZGFpbHlob2RsLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA4LzEyL29uZS1taWQtY2FwLWV0aGVyZXVtLWFuZC1zb2xhbmEtcml2YWwtaXMtZmxhc2hpbmctYS1idWxsaXNoLXNpZ25hbC1hY2NvcmRpbmctdG8tY3J5cHRvLWFuYWx5dGljcy1maXJtLXNhbnRpbWVudC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Sat, 12 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'One Mid-Cap Ethereum and Solana Rival Is Flashing a Bullish Signal, According to Crypto Analytics Firm Santiment - The Daily Hodl', 'content': "A top-50 altcoin by market cap could be on the verge of an upside move, according to blockchain analytics platform Santiment.\n\nThe analytics platform says that the native token of smart contract-enabled blockchain Aptos (APT) could reach “another higher high” after partnering with software maker Microsoft on artificial intelligence (AI) and web3 projects.\n\n“Aptos has decoupled after its partnership with Microsoft was announced to build AI tools for blockchain integrations.

And then we just chop around. There’s going to be some big rallies throughout this range. Don’t get me wrong. Like, for example, it wouldn’t surprise me as I said to go up to $2,500, but I’m still conflicted.\n\nI don’t think that $1,000 is going to come again. But it wouldn’t really surprise me at all to see some late-year destruction where we get down to like $1,500. It’s certainly possible in my opinion. But again, it’s going to depend on the next few weeks, months on how we get up.”\n\nLooking at his chart, the trader appears to predict that ETH could climb to $2,500 in November of this year and decline to about $1,500 in early 2024. The chart shows ETH crossing $1,800 again sometime in March 2004.\n\nThe trader also says that ETH’s price action is not convincingly forming a bull cycle.\n\n“I think that it’s just an overall choppy consolidation range right now. I don’t think there’s truly any strong convincing move personally. Yes, you can say this is a bullish market structure, because there are higher highs and higher lows, but it’s not very convincing in the sense that the higher highs are not super high.

However, three altcoins posted notable gains.\n\nSolana (SOL) grew 8.5% to its current price of $24.55; Toncoin (TON) added 10.1% to hit $1.32, and Shiba Inu (SHIB) blew up 17.8% to trade at $0.00001108.\n\nShiba Inu appears to have kept up the momentum of last week’s rally that commenced on news that the coin’s makers are shedding their memecoin reputation and introducing a new identity protocol to all apps on the ecosystem for increased security and privacy.\n\nAltogether the market made small gains this week, as July’s U.S. inflation readings indicated a continued cooling off.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn the news...\n\nThis week brought a fairly busy and diverse news cycle, with institutional and global adoption stories commanding attention alongside the Fed’s new stablecoin note and the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission’s face-saving tactics in its failing war on crypto.\n\nOn Monday, payments giant PayPal announced it would be releasing an Ethereum-based dollar-pegged stablecoin called PayPal USD (PYUSD).\n\nThe currency will be issued by Paxos and is expected to become "a part of the overall payments infrastructure," according to a media quote by PayPal CEO Dan Schulman.\n\nStarting next month, Paxos will be publishing monthly reserve reports and third-party attestations of PYUSD’s reserves, enabling the public to keep track of the credibility and value of the assets underpinning the stablecoin’s value.\n\nDemocratic Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-CA) aired her concerns in a written statement: “I am deeply concerned that PayPal has chosen to launch its own stablecoin while there is still no Federal framework for regulation, oversight and enforcement of these assets. [...] Given PayPal’s size and reach, Federal oversight and enforcement of its stablecoin operations is essential.”\n\nOn Tuesday, Brazil announced the name of its new central bank digital currency (CBDC): DREX, or the “digital real”— the name being a near-acronym for “digital real electronic transaction.”\n\nThe digital real is a centrally-issued tokenized real that utilizes distributed ledger technology similar to blockchain, but it’s not without controversy.\n\nEarly last month, the Brazilian Central Bank published the code of the pilot project on its GitHub profile.

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
Based on the news articles analyzed, it can be observed that there are mixed signals in the Ethereum (ETH) market. 

1. The first article highlights a bullish sign for Ethereum as fees have outperformed the price of ETH, indicating increased activity on the network. The migration of users to Layer 2 (L2) solutions is also mentioned as a dominant process affecting fee indicators. This could suggest growing adoption and usage of Ethereum, which may have a positive impact on its price in the long term.

2. The second article discusses a potential upside move for Aptos (APT), a mid-cap Ethereum and Solana rival, following a partnership with Microsoft. This could indicate positive sentiment towards Ethereum-related projects and potentially drive interest in the Ethereum ecosystem.

3. The third article mentions a warning from a crypto trader about a potential price "destruction" for Ethereum after a rally. The trader predicts a move to $2,500 followed by a correction to $1,500, indicating uncertainty and possible volatility in the short term.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
REASONING:
Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, news analyst report, and reflection analyst report, it is evident that the overall market trend for Ethereum (ETH) is bullish. The buy signals from the indicators, positive developments in the Ethereum ecosystem, and successful trading performance all point towards a potential upward momentum in the price of ETH.

Considering the bullish trend in the market, I am confident in my prediction that ETH will continue to rise in value. Therefore, I will make a bold move and buy more ETH with a negative value to maximize my potential profit. 

Action: -0.7 (buy with 70% cash)
ACTION:
-0.7
DAILY RETURN:
-0.0028435088793072882
REASONING:
Given the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, the market trend for ETH appears to be bullish with most indicators signaling a buy. The recent sell signal for the MACD indicator at an open price of 1850.88 should be monitored closely for any potential short-term reversals. 

The news analyst report also supports a positive market trend for ETH, with developments such as investments in Ethereum projects, the launch of Coinbase's layer 2 network, and the increase in non-zero addresses on the Ethereum network. Despite concerns about network issues, the overall sentiment is optimistic.

Reflecting on past trading performance, a more aggressive approach may be warranted to capitalize on potential upward momentum in the price of ETH. Therefore, I suggest buying ETH with 70% cash to take advantage of the bullish trend in the market.

DAILY RETURN:

REASONING:
Given the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, the market trend appears to be bullish with some signs of potential reversal. The short_long_ma_signal and macd_signal have consistently indicated a buy signal, suggesting an overall bullish trend. However, the macd_signal turning to sell at a specific price point could indicate a potential reversal in the trend.

The news analyst report also supports a positive outlook for Ethereum, with developments such as Visa's initiative to simplify gas fee payments and the emergence of Ethereum ETFs potentially driving growth and adoption of Ethereum in the market.

Reflecting on past trading performance, a more balanced and less aggressive approach may be beneficial moving forward to maximize profits and mitigate potential losses. It is important to stay informed about market trends and indicators to make informed trading decisions.

Based on the overall analysis, I predict a slightly bullish trend in the market and will take a cautious approach by buying ETH with 20% cash.

Provide a brief reflection on your recent trading performance with a focus on the effective strategies and information that led to the most successful outcomes, and the ineffective strategies and information that led to loss of profit. Identify key trends and indicators in the current cryptocurrency market that are likely to influence future trades. Also assess whether a more aggressive or conservative trading approach is warranted. 
*** REFLECTION ANALYST RESPONSE ***
In my recent trading performance, I have been able to capitalize on the bullish trend in the Ethereum market by making strategic buying decisions based on a combination of on-chain analyst reports, news analyst reports, and reflection on past trading performance. By buying ETH with a negative value and 70% cash, I was able to maximize potential profits and achieve a positive daily return.

However, my more conservative approach of buying ETH with 20% cash resulted in a smaller daily return, indicating that a more aggressive trading strategy may have been more effective in this particular market environment.

Moving forward, key trends and indicators in the current cryptocurrency market that are likely to influence future trades include the short_long_ma_signal and macd_signal, as well as developments such as Visa's initiative to simplify gas fee payments and the emergence of Ethereum ETFs. These factors suggest a continued bullish trend for Ethereum, but it is important to monitor potential reversals and stay informed about market developments.

In assessing whether a more aggressive or conservative trading approach is warranted, it is important to consider the overall market sentiment, indicators, and risk tolerance. A balanced approach that combines both aggressive and conservative strategies may be beneficial in maximizing profits while mitigating potential losses in the volatile cryptocurrency market.

You are an experienced ETH cryptocurrency trader and you are trying to maximize your overall profit by trading ETH. In each day, you will make an action to buy or sell ETH. You will start with 1 million dollars, half in cash and half in ETH. You are assisted by a few analysts below and need to decide the final action.

ON-CHAIN ANALYST REPORT: Based on the recent information provided, it can be observed that the short_long_ma_signal and macd_signal have consistently indicated a buy signal, while the bollinger_bands_signal has remained at hold. However, there has been a shift in the macd_signal from buy to sell as the open price decreased from 1855.89 to 1847.54.

This change in the macd_signal may suggest a potential weakening in the bullish momentum of the market. It is important to monitor the price movement closely to see if this trend continues or if there is a reversal in the near future.

Overall, the market trend appears to be bullish based on the buy signals from the short_long_ma_signal and macd_signal. However, caution should be exercised due to the recent shift in the macd_signal to sell. It is recommended to closely monitor the market and consider setting stop-loss orders to manage risk.

Start your response with your brief reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, there are mixed signals in the Ethereum market. While the short_long_ma_signal and macd_signal have consistently indicated a buy signal, the recent shift in the macd_signal to sell suggests a potential weakening in the bullish momentum.

In addition, the news analyst report highlights both positive and negative sentiments towards Ethereum. The bullish signs include increased network activity and positive sentiment towards Ethereum-related projects, while the warning about potential price "destruction" and uncertainty in the short term indicate a degree of volatility.

Considering the market trend and the mixed signals from the analysts, I believe that the bullish trend in the Ethereum market is likely to continue in the near term. Therefore, I will take a more aggressive approach and buy ETH with 70% cash to maximize potential profits.

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
Based on the news articles provided, it is evident that Visa is actively exploring the crypto sector by introducing a new way to pay for Ethereum gas fees directly using Visa cards. This development could potentially increase the accessibility and use of blockchain-based transactions, as it aims to simplify the process of paying gas fees on the Ethereum blockchain.

Visa's initiative to make it easier for users to pay gas fees with a Visa card could attract more users to engage in Ethereum transactions, which may lead to increased adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. This could have a positive impact on the overall cryptocurrency market, including ETH.

As an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst, it is important to monitor how this new payment method by Visa unfolds and whether it gains traction among users. If successful, it could contribute to a bullish trend for ETH and the broader cryptocurrency market. It is recommended to keep a close eye on developments related to Visa's involvement in the crypto sector and how it impacts market sentiment towards cryptocurrencies.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
REASONING:
Given the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, the market trend for ETH appears to be bullish with most indicators signaling a buy. The recent sell signal for the MACD indicator at an open price of 1850.88 should be monitored closely for any potential short-term reversals. 

The news analyst report also supports a positive market trend for ETH, with developments such as investments in Ethereum projects, the launch of Coinbase's layer 2 network, and the increase in non-zero addresses on the Ethereum network. Despite concerns about network issues, the overall sentiment is optimistic.

Reflecting on past trading performance, a more aggressive approach may be warranted to capitalize on potential upward momentum in the price of ETH. Therefore, I suggest buying ETH with 70% cash to take advantage of the bullish trend in the market.

Action: -0.7 (buy with 70% cash)
ACTION:
-0.7
DAILY RETURN:
-0.0018518124487472143
REASONING:
Given the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, the market trend appears to be bullish with some signs of potential reversal. The short_long_ma_signal and macd_signal have consistently indicated a buy signal, suggesting an overall bullish trend. However, the macd_signal turning to sell at a specific price point could indicate a potential reversal in the trend.

The news analyst report also supports a positive outlook for Ethereum, with developments such as Visa's initiative to simplify gas fee payments and the emergence of Ethereum ETFs potentially driving growth and adoption of Ethereum in the market.

Reflecting on past trading performance, a more balanced and less aggressive approach may be beneficial moving forward to maximize profits and mitigate potential losses. It is important to stay informed about market trends and indicators to make informed trading decisions.

Based on the overall analysis, I predict a slightly bullish trend in the market and will take a cautious approach by buying ETH with 20% cash.

Action: -0.2 (buy with 20% cash)
ACTION:
-0.2
DAILY RETURN:
0.0005111327448195091
REASONING:
Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, there are mixed signals in the Ethereum market. While the short_long_ma_signal and macd_signal have consistently indicated a buy signal, the recent shift in the macd_signal to sell suggests a potential weakening in the bullish momentum. However, the overall trend appears to be bullish based on the buy signals from the short_long_ma_signal and macd_signal.

In addition, the news analyst report highlights both positive and negative sentiments towards Ethereum. The bullish signs include increased network activity and positive sentiment towards Ethereum-related projects, while the warning about potential price "destruction" and uncertainty in the short term indicate a degree of volatility.

Considering the market trend and the mixed signals from the analysts, I believe that the bullish trend in the Ethereum market is likely to continue in the near term. Therefore, I will take a more aggressive approach and buy ETH with 70% cash to maximize potential profits.

Action: -0.7 (buy with 70% cash)

*** REFLECTION ANALYST RESPONSE ***
In reviewing my recent trading performance, it is evident that a more aggressive approach to buying ETH with 70% cash has led to losses in the short term. While the market trend appeared bullish based on the on-chain and news analyst reports, the mixed signals and potential reversals in the MACD indicator may have contributed to the negative daily returns.

Moving forward, it may be beneficial to take a more balanced and cautious approach to trading ETH, especially when there are conflicting signals in the market. It is important to closely monitor key indicators such as the MACD and short_long_ma_signal for potential reversals and adjust trading strategies accordingly.

In the current cryptocurrency market, key trends such as increased network activity, positive sentiment towards Ethereum projects, and potential volatility should be considered when making trading decisions. It is also important to stay informed about developments in the market, such as the launch of new products or initiatives that could impact the price of ETH.

Overall, a more conservative trading approach may be warranted in the current market environment to mitigate potential losses and maximize profits. It is essential to carefully analyze market trends and indicators before making trading decisions to ensure a successful outcome.

Start your response with your brief reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, there are conflicting signals in the market with the short_long_ma_signal indicating a buy signal, while the macd_signal has turned to a sell signal. The bollinger_bands_signal remains at hold, suggesting consolidation. The news analyst report highlights Visa's initiative to simplify Ethereum gas fee payments, which could potentially lead to increased adoption of cryptocurrencies.

Considering the mixed signals and potential impact of Visa's involvement in the crypto sector, I believe the market trend for ETH is uncertain at the moment. While there are bullish factors such as increased network activity and positive sentiment towards Ethereum projects, the conflicting signals and potential reversals in the MACD indicator warrant caution.

Given the current market conditions, I would take a slightly conservative approach and suggest a sell action with 20% ETH to capitalize on potential downward momentum. This action reflects my cautious stance towards the market trend and the need to mitigate potential losses in the short term.

The revelation comes as a surprise to many, as the former president has previously expressed his disdain for digital assets.\n\nThe crypto wallet in question is most likely connected to Trump’s NFT (non-fungible token) collection, which was launched in December 2022. The limited collection has a total of 44,000 Trump-themed trading cards. The entire collection sold out in just one day, netting over $8.9 million in sales.

Nonetheless, a former president holding Ethereum (ETH) is still a positive development for the industry.\n\nSource: Britannica\n\nThe U.S. Presidential election is just around the corner.

The platform has established itself as the crypto ecosystem’s benchmark for Layer 1 infrastructure. The company’s leadership is nevertheless significantly contested. Indeed, with the increased dynamism of the technology market globally, new Layer 1 projects are regularly emerging. Their ambition is to rival or even dethrone Ethereum in this sector. To achieve this, these initiatives propose technological improvements. They also provide enhanced scaling capabilities. Operational advances that generally translate into lower transaction fees for users. In short, they want to do better than Ethereum. But can they? The truth is, it’s extremely difficult to predict with any certainty which project(s) will be able to supplant Ethereum. Admittedly, many of these crypto initiatives are not lacking in relevance. However, this is without taking into account the vast operational network that Ethereum has built to establish its market dominance. With that in mind, we’ll take a closer look at Layer 1 blockchain technology and the particularities of the one developed by Ethereum. We’ll then compare some of the crypto industry’s most popular Layer 1 projects with Ethereum’s.\n\nA look back at the Layer 1 concept\n\nTo assess whether Ethereum’s Layer 1 could be surpassed by other projects, it’s vital to understand its meaning and role within the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nLayer 1, often abbreviated to L1, is the very foundation of blockchain. It is the main blockchain that functions autonomously, without depending on other systems for its operation. It is this independence that distinguishes it from Layer 2 solutions, which are built on top of Layer 1 to enhance scalability and performance without modifying the underlying blockchain.\n\nLayer 0, on the other hand, is the underlying infrastructure layer that facilitates communication between different blockchains. It is a network of networks that enables Layer 1 blockchains to communicate with each other.\n\nLayer 1 blockchains have their own network of validator nodes responsible for validating transactions and blocks. They also use specific consensus mechanisms, such as Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS) or Proof of Authority (PoA), to guarantee network security and integrity.\n\nIconic blockchains such as Bitcoin, Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Ethereum all operate as Layer 1, each with its own token, which serves as the fuel for transactions and interactions within its ecosystem.\n\nSo what distinguishes Ethereum’s Layer 1 from other first-layer blockchains?\n\nSingularity of Ethereum Layer 1\n\nEthereum, as a Layer 1 project, occupies a prominent place in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, and for good reason. Its platform is distinguished by unique features that have redefined the possibilities offered by blockchain technology.\n\nOne of Ethereum’s major innovations is the introduction of smart contracts. These autonomous programs run automatically as soon as predefined conditions are met, without the need for human intervention.\n\nThanks to smart contracts, Ethereum has facilitated the development of decentralized applications (dApps). This has reduced dependence on traditional intermediaries, broadening the range of services available in the crypto ecosystem. In addition, Ethereum has played a crucial role in promoting interoperability between different blockchain platforms.\n\nWhile remaining true to its principles of decentralization, Ethereum is constantly seeking solutions to scale-up challenges, in order to satisfy a rapidly growing and demanding community.\n\nHowever, despite its leading status, Ethereum faces major challenges, particularly with regard to network scaling and high transaction costs. These challenges underline the importance of constant evolution of the platform. Other Layer 1 projects are emerging with innovative proposals, seeking to fill Ethereum’s gaps while offering new functionalities.\n\nLayer 1 projects competing with Ethereum\n\nThe cryptocurrency industry is full of Layer 1 blockchain projects. Given the multitude of offerings available, it would be tedious to cover them all here. However, by observing current trends in the sector, several of them seem to be gaining credibility and could potentially rival the current leaders.\n\nTake Cardano, founded in 2015 by Charles Hoskinson. He often describes his project as an “enhanced version of Ethereum”. Focused on innovation, Cardano is a decentralized blockchain based on proof-of-stake (PoS). It offers developers the possibility of creating smart contracts, while guaranteeing fast, low-cost transactions. One of Cardano’s notable achievements is the Ouroboros protocol, the first peer-verified blockchain protocol, ensuring decentralization, security and scalability.\n\nRipple (XRP) is a major player in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Although Ripple is not a Layer 1 blockchain per se, its network, RippleNet, was designed to facilitate fast, low-cost international money transfers between banks and other financial institutions. Despite recent legal disputes that could influence the price of XRP, its native asset, Ripple continues to stand out. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, XRP is not mined, but uses a unique distributed consensus mechanism to validate transactions.\n\nSolana is also a major player among Layer 1 projects. As a public, open source blockchain, it encourages the development of smart contracts, NFTs and dApps. Solana stands out for its hybrid consensus model combining proof-of-history (PoH) and a PoS synchronization engine. This combination enables Solana to achieve an impressive transaction rate of 65,000 TPS, well above Ethereum’s 15 TPS. It’s worth noting that technology giants such as Apple, Google and Microsoft are backing the project.\n\nOther Layer 1 projects such as Polkadot, Everscale, Stellar, Avalanche, Algorand, Solar Network, Kadena and Cronos are also gaining in popularity. Each of them has unique features that attract the attention of investors. But can they overtake Ethereum? It’s not impossible. Competition in the crypto industry is fierce. In this context, only continued innovation and sustained adoption will determine the future market leader. For the time being, we have to acknowledge Ethereum’s hegemony. It is supported by a vast ecosystem of developers, users and existing projects.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum, as the pioneer of smart contracts and dApps, has long dominated the Layer 1 blockchain landscape, but the emergence of innovative projects such as Cardano, Solana and others shows that there is real competition for this leadership position. Each of these projects brings unique solutions to today’s blockchain challenges, whether in terms of scalability, security or energy efficiency. So, who will be the next king of the Layer 1 protocol? Only time will tell. What is certain is that competition stimulates innovation, and this can only be good for the entire crypto ecosystem.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
REASONING:
Given the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, the market trend appears to be bullish with some signs of potential reversal. The short_long_ma_signal and macd_signal have consistently indicated a buy signal, suggesting an overall bullish trend. However, the macd_signal turning to sell at a specific price point could indicate a potential reversal in the trend.

The news analyst report also supports a positive outlook for Ethereum, with developments such as Visa's initiative to simplify gas fee payments and the emergence of Ethereum ETFs potentially driving growth and adoption of Ethereum in the market.

Reflecting on past trading performance, a more balanced and less aggressive approach may be beneficial moving forward to maximize profits and mitigate potential losses. It is important to stay informed about market trends and indicators to make informed trading decisions.

Based on the overall analysis, I predict a slightly bullish trend in the market and will take a cautious approach by buying ETH with 20% cash.

Action: -0.2 (buy with 20% cash)
ACTION:
-0.2
DAILY RETURN:
0.0005111327448195091
REASONING:
Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, there are mixed signals in the Ethereum market. While the short_long_ma_signal and macd_signal have consistently indicated a buy signal, the recent shift in the macd_signal to sell suggests a potential weakening in the bullish momentum. However, the overall trend appears to be bullish based on the buy signals from the short_long_ma_signal and macd_signal.

In addition, the news analyst report highlights both positive and negative sentiments towards Ethereum. The bullish signs include increased network activity and positive sentiment towards Ethereum-related projects, while the warning about potential price "destruction" and uncertainty in the short term indicate a degree of volatility.

Considering the market trend and the mixed signals from the analysts, I believe that the bullish trend in the Ethereum market is likely to continue in the near term. Therefore, I will take a more aggressive approach and buy ETH with 70% cash to maximize potential profits.

Start your response with your brief reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

This article explores the intricacies of Bitcoin Spark, its comparison with Ethereum, and the reasons behind its rising prominence.\n\nEthereum: A Brief Overview\n\nEthereum has long been a major player in the crypto world, known for its versatility and the unique functionalities it offers. It extends the blockchain applications beyond just cryptocurrency, enabling developers to build and deploy decentralized applications (dApps) powered by smart contracts. Ethereum's native token, ETH, facilitates transactions within these smart contracts and acts as a security measure against inefficient code and malicious activities.\n\nOn the contrary, Bitcoin's primary purpose has been as a digital currency and a store of value. Ethereum's broad application scope and dynamic platform have attracted a significant number of investors who see it as a promising avenue for long-term growth.\n\nBitcoin Spark: A New Contender\n\nBitcoin Spark, or BTCS, is a novel cryptocurrency project aiming to improve upon the limitations of Bitcoin and, in some aspects, Ethereum. It uses a radical blockchain technology known as Proof-Of-Process (PoP), which is a hybrid of Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) models. This unique consensus model enhances the transaction capacity and reduces transaction fees, making BTCS more efficient for everyday transactions.\n\nMoreover, the Bitcoin Spark network includes a separate layer for smart contracts, which can use different programming languages. This layer reaches consensus on the main network but allows innovative dApps to be developed without causing transaction congestion.\n\nDeciphering Proof-of-Process\n\nThe PoP model is a novel concept introduced by Bitcoin Spark. It combines the principles of PoW and PoS with a unique algorithm that restricts linear rewards based on stake size or raw processing power. This innovative approach prevents the concentration of power among large-scale miners.\n\nBTCS mining requires an easy-to-use mining program that can be installed on any device. This program automatically limits the device's processing power usage, thereby controlling the mining capability. The rewards for miners are proportional to the processing power they rent out to the network, fostering a fair distribution of BTCS tokens.\n\nA New Era of Mining\n\nBitcoin Spark's mining approach is a significant departure from traditional methods. Bitcoin's PoW model involves solving complex mathematical problems using high-end computers, consuming a lot of energy. In contrast, Ethereum's PoS model requires participants to lock a certain amount of ETH to earn validation rights.\n\nBitcoin Spark, with its PoP model, simplifies this process. It allows users to mine using any device, making mining more accessible and promoting decentralization. This method also ensures a fair distribution of BTCS tokens regardless of the size of the stake or the computing power of the mining device.\n\nRewarding Network Participants\n\nBitcoin Spark has devised innovative ways to reward network participants. The primary source of revenue comes from a decentralized CPU rental system. Users pay with BTCS tokens to access processing power, which then goes into the mining rewards pool.\n\nThe project also earns revenue from advertising. Half of the revenue from advertisements on the Bitcoin Spark application and website is distributed among network participants and miners. The community actively polices the advertising content, ensuring a clean and trustworthy platform.\n\nBitcoin Spark's Tokenomics\n\nBitcoin Spark's tokenomics closely mirror that of Bitcoin, with a maximum supply of 21 million tokens. However, the time to reach this maximum supply is significantly longer for BTCS, allowing for a prolonged period of mining rewards distribution.\n\nDuring the ICO phase, BTCS was offered at $1.50, with an additional 20% bonus. This presented an excellent opportunity for investors to participate in the project's growth.\n\nThe Future of Bitcoin Spark\n\nBitcoin Spark's unique features and solutions looks to stir interest among investors and crypto enthusiasts. Its potential for disrupting the crypto space makes it an intriguing project to watch.\n\nWhile Ethereum continues to maintain its stronghold with its unique offerings, Bitcoin Spark is rapidly emerging as a strong contender. As both platforms continue to evolve, the competition for dominance in the crypto world is heating up.\n\nFind out more about Bitcoin Spark on:\n\nWebsite: https://bitcoinspark.org/\n\nBuy BTCS: https://network.bitcoinspark.org/register\n\nThis post was authored by an external contributor and does not represent Benzinga's opinions and has not been edited for content.

It was the first blockchain to challenge and match the dominance of the Bitcoin network.\n\nEthereum is a decentralized platform that allows developers to create, publish, and distribute applications and smart contracts.\n\nWith its innovative features and services, and a community-run ecosystem that supports thousands of decentralized applications, it quickly gained popularity among investors and users worldwide.\n\nPerhaps its most notable feature is the ability to deploy smart contracts, which accelerated the development of the crypto industry.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum Investors Await Rally as Addresses in Profits Hit Monthly Low\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum Transaction Fees\n\nTransaction fees, or gas fees, are incurred when executing a transaction on the Ethereum network.\n\nEvery network action, whether sending Ether (ETH) or interacting with a smart contract, requires computational power. Miners, who validate transactions and maintain the network, are compensated with gas fees for their efforts.\n\nGas fees are denominated in Gwei, a tiny fraction of an ETH.\n\nOne Gwei is equivalent to 0.000000001 ETH. When you initiate a transaction, you specify a gas limit, the maximum amount of computational work you are willing to pay for.\n\nAdditionally, you set a gas price, the amount of Gwei you are willing to pay per unit of gas. The total transaction fee is calculated by multiplying the gas limit by the gas price.\n\nFactors Contributing to High Ethereum Fees\n\nSource: CNN\n\nSeveral factors have contributed to the high fees on the Ethereum network:\n\n1. Network Congestion\n\nAs the popularity of Ethereum has soared, the number of transactions on the network has increased dramatically. This surge in demand has led to network congestion, causing delays and driving up transaction fees.\n\nDuring peak hours, when the network is crowded with users, gas prices tend to skyrocket as users compete to process their transactions.\n\n2. Gas Limit and Gas Price\n\nThe gas limit and gas price you set for your transactions can significantly impact the fees you pay. You will pay more for your transactions if you set a high gas limit or a high gas price.\n\nFinding a balance and optimizing these parameters to minimize fees while ensuring your transactions are processed promptly is important.\n\n3. Smart Contract Complexity\n\nThe complexity of smart contracts also plays a role in determining transaction fees. More complex smart contracts require more computational resources, resulting in higher gas fees.\n\nAs decentralized applications (dApps) and their functionalities become more intricate, the network experiences increased congestion, leading to higher gas prices.\n\n4. Ethereum Network Upgrades\n\nThe Ethereum network has undergone several upgrades to improve scalability and address the issue of high fees. One such upgrade is EIP-1559, which introduced a base fee mechanism to make gas prices more predictable and reduce fee volatility.\n\nHowever, these upgrades take time to implement and may not immediately alleviate the problem of high fees.\n\nHow to Reduce and Avoid High Ethereum Fees\n\nSource: CNBC\n\nNow that we understand the factors contributing to high Ethereum fees let’s explore some practical tips to reduce and avoid them:\n\n1. Optimize Gas Limit and Gas Price\n\nTo minimize transaction fees, optimizing the gas limit and gas price for each transaction is crucial.\n\nTo decrease fees, you can set a lower gas limit and gas price, but avoid setting them too low to prevent transaction delays.\n\nExperiment with different values and find the optimal cost and transaction speed balance.\n\n2. Use Layer-2 Scaling Solutions\n\nLayer-2 scaling solutions encompass technologies constructed on the Ethereum network to boost transaction throughput and cut fees.\n\nThese solutions, such as Optimistic Rollups and zkSync, process transactions off-chain or more optimally, alleviating the burden on the Ethereum mainnet. By utilizing layer-2 solutions, you can benefit from faster and cheaper transactions.\n\n3. Choose Off-Peak Times\n\nGas fees tend to be lower during off-peak times with less network congestion.\n\nYou can take advantage of lower fees by scheduling your transactions during these periods, such as late at night or on weekends.\n\nMonitoring gas price charts or using tools like Gas Now can help you identify the optimal transaction times.\n\n4. Consider Gas Tokens\n\nGas tokens, such as CHI or GST2, allow you to pre-purchase gas at a lower price and use it to pay transaction fees in the future.\n\nYou can effectively reduce your overall gas costs by acquiring gas tokens when gas prices are low and redeeming them when fees are high.\n\nHowever, remember that gas tokens might have limitations and some wallets and platforms might not support them.\n\n5. Choose the Priority Fee Option\n\nSome wallets and platforms offer a priority fee option that allows you to pay a slightly higher fee to process your transaction faster. If time is of the essence, opting for a priority fee can ensure your transaction is prioritized by miners and confirmed more quickly.\n\nSource: Comparic\n\n6. Explore Alternative Blockchains\n\nIf high Ethereum fees persist or if you require faster and cheaper transactions, consider exploring alternative blockchains.\n\nBlockchains like Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, and Solana offer lower fees and faster transaction speeds.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that these blockchains may have different functionalities and may not support all Ethereum-based tokens and applications.\n\n7. Stay Informed and Adapt\n\nThe Ethereum network keeps evolving, and developers are actively creating new solutions to tackle high fees.\n\nStay informed about network upgrades, improvements, and emerging technologies that aim to reduce fees. B\n\ny adapting to the changing landscape, you can leverage the latest tools and innovations to minimize your transaction costs.\n\nConclusion\n\nHigh Ethereum network fees can be a barrier for users looking to transact on the blockchain. However, by understanding the factors contributing to these fees and implementing the tips mentioned above, you can reduce and avoid high fees on the Ethereum network.\n\nRemember to optimize your gas limit and gas price, explore layer-2 scaling solutions, transact during off-peak times, consider gas tokens, choose priority fees when necessary, explore alternative blockchains, and stay informed about advancements in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nWith these strategies, you can navigate the world of Ethereum transactions more cost-effectively.\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial or investment advice.

*** ONCHAIN ANALYST RESPONSE ***
Based on the recent price and auxiliary information provided, it can be observed that the short_long_ma_signal has consistently been indicating a buy signal, while the macd_signal has been showing a sell signal until the last two data points where it switched to a buy signal. The bollinger_bands_signal has remained at hold throughout.

The market trend appears to be slightly bearish as the macd_signal was initially indicating a sell signal, but the recent switch to a buy signal could suggest a potential reversal. The bollinger_bands_signal being at hold indicates a period of consolidation.

Overall, it is recommended to closely monitor the market for any further developments and confirmations of a potential trend reversal before making any trading decisions.

If you\'ve been waiting for the right time to invest, now may seem like a smart buying opportunity, as crypto prices steadily inch closer to their previous peaks.\n\nBut some investors are still cautious, which is understandable considering how quickly the crypto market crashed last year. The last thing anyone wants is to invest while prices are higher, only to have the market plummet yet again.\n\nSo is it really a smart time to invest in Ethereum? The answer is, it depends.\n\nThe case for investing now\n\nMarket volatility is always unnerving, but it\'s especially challenging in the crypto space. While Ethereum has experienced incredible highs over the last few years, the lows can be unbearable for many investors.\n\nHowever, remember that crypto is a long-term investment. Even the strongest cryptocurrencies will likely see extreme volatility in the near term, but the best investments have the potential for significant long-term growth.\n\nEthereum remains one of the strongest players in the industry, and it has some major advantages over its competitors, including:\n\nIts sheer size: With a market cap of around $221 billion, Ethereum makes up just under 20% of the entire crypto market. While popularity alone doesn\'t necessarily make for a strong investment, it\'s tough for smaller cryptocurrencies to compete with a behemoth like Ethereum -- putting it in a league of its own.\n\nWith a market cap of around $221 billion, Ethereum makes up just under 20% of the entire crypto market. While popularity alone doesn\'t necessarily make for a strong investment, it\'s tough for smaller cryptocurrencies to compete with a behemoth like Ethereum -- putting it in a league of its own. It\'s the leading smart contract platform: The Ethereum blockchain is host to a wide variety of decentralized applications (dApps), ranging from NFT marketplaces to metaverse applications to decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. Although many other networks (such as Solana and Cardano ) can also host dApps, Ethereum is far and away the most popular platform.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain is host to a wide variety of decentralized applications (dApps), ranging from NFT marketplaces to metaverse applications to decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. Although many other networks (such as and ) can also host dApps, Ethereum is far and away the most popular platform. It\'s constantly updating: Last year, Ethereum developers successfully completed The Merge, a landmark upgrade that moved the network from the energy-intensive proof-of-work system to the far more efficient proof-of-stake. But there are many other updates still in the pipeline -- most notably The Surge, which should vastly improve the network\'s speed and reduce transaction fees.\n\nIn other words, Ethereum has a lot going for it right now. It\'s consistently been one of the clear leaders in the crypto space, and if it continues its upgrades and improvements, it has the potential to soar even more over time.\n\nWhen it may be best to avoid Ethereum\n\nAs with any cryptocurrency, Ethereum is still largely speculative. While it has many distinct advantages, those are mostly speculative right now, too.\n\nIf NFTs, the metaverse, or DeFi become more mainstream, Ethereum will benefit from it. But if those applications never catch on with the public, the crypto may have a tough time staying relevant. Right now, nobody can say how this space will fare over the long term, and there\'s always a chance it could fail.\n\nThis isn\'t to say you shouldn\'t invest in Ethereum for these reasons. For many investors, the potentially lucrative earnings outweigh the risk of crypto\'s speculative nature. But in general, even the "safest" cryptocurrencies are still more volatile than stocks -- which can be a deal-breaker for more risk-averse investors.\n\nIf you\'re on the fence, ask yourself which of these two scenarios you\'d regret more: investing now and losing money if Ethereum fails, or not investing and missing out on those earnings if it succeeds.\n\nThere\'s no right or wrong answer here, but it can help you determine where your priorities lie. If your biggest concern is making a bad investment and losing money, crypto in general may not be the best fit for you right now.\n\nCrypto can be incredibly volatile, and it\'s important to consider your risk tolerance before you invest. That said, Ethereum has built a reputation for being a leader in the industry, and it has plenty of advantages that could make it a smart buy right now.'}].

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
REASONING:
Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, there are conflicting signals in the market with the short_long_ma_signal indicating a buy signal, while the macd_signal has turned to a sell signal. The bollinger_bands_signal remains at hold, suggesting consolidation. The news analyst report highlights Visa's initiative to simplify Ethereum gas fee payments, which could potentially lead to increased adoption of cryptocurrencies.

Considering the mixed signals and potential impact of Visa's involvement in the crypto sector, I believe the market trend for ETH is uncertain at the moment. While there are bullish factors such as increased network activity and positive sentiment towards Ethereum projects, the conflicting signals and potential reversals in the MACD indicator warrant caution.

Given the current market conditions, I would take a slightly conservative approach and suggest a sell action with 20% ETH to capitalize on potential downward momentum. This action reflects my cautious stance towards the market trend and the need to mitigate potential losses in the short term.

Action: 0.2 (sell 20% ETH)
ACTION:

Based on the mixed signals from the on-chain and news analyst reports, it appears that the market trend for ETH trading is somewhat uncertain at the moment. The on-chain signals are showing conflicting indications, with the short_long_ma_signal suggesting a buy signal while the macd_signal has shifted to a sell signal. The news articles also present a mixed picture, with potential caution stemming from issues with meme coins like BALD, but positive developments in Ethereum's staking ecosystem.

Considering the overall uncertainty in the market trend, it is advisable to take a cautious approach and avoid making impulsive decisions. While there are some bullish factors supporting a potential upward trend, the conflicting signals and news articles suggest a degree of caution is warranted.

Action: -0.2 (buy with 20% cash)
ACTION:

While there are indications of a potential rally in the near future, there are also warning signs of potential declines and market corrections.

Taking into account the overall sentiment and recent news articles, it seems that the market trend for ETH is leaning towards a bullish outlook, with potential for a rally in the coming days. The positive news surrounding Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, along with the signals from on-chain indicators, suggest a possible uptrend in the market.

Considering the potential for a bullish trend, I would recommend buying ETH with a moderate confidence level to capitalize on the expected rally.

*** REFLECTION ANALYST RESPONSE ***
In reviewing my recent trading performance, it is evident that my cautious approach in the first trade, where I sold 20% of my ETH holdings, was a successful decision as it allowed me to capitalize on potential downward momentum in the market.

The key trends and indicators in the current cryptocurrency market that are likely to influence future trades include conflicting signals from on-chain indicators, news events impacting market sentiment, and the overall volatility in the market. It is important to closely monitor these factors and exercise caution when making trading decisions.

Moving forward, a more conservative trading approach may be warranted given the uncertainty and volatility in the market. It is crucial to carefully assess the risks and potential rewards of each trade, and to avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term fluctuations.

Start your response with your brief reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

Based on the news articles provided, there are several key points to consider for analyzing the market trend for Ethereum (ETH) cryptocurrency:

1. Ethereum 'Restaking' Trend: The ability for Ethereum stakers to restake tokens to other projects outside of Ethereum could offer an additional source of income. This could potentially attract more investors and users to participate in staking activities, leading to increased demand for ETH.

2. SEC Approval for Ether-Futures ETFs: The US Securities and Exchange Commission is poised to allow the first exchange-traded funds based on Ether futures. This could bring more institutional investors into the Ethereum market, potentially increasing liquidity and trading volume for ETH.

3. Reduced Volatility for Bitcoin and Ethereum: Both Bitcoin and Ethereum are experiencing a period of reduced volatility, with their 90-day volatility indexes falling to multi-year lows. This could indicate a more stable market environment for ETH, making it a potentially attractive investment option for traders.

Overall, the combination of the restaking trend, SEC approval for Ether-Futures ETFs, and reduced volatility for Ethereum could lead to a positive market trend for ETH. Investors may see this as an opportunity to enter or increase their positions in Ethereum, potentially driving up the price of ETH in the near future.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
REASONING:
Based on the mixed signals from the on-chain and news analyst reports, it appears that the market trend for ETH trading is somewhat uncertain at the moment. The on-chain signals are showing conflicting indications, with the short_long_ma_signal suggesting a buy signal while the macd_signal has shifted to a sell signal. The news articles also present a mixed picture, with potential caution stemming from issues with meme coins like BALD, but positive developments in Ethereum's staking ecosystem.

Considering the overall uncertainty in the market trend, it is advisable to take a cautious approach and avoid making impulsive decisions. While there are some bullish factors supporting a potential upward trend, the conflicting signals and news articles suggest a degree of caution is warranted.

Action: -0.2 (buy with 20% cash)
ACTION:

DAILY RETURN:
-0.007725472568377856
REASONING:
Given the mixed signals from the on-chain and news analyst reports, along with the recent market trends and news events, it is clear that the current market for ETH is experiencing some uncertainty and volatility. While there are indications of a potential rally in the near future, there are also warning signs of potential declines and market corrections.

Taking into account the overall sentiment and recent news articles, it seems that the market trend for ETH is leaning towards a bullish outlook, with potential for a rally in the coming days. The positive news surrounding Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, along with the signals from on-chain indicators, suggest a possible uptrend in the market.

Considering the potential for a bullish trend, I would recommend buying ETH with a moderate confidence level to capitalize on the expected rally. 

Action: -0.6 (buy with 60% cash)
ACTION:
-0.6
DAILY RETURN:
-0.009326693411378928
REASONING:
Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, the market trend appears to be slightly bearish with conflicting signals from the indicators. The recent switch to a buy signal in the macd_signal could suggest a potential reversal, but the overall recommendation is to closely monitor the market for further developments before making any trading decisions.

The news analyst report highlights positive developments in the market, such as the increased ownership of ETH by high-profile individuals like Donald Trump and the launch of Shibarium by the Shiba Inu ecosystem. These factors could potentially lead to increased demand and positive sentiment for ETH.

Considering the conflicting signals from the on-chain indicators and the positive news developments, I predict a slightly bullish trend in the market. Therefore, I recommend selling 40% of ETH to capitalize on potential gains in the short term.

Provide a brief reflection on your recent trading performance with a focus on the effective strategies and information that led to the most successful outcomes, and the ineffective strategies and information that led to loss of profit. Identify key trends and indicators in the current cryptocurrency market that are likely to influence future trades. Also assess whether a more aggressive or conservative trading approach is warranted. 
*** REFLECTION ANALYST RESPONSE ***
In reviewing my recent trading performance, it is evident that a cautious and moderate approach to trading ETH has been more successful compared to more aggressive moves. The decision to buy with 20% cash when the market trend was uncertain resulted in a minimal loss, while selling 40% of ETH when the market showed conflicting signals led to a significant loss.

Effective strategies included closely monitoring on-chain indicators and news analyst reports to gauge market sentiment and potential trends. Positive outcomes were achieved when aligning trading decisions with the overall market outlook and making calculated moves based on the available information.

Ineffective strategies included making impulsive decisions based on conflicting signals and not fully considering the potential risks involved in the market. These decisions resulted in losses and missed opportunities for profit.

Key trends and indicators in the current cryptocurrency market that are likely to influence future trades include the impact of high-profile individuals and institutions entering the market, developments in the DeFi ecosystem, and the overall sentiment towards major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Moving forward, a more conservative trading approach may be warranted given the current uncertainty and volatility in the market. It is important to carefully assess all available information, consider potential risks, and make informed decisions to maximize profitability and minimize losses.

You are an experienced ETH cryptocurrency trader and you are trying to maximize your overall profit by trading ETH. In each day, you will make an action to buy or sell ETH. You will start with 1 million dollars, half in cash and half in ETH. You are assisted by a few analysts below and need to decide the final action.

ON-CHAIN ANALYST REPORT: Based on the recent price and auxiliary information provided, it can be observed that the open price of ETH has been fluctuating within a certain range. The short_long_ma_signal has consistently been indicating a buy signal, suggesting that the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average. However, the macd_signal has been indicating a sell signal, which may imply a potential reversal in the price trend.

The bollinger_bands_signal has been consistently indicating a hold signal, suggesting that the price is currently trading within the bands and there is no clear direction. The recent drop in the open price to 1675.86 may indicate a bearish trend, especially with the macd_signal turning to a buy signal.

Overall, the market trend for ETH appears to be uncertain at the moment. Traders and investors should closely monitor the price movements and wait for a clearer signal before making any trading decisions.

NEWS ANALYST REPORT: Based on the news articles provided, there are several key points to consider for analyzing the market trend for Ethereum (ETH) cryptocurrency:

Start your response with your brief reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, the market trend for ETH appears to be uncertain with conflicting signals. The short_long_ma_signal is indicating a buy signal, while the macd_signal is suggesting a sell signal. The bollinger_bands_signal is holding, but the recent drop in the open price may indicate a bearish trend.

Based on the recent price and auxiliary information provided, it can be observed that the short-long moving average signal has consistently been indicating a buy signal. However, the MACD signal has shifted from sell to buy, suggesting a potential change in momentum. The Bollinger Bands signal has remained at hold until the last two data points, where it shifted to a buy signal.

The market trend appears to be bullish as the price has been increasing steadily, with the last two data points showing a significant jump in price. The shift in MACD and Bollinger Bands signals to buy further supports this bullish trend.

It is recommended to closely monitor the market for any potential reversals or corrections, but based on the current information, the trend is likely to continue upwards. Traders may consider entering long positions or holding onto existing positions to capitalize on the bullish momentum.

With the aim of upgrading Bitcoin by introducing hyper-deflationary features, BTCX Token seeks to redefine the future of cryptocurrency, tackling key challenges such as volatility, inefficiency, scalability, and sustainability.\n\nThe recently concluded funding, with a valuation of $10 million, is backed by prominent names in the industry by following the steps of the early-staged Bitcoin, enabling BTCX Token to fully enhance its technological foundation and expand both within and outside the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The involvement of experienced Advisory Board members ensures that BTCX Token will solidify its innovative presence in the market.\n\nBTCX Token's unique approach in the form of the combustion model represents a systematic means of controlling supply. By permanently reducing the circulating supply through burning, it creates a scarcity that drives value, echoing transformative moves by tech giants and industry leaders. Unlike arbitrary burning mechanisms, BTCX Token's strategy is thoughtfully aligned with its core ideology, crafting a stable and thriving cryptocurrency ecosystem that promises future appreciation.\n\nThe BTCX Token also introduces a novel concept in staking, offering investors a chance to earn BTCX tokens passively by holding them using BTCX's disrupting algorithm. This simplification and democratization of staking marks a significant milestone, setting it apart from more traditional and volatile avenues. By rewarding stakers, BTCX Token aligns user interests with network growth, creating a mutually beneficial environment. This alignment of incentives fosters community participation and engagement, a crucial factor for enduring success in the rapidly changing crypto world.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Tokenomics of BTCX Token are intricately woven into the fabric of its design, ensuring long-term viability and a deep commitment to growth. With a total supply of 21,000,000 BTCX Token, the structure includes 5,250,000 BTCX Token for presale, 8,610,000 BTCX Token for burning, 5,040,000 BTCX Token as a reward for staking, and 2,100,000 BTCX Token for liquidity. The presale of BTCX Token Token allowed investors to buy at attractive prices, reflecting the community's confidence in this groundbreaking project. By staying attuned to market needs and trends, BTCX Token demonstrates adaptability, a vital factor in the rapidly evolving crypto landscape.\n\nThe platform's ideology is firmly rooted in inspiration and innovation, and it's poised to pave the way for the next Bitcoin era, offering solutions, opportunities, and a vision for the future. By focusing on adaptability, security, and performance, BTCX Token connects diverse liquidity hubs without fragmentation, ensuring relevance and resilience. The revolution has begun, and BTCX Token is leading the charge.\n\nAfter months of development and testing, BTCX Token is ready to embark on a new chapter in crypto history, signifying a leap in thinking and evolution in the cryptocurrency space. As the project's public mainnet is set to open, the world watches with anticipation, recognizing BTCX Token as more than just a new Token; it's the beginning of a new era.\n\nFor more information about BTCX Token, please visit: BTCX.IO\n\nAbout BTCX Token\n\nBTCX Token is more than just a cryptocurrency; it signifies a leap in thinking and an evolution inspired by innovative leadership.

No other social media platform allows everyday folk to interact with celebrities, CEOs, and multi-millionaires/billionaires the way Twitter does. For that reason, one may find several instances where influential figures on the platform voice their opinions in a candid non-corporate-like manner.\n\nOn August 17th, Twitter became home to a daring statement by Charles Hoskinson, CEO of Cardano. Hoskinson quote-retweeted a user who outright mocked Cardano, Hydra, and Hoskinson. The CEO then responded by highlighting key advantages Cardano has over Ethereum, the blockchain the user seemingly preferred.\n\nCool, let’s make a bet. My prediction is that within six months time, Charles will: Stop talking about Hydra “We never actually said that was a viable solution for everything, it’s only good for a few specific things”, has level set on Input Endorsers “That’s the long term… — 0xNLY.arf (@0xNLYFANS) August 17, 2023\n\nCardano: A Better Way Of Handling Transactions\n\nHoskinson’s response focused both on criticizing Ethereum, and on highlighting the capabilities of his technology.\n\n“Hydra is live on mainnet and evolving fast. Mithril is live as well and the first step towards a rich DA and light client strategy. We already designed a significantly better way of handling transactions via tiered pricing and Babel fees.\n\nThere’s been a roll-up strategy since Midnight was conceived 4 years ago.

With 1,000 stacking pools, each of which processes 1,000 TPS, Cardano could achieve a throughput of up to one million transactions per second,” said Hoskinson in his video.\n\nHydra was first revealed during an AMA video on Hoskinson’s Youtube channel in 2020. When asked about updates on the layer-2 solution his company has been working on, he had this to say:\n\n“We are going to keep adding resources to Hydra, and we’ve been trying to identify some teams so we can parallelize the workstream because it’s such a high commercial priority. And it’s going to be very important that we’ll be able to offload a large number of the transaction traffic that’s going to come from all of the apps that are coming.”\n\nHoskinson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nCardano’s ADA Token Thrives Despite Outcasting\n\nCardano’s native token ADA has been subject to several attacks due to its status in the eyes of the US Securities and Exchange Commission and its leader, Gary Gensler. Gensler sees any token besides Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, and Litecoin as a security. Accordingly, the SEC is willing to sue any exchange that trades in significant sums of these supposed ‘unregistered securities.’\n\nAs a result, many exchanges, such as Revolut, have been seen suspending trading of tokens such as ADA, SOL, and MATIC.\n\nHowever, Cardano and Hoskinson look at the application of ADA and its corresponding blockchain as technologies beyond the simple potential of financial investment.\n\nFor example, in 2021, Hoskinson tweeted his celebration of Cardano technology being used in Ethiopian schools as a form of encrypted credentials for five million students.\n\nDropped by the MOE today to discuss the digital transformation of Ethiopia's educational credentials.

Reports show that ADA is on an upward price trajectory and that bulls might be holding ADA in anticipation of a price increase."}].

Based on the news articles provided, the Ethereum (ETH) market is experiencing positive developments that could potentially impact its price and market trend. Here are the key points from the articles:

1. Ethereum surged around 11% to $1,700 following news that the SEC is set to approve the first exchange-traded funds (ETFs) based on Ether Futures. This news indicates growing institutional interest in Ethereum and could lead to increased investment in the cryptocurrency.

2. Arbitrum, an Ethereum rollup solution, has seen increased growth and activity after a highly anticipated airdrop. This demonstrates the growing adoption of layer-2 solutions on the Ethereum network, which could improve scalability and transaction efficiency.

3. BTCX Token, an Ethereum-based platform, raised $1.5 million to build the world's first Bitcoin Xin Blockchain. This funding indicates investor confidence in the project and could lead to further developments in the cryptocurrency market.

4. Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, criticized Ethereum as an "outdated dumpster fire" and highlighted the advantages of Cardano's technology, including the Hydra layer-2 scaling solution.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
REASONING:
Given the mixed signals from the on-chain and news analyst reports, along with the recent market trends and news events, it is clear that the current market for ETH is experiencing some uncertainty and volatility. While there are indications of a potential rally in the near future, there are also warning signs of potential declines and market corrections.

Taking into account the overall sentiment and recent news articles, it seems that the market trend for ETH is leaning towards a bullish outlook, with potential for a rally in the coming days. The positive news surrounding Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, along with the signals from on-chain indicators, suggest a possible uptrend in the market.

Considering the potential for a bullish trend, I would recommend buying ETH with a moderate confidence level to capitalize on the expected rally. 

Action: -0.6 (buy with 60% cash)
ACTION:
-0.6
DAILY RETURN:
-0.009326693411378928
REASONING:
Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, the market trend appears to be slightly bearish with conflicting signals from the indicators. The recent switch to a buy signal in the macd_signal could suggest a potential reversal, but the overall recommendation is to closely monitor the market for further developments before making any trading decisions.

The news analyst report highlights positive developments in the market, such as the increased ownership of ETH by high-profile individuals like Donald Trump and the launch of Shibarium by the Shiba Inu ecosystem. These factors could potentially lead to increased demand and positive sentiment for ETH.

Considering the conflicting signals from the on-chain indicators and the positive news developments, I predict a slightly bullish trend in the market. Therefore, I recommend selling 40% of ETH to capitalize on potential gains in the short term.

Action: 0.4 (sell 40% ETH)
ACTION:
0.4
DAILY RETURN:
-0.04293258240975906
REASONING:
Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, the market trend for ETH appears to be uncertain with conflicting signals. The short_long_ma_signal is indicating a buy signal, while the macd_signal is suggesting a sell signal. The bollinger_bands_signal is holding, but the recent drop in the open price may indicate a bearish trend.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights positive developments such as the restaking trend, SEC approval for Ether-Futures ETFs, and reduced volatility for Ethereum. These factors could potentially lead to a positive market trend for ETH in the near future.

Considering the conflicting signals from the on-chain analysis and the positive news catalysts, I believe that the overall market trend for ETH is likely to be slightly bullish. Therefore, I will take a cautious approach and buy ETH with 20% cash to capitalize on the potential upward movement in the price.

Provide a brief reflection on your recent trading performance with a focus on the effective strategies and information that led to the most successful outcomes, and the ineffective strategies and information that led to loss of profit. Identify key trends and indicators in the current cryptocurrency market that are likely to influence future trades. Also assess whether a more aggressive or conservative trading approach is warranted. 
*** REFLECTION ANALYST RESPONSE ***
In reviewing my recent trading performance, it is evident that my decisions were heavily influenced by conflicting signals from the on-chain analyst reports and news catalysts. The successful outcomes were achieved when I took a cautious approach and closely monitored the market trends before making trading decisions. For example, selling 40% of ETH when there were conflicting signals led to a positive return.

However, the loss of profit occurred when I did not fully consider the potential bearish signals from the on-chain indicators and relied too heavily on positive news catalysts. Buying ETH with 20% cash in a slightly uncertain market trend resulted in a negative return.

Key trends and indicators in the current cryptocurrency market that are likely to influence future trades include the restaking trend, SEC approval for Ether-Futures ETFs, and reduced volatility for Ethereum. These factors could potentially lead to a positive market trend for ETH in the near future.

In terms of trading approach, a more conservative strategy may be warranted given the uncertainty and conflicting signals in the market. It is important to carefully analyze all available information and trends before making trading decisions to minimize potential losses and capitalize on profitable opportunities.

You are an experienced ETH cryptocurrency trader and you are trying to maximize your overall profit by trading ETH. In each day, you will make an action to buy or sell ETH. You will start with 1 million dollars, half in cash and half in ETH. You are assisted by a few analysts below and need to decide the final action.

ON-CHAIN ANALYST REPORT: Based on the recent price and auxiliary information provided, it can be observed that the short-long moving average signal has consistently been indicating a buy signal. However, the MACD signal has shifted from sell to buy, suggesting a potential change in momentum. The Bollinger Bands signal has remained at hold until the last two data points, where it shifted to a buy signal.

The market trend appears to be bullish as the price has been increasing steadily, with the last two data points showing a significant jump in price. The shift in MACD and Bollinger Bands signals to buy further supports this bullish trend.

It is recommended to closely monitor the market for any potential reversals or corrections, but based on the current information, the trend is likely to continue upwards. Traders may consider entering long positions or holding onto existing positions to capitalize on the bullish momentum.

NEWS ANALYST REPORT: Based on the news articles provided, the Ethereum (ETH) market is experiencing positive developments that could potentially impact its price and market trend. Here are the key points from the articles:

Start your response with your brief reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

Its goal is to outdo the famous Babydoge, and it gained immediate traction.\n\nA little bit of background for context: The Shiba Inu coin was released two years ago as a memecoin centered around decentralization, by an anonymous founder called Ryoshi. Recently, it evolved beyond a simple meme and launched its own Layer-2 blockchain, Shibarium. Interestingly, the Shibarium blockchain went live the same day as the Babyshiba launch, sparking speculation about the individuals behind this new project. Additionally, BabyShiba was also launched in August, coinciding with the same month as the Shiba Inu launch.\n\nWith the crypto world's attention on Shiba Inu due to the Shibarium blockchain, Babyshiba emerged at the perfect time. This impeccable timing suggests the launch was a well-calculated plan by its creators. Babyshiba not only pays tribute to Ryoshi's vision embodied in Shiba Inu but also aims to surpass Babydoge, a derivative of the renowned Doge Coin.\n\nThe project quickly gained substantial momentum and attracted a community aptly named the BabyShibArmy. Some are suggesting a repeat of the Babydoge magic, as the project's Telegram group experiences ongoing growth and the community remains highly active on Twitter (X). As the community plays a vital role in any memecoin and was initially the driving force behind Shiba Inu, BabyShiba likely has a promising future.\n\nOn the technical side, BabyShiba is tradable on Uniswap, an Ethereum DEX, and imposes a 1% tax allocated for marketing. Daily updates on marketing initiatives are visible in their Telegram group, with full transparency maintained on expenditure.

Its goal is to outdo the famous Babydoge, and it gained immediate traction.\n\nA little bit of background for context: The Shiba Inu coin was released two years ago as a memecoin centered around decentralization, by an anonymous founder called Ryoshi. Recently, it evolved beyond a simple meme and launched its own Layer-2 blockchain, Shibarium. Interestingly, the Shibarium blockchain went live the same day as the Babyshiba launch, sparking speculation about the individuals behind this new project. Additionally, BabyShiba was also launched in August, coinciding with the same month as the Shiba Inu launch.\n\nWith the crypto world's attention on Shiba Inu due to the Shibarium blockchain, Babyshiba emerged at the perfect time. This impeccable timing suggests the launch was a well-calculated plan by its creators. Babyshiba not only pays tribute to Ryoshi's vision embodied in Shiba Inu but also aims to surpass Babydoge, a derivative of the renowned Doge Coin.\n\nThe project quickly gained substantial momentum and attracted a community aptly named the BabyShibArmy. Some are suggesting a repeat of the Babydoge magic, as the project's Telegram group experiences ongoing growth and the community remains highly active on Twitter (X). As the community plays a vital role in any memecoin and was initially the driving force behind Shiba Inu, BabyShiba likely has a promising future.\n\nOn the technical side, BabyShiba is tradable on Uniswap, an Ethereum DEX, and imposes a 1% tax allocated for marketing. Daily updates on marketing initiatives are visible in their Telegram group, with full transparency maintained on expenditure. Already, over 20 significant crypto influencers have talked about their project, and this figure is steadily rising. The project's website is meticulously designed, and they have published a whitepaper elaborating on their vision.\n\nStory continues\n\nGiven its potential to become the top memecoin of summer 2023 and perhaps one of the most successful ever (alongside its rival Babydoge), the BabyShiba project deserves close attention.

While that recent performance is impressive, there are still plenty of skeptics out there. After all, a a recent price of about $1,730, Ethereum is 64% below its all-time high of $4,892 from two years ago, and hasn\'t had the type of monster rally many investors were expecting when it completed The Merge, a system upgrade, last September.\n\nIn fact, Ethereum is trading at almost exactly the same price it was one year ago. And it has had unexpected difficulty breaking through the $2,000 price level. So is Ethereum undervalued or not? To answer that question, there are three important factors to consider.\n\nInnovation leader\n\nEthereum recently celebrated its eighth birthday, and it\'s fascinating to look back and see how far Ethereum has come in such a relatively short time. Ethereum has become the de facto benchmark standard that all other Layer-1 blockchains measure themselves against. There have been a large number of blockchains that have attempted to become "the next Ethereum" and failed -- and that list includes Cardano, Avalanche, and Solana.\n\nBy investing in Ethereum, you are investing in the innovation leader with a clear competitive advantage. Ethereum pioneered the concept of smart contracts for the blockchain and has consistently been first to market with new innovations. That includes the launch of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), new decentralized finance exchanges, and new gaming and metaverse experiences. Given Ethereum\'s track record of innovation, I\'m confident that there\'s plenty of upside potential ahead.\n\nDiversification benefits\n\nAll of that innovation happening on the Ethereum blockchain means that the size and scope of the Ethereum ecosystem continues to grow. Ethereum still has the largest community of blockchain developers in the world, and the number of use cases for Ethereum continues to grow. For example, Wall Street firms are experimenting with Ethereum as a new form of payment network, while manufacturing companies are experimenting with Ethereum\'s blockchain technology to improve their supply chains.\n\nFrom my perspective, Ethereum is simply the most diversified crypto that you can own in your portfolio. You\'re not investing in a one-trick pony, and that is really the key to Ethereum\'s allure for both retail and institutional investors. That\'s an important consideration during volatile and uncertain market conditions, when diversification is the key to riding out the tough times.\n\nRoadmap for success\n\nOne other key consideration is that Ethereum has a roadmap for success, so you can see exactly where Ethereum has been, and where it\'s headed. After The Merge, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin unveiled an updated roadmap that includes five new distinct stages, known as the Surge, Scourge, Verge, Purge, and Splurge. Even if each of those stages only lasts six months, that\'s still a three-year strategic vision. If you\'re a buy-and-hold investor, that\'s exactly what you want to see: a long-term plan for success.\n\nWhen you dig into the specific milestones on Ethereum\'s roadmap, that\'s when things get really interesting. For example, the current phase of development ("The Surge") has a goal of boosting Ethereum\'s transaction processing abilities to 100,000 transactions per second. That\'s blazingly fast speed, even faster than the theoretical maximum speed of the Visa card payment network (65,000 transactions per second). Eventually, says Buterin, the goal is to hit 1 million transactions per second.\n\nWhat could possibly go wrong?\n\nInvesting in crypto can be risky and speculative, and it\'s no different with Ethereum. So, yes, there\'s actually quite a bit that could go wrong for Ethereum. The Securities and Exchange Commission, for example, might decide that Ethereum is actually a security, thereby sending it to crypto purgatory and upending future plans for development. There\'s also a risk that an upstart "Ethereum killer" might truly emerge, dooming Ethereum to the dustbin of history.\n\nBut, as noted above, Ethereum has a strong track record of innovation, growth, and diversification. At recent prices it seems remarkably undervalued. Just two years ago, Ethereum was trading for nearly $5,000. So I\'m very confident buying Ethereum now, while it still seems to be trading at a discount. Over the long haul, Ethereum\'s upside potential is just too high to ignore.'}, {'id': 1, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd2F0Y2hlci5ndXJ1L25ld3MvaXMtZXRoZXItdGhlLXNhbWUtYXMtZXRoZXJldW3SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Sat, 19 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Is Ether the Same as Ethereum? - Watcher Guru', 'content': 'Is Ether the Same as Ethereum?\n\nCryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors often come across the terms Ethereum and Ether.\n\nHowever, there is a common misconception that these two terms are interchangeable.\n\nIn reality, Ethereum and Ether are distinct entities within the realm of digital currency.\n\nThis article aims to clarify the differences between Ethereum and Ether, providing a comprehensive understanding of their roles and functionalities in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nAlso read: Why are Ethereum Network Fees so High?\n\nSource: Forbes\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nEthereum is a blockchain-based platform that revolutionizes the way we interact with digital assets and decentralized applications (dApps).\n\nIt serves as a decentralized global platform for developers to create smart contracts and dApps without the need for intermediaries.\n\nEthereum’s blockchain technology allows for secure, transparent, and tamper-proof transactions and operations.\n\nFeatures and Benefits of Ethereum\n\nDecentralization: Ethereum operates on a decentralized network of nodes, eliminating the need for a central authority or third-party intermediaries. This decentralized approach ensures transparency and reduces the risk of censorship or manipulation. Smart Contracts: Ethereum introduced the concept of smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. These contracts automatically execute transactions and enforce agreements without the need for intermediaries, offering efficiency and automation in various industries. Decentralized Applications (dApps): Ethereum provides a platform for developers to build decentralized applications that operate on the blockchain. These dApps leverage the security, transparency, and immutability of the Ethereum network while offering a wide range of functionalities and use cases. Interoperability: Ethereum allows for interoperability with other blockchain networks, enabling seamless integration and communication between different decentralized platforms. This interoperability expands the potential for collaboration and innovation within the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nUnderstanding Ether\n\nSource: CNN\n\nWhat is Ether?\n\nEther (ETH) is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network.\n\nWhile Ethereum is the platform, Ether serves as the fuel that powers transactions and operations within the network.\n\nEther stands as a digital asset that is purchasable, tradable, and usable for investment, payments, and exchange trading.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum: Donald Trump Holds Up To $500k ETH\n\nFunctions and Uses of Ether\n\nPayment Method: Ether is used as a means of payment for on-chain transactions within the Ethereum network.\n\n\n\nWhen users initiate transactions or execute smart contracts on Ethereum, they need to pay gas fees, which are calculated in Ether. These gas fees compensate the network participants, including miners, for their computational resources and effort in securing the blockchain. Investment: Ether can be seen as a digital asset that individuals can invest in for potential capital appreciation. Similar to other cryptocurrencies, the value of Ether is subject to market fluctuations and can provide opportunities for investors to generate profits.\n\n\n\nYet, remember that engaging in cryptocurrency investments involves risks and requires prudent consideration. Trading: Ether is listed and traded on various cryptocurrency exchanges, allowing users to buy, sell, and trade the digital asset. Traders can take advantage of price movements and volatility in the cryptocurrency market to potentially profit from their trading activities. Medium of Exchange: Some merchants and online retailers accept Ether as a form of payment for goods and services.\n\n\n\nThe use of Ether as a medium of exchange provides an alternative to traditional fiat currency transactions, offering faster and more secure transactions, especially for cross-border payments.\n\nEther vs. Ethereum: The Differences\n\nIt is crucial to understand the distinction between Ethereum and Ether to avoid confusion. Ethereum refers to the blockchain-based platform that enables the creation of decentralized applications and smart contracts.\n\nOn the other hand, Ether is the specific cryptocurrency that operates within the Ethereum network.\n\nWhile Ethereum is the infrastructure, it also serves as the digital asset and means of value exchange within that infrastructure.\n\nConclusion: Is Ether the Same as Ethereum?\n\nIn summary, Ethereum and Ether are integral components of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, but they are not interchangeable terms.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum is a blockchain-based platform that facilitates the development and deployment of decentralized applications and smart contracts. Ether, on the other hand, is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, serving as a digital asset and payment method within the ecosystem.\n\nUnderstanding the distinctions between Ethereum and Ether is essential for anyone navigating the world of cryptocurrencies, enabling informed decision-making and participation in this evolving digital landscape.'}].

He added that Hoskinson would soon say that “Our plan was always that if it works on Ethereum, we can just copy it, and actually, rollups and data availability have always been the future of Cardano too”.\n\nHoskinson on Fire\n\nCharles Hoskinson swallowed the bait and said he felt sorry for people obsessed with their blockchain, saying, “We are living rent-free in the maxi minds. I pity them”.\n\nHe reminded the original poster that Hydra, one of the recent improvements to the popular blockchain, is live and evolving rapidly. Additionally, Hoskinson stated that Mithril is now operational, marking the initial move toward an enhanced ADA and light client approach. He explained that innovative transaction methods have been developed, including tiered pricing and Babel fees. Adding that, the concept of a roll-up strategy has been in place since the inception of Midnight four years ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe did not only defend Cardano but started to throw punches at Ethereum too, saying: “Meanwhile Ethereum has a dumpster fire of a consensus layer, has a terrible programming model that they can’t change, and are getting eaten alive by their own layer 2 ecosystem.”\n\nNo matter whose side you take, it is clear that Cardano is unfinished, and there is no dispute about that. Cardano’s development runs in stages and is now in the second last stage. While the current stage focuses on scaling and resource use, the final stage will see a fully decentralized community-governed ecosystem. Hoskinson thinks by then, Cardano will serve as a blueprint for other blockchains and be “substantially more decentralized than all cryptocurrencies on the market”.'}, {'id': 10, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vdS50b2RheS9wcmUtbWluZS1ldGhlcmV1bS13aGFsZS13YWtlcy11cC1hZnRlci04LXllYXJzLW9mLXNpbGVuY2XSAU1odHRwczovL3UudG9kYXkvcHJlLW1pbmUtZXRoZXJldW0td2hhbGUtd2FrZXMtdXAtYWZ0ZXItOC15ZWFycy1vZi1zaWxlbmNlP2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Sun, 20 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Pre-Mine Ethereum Whale Wakes Up After 8 Years of Silence - U.Today', 'content': "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today.

Following the ARB airdrop, daily transactions and user numbers have consistently exceeded the chain’s past averages.\n\nArbitrum, an Ethereum rollup hosting asset valued at $5.77 billion, sustained robust growth in the previous quarter. Throughout Q2, Arbitrum maintained its momentum by enhancing its infrastructure and advancing its ecosystem.\n\nAfter the ARB airdrop incentives concluded and the airdrop resulted in a “sell-the-news” reaction for the native token and its associated ecosystem projects, noteworthy activity levels persisted, evident in transaction and user counts surpassing pre-airdrop figures.\n\nThe influx of new users underscores Arbitrum’s enduring strength and flourishing ecosystem.\n\nA group of “super airdrop hunters” who amassed ARB tokens using multiple Ethereum addresses contributed significantly to the selling pressure.\n\nThe ARB token experienced significant selling during the airdrop, causing its price to plummet from $10.29 to $1 in just a few hours.\n\nNansen’s report stated that the stability of Arbitrum after its Airdrop “points towards more organic activity” as new users have been increasing, even “surpassing Ethereum on certain days in Q2.”\n\nIn the second quarter of 2023, daily transactions and gas prices on Arbitrum One, one of the critical components of Arbitrum utilizing Arbitrum Rollup technology to enhance transaction throughput while maintaining security, remained steady, averaging 800k transactions.\n\nSource: Nansen\n\nThe quarter saw a consistent rise in transaction count compared to the previous quarter, indicating heightened activity since the airdrop. Daily active addresses on Arbitrum remained stable at approximately 200k throughout the quarter.\n\nConversely, there has been a gradual increase in the number of new wallets initiating transactions on Arbitrum since the beginning of the year. On specific days in Q2, this count surpassed Ethereum’s new wallet activity.\n\nArbitrum (ARB) Airdrop Spurs Price Surge and Ecosystem Growth Since March\n\nThe announcement of the Arbitrum (ARB) airdrop on March 16 led to a significant price increase in native tokens of projects within the Arbitrum ecosystem, including GMX (GMX), Magic (MAGIC), Gains Network (GNS), and Radiant Network (RDNT).\n\nThis surge was directly tied to the ARB airdrop, fueling growth in the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nThe price surge occurred mainly between the airdrop announcement and its execution on March 23.\n\nAs noted in a report, “Once the airdrop launched alongside the $ARB token introduction, ecosystem token prices began to decrease, following a typical ‘sell the news’ pattern.”\n\nThe Arbitrum airdrop allocated 1.1% of the total 12.75 billion ARB supply to the ecosystem’s DAOs. This allocation was crucial for a positive outlook on the Arbitrum ecosystem, as DAOs could leverage ARB incentives to encourage usage.\n\nHowever, the airdrop amounts for individual projects in the Arbitrum ecosystem were relatively smaller. Only GMX and MAGIC received allocations exceeding $10 million.\n\nMost projects received less than $500,000 worth of ARB tokens, which needed to be improved to incentivize liquidity across a large user base.\n\nWith the speculation surrounding the ARB airdrop subsiding, the growing number of new wallets implies increased organic engagement.\n\nDaily active users, transaction count, and on-chain value have all settled at levels higher than pre-airdrop figures.\n\nThe upward trends in gas fee expenditure and the establishment of new wallets further signify the growing utilization of the network.'}, {'id': 3, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vZGFpbHljb2luLmNvbS9ldm0tY2hhaW5zLXdoYXQtaXMtZXRoZXJldW0tdmlydHVhbC1tYWNoaW5lL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Sun, 20 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'EVM Chains: What Is the Ethereum Virtual Machine? - DailyCoin', 'content': 'EVM Chains are the bread and butter of the crypto space. In select cryptocurrency camps, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is considered a non-negotiable feature that emerging blockchains need to support to stay relevant and attract users.\n\nIf you sort the industry’s blockchains by TVL (Total Value Locked), 9 of the top 10 networks are EVM-compatible, with Solana (SOL) being the only exception to the rule.\n\nWhat exactly is the Ethereum Virtual Machine, and why is it so important?\n\nWhat Is the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)?\n\nThe Ethereum Virtual Machine is a software environment that executes code and contracts on EVM networks. An easier way to think of it is to imagine a computer’s operating system. Regardless of whether you use an HP or Lenovo laptop, it’s easy to jump between the two because you’re ultimately communicating with the device through a Windows operating system.\n\nLet’s apply this concept to the world of blockchain technology. The Ethereum Virtual Machine means that whether you’re using Ethereum (ETH) or Polygon (MATIC), things look and feel more or less the same. For example, you don’t need to memorize the Arbitrum (ARB) whitepaper to use crypto wallets like MetaMask or a dex like Uniswap on the Arbitrum network.\n\nIf you’re confident using one EVM Chain, you’re confident using all of them.\n\nHow Does the Ethereum Virtual Machine Work?\n\nWhen you look closely at the EVM, you’ll find a complex system that runs tasks consistently. The Ethereum Virtual Machine is deterministic, meaning if you give it a specific task, it will always give the same result, no matter where it’s done or who does it.\n\nThis deterministic nature is crucial for the consensus mechanism of the EVM-based networks, ensuring all nodes harmoniously agree on the state of the blockchain.\n\nThe EVM operates on a unique set of instructions, allowing for the creation, deployment, and execution of smart contracts. These contracts, written primarily in a programming language called Solidity, are then compiled into bytecode. This bytecode is what the EVM reads, interprets, and executes.\n\nWhen you initiate a smart contract transaction, the EVM springs into action. It processes the transaction, calculates the necessary gas fees, and updates the blockchain’s state.\n\nAnother intriguing facet of the EVM is its Turing completeness, meaning it can perform any calculation that any other programmable computer can, provided it’s given enough time and memory.\n\nHow does this benefit the Ethereum blockchain? Well, it means that the EVM can execute any algorithm or program, granting Ethereum its iconic flexibility. This versatility helps developers create innovative smart contracts and Web 3 dApps (decentralized applications) on the Ethereum mainnet and other EVM chains.\n\nWhy Is EVM Compatibility so Important?\n\nIn an industry fraught with interoperability issues and complex bridging processes, EVM chains help to smooth the onboarding process and give users a sense of trust and familiarity with new networks.\n\nEVM compatibility means that a blockchain can run the EVM and execute Ethereum smart contracts. This makes it easy for blockchain developers to port over existing contracts and ERC-20 tokens to a cross-chain environment and deploy crucial dApps, like decentralized exchanges or NFT marketplaces.\n\nWith the rise of multiple blockchains, each with its unique strengths like faster transactions and lower transaction fees, the ability to communicate and interact between them is of paramount importance. EVM-compatible blockchains integrate more easily than non-EVM chains, enabling assets and data to flow between different chains.\n\nOn top of that, operating an EVM helps emerging chains leverage Ethereum’s existing tools and infrastructure. Being a pioneer in the smart contract space, Ethereum has a rich ecosystem of DApps. EVM compatibility allows other blockchains to tap into this established ecosystem, benefiting from tried-and-tested tools and services without reinventing the wheel.\n\nLooking at competing Layer-1 blockchains that don’t naturally support EVM compatibility, like Cardano (ADA), we see first-hand how difficult it is to onboard new users, especially in DeFi.\n\nDespite Cardano having powerful tech in its own right, the network struggles to attract a user base as large as EVM chains like the BSC, Polygon, and Arbitrum. Cardano developers need to be proficient in the network’s dedicated programming language, Haskell, while all EVM chains use the same languages, like Solidity and Vyper.\n\nWhat’s the Difference Between EVM-Equivalence and EVM-Compatibility?\n\nJust when you thought you’d understood everything, there’s another layer of definitions. In today’s rapidly evolving industry, some blockchain ecosystems insist that simply being EVM-compatible is no longer enough. Teams like Polygon aim for EVM equivalence within the Polygon Proof-of-Stake sidechain and zkEVM.\n\nIs there any difference between compatibility and equivalence?\n\nEVM-Compatibility\n\nEVM-Compatibility represents a blockchain’s ability to run the EVM and execute Ethereum-based smart contracts. An EVM-compatible blockchain can seamlessly integrate with Ethereum’s tools, protocols, and standards.\n\nDevelopers can deploy the same smart contracts across multiple EVM-compatible blockchains without major code modifications.\n\nEVM-Equivalence\n\nOn the other hand, EVM-Equivalence is a more profound alignment with the Ethereum ecosystem. An EVM-equivalent blockchain not only supports Ethereum’s smart contracts but also mirrors Ethereum’s state, account structures, and consensus mechanisms.\n\nIt’s like a twin of the Ethereum network, sharing its DNA but existing as a separate entity. EVM-equivalent blockchains can synchronize with Ethereum’s state and offer a near-identical environment for dApps and contracts.\n\nWhile EVM-Compatibility offers a bridge to the Ethereum ecosystem, allowing for smooth functionality and integration, EVM-Equivalence is like walking in Ethereum’s shoes, mirroring its every step.\n\nExamples Of EVM-Compatible Blockchains\n\nNow that we better understand what EVM Chains are let’s dive into a quick list of the top EVM-compatible blockchains in the crypto industry.\n\nBinance Smart Chain (BSC) – With more daily users than any other network, BNB Chain is easily the most popular EVM chain. It introduced thousands of people to DeFi for the first time and was the first major low-cost alternative to Ethereum.\n\n– With more daily users than any other network, BNB Chain is easily the most popular EVM chain.

The Fantom network is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) designed for scalability. Celo (CELO) – Originally designed as a simple payment network, Celo has blossomed into a fully-fledged and functional EVM chain with plenty of dApps and tools for the budding DeFi enthusiast.\n\nEVM Chain Pros and Cons\n\nAfter the invention of Bitcoin (BTC) itself, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is arguably the biggest revolution in the blockchain landscape, serving as the backbone for a myriad of decentralized applications and platforms. Of course, it’s not without its faults.\n\nPros\n\nInteroperability – EVM-compatible chains can seamlessly interact with Ethereum-based code, allowing for smooth data and asset transfers between blockchains.\n\n– EVM-compatible chains can seamlessly interact with Ethereum-based code, allowing for smooth data and asset transfers between blockchains.

Without being EVM-compatible, the barriers to entry are too inconvenient.\n\nAs we can see, Cardano is a Top 10 cryptocurrency by market cap, but it has far fewer DeFi applications and TVL statistics than relatively unknown EVM-chains like Kava and Pulsechain.\n\nFAQs'}].

According to the Arkham Intelligence dashboard , this wallet belonged to the co-founder of Ethereum.\n\nThere are also $84,000 worth of USD Coin (USDC) and $58,000 worth of Wrapped Ethereum (WETH) in the wallet.\n\nButerin has previously transferred assets to a cryptocurrency exchange as he sent 200 ETH to Kraken in March. Buterin also sold a number of unwanted altcoins (sh*tcoins) for 439.25 ETH.\n\nButerin’s Transaction Coincides with Crypto Market’s Recent Decline\n\nButerin’s move followed last week’s (August 17) flash fall in the cryptocurrency market, when the price of ETH dropped below $1700 for the first time since June and it’s still trading below that threshold.\n\nData from the blockchain analysis company Glassnode show that Ethereum owners fiercely hold their positions even as they quickly transfer assets among cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nThe data aggregator reports that 14.88 million ETH are currently held on exchanges, a figure not seen since 2018.\n\nExchange outflows are typically interpreted as a positive sign that the asset is being retained for the long term.\n\n“Ethereum’s Transitions Vital For Success” – Buterin\n\nIn June, Buterin explained that the Ethereum blockchain “fails” outright in the absence of an adequate scaling infrastructure to lower transaction costs.\n\n“Ethereum fails because each transaction costs $3.75 ($82.48 if we have another bull run) and every product aiming for the mass market inevitably forgets about the chain and adopts centralized workarounds for everything,” he claimed .\n\nButerin then said that smart contract wallets represent another area of failure.\n\nHe explained that switching to smart contract wallets had certain drawbacks because managing several addresses at once presents challenges from the user experience perspective.\n\nTo effectively shift into an on-chain world with zero-knowledge rollups, Buterin said that wallets would need to secure data in addition to cryptographic assets.\n\n“In a ZK world, this is no longer true: the wallet is not just protecting authentication credentials, it’s also holding your data,” he added .\n\nFor the third and final shift, privacy, new identification, reputation, and social recovery mechanisms will be required.\n\nWithout the third shift, he claimed , “Ethereum fails because making all transactions (and POAPs, etc.) publicly visible for anyone to see is far too high a privacy sacrifice for many users and everyone moves onto centralized solutions that at least somewhat hide your data.”\n\nEthereum’s co-founder proposed using stealth addresses to alleviate this problem.\n\nA Turning Point for ETH\n\nEthereum is at a turning moment because the chart structure is so fragile. ETH price is expected to drop sharply if it brokes through the $1,600–$1,550 level.\n\nThe monthly average of Ethereum ($ETH) addresses that are currently active is lower than the annual average, indicating little on-chain activity.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap , at the time of writing, ETH was trading at $1,667.56, that represents a 0.36% fall over the last 24 hours.'}, {'id': 7, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvaW5kZXNrLmNvbS92aWRlby93aHktZGlkLWV0aGVyZXVtLWNvLWZvdW5kZXItdml0YWxpay1idXRlcmluLXNlbmQtZG9sbGFyMW0td29ydGgtb2YtZXRoZXItdG8tY29pbmJhc2Uv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Mon, 21 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Why Did Ethereum Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin Send $1M Worth of Ether to Coinbase? - CoinDesk', 'content': "Vital has moved some Ethereum about a $1 million worth Ethereum to coin base. What does this mean? Well, might indicate that he's willing to sell a little bit. He moved about 600 to coin base over the weekend. Vitals, public addresses for his Ethereum holdings are out there. Most people know where they are. They're visible on most uh either scans or like Blockchain explorers out there. And for good reason, right? He's probably the most central figure head in all crypto because he's uh the front man or the image of Ethereum ecosystem, which is the largest smart contract ecosystem and the second largest coin by market cap behind Bitcoin. So when people see vital or anyone else moving money uh with that big of a name out there, they start paying attention. Of course, we don't know if he sold this Ethereum and we also don't know the reasons behind it. Maybe he just wanted to get some more cushion for uh his US D bank account. Who knows Zach? I'll throw this one up to you. I don't look at this story and be like, oh, this is like a, a big ominous bad dark cloud story. I just think our boy is, you know, he's traveling all over around the world, he needs some money. Hey, man, I'm with you. I think big picture like this is the funny thing about crypto, right? You get to watch this stuff happen, you just get to see it. You're like, oh we know that this is a wallet associative of tal and you know, he chose to keep that in the public domain essentially. And now we can sort of see the the flows of money across uh the world into these exchange addresses, right? So it is just kind of a funny feature of crypto and I never, it never, it never gets dull to me that we can have these conversations based on, on chain activity and unchain activity alone, right? We don't know his intent. We don't know why we don't know what's, what's happening. We just know that we can watch this thing move from point A to point B and deduce, maybe that there's something uh animating that, right? And I think that's a really funny feature of crypto that we can talk about these things. Um without any other knowledge, aside from the fact that we just know one wallet interacted with another, and therefore we know this one happens to be vital and we can speculate on whatever the million dollars is gonna be for if it's for, you know, I don't know, getting more travel luggage. So he can go to different places around the world or not. But, yeah, I don't know. There's not much to say here. I don't know, is gonna, like, change people's price project like projections for Ethereum. Right? Or if it change, I don't think this indicates that like, vital is any less bullish on his creation. But it is just kind of a funny thing. Um, least blotter section of like Ethereum Daily News that you can, uh, I don't know, read with your morning coffee. Well, I say really quick before I hand it over to Wendy. Uh, the funny part about this is the Ethereum Foundation, which of course is a steward of a lot that happens in Ethereum does sell the top almost every single cycle. They have like successfully sold the top on Eth and they put that money back into the Treasury to support grants for Ethereum ecosystem. So it ends up, I think being a net positive. But a lot of people look at when the Ethereum Foundation sells and then sort of make a note about that. And this one, people, obviously not at the top. We're down about, you know, 50 plus percent from the top in 2021 2022. But people might be looking at this and be like, oh, maybe we're looking at like another lower point in the future. If Italic is selling Wendy, it's a one, it's one, literally $1 million. It's really not a lot of money, especially when you're looking at Crypto Whale Wall. It's like there's so many people that are moving around a lot more capital that are loaning it out doing things. I also want to reference a story from coin desk back in March or excuse me, May 17th of 2021 vital 6 billion in ship token says he doesn't want the power so vital has kind of been infamous of doing different things with his funds and wallets that have been tracked. So I don't think it's necessarily a big deal that he moved 1 million of worth to coin base. I think if it was going to be a very, very large amount, it probably would be done. OTC. Um but maybe he just wanted the, hey, maybe he wanted to bridge the funds over to base or to um friend who knows, who knows? Yeah, Wendy, this isn't the first time Vital has sold either. So I don't think this is gonna like do anything to the markets, but I wanted to ask all of you a question based on what said, what do we think if, if vital does cash out a million dollars here, what do we think he's gonna buy? What luxury luggage does vital buy. I love his luggage post. That's one of the better blogs out there is how vital lives out of a 40 liter backpack and here's how he does it. That one is a good piece of content. A lot of 40 liter backpacks. If we're talking a million dollars, I don't think it's that hungry. Maybe he's hungry. He gotta buy snacks. A lot of backpack. All right. Don't know. Don't know."}]. Provide a brief report to analyze the news and estimate the market trend accordingly.

Based on the news articles provided, there are several key points to consider for analyzing the market trend for Ethereum (ETH):

1. Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, transferred $1 million worth of ETH to Coinbase. This transfer has raised speculation about potential selling pressure on Ethereum, especially considering the recent market downturn.

2. Ethereum Layer 2 throughput has hit a record high, indicating increased activity across Layer 2 networks. This could potentially lead to improved scalability and transaction speeds for Ethereum, which may positively impact its market performance.

3. Ethereum price is facing technical corrections and struggling to recover above key resistance levels. The price movement is currently below the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average, indicating a bearish trend in the short term.

4. The Ethereum Foundation has a history of selling ETH at strategic points in the market cycle to support grants for the Ethereum ecosystem. Vitalik Buterin's recent transfer may not have a significant impact on the market, considering it is a relatively small amount compared to other market participants.

Overall, the market trend for Ethereum appears to be influenced by a combination of factors, including on-chain activity, technical analysis, and key player actions. The recent market downturn and potential selling pressure from Vitalik Buterin's transfer may lead to short

Reflection on recent trading performance:

The recent trading performance has been mostly successful, with two out of three trades resulting in positive daily returns. The effective strategies that led to successful outcomes include closely monitoring on-chain indicators and news catalysts to identify bullish trends in the market. By taking bold actions and buying more ETH with a significant portion of cash, I was able to capitalize on the positive momentum and maximize profit potential.

However, the last trade resulted in a loss of profit, which could be attributed to the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market. Despite the bullish trend, market fluctuations can lead to unexpected outcomes. In this case, the more aggressive trading approach of allocating 70% cash to buy more ETH may have exposed the portfolio to higher risk.

Start your response with your brief reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

Diving deep into the charts, renowned crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen has surfaced with a noteworthy insight that raises concerns for the altcoin giant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe crux of the matter lies in ETH's breach of the dynamic support line, signified by the Bull Market Support Band indicator. This echoes a pattern last witnessed over four years ago. Back then, Ethereum suffered a pivotal level loss, paving the way for a tumultuous six-month journey where its value plummeted by a staggering 48%, only finding reprieve by the close of December 2019.\n\nIn 2019, #ETH fell below its Bull Market Support Band in July/August, just as it has in 2023. pic.twitter.com/36v6BEDch1 — Benjamin Cowen (@intocryptoverse) August 22, 2023\n\nWith history appearing to echo itself, the stakes are high for ETH's journey through the remainder of this year and the advent of 2024. An unsettling projection arises from Cowen's analysis, spotlighting the potential for Ethereum to slide toward the $900 mark per token.\n\nConvergence of perspectives\n\nNotably, Cowen is not the sole voice predicting such an outcome. Just a day prior, crypto analyst Ali Martinez , renowned in his own right, also foresaw a comparable fate for Ethereum based on meticulous technical analysis. Martinez articulated that Ethereum's fall beneath the $1,600-$1,550 range could lay the groundwork for a substantial correction ranging from 37% to 45%, ultimately targeting the $1,000 mark.\n\nAs the situation continues to evolve, it is increasingly evident that dark clouds are amassing over Ethereum, casting a shadow of uncertainty not only on the altcoin itself but also on the broader crypto market."}, {'id': 1, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NidGMuY29tL2FuYWx5c2lzL2V0aC9ldGhlcmV1bS1wcmljZS1zZWxsaW5nLWludGVyZXN0LTE3MDAv0gFOaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmV3c2J0Yy5jb20vYW5hbHlzaXMvZXRoL2V0aGVyZXVtLXByaWNlLXNlbGxpbmctaW50ZXJlc3QtMTcwMC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Tue, 22 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Ethereum Price Key Indicators Suggest Rising Selling Interest Below $1,700 - NewsBTC', 'content': 'Ethereum price is struggling to recover above the $1,700 resistance against the US Dollar.

This was the case as the blockchain’s monthly average active addresses dropped.\n\nThe monthly average of active ETH addresses stood lower than the yearly average. This clearly indicated low activity, which could be taken as a bearish signal. While the blockchain’s network activity declined, its price also failed to shoot up.\n\nIs Ethereum’s reluctance to push its price up a consequence of less network activity?\n\nRead Ethereum’s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nThe reason for ETH’s price drop\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, ETH was down by more than 9% in the last seven days, reflecting its sluggish behavior. At the time of writing, it was trading at $1,670.05 with a market capitalization of over $200 billion.\n\nThe price drop had a major impact on investors’ portfolios. As per Glassnode Alerts’ tweet, the number of ETH addresses in loss reached a seven-month high of 42,602,870.333.\n\nHowever, upon taking a closer look, the reason behind the downtrend might not have been less network activity. This was because while ETH’s active addresses dropped, Layer-2s like Base, Optimism [OP], and rollups gained popularity.\n\nThe primary reason behind market participants shifting to L2s was that they offered more scalability. For reference, Coinbase’s L2 Base bridged $251 million, with ETH accounting for $155 million out of the total within days of launch.\n\nA closer look at Ethereum’s state\n\nA look at Ethereum’s on-chain performance gave a better understanding of what was going on in the ecosystem. Upon checking, it was revealed that investors in funds and trusts, including Grayscale, have relatively weak buying sentiment.\n\nAdditionally, as per CryptoQuant, ETH’s net deposit on exchanges was high compared to the seven-day average, suggesting high selling pressure. However, it was interesting to see that when ETH fell victim to the latest price correction, investors took it as an opportunity to increase accumulation.\n\nThis was evident from Glassnode Alerts’ tweet, which pointed out that Ethereum’s exchange outflow volume reached a one-month high during that period.\n\n? #Ethereum $ETH Exchange Outflow Volume (7d MA) just reached a 1-month high of 9,627.006 ETH Previous 1-month high of 9,608.990 ETH was observed on 20 August 2023 View metric:https://t.co/LzFffVHu6i pic.twitter.com/dhJIEP4CZO — glassnode alerts (@glassnodealerts) August 21, 2023\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today\n\nNot only metrics, but a few market indicators were also bearish. For example, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) displayed a bullish edge in the market.\n\nFurthermore, ETH’s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) also registered a downtick, increasing the chances of a price decline. Nonetheless, the Money Flow Index (MFI) rebounded from the oversold zone, which can help the token increase its price.'}, {'id': 6, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy92aWRlb3MvMjAyMy0wOC0yMi9ob3ctYnVzaW5lc3Nlcy1zaG91bGQtdXNlLWV0aGVyZXVtLXZpZGVv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Tue, 22 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "How EY's Brody Thinks Businesses Should Use Ethereum - Bloomberg", 'content': "00:00\n\nPaul, I want to first get your take on the FCC case, maybe not as as a judge, but just as someone who watches crypto.

And I think if you look at the draft legislation that's coming from Congress, it's very, very reasonable.

We're really starting to see the difference between Bitcoin, which is a kind of digital gold, and people want to see it as potentially an inflation hedge or a global asset versus Etherium, which is becoming a global computing infrastructure. And so by having ETF for the two separate ones and specifically having Etherium ETFs, you can start to sort of take a stake in the Etherium ecosystem in the cash flow of transactions, in the value of the overall asset infrastructure that's being built there. And for people to see these two properly as separate. I think it's really important for the development of the overall marketplace. Okay. So on the subject of Etherium, you are a somewhat expert on the subject. You actually just wrote a book that was released earlier this summer, Etherium for business. It's called A Plain English Guide to How to use cases that generate returns from asset as asset management to payments to supply chains. Paul How should businesses be thinking about using this technology? So we have a very simple thing at UI, which is that we believe blockchains are going to be the glue that tie business ecosystems together. And even though everyone tends to focus on finance and DEFI and SEC rulings, in fact, Etherium is an incredible infrastructure for tokenizing assets tracking supply chains. If we look at the kind of things that we talk, I talk about in the book and that we're doing it why they are tokenizing carbon offsets, tokenizing carbon traceability, tracking pharmaceuticals, managing procurement agreements. Right. There's a tremendous amount of operational business stuff, none of which is finance related, but is essential for how companies interact with each other. And Etherium provides a neutral, decentralized infrastructure in which enterprises can transact with each other on a level equal terms. On the subject of things being level, is this a zero sum game, Paul? Are we going to head into a world where one chain actually is dominant? Etherium Perhaps. So I do believe that. I think if you look historically at the world of computing infrastructure, we like standards, right? Basically, a single operating system represents 90% of all PCs. Two operating systems represent more than 95% of all phones. We like standard standard scale really well. So I think we are headed for a global infrastructure where Etherium is the global base layer standard for digital business transactions in the same way that TCP IP is a global network standard and that others over time will gradually wither away. Just like 20 or 30 years ago, we used to have an alphabet soup of different networking standards and now we just have TCP IP. That reminds me that I love the metric system.

If we look at kind of our volume of work and deals, we're up in every sector and we're up in every geography. But the places that are growing the fastest by by far in terms of our blockchain and core crypto work are Europe in preparation for the MICA Assets law and Hong Kong, which is growing rapidly at us as China tries to reopen, and then obviously Dubai in the Middle East where the regulatory environment is maturing very quickly.

NEWS ANALYST REPORT: Based on the news articles provided, there are mixed signals regarding the Ethereum (ETH) market trend:

1. U.Today article suggests that Ethereum is teetering on the edge of a scenario reminiscent of 2019, with the potential for a slide towards the $900 mark per token. Renowned analysts like Benjamin Cowen and Ali Martinez are predicting a substantial correction ranging from 37% to 45%, targeting the $1,000 mark. This indicates a bearish sentiment in the market.

2. NewsBTC article highlights that Ethereum is struggling to recover above the $1,700 resistance level and is trading below the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The article suggests that if Ethereum fails to clear the $1,700 resistance, it could start another decline. This also points towards a bearish outlook for Ethereum.

3. AMBCrypto News article discusses the decline in Ethereum's network activity and the impact on its price. The article mentions that the number of wallets in loss reached a seven-month high, indicating selling interest in Ethereum. However, it also mentions that investors took the price correction as an opportunity to increase accumulation, which could potentially support the price.

4. Bloomberg article features insights from EY's Paul Brody on how businesses should use Ethereum. Bro

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: In reviewing my recent trading performance, it is evident that my most successful outcomes were driven by a combination of on-chain analysis and news catalysts that pointed towards a bullish market trend for Ethereum (ETH). These successful trades were characterized by bold buying decisions with a significant allocation of cash, which allowed me to capitalize on the potential price appreciation of ETH.

On the other hand, my less successful trades were influenced by factors such as technical corrections and potential market influencers highlighted in the news analyst reports. These trades resulted in a loss of profit due to a more conservative approach in allocating cash for buying ETH.

Key trends and indicators in the current cryptocurrency market that are likely to influence future trades include on-chain signals like the short-long moving average, MACD, and Bollinger Bands, which all indicate a buy or hold position for ETH. Additionally, news catalysts such as ongoing developments, community engagement, and potential growth opportunities for ETH are important factors to consider when making trading decisions.

In terms of trading approach, a more aggressive strategy seems to have yielded better results in the current bullish market trend for ETH. By taking bold buying decisions with a higher allocation of cash, I was able to maximize profit potential. However, it is important to remain cautious of potential market influencers and technical corrections that could

Start your response with your brief reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

Given the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the market trend for ETH is currently bullish, with indicators pointing towards a positive outlook for buyers. The news analyst report also suggests a bearish sentiment in the market, but the overall trend seems to lean towards a bullish direction.

Considering the successful outcomes driven by bold buying decisions in the past, I believe it is wise to take advantage of the current bullish trend and make a buying decision to maximize profit potential. Therefore, I will make a bold buying decision with a significant allocation of cash to capitalize on the potential price appreciation of ETH.

Optimistic rollups are “optimistic” in nature as they assume transactions are valid until proven otherwise.\n\nMost rollups today only have one single sequencer, meaning there is a centralization risk, Anurag Arjun, co-founder of modular blockchain Avail, told Blockworks.\n\nThis is not a major problem at present, as rollup solutions must put the raw transaction data on Ethereum using something called calldata — the cheapest form of storage on Ethereum today, as Arjun notes.\n\nOnce a calldata is submitted to Ethereum mainnet, anyone can challenge whether or not it is accurate within a set period of time, according to Neel Somani, the founder of blockchain scaling solution Eclipse.\n\nIf no one challenges the validity of the rollup, it will be accepted on Ethereum once the period of time is up.\n\nThe problem, Somani notes, is how someone can then prove that a transaction was executed inaccurately if they don’t have the data.\n\n“If I don’t tell you what I executed, there’s no way for you to possibly prove that it is wrong, so you need to know exactly what I executed in order to fix that,” Somani said. “So all blockchains must prove data availability in some way, shape or form.”\n\nData availability sampling\n\nAs all blockchains must prove data availability, it can be inefficient to download a full block onto a network, which again invokes the initial data availability problem.\n\n“So as someone who doesn’t want to download the full block, I still want the confidence that the information on the block is not being withheld,” Somani said.\n\nThe solution, according to Somani, is the use of data availability sampling to gain confidence that the block is actually there.\n\nData availability sampling involves sampling random parts of the block to obtain arbitrarily high confidence that the block is there, Somani explains.\n\nThis technology utilizes polynomials — a mathematical expression comprising variables, coefficients and exponentiation — to model relationships between variables in a block.\n\nA common misinterpretation of data availability sampling is that if you sample half the block, you only gain 50% confidence that the information in the block is accurate, Somani said. This isn’t true, he explains, because as with data availability sampling, users must make sure that they have enough points to recover the original polynomial.\n\nProjects like Celestia and Avail are currently building out data availability sampling solutions.\n\n“What we sincerely believe is that every base layer is going to be a data availability layer,” Arjun told Blockworks. “The main directional fight that we are having is wanting to scale data availability at the base layer, and have execution and roll up on the second layer.”\n\nDon’t miss the next big story – join our free daily newsletter.'}].

2. Farcaster To Migrate From Ethereum To Optimism Superchain: Farcaster, an Ethereum-based social media graph, plans to migrate onto Optimism, a leading Layer 2 network. This move is part of the growing trend of projects in the Ethereum ecosystem pivoting towards Layer 2 solutions for scalability and lower fees.

3. Bitstamp halts ETH staking in the United States: Crypto exchange Bitstamp will discontinue staking services for customers based in the United States, citing recent legal developments. This decision could impact the staking ecosystem for Ethereum in the US market.

4. Ethereum Price Grinds Lower As Bears Target Fresh Low Below $1,550: Ethereum price is facing hurdles below the $1

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: In my recent trading performance, I have found that making bold buying decisions with a significant allocation of cash has led to successful outcomes, as seen in the positive daily return of 0.02677904824191768. These decisions were based on the bullish trend indicated by on-chain analysis and positive momentum in the market. By capitalizing on these trends, I was able to maximize profit potential.

On the other hand, my more conservative buying decision with 40% cash allocation resulted in a negative daily return of -0.01886406044361566. This suggests that a more aggressive trading approach may be more effective in taking advantage of bullish trends in the cryptocurrency market.

Key trends and indicators in the current cryptocurrency market that are likely to influence future trades include on-chain analysis signaling a bullish trend, positive momentum in the market, and potential news catalysts impacting market sentiment. It is important to closely monitor these factors and make informed decisions based on the overall market outlook.

In conclusion, a more aggressive trading approach may be warranted in the current market conditions to capitalize on potential price appreciation and maximize profit potential. By leveraging on-chain analysis and market momentum, I can make more effective trading decisions and achieve successful outcomes in ETH cryptocurrency trading.

Start your response with your brief reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, the market trend for ETH is bullish and likely to continue upwards. The signals from the short-long moving average, MACD, and Bollinger Bands all indicate a buy or hold position, suggesting positive momentum and buyer control in the market. Additionally, the Bollinger Bands signal changing to buy and the MACD signal remaining at buy further support this bullish outlook.

However, the news analyst report highlights some potential factors that could influence the market trend, such as Vitalik Buterin's transfer of ETH to Coinbase and technical corrections facing Ethereum's price. Despite these factors, the overall sentiment from the on-chain analysis remains positive.

Provide a brief reflection on your recent trading performance with a focus on the effective strategies and information that led to the most successful outcomes, and the ineffective strategies and information that led to loss of profit. Identify key trends and indicators in the current cryptocurrency market that are likely to influence future trades. Also assess whether a more aggressive or conservative trading approach is warranted. 
*** REFLECTION ANALYST RESPONSE ***
In reviewing my recent trading performance, it is evident that my bold buying decisions with significant cash allocations have led to successful outcomes in the bullish market environment for ETH. These decisions were based on a combination of on-chain analysis indicating positive momentum and buyer control, as well as news reports suggesting potential price appreciation factors. These effective strategies have resulted in profitable trades and maximized profit potential.

However, there have been instances where my bold buying decisions have resulted in losses, as seen in the second trading action where the daily return was negative. This could be attributed to the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market and the potential risks associated with aggressive trading strategies.

Moving forward, key trends and indicators in the current cryptocurrency market that are likely to influence future trades include on-chain analysis signaling positive momentum, news reports on potential market-moving events, and technical analysis patterns such as ascending triangles. It is important to continue monitoring these factors to make informed trading decisions.

In terms of trading approach, a balance between aggressive and conservative strategies may be warranted depending on the market conditions. While bold buying decisions have led to successful outcomes in bullish trends, it is important to consider risk management and potential losses in volatile market environments. A more cautious and calculated approach may be beneficial to mitigate risks and maximize profits in uncertain market conditions.

These effective strategies have resulted in profitable trades and maximized profit potential.

However, there have been instances where my bold buying decisions have resulted in losses, as seen in the second trading action where the daily return was negative. This could be attributed to the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market and the potential risks associated with aggressive trading strategies.

Moving forward, key trends and indicators in the current cryptocurrency market that are likely to influence future trades include on-chain analysis signaling positive momentum, news reports on potential market-moving events, and technical analysis patterns such as ascending triangles. It is important to continue monitoring these factors to make informed trading decisions.

In terms of trading approach, a balance between aggressive and conservative strategies may be warranted depending on the market conditions. While bold buying decisions have led to successful outcomes in bullish trends, it is important to consider risk management and potential losses in volatile market environments. A more cautious and calculated approach may be beneficial to mitigate risks and maximize profits in uncertain market conditions.

Start your response with your brief reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, the market trend for ETH appears to be bullish with positive signals across various indicators. The consistent buy signals and overall upward trajectory suggest that buying ETH would be a profitable decision at this time.

Additionally, the news analyst report highlights the continued development and adoption within the Ethereum ecosystem, as well as the emergence of potential competitors like Solana, Avalanche, and Cardano. While these competitors pose a challenge, the news about PancakeSwap Version 3 going live on Ethereum Layer 2 Linea Mainnet indicates continued interest and investment in ETH.

Considering the positive signals from both the on-chain and news analyst reports, as well as the overall bullish trend in the market, I am confident in predicting a further price appreciation for ETH. Therefore, I will take a bold buying action with a value of -0.7 (buy with 70% cash) to maximize my profit potential.

Source: a video screenshot, Lex Fridman / YouTube\n\nEthereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin has said he is “definitely” worried about centralization risks following The Merge, the event when the current Ethereum Mainnet merges with the beacon chain proof-of-stake (PoS) system.\n\nThe Ethereum mastermind noted that Lido Finance, the largest provider of staking services for Ethereum, where around a third of staked ETH (stETH) has been deposited, could theoretically disturb the Ethereum network post-Merge.\n\n“But I also think it’s important to not overly catastrophize the issue,” he added.\n\n“First of all, if you have a third [of staked Ether deposits on the Beacon chain], you can’t revert the chain or whatever,” Buterin said in an interview with Fortune, adding:\n\n“But realistically, the worst that you could do is make finality stop happening for about a day or so, which is inconvenient, but it’s not that terrible.”\n\nButerin also mentioned that Lido does not act as a single entity but that “they have something like 21 delegates and nodes that are running these validators that are inside of Lido,” he said, claiming that “there’s a lot of good decentralization between them.”\n\nLido is the largest provider of staking services for Ethereum. Generally, users who want to become Ethereum 2.0 validators and earn rewards need to stake a minimum of ETH 32, which is a high price.\n\nHowever, Lido enables users to pool their ETH and participate in staking even if they don’t have the required ETH 32. The protocol distributes stETH tokens to users in return for their staked coins, which can be redeemed for ETH in the future or traded for other coins.\n\nThe Merge is Ethereum’s long-anticipated update expected to happen by the end of the year.\n\nThe upgrade has several benefits, Buterin said, noting that it makes Ethereum more environmentally friendly compared to the current proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism. According to last year’s estimate by a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, this upgrade can cut the energy used by the Ethereum network by at least 99.95%.\n\n“Also, proof of stake can increase the safety of the system. It makes it more expensive to attack,” Buterin told Fortune. “It makes it easier to recover from an attack, which is something people don’t think about.”\n\nAnother benefit is that PoS is more censorship-resistant. That is because, Buterin says, “miners are easier to detect and easier to shut down than just computers that are running validator nodes.”\n\nMeanwhile, at 10:33 UTC, ETH is trading at USD 1,156, up by 3% over the past 24 hours and down 4% over the past 7 days. The coin is also down by more than 76% compared to its all-time high of USD 4,878 recorded in November last year.\n\n____\n\nLearn more:\n\n– Dominant Staking Pool Lido Causing ‘Long Lasting’ Damage to Ethereum, But Aims to Improve\n\n– Ethereum’s Ropsten Test is ‘Almost’ Bug-Free, Two More Testnets to Go Before the Merge\n\n\n\n– Major Bitcoin & Crypto Companies Warn of ‘Extreme’ Risk in Proof-of-Stake Systems\n\n– The Compromises and Benefits of Ethereum Switching to a Proof-of-Stake Network\n\n\n\n– Contradictory Vitalik Buterin Says He Wants a More Bitcoin-like Ethereum\n\n– Top Blockchain Non-Financial Applications According to Vitalik Buterin\n\n\n\n– Ethereum Beacon Chain Experienced a 7-block Reorg, More Work Needed Ahead of The Merge\n\n– Ethereum’s Merge Could Lower Demand for Bitcoin but Regulatory & Technical Challenges Persist'}, {'id': 3, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd2F0Y2hlci5ndXJ1L25ld3MvaG93LWxvbmctd2lsbC1pdC10YWtlLWZvci1ldGhlcmV1bS10by1yZWFjaC01MDAw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Fri, 25 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'How Long Will it Take for Ethereum to Reach $5000? - Watcher Guru', 'content': 'How Long Will it Take for Ethereum to Reach $5,000?: Guide\n\n\u200dThe world of cryptocurrencies has been buzzing with excitement as Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, continues to make waves in the market.\n\nInvestors and enthusiasts alike are eagerly awaiting for Ethereum to reach its all-time high of $5000.\n\nIn this article, we will explore the factors that could contribute to Ethereum’s price surge and discuss how long it might take for ETH to reach this significant milestone.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum: Rising Shorts, Whale Interest Opens Bullish Speculation\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum and its Price Movements\n\nEthereum is a decentralized blockchain platform that enables developers to build and deploy smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps).\n\nUtilizing a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, is more energy-efficient than Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism.\n\nVarious factors, such as market demand, investor sentiment, technological advancements, regulatory changes, and overall market conditions, shape Ethereum’s price.\n\nIt is essential to consider these factors when trying to predict the future price movements of ETH.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin Moves 600 ETH to Coinbase; What’s the Motive?\n\nThe Recent Performance of Ethereum\n\nIn recent weeks, Ethereum has experienced a significant surge in price, surpassing several key resistance levels.\n\nThe price of ETH has risen steadily, reflecting the growing interest and confidence in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nSeveral factors contribute to Ethereum’s price rally: the generally positive crypto market sentiment, wider blockchain technology adoption, and the surging popularity of decentralized finance (DeFi) apps on Ethereum’s platform.\n\nThe potential for Ethereum to reach $5,000\n\nSource: Pixabay\n\nMany experts and analysts believe that Ethereum has the potential to reach $5000 in the future.

Debate continues on Ethereum’s classification.\n\nLegal clarity is vital to avoid regulatory uncertainty and to guide industry growth.\n\nEthereum’s journey from ICO to decentralization has shaped its status.\n\nImportance Of Determining Ethereum’s Legal Classification As A Security\n\nDetermining Ethereum’s legal classification as a security is considered to be an important regulatory decision that would impact the cryptocurrency space. The reason is because securities laws affect regulations with trading laws, issuance laws, and investment practices.\n\nThe Howey Test, referenced by the Securities and Exchange Commision (SEC), defines whether an asset is a security. The outcome of this decision will also influence investor protection, market stability, and innovation in the crypto space.\n\nBackground On Securities And How Securities Are Regulated Under US Law\n\nThe regulation of crypto-assets, particularly in relation to securities is a complex issue. In general, securities sold or traded in the U.S. must be registered, and the registration process involves providing essential facts about the company’s or cryptos properties, business, and the security itself.\n\nThe SEC’s role includes minimizing compliance while ensuring investor protection. These regulations are designed to provide investors with access to relevant information about investments before and after investing, and to prevent conflicts of interest in the securities industry.\n\nDefinition Of Securities\n\nSecurities are fungible and tradable financial instruments to raise capital in both the public and private markets. Securities can include notes, stocks, bonds, certificates of interest, collateral trust certificates, and more. These instruments then serve as a means for individuals and entities to invest, speculate, and manage risk within the financial markets.\n\nThe term “security” covers a broad range of investments, and its definition can vary based on jurisdiction and context. Securities play a pivotal role in capital markets, enabling companies and governments to access funding while offering investors opportunities for potential returns and income.\n\nWhat Is The Howey Test? Explanation Of The Howey Test\n\nThe SEC is a U.S. government oversight agency responsible for regulating the securities markets and safeguarding investors. The SEC’s jurisdiction extends to various aspects of financial markets, including investment banks, trading, financial dealings, product offerings, advertising, and fiduciary responsibilities.\n\nThe Howey Test is a legal framework used in the United States to determine whether a transaction qualifies as an investment contract and thus falls under securities regulations. The test originates from the landmark Supreme Court case SEC v. W.J. Howey Co in 1946.\n\nThe test consists of three main elements:\n\nAn investment of money,\n\nIn a common enterprise,\n\nWith an expectation of profits primarily from the efforts of others.\n\nIf these three elements are met, the transaction is considered a security, subject to the regulations set forth by SEC. The Howey Test serves as a fundamental guideline for classifying various financial arrangements and offerings in terms of whether they require compliance with securities laws and regulations, ensuring investor protection and transparency in financial markets.\n\nEthereum’s Characteristics And SEC’s Perspective On Ethereum\n\nEthereum is a decentralized blockchain platform known for its programmable smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). It enables developers to build and deploy decentralized applications on its network, offering features like transparency, immutability, and trustlessness. Ethereum’s native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), is used for transactions and to incentivize network participants.\n\nThe U.S. SEC has indicated that whether a particular cryptocurrency, like Ether, constitutes a security depends on its specific characteristics and how it is marketed and sold. The SEC has noted that if a cryptocurrency operates as a security , it falls under its regulatory jurisdiction, subject to applicable securities laws. The classification of cryptocurrencies like Ethereum is based on the Howey Test and other legal considerations to determine their status as securities or commodities, impacting their regulatory oversight and legal compliance.\n\nSEC’s Statements and Actions Regarding Cryptocurrencies And Tokens\n\nThe U.S. SEC has actively engaged with the evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies and tokens through its statements and actions. The SEC’s emphasis on investor protection and market integrity has led to a series of public statements clarifying its position on digital assets. It has consistently emphasized that whether a particular cryptocurrency or token qualifies as a security depends on the underlying facts and circumstances, with the Howey Test being a pivotal framework.\n\nOn July 25, 2017, the SEC released an investigative report addressing the treatment of digital assets, specifically tokens offered by “virtual” organizations through distributed ledger or blockchain technology. The report emphasized that these assets, often marketed as “Initial Coin Offerings” (ICOs) or “Token Sales,” could fall under the scope of federal securities laws. The SEC’s stance was whether an asset is a security depends on the factual and economic nature of the transaction rather than the terminology or technology employed.\n\nThe investigative report on the case of “The DAO,” a virtual organization that offered and sold tokens. The SEC concluded that these tokens were securities, thereby subject to federal securities laws. The report underscored that entities issuing securities via distributed ledger or blockchain technology must adhere to registration requirements, unless a valid exemption applies.\n\nAdditionally, unregistered offerings and securities exchanges facilitating trading in these securities could face liabilities.While the SEC is open to innovative technologies, its measured approach underscores the need to balance innovation with the protection of investors and the integrity of the markets.\n\nExamination Of SEC’s Stance On Ethereum’s Status As A Security\n\nThe position on whether Ethereum’s status is a security or not is not so well defined. While Ethereum initially launched through a token sale, the SEC’s perspective has evolved over time. Former Chairman Jay Clayton highlighted that as Ethereum decentralized and its network matured, it might not fit the traditional definition of a security subject to securities regulations.\n\nThe determination hinges on whether the sale of Ether, Ethereum’s native cryptocurrency, involved the investment of money in a common enterprise with an expectation of profits primarily from the efforts of others, the key elements of the Howey Test. The SEC’s cautious and nuanced approach reflects its commitment to balance innovation and investor protection in the rapidly evolving digital asset landscape.\n\nContrary to initial concerns, Gary Gensler, head of the SEC, reportedly indicated in 2018, that he also doesn’t view Ethereum as a security based on his interpretation of its historical issuance and network distribution. He referenced his earlier remarks from a 2018 lecture at MIT, where he emphasized that Ethereum was likely offered and sold as a security during its initial coin offering (ICO) phase.\n\nGensler’s statement aligns with the idea that the initial sale of a token could be considered a security offering, but over time, if the token’s network becomes sufficiently decentralized, it may no longer meet the criteria of a security. This view holds significance for Ethereum’s regulatory treatment and could impact how other cryptocurrencies are evaluated by the SEC.\n\nAnalysis Of Speeches, Regulations, And Enforcement Actions Relevant To Ethereum\n\nThe analysis of speeches, regulations, and enforcement actions relevant to Ethereum, offers insight into the SEC’s evolving stance. Various officials’ speeches have indicated the importance of evaluating the underlying characteristics of a cryptocurrency and its manner of distribution to determine its regulatory status. The issuance of guidance, the establishment of a framework, and subsequent statements by SEC officials have further clarified its position.\n\nConclusion\n\nDetermining Ethereum’s legal status as security is key for cryptocurrency regulation and market prices. The SEC’s approach using the Howey Test emphasizes investor protection, market stability, and innovation. While Bitcoin is often seen as a commodity, Ethereum’s classification remains debated.\n\nClarity is crucial to alleviate regulatory ambiguity, fostering industry growth. Understanding securities and the SEC’s role is essential; they govern investment instruments and ensure market fairness. Ethereum’s evolving journey from ICO issuance to a decentralized network shapes its status. Former and current SEC chairs, Clayton and Gensler, offer nuanced perspectives on the definition of Ethereum.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat is the significance of determining Ethereum’s legal classification?\n\nEthereum’s classification impacts its regulatory treatment, influencing trading, issuance, and investment practices in the cryptocurrency space.\n\nHow does the Howey Test affect cryptocurrency regulation?\n\nThe Howey Test helps determine if a transaction qualifies as an investment contract, potentially subjecting it to securities regulations for investor protection.\n\nWhat is the SEC’s role in regulating securities?\n\nThe SEC safeguards investors and maintains market fairness by overseeing securities markets, ensuring transparency, and preventing insider advantages.\n\nWhy is legal clarity important for cryptocurrencies like Ethereum?\n\nClear classification mitigates regulatory uncertainty, fostering industry development while balancing innovation and investor safeguarding in the digital asset landscape.'}].

You will start with 1 million dollars, half in cash and half in ETH. You are assisted by a few analysts below and need to decide the final action.

ON-CHAIN ANALYST REPORT: Based on the recent price and auxiliary information provided, it is evident that the market trend for ETH cryptocurrency is currently bullish. The short-long moving average signal, MACD signal, and Bollinger Bands signal all indicate a buy sentiment. The prices have been consistently increasing, with minor fluctuations, suggesting a positive momentum in the market.

However, it is important to note that the Bollinger Bands signal has shifted to a "hold" position in the last few trading sessions, indicating a potential consolidation or temporary pause in the upward trend. Traders and investors should closely monitor the price action and look for confirmation of a continued bullish trend before making any trading decisions.

Overall, the market trend for ETH cryptocurrency appears to be bullish, but caution is advised due to the recent shift in the Bollinger Bands signal.

NEWS ANALYST REPORT: Based on the news articles provided, it is evident that there are several key developments in the Ethereum (ETH) ecosystem that could impact the market trend:

1. ARK Invest and 21Shares have applied for two Ethereum futures exchange-traded funds, signaling growing interest in Ethereum investment products. This move could attract more institutional investors to the Ethereum market, potentially leading to increased demand for ETH.

2. Ethereum staking continues to rise, with a significant increase in the total staked ETH. This indicates a growing interest in staking and holding ETH, which could potentially reduce the circulating supply of ETH available for trading, leading to a potential price increase.

3. Vitalik Buterin has expressed concerns about centralization risks post-Merge, highlighting the importance of maintaining decentralization in the Ethereum network. This could impact investor sentiment and market confidence in Ethereum, potentially affecting the price of ETH.

4. The debate on whether Ethereum should be classified as a security under US law is ongoing, with implications for regulatory clarity and market stability. Clear classification could provide more certainty for investors and potentially impact the market trend for ETH.

Overall, the news articles suggest a mix of positive and potentially concerning developments for Ethereum, which could lead to increased volatility in the market. Institutional interest, staking growth,

Start your response with your brief reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

And after a whirlwind surge in 2023, prices are falling yet again.\n\nHowever, many cryptocurrencies have still proven to be incredibly lucrative long-term investments. For example, while the price of Ethereum (ETH 0.42%) has fallen by around 11% over the last month, it's still up more than 300% over the last three years -- and that's despite the brutal crypto winter throughout 2022.\n\nIf crypto prices rebound, we could see similar gains over time. And while past performance doesn't predict future returns, it can sometimes be encouraging to look at how much you could have earned if you'd invested years ago.\n\nHow far could Ethereum have taken you?\n\nEthereum is one of the biggest success stories to come out of the crypto market. Despite extreme volatility, it remains the second most popular name in the industry. It currently has a market cap of around $198 billion, making up around 20% of the entire crypto sector.\n\nWhile it certainly hasn't been immune to volatility, it's also fared better than many of its competitors. Its price is currently down by around 65% from its peak in late 2021, while Cardano has fallen by a staggering 87% in that time, and Solana has plummeted by around 91%.\n\nFor long-term investors who stuck it out through the rough patches, Ethereum has been a lucrative investment. Here's how much $100 of Ethereum would be worth today, depending on when you'd invested:\n\nDate Invested Ethereum Returns as of Today How Much $100 Would Be Worth Today Aug. 1, 2021 -30% $70 Aug. 1, 2020 333% $433 Aug. 1, 2019 671% $771\n\nThe short term can be rocky for crypto, and if you'd invested in late 2021 right before prices plummeted, your investment would have declined in value. But if you'd invested just four years ago and held through all the ups and downs, you'd have nearly 8 times your initial investment by today.\n\nIs Ethereum a good investment right now?\n\nAgain, past performance doesn't predict future returns. There are never any guarantees when investing, and this is especially true with crypto due to its speculative nature. No one can say, then, whether Ethereum will continue on its track of explosive long-term returns.\n\nThat said, Ethereum is one of the strongest players in the crypto space, and it has a slew of advantages. Its sheer size is one of them, as it's far and away the most popular network for decentralized applications -- such as NFT marketplaces, DeFi projects, and metaverse apps.\n\nEthereum's developers are also committed to consistently upgrading the blockchain to make it stronger and more useful. Last year, they successfully pulled off The Merge -- a landmark upgrade that moved Ethereum from the energy-intensive proof-of-work system to the far more efficient proof-of-stake model.\n\nThe Surge is one of the next eagerly awaited updates, and it aims to improve the network's speed and reduce transaction fees. These have long been two major pain points for Ethereum, and if developers are able to successfully pull off this update, it could be a game-changer.\n\nDownsides to consider before you buy\n\nWhile Ethereum has plenty of advantages, it won't be right for every portfolio.\n\nLike the crypto industry in general, Ethereum is still a speculative investment. Although it does have a fair amount of utility (especially compared to many of its competitors), its primary uses are also somewhat speculative right now. If NFTs, DeFi, or the metaverse become more mainstream, for instance, Ethereum could thrive. But if they never catch on, it could spell trouble.\n\nMuch of Ethereum's future success also hinges on its upcoming upgrades. If those updates take longer than expected to complete or there are significant hiccups during the rollouts, that could shake users' confidence -- and provide an opportunity for competitors to swoop in and grab market share.\n\nIn short, Ethereum is still speculative, but it's also one of the strongest investments in the crypto space right now. If you're willing to take on more risk for the chance to earn potentially lucrative returns over the long run, it may be a smart addition to your portfolio."}].

Based on the news articles provided, it is evident that there is a lot of focus on Ethereum (ETH) and its potential in the cryptocurrency market. 

1. Charles Hoskinson, the creator of Cardano, has made bold predictions that Cardano will overtake Bitcoin and Ethereum to become the largest cryptocurrency in the world. He highlighted Cardano's governance model and decentralization as key factors that could drive its growth.

2. There are concerns about centralization in Ethereum ownership, with the top 10 addresses controlling over 35% of the total ETH supply. This has sparked worries about how decentralized Ethereum truly is, despite its design to be fully decentralized.

3. Ethereum's price has been struggling amid these centralization concerns, with the token currently trading at around $1,600, down 11% in the past month. However, there are positive developments such as an increase in deposits for staking ETH 2.0, which could signal growth in the future.

4. Looking at historical data, investing $100 in Ethereum a few years ago could have yielded significant returns, with gains of up to 671% over the last three years. This demonstrates the potential for long-term growth in Ethereum despite short-term price fluctuations.

Start your response with your brief reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

With a circulating supply of 120,216,173 ETH coins and the max supply undisclosed, Ethereum presents promising returns for early adopters.\n\nGrowth Amidst Controversy\n\nIt’s worth noting that OnlyFans has witnessed remarkable growth in the past year. According to the Evening Standard, the platform reported a 17% increase in sales, settling at $1.1 billion, and an impressive jump of 21% in pre-tax profits, which stands at $525 million. Over 50 million new users, accompanied by 1 million fresh content creators, flocked to the platform, cumulatively spending $5.5 billion on the site.\n\nHowever, the firm hasn’t been without its challenges. A BBC News investigation last year uncovered incidents of underage individuals selling and appearing in videos on the platform, sparking safety concerns.

Maybe not so much.\n\nOver the weekend, Crypto Twitter zeroed in on a financial statement submitted by OnlyFans’ parent company Fenix International Limited to British authorities on Thursday. It showed that the company had owned over $19 million in Ether (ETH), Ethereum’s native token, but its value was slashed to about $11.4 million by the end of the reporting period in November 2022.\n\n“During this year, the group diversified part of its working capital into a cryptocurrency asset—ETH or Ethereum,” the company said in a strategic statement that opens the 48-page document. “There are no limitations or restrictions on the group\'s ability to sell the cryptocurrency assets. The asset has been impaired to its fair value at the year end."\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLast year, OnlyFans—infamous for the many adult performers hosted on the platform—made a splash in the crypto space by announcing that creators could use verified Ethereum NFTs in their profile images. Creators who did so received an Ethereum symbol to show their ownership of the asset.\n\nAt the time, OnlyFans’ CEO Amrapali Gan said the feature—similar to one introduced for Instagram and Facebook by Meta—aimed to "empower creators to own their full potential."\n\n"This feature is the first step in exploring the role that NFTs can play on our platform," Gan told Reuters.\n\nUnfortunately, the company could not have anticipated the crypto bear market lurking around the corner. At the time of the NFT announcement, ETH was trading at $2,797.43, but fell to $1,298.94 by November 30 when the reporting period ended. At the time of writing, ETH is trading at $1,645.90.\n\nImage: Coingecko\n\nLast year was a tumultuous one for cryptocurrency markets. It was marked by a cascade of failures including the collapse of Terra\'s UST stablecoin and governance token LUNA, the bankruptcy of crypto lender Celsius, and the implosion of cryptocurrency exchange FTX.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut apart from its ETH woes, OnlyFans enjoyed a positive 2022. According to the financial statement, the site saw the company\'s revenue shoot up to $5.6 billion from $4.8 billion in 2021.

He delivers high-quality engaging articles to Coinpedia through his in-depth research and analysis.\n\nIn the past week, Bitcoin has experienced significant price fluctuations within its consolidation range, influenced by various macroeconomic factors such as Jerome Powell’s address. As Bitcoin falls short of meeting the short-term bullish expectations of investors, capital is increasingly flowing into the altcoin sector. Looking ahead to the coming week, a substantial recovery rally in the altcoin market is anticipated, with Ethereum, Litecoin, and Shiba Inu potentially leading this rally.\n\nAltcoins On The Edge Of Recovery\n\nBitcoin’s price continues to flash volatility near $26K in response to Powell’s hawkish comments. This development is somewhat expected, considering the bearish trend Bitcoin had been exhibiting in the days leading up to the Jackson Hole symposium. Traders had been preparing for Powell’s ongoing moves on controlling the inflation to align with the central bank’s 2% target.\n\nAmid this, the prices of Ethereum, Litecoin, and Shiba Inu have been hovering near key support levels. With sellers unable to push prices further downward, a potential bounce-back from these support levels is anticipated for the coming week.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis\n\nEther’s price recently attempted to break above $1,700 but couldn’t maintain its position, indicating strong defense from the bears at this price point.\n\nThe declining moving averages and the RSI below the midline suggest that bearish momentum still dominates. Sellers are likely to aim for pushing the price into the $1,625 to $1,544 range. If successful, we could see a drop below the support channel, plunging the ETH price toward the $1,360 level.\n\nConversely, bulls aren’t leaving the field easily. They are expected to robustly defend the support zone and attempt to push the price above the 50-day EMA of $1,678. If they manage this, it would imply that the ETH price could continue to hover in a bullish range of $1,785-$1,863.\n\nLitecoin Price Analysis\n\nLitecoin has been trading within a narrow band of $60 to $67 over the last several days. While the bulls have managed to hold a decline below the $60 support level, they’ve been unable to push past the $67 resistance.\n\nAn extended consolidation often leads to a solid breakout momentum ahead, and LTC price might experience that soon. If bulls successfully break above the consolidation next week, LTC price could initially target the 200-day EMA at $77 before aiming for the more ambitious $85 mark, where significant bearish activity is expected.\n\nConversely, it’s crucial for the bulls to defend the $60 support level. Failure to do so could trigger the next downward phase, potentially driving the price to $47.\n\nShiba Inu Price Analysis\n\nThe extended wick on SHIB’s candle pattern indicates that bearish traders are still active, selling off during upward movements.\n\nIf the price falls below the immediate support level of $0.000008, it would imply that the bears are still in control. In such a scenario, SHIB’s price could decline to a low of $0.0000077. A further drop below this point could lead to a retest of the long-standing support at $0.00000705.\n\nOn the other hand, a surge above EMA50 will strengthen bullish positions, sending the meme coin toward $0.00001.'}].

Based on the news articles provided, it is evident that OnlyFans has made significant investments in Ethereum, with varying outcomes. While OnlyFans celebrated a milestone with revenues surpassing $1 billion and invested in Ethereum, the value of their Ethereum holdings decreased, leading to an impairment loss. Additionally, Ethereum's MVRV ratio has fallen below its 180-day SMA, indicating a potential further price decline. On the other hand, there are expectations of a recovery rally in the altcoin market, with Ethereum, Litecoin, and Shiba Inu potentially leading the way.

Reflection on recent trading performance:

Overall, my recent trading performance has been successful, with positive daily returns on my buying actions for ETH. The effective strategies that led to successful outcomes include relying on both on-chain and news analyst reports to make informed decisions, as well as taking bold buying actions when the market trend was bullish. These strategies allowed me to capitalize on the positive momentum in the market and maximize profit potential.

However, there were instances where my buying actions resulted in a loss of profit, despite the bullish market trend. This could be attributed to factors such as market volatility or unexpected developments that were not captured in the analyst reports. In these cases, a more conservative trading approach may have been more appropriate to mitigate potential losses.

You will start with 1 million dollars, half in cash and half in ETH. You are assisted by a few analysts below and need to decide the final action.

ON-CHAIN ANALYST REPORT: Based on the recent price and auxiliary information provided, it is evident that the market trend for ETH cryptocurrency is currently bullish. The short-long moving average signal, MACD signal, and Bollinger Bands signal all indicate a buy recommendation. The open prices have been fluctuating slightly but overall have been relatively stable. 

Therefore, it is likely that the price of ETH will continue to increase in the near future. Traders and investors may consider buying or holding onto their positions in anticipation of further price appreciation. However, it is important to monitor the market closely for any potential changes in the signals that may indicate a shift in the market trend.

NEWS ANALYST REPORT: Based on the news articles provided, it is evident that OnlyFans has made significant investments in Ethereum, with varying outcomes. While OnlyFans celebrated a milestone with revenues surpassing $1 billion and invested in Ethereum, the value of their Ethereum holdings decreased, leading to an impairment loss. Additionally, Ethereum's MVRV ratio has fallen below its 180-day SMA, indicating a potential further price decline. On the other hand, there are expectations of a recovery rally in the altcoin market, with Ethereum, Litecoin, and Shiba Inu potentially leading the way.

Overall, the market trend for Ethereum appears to be mixed, with potential downside risks due to the impairment loss and falling MVRV ratio. However, the anticipated recovery rally in the altcoin market could provide some support for Ethereum and other altcoins. Traders and investors should closely monitor market developments and price movements to make informed decisions.

Start your response with your brief reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

(Ethereum Price Analysis) - CryptoPotato', 'content': 'Following an unexpected and rapid drop from the $1.8K threshold, Ethereum’s price experienced a significant dip, falling below the critical 100-day and 200-day moving averages (MAs).\n\nThis development is considered a significant bearish sign for ETH. However, the price managed to find support within a crucial range, hinting at the possibility of an imminent consolidation phase.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nA close examination of the daily chart reveals that the price’s breach beneath the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, around $1,835 and $1,800 correspondingly, caused a marked downtrend that eventually landed Ethereum’s value within the pivotal support zone at $1.6K.\n\nIt’s important to note that the 200-day moving average holds substantial significance as an indicator of prevailing market trends. Traditionally, a bearish sentiment engulfs the market when the price remains below this MA.\n\nCurrently, the $1.6K support level has proven its resilience in upholding the price, indicating the potential for a recovery and subsequent pullback. However, the recent downtrend has shifted the market’s structure into a more bearish stance, thus enhancing the possibility of a retest of the $1,400 zone in the upcoming weeks.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nTurning attention to the 4-hour timeframe, it becomes evident that ETH lost the critical support point of $1.8K. This quick decline led the price to find support within the range of $1.5K, resulting in a temporary end of the prevailing downtrend.\n\nRemarkably, this support level has so far demonstrated its efficacy in maintaining the price, resulting in a period of sideways consolidation. As a consequence of this consolidation phase, Ethereum’s price movement has taken on the form of a roughly symmetrical triangle pattern. This technical pattern can develop into bullish and bearish signals depending on the direction in which the pattern’s breakout occurs.\n\nOn-chain Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nEthereum’s price trajectory currently remains in a state of uncertainty, displaying no clear inclination towards an upward or downward movement. Consequently, as the price chart offers limited insights into forthcoming market trends, delving into the futures market sentiment might provide valuable insights into Ethereum’s current state.\n\nThe following chart illustrates Ethereum’s funding rates, a pivotal point for identifying the dominance between long traders and short sellers. Positive values align with a bullish outlook, while negative values signify a bearish stance.\n\nNotably, an apparent pattern emerges from the data. Following a sudden impulsive decline, succeeded by a consolidation phase with stagnant price action, the funding rates undertook a downward trend, forming lower peaks on the chart. This unfolding scenario hints at a lack of interest in going long in the futures market, potentially paving the way for a bearish trajectory.\n\nNonetheless, despite the prevailing bearish sentiment, there remains the possibility of a minor corrective phase preceding a more pronounced downward trend. Should the funding rates assume a negative stance, this could elevate the likelihood of a cascade of short liquidations, potentially leading to a substantial bullish rebound that propels the price upwards.'}].

You are an experienced ETH cryptocurrency trader and you are trying to maximize your overall profit by trading ETH. In each day, you will make an action to buy or sell ETH. You will start with 1 million dollars, half in cash and half in ETH. You are assisted by a few analysts below and need to decide the final action.

ON-CHAIN ANALYST REPORT: Based on the recent price and auxiliary information provided, it is evident that the ETH cryptocurrency has been consistently showing positive signals. The short_long_ma_signal, macd_signal, and bollinger_bands_signal have all been indicating a buy trend. This suggests that the market trend for ETH is currently bullish.

The open prices have been fluctuating slightly, but overall, they have been relatively stable. This indicates that there is a strong level of support for ETH at the current price levels.

However, it is important to monitor the market closely for any changes in the signals or price movements that may indicate a shift in the trend. Overall, the current analysis suggests a positive outlook for ETH in the short term.

NEWS ANALYST REPORT: Based on the news articles provided, here is a brief analysis and estimation of the market trend for Ethereum (ETH) cryptocurrency trading:

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: In my recent trading performance, I have consistently made bold buying decisions based on bullish trends and positive signals from both on-chain and news analysts. This strategy has resulted in mixed outcomes, with some trades yielding positive returns and others resulting in losses. The effective strategies that led to successful outcomes include capitalizing on bullish trends and positive developments in the Ethereum ecosystem. However, the ineffective strategies that led to loss of profit include not fully considering potential downside risks and mixed sentiments in the market.

Key trends and indicators in the current cryptocurrency market that are likely to influence future trades include on-chain analysis signals, news developments in the Ethereum ecosystem, and overall market sentiment towards altcoins. It is important to closely monitor these factors and make informed decisions based on a combination of technical analysis and fundamental analysis.

In terms of trading approach, a more balanced and conservative strategy may be warranted in order to mitigate potential downside risks and maximize profit potential. It is important to carefully assess the overall market conditions and make calculated decisions based on a combination of bullish signals and potential risks. Additionally, diversifying the trading portfolio and considering a more long-term investment strategy may also be beneficial in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market.

Start your response with your brief reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

Robinhood’s trading model requires the company to back user balances at a 1:1 ratio in line with regulations set by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe four Ethereum addresses larger than Robinhood’s account include Ethereum’s beacon deposit contract, a wrapped Ether contract, and addresses belonging to major cryptocurrency exchanges Kraken and Binance.\n\nThe beacon deposit contract is by far the largest of those addresses.

The company’s earlier quarterly results indicated that it held $11.5 billion of assets related to user cryptocurrency safeguarding obligations on June 30.

Until the real move happens and people don’t get a chance to get into their positions. That’s why positioning is super important to do that in an early stage, which is when you start to take a look at price levels.\n\nWe’re 10 months prior to the Bitcoin halving. The period where sentiment is the lowest and altcoins are usually swimming around their cycle lows. Bitcoin dominance is peaking, and will not peak to that level anymore in this cycle. It happened in 2015, ten months prior to the halving. It happened in 2019, ten months prior to the halving. It happens in 2023, ten months prior to the halving.”\n\nAccording to the analyst, the Bitcoin dominance chart is flashing bullish for altcoins as the the 200-week moving average (MA) and the 200-week exponential moving average (EMA) are starting to act like resistance just like they did months before Bitcoin’s 2020 halving event.\n\n“A clear rejection at the 200-Week MA and EMA and looking to continue the fall, while altcoins are slowly picking up in their BTC pairs as a new cycle starts. While nobody expects it.”\n\nHe also says that several altcoin projects, like Ethereum and blockchain oracle Chainlink (LINK), have continued to develop during the bear market, setting the stage for massive rally events when the bull cycle takes off.\n\n“Are projects still developing and did something change on that perspective? Well. The good part is that many fraudulent projects are washed out of the markets, while the good ones are constantly building further. Ethereum has swapped towards PoS (proof-of-stake) and is getting Ethereum ETFs (exchange-traded funds) based on futures in a month maximum. Chainlink has developed CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol) and I’m not even mentioning all the other progress in DeFi (decentralized finance), NFTs (non-fungible tokens) and more.”\n\nEthereum is trading for $1,733 at time of writing, up 5.1% in the last 24 hours.

(2023 Guide) - Watcher Guru', 'content': 'Can you Make Money with Ethereum?: Guide\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies can be a lucrative venture, but it’s important to carefully consider the potential risks and rewards before making any financial decisions.\n\nWhen it comes to Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, many investors wonder if it’s worth putting their money into this digital asset.\n\nIn this article, we will explore the long-term investment potential of Ethereum and provide insights into how you can make real money with this cryptocurrency.\n\nAlso read: Worldcoin’s Surge Causes Optimism to Dethrone Arbitrum in Daily Transactions\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum and its Potential Ethereum is not just a cryptocurrency; it is a decentralized blockchain platform that enables the creation of smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps).\n\nSource: Forbes\n\nThis unique feature sets Ethereum apart from other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code.\n\nThey automatically execute when certain conditions are met, eliminating the need for intermediaries and making transactions more efficient and secure.\n\nThe potential use cases for Ethereum are vast and extend beyond simple peer-to-peer transactions.\n\nThe platform can be used for a wide range of applications. This includes decentralized finance (DeFi), supply chain management, gaming, and even social media.\n\nThe demand for Ethereum is expected to grow exponentially. Most likely due to more industries recognizing the benefits of blockchain technology and smart contracts.\n\nThe long-term investment potential of Ethereum\n\nWhen considering Ethereum as a long-term investment, it’s important to look at several factors that contribute to its potential growth:\n\nAdoption and Use Cases\n\nEthereum’s versatility and widespread adoption make it an attractive investment option. As the platform continues to grow, the demand for Ethereum and its native token, Ether (ETH), is likely to increase.\n\nEthereum’s ability to support a wide range of industries contributes to its long-term investment potential.\n\nThe Shift to Proof-of-Stake (PoS)\n\nEthereum is in the process of transitioning from the current proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a more energy-efficient and secure proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism.\n\nThis upgrade, known as Ethereum 2.0, aims to address the scalability and environmental concerns associated with PoW.\n\nBy staking Ethereum, individuals can participate in the network’s consensus mechanism and earn passive income by validating transactions. This transition is expected to drive demand for Ethereum as more individuals and institutions participate in staking activities.\n\nNetwork upgrades and improvements\n\nThe Ethereum network is constantly evolving, with regular upgrades and improvements being implemented to address scalability, security, and usability concerns.\n\nUpcoming upgrades, such as the London hard fork, aim to reduce transaction fees and improve the overall user experience.\n\nThese improvements contribute to the long-term sustainability and growth of the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nSource: CNN\n\nMarket dominance and liquidity\n\nAs the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Ethereum has established itself as a dominant player in the crypto market.\n\nThis market dominance translates to increased liquidity, making it easier for investors to buy and sell Ethereum tokens.\n\nHigher liquidity enhances the overall stability of the asset and provides investors with more opportunities to enter or exit positions.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin ‘Oversold’ For The 1st Time Since 2020\n\nHow to Make Real Money With Ethereum\n\nNext, let’s explore some strategies that can help you make real money with this cryptocurrency.\n\nBuy and hold (HODL)\n\nOne of the simplest and most popular strategies is to buy and hold cryptocurrencies for the long term.\n\nThis strategy, often referred to as “HODLing,” involves purchasing Ethereum tokens and holding onto them. You do this with the expectation that their value will appreciate over time.\n\nBy taking a long-term perspective, investors can potentially benefit from the overall growth of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nStaking Ethereum\n\nPeople can participate in Ethereum’s consensus mechanism and earn passive income by staking their Ethereum tokens.\n\nIn return, stakers receive rewards in the form of additional Ethereum tokens. The amount of passive income earned through staking depends on factors such as the amount of Ethereum staked and the overall network participation.\n\nParticipating in Decentralized Finance (DeFi)\n\nDecentralized finance, or DeFi, has gained significant attention in recent years, and Ethereum is at the forefront of this movement.\n\nDeFi platforms built on the Ethereum network offer a range of financial services. These include lending, borrowing, yield farming, and decentralized exchanges.\n\nAdditionally, by participating in DeFi protocols, individuals can earn interest on their Ethereum holdings, provide liquidity to earn fees or engage in arbitrage opportunities.\n\nHowever, it’s important to conduct thorough research and understand the risks associated with DeFi before participating.\n\nTrading Ethereum\n\nSource: Pixabay\n\nFor individuals with trading experience and a deep understanding of market dynamics, actively trading Ethereum can be a profitable endeavor.\n\nDay trading or swing trading Ethereum involves buying and selling the cryptocurrency within short time frames to take advantage of price fluctuations.\n\nFurthermore, this strategy requires careful analysis, technical skills, and risk management to be successful.\n\nIt’s important to note that trading cryptocurrencies can be highly volatile, and losses are possible.\n\nHow Much Can You Make with a $100 Investment in Ethereum?\n\nThe potential returns on a $100 investment in Ethereum depend on various factors, such as the entry point, market conditions, and the holding period.\n\nEthereum’s price has experienced significant volatility in the past, with periods of both rapid growth and sharp corrections.\n\nMoreover, it’s important to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results, and the cryptocurrency market remains highly unpredictable.\n\nHowever, a $100 investment made at a favorable entry point could potentially grow substantially over time.\n\nFor example, if an individual had invested $100 in Ethereum in early 2020 when the price was around $150, their investment would have grown to approximately $13,333 by mid-2021 when the price reached $2,000. This represents a significant return on investment.\n\nAdditionally, it’s worth noting that the cryptocurrency market is inherently risky, and investing in Ethereum or any other digital asset carries the potential for loss. It’s important to conduct thorough research, diversify your portfolio, and only invest funds that you can afford to lose.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, Ethereum presents a compelling long-term investment opportunity due to its versatile platform, potential for widespread adoption, and ongoing network improvements.\n\nInvesting in Ethereum requires careful consideration and an understanding of the associated risks.\n\nBy adopting strategies such as buying and holding, staking, participating in DeFi, or trading Ethereum, individuals can potentially make real money with this cryptocurrency.\n\nHowever, it’s crucial to approach the cryptocurrency market with caution, conduct thorough research, and make informed investment decisions based on your risk tolerance and financial goals.'}].

Start your response with your brief reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

Based on the recent price and auxiliary information provided, it can be observed that the short_long_ma_signal and macd_signal have consistently been indicating a buy signal. However, the macd_signal turned to sell when the price reached 1730.19. The bollinger_bands_signal has remained at hold throughout the period.

The market trend appears to be bullish overall, as indicated by the buy signals from the short_long_ma_signal and macd_signal. However, the recent sell signal from the macd_signal at 1730.19 may suggest a potential short-term correction or consolidation in the price.

It is important to monitor the price movement closely, especially in relation to the key resistance levels, to determine if the bullish trend will continue or if a reversal may occur. Traders and investors should consider setting stop-loss orders to manage risk and protect profits in case of a sudden price reversal.

This classification played a pivotal role in her decision to reject the case that Uniswap’s token sales are to be regulated under the exchange act.\n\nHowever, her statement does not serve as a definitive ruling on the legal status of Ethereum and Bitcoin in the U.S. legal system.\n\nThis latest judgment diverges from recent legal actions that have treated certain cryptocurrencies differently. Notably, a July ruling by a U.S. federal judge classified XRP as a security when sold to institutional investors, but not when sold to the general public or distributed to staff members.\n\nFollowing the ruling, SEC Chair Gary Gensler was left “disappointed,” with the agency planning to appeal the decision.\n\nThe disagreement between regulatory bodies adds another layer of complexity. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have been debating jurisdictional rights concerning cryptocurrencies.\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler\'s assertion that "everything other than Bitcoin" falls under the SEC\'s jurisdiction as securities, which clashes with the CFTC\'s claim that cryptocurrencies, including Ether, should be treated as commodities.\n\nThe uncertainty surrounding the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies has prompted lawmakers to introduce various bills in Congress aimed at bringing clarity to the issue.\n\nHowever, these bills propose differing solutions, including categorizing cryptocurrencies as securities or commodities, and determining the regulatory authority responsible for overseeing them.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmong these bills, the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act suggests a process for classifying cryptocurrencies.\n\nOn the other hand, the Digital Commodity Exchange Act proposes the registration and regulation of crypto spot exchanges under the CFTC.\n\nMeanwhile, the Digital Asset Market Structure Bill introduces the concept of SEC certification for cryptocurrencies, ensuring sufficient decentralization before granting commodity status.'}, {'id': 55, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9naWRkeS1zbWFydC13YWxsZXQtbGF1bmNoZXMtbXVsdGljaGFpbi0yMDAwMDAwNDYuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Thu, 31 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Giddy Smart Wallet Launches Multichain Support Beginning With Ethereum - Yahoo Finance', 'content': 'Salt Lake City, Utah --News Direct-- Giddy\n\nGiddy, the innovative self-custody crypto smart wallet that provides easy retail access to DeFi earning opportunities, is excited to announce it is expanding its advanced private key technology with immediate support for Ethereum Mainnet.\n\nThis marks the second chain supported by Giddy following its initial launch on the Polygon network, and will soon be followed by other EVM-compatible networks such as Arbitrum, Base, Binance Smart Chain, and more.

In reviewing my recent trading performance, it is evident that my strategy of buying ETH with a significant percentage of cash has not been successful in generating profits. Despite the bullish market trend and positive sentiment towards Ethereum, the short-term corrections and consolidations have resulted in negative daily returns.

One effective strategy that has led to successful outcomes is the analysis of on-chain signals and news developments, which have provided valuable insights into market trends and potential price movements. However, the ineffective strategy of buying with a large percentage of cash has not yielded positive results.

Key trends and indicators in the current cryptocurrency market that are likely to influence future trades include on-chain analysis signals, news developments, market sentiment, and technical indicators such as the MACD signal. These factors can help in predicting potential price movements and making informed trading decisions.

In assessing whether a more aggressive or conservative trading approach is warranted, it is important to consider the current market conditions and risk tolerance.

The market trend appears to be bullish overall, as indicated by the buy signals from the short_long_ma_signal and macd_signal. However, the recent sell signal from the macd_signal at 1730.19 may suggest a potential short-term correction or consolidation in the price.

It is important to monitor the price movement closely, especially in relation to the key resistance levels, to determine if the bullish trend will continue or if a reversal may occur. Traders and investors should consider setting stop-loss orders to manage risk and protect profits in case of a sudden price reversal.

Start your response with your brief reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

The solution makes use of StarkWare’s STARK proofs, the ZK-proof technology co-invented by mathematician Eli Ben-Sasson.\n\nStarkWare presented Herodotus with a custom-built instance of its shared prover service SHARP, which enables advanced scaling efficiency using recursive proofs. The latter allows a virtual machine to provide “proofs of proofs” by generating proofs of transactions or blocks in parallel and real-time, batching them into a subsequent proof.\n\nRelated: More TPS, less gas: Ethereum L2 Starknet outlines performance upgrades\n\nAt a slightly more technical level, the accumulator acts as a cache that stores block headers. If the accumulator has a header in its cache, the respective storage-proof computation can use it for validation.\n\nA visual representation of the possible use of recursive proofs to batch a variety of information into subsequent verified and cached proofs. Source: StarkWare\n\nIf the header is not cached, the prover has to generate a proof to cover the requested block range, add the block header to the accumulator and then complete the requested storage proof computation.\n\nAs the name suggests, the on-chain accumulator essentially accumulates proofs that rollup prior proofs, drastically reducing the time it takes to verify the Ethereum blockchain and associated data at any point in the network’s history.\n\nHerodotus chief technology officer Marcello Bardus notes that the technology removes the need to traverse the entire blockchain on the blockchain itself:\n\n“We can do it off chain, generate an accumulator and just cherrypick one specific block without iterating from the entire chain on the chain itself.”\n\nStarkWare notes that Storage proofs could prove groundbreaking as an alternative to cross-chain bridges that rely on third-party oracles to track and verify data.\n\nRelated: StarkNet overhauls Cairo programming language to drive developer adoption\n\nHerodotus co-founder Kacper Koziol added that the accumulator is an innovation that Ethereum has long needed to align with blockchain principles of transparency and accessibility. The technology will essentially allow any user to access any point in Ethereum’s history.\n\n“This will be very powerful. For the first time in the history of blockchains, people are going to be able to prove the correctness of any aspect of anyone’s on-chain information.”\n\nThe two teams highlight the potential for storage proofs to build “Web2 equivalent applications,” tapping into the pioneering ability to access and verify Ethereum blockchain data autonomously.\n\nAccount recovery is touted as one potential use case, where the ability to verify on-chain data could trigger a proverbial dead man’s switch or automate insurance protocols that use historical on-chain events to trigger smart contract payouts.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: Recursive inscriptions: Bitcoin ‘supercomputer’ and BTC DeFi coming soon'}, {'id': 1, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNjbi5jb20vbmV3cy9ldGgtc3Rha2luZy1zZXJ2aWNlcy1hZ3JlZS1saW1pdC1mb3ItdmFsaWRhdG9ycy1hbWlkLWNyaXRpY2lzbS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Fri, 01 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Ethereum Staking Services Accept 22% Validators Limit Amid Criticism From ETH Community - CCN.com', 'content': 'Key Takeaways\n\nSome ETH staking service providers agreed to a self-imposed limit.\n\nThe limit restricts the amount of the staking market they control.\n\nThey promise to hold no more than 22% of the Ethereum staking market.\n\nPotential centralization of ETH liquid staking behind the move.\n\nEthereum has always been at the forefront of the debate about decentralization and now this is being protected by the adoption of a ground-breaking self-limit regulation by Ethereum staking providers.\n\nThe 22% Self-Limit Rule\n\nIn order to maintain Ethereum blockchain’s decentralized nature, at least five Ethereum liquid staking providers, including Rocket Pool , Stader Labs , Diva Staking , Puffer Finance , and StakeWise , have either adopted or are actively working to implement a self-limit rule. This regulation limits their ownership to no more than 22% of the Ethereum staking market.\n\nThis figure was selected due to Ethereum’s consensus algorithm requiring a 66% validator agreement on the network’s state. This rule mandates the collaboration of at least four major companies for finalizing the chain, making transactions unchangeable by setting the limit at 22%.\n\nStruggling Against Centralization\n\nThe Ethereum community has had ongoing concerns about staking service centralization, as indicated by the self-limit proposal presented by Superphiz, an Ethereum core developer, in May 2022 . The main goal is to maintain the network’s decentralized nature by preventing any one entity from obtaining disproportionate influence over it.\n\nThese providers are committed (or are in the process of committing) to self-limit to <22% of Ethereum validators. This is how our chain will be successful: Coordination above greed. Cooperation instead of winner-take-all.@Rocket_Pool @stakewise_io @staderlabs @divastaking — superphiz.eth 🦇🔊🛡️ (@superphiz) August 30, 2023\n\nLido Finance Mysteries\n\nThe biggest Ethereum liquid staking service, Lido Finance, stands out as an important exception to this trend. According to data from Dune Analytics , Lido has now a commanding 32.4% of all staked Ethereum, leaving Coinbase with just an 8.7% market share.\n\nIn an unexpected move, Lido Finance voted against self-limiting in June, with a whopping 99.8% majority.\n\n“They have expressed an intention to control the majority of validators on the beacon chain,” Superphiz said in an August 31 post.\n\nVarious Views in ETH Community\n\nThe self-limit rule has received a mixed reception from the Ethereum community. Some claim that the rule ignores the Ethereum tenets in favor of concentrating on economic self-interest. They argue that if proponents of the self-limit rule were in Lido’s position of power, they may view things differently.\n\nEasy to commit to self-limit when it seems that most of these will likely never reach 22% market share of Liquid staking on Ethereum. Folks in the ETH community should not shame more user-friendly solutions as greedy products. https://t.co/65vgti3Jrm — Neel Daftary 🦇🔊 (@DaftaryNeel) August 31, 2023\n\nOn the other hand, several members of the Ethereum community voiced worries about the risks of centralization posed by Lido’s substantial market share. They call this domination “selfish” and push for measures to maintain the health and decentralization of the larger Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nYeah because they have way less market share than that now… easy to chirp from the cheap seats. This has nothing to do with “Ethereum alignment.” None of these teams would self limit were they in Lido’s place. Everyone is doing the economically selfish and rational thing… — Mippo 🟪 (@MikeIppolito_) August 31, 2023\n\nThe debate over Ethereum’s decentralization will persist as it evolves. The 22% self-limit rule is a significant step in striking a balance between market growth and network decentralization.\n\nIt underscores the Ethereum community’s commitment to preserving decentralization for impartiality and permissionless innovation on the platform.\n\nThe Ethereum community’s commitment to decentralization is demonstrated by its acceptance of the 22% self-limit rule. This novel strategy aims to protect the fundamental values of the Ethereum platform by preventing any one company from exerting undue control over the Ethereum staking market.\n\nWhile opinions may vary, it underscores the Ethereum community’s ongoing commitment to striking the right balance between market dynamics and network integrity.'}].

Based on the news articles analyzed, the Ethereum (ETH) market is currently facing some downward pressure. The price of Ethereum has fallen by almost 4% over the last 24 hours, with bears being more powerful than bulls on the first day of September. The price is currently trading at $1,629 and is on its way to testing the local support level of $1,630. If the price breaks below this level, it may lead to a sharp drop to the $1,600 zone soon.

Additionally, there are concerns about centralization in the Ethereum staking market, with some providers implementing a self-imposed limit to control no more than 22% of the market. This move aims to maintain the decentralized nature of the Ethereum blockchain and prevent any one entity from obtaining disproportionate influence.

Overall, the market trend for Ethereum appears to be bearish in the short term due to the price decline and concerns about centralization in the staking market. Traders should closely monitor the support levels mentioned in the news articles to gauge the potential direction of the market.

Start your response with your brief reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Given the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, news analyst report, and reflection analyst report, it is clear that the market trend for Ethereum (ETH) is currently uncertain and potentially bearish in the short term. The conflicting signals from different indicators, the recent price decline, and concerns about centralization in the staking market all point towards a cautious approach to trading ETH.

While the overall trend in the cryptocurrency market has been bullish, it is important to consider the short-term corrections and fluctuations that may impact trading decisions. In this case, waiting for more clarity in the market before making any trading decisions seems to be the most prudent approach.

Considering the potential bearish trend and uncertainty in the market, I would suggest a conservative approach with a slight bias towards selling ETH. Therefore, I recommend selling 0.2 (20%) of ETH to maximize profit and mitigate potential losses in the short term.

She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nRenowned macro guru Raoul Pal expresses unwavering optimism in the face of lingering market uncertainties. Pal, a steadfast bull, maintains that his bullish stance, which he has held for an extended period, remains unshaken.\n\nWhen questioned about the foundation of his bullish outlook, Pal elucidated that he believes the much-anticipated recession, which had loomed ominously on the economic horizon, was largely factored into the market dynamics last year. According to him, the substantial downturns witnessed in equity markets and the cryptocurrency realm during that period were clear manifestations of this anticipatory pricing.\n\nRaoul Pal’s Unwavering Bullish Stance\n\nIn a recent interview with Crypto Banter, Pal reiterated his consistent perspective, asserting that the long-anticipated recession has already transpired and was duly assimilated by the markets in the preceding year.\n\nTo illustrate this point, he cited the substantial market fluctuations, including a precipitous 75% decline in cryptocurrencies and a 30-35% dip in stock values, as compelling evidence of the market’s proactive response to the impending economic cycle.\n\nPal expounded on how the market had preemptively adjusted to these anticipated changes in the prior year. Subsequently, it embarked on a path of anticipatory behavior, as evidenced by the discernible surge in liquidity since the month of June.\n\nDrawing from his forward-looking indicators, Pal revealed that liquidity had exhibited an upward trajectory since June of the preceding year. These indicators played a pivotal role in shaping his investment decisions, most notably in Ethereum, where he augmented his holdings during a significant market sell-off.\n\nContemplating the future landscape, Pal highlights that current data trends are now harmonizing with his forward-looking indicators. He emphasized that inflationary pressures are gradually receding, while unemployment figures are showing a gradual ascent. Furthermore, economic growth appears to be losing momentum. These unfolding trends, in Pal’s assessment, suggest that the Federal Reserve may, in due course, contemplate halting its ongoing rate hikes and, potentially, resort to rate cuts in a bid to sustain economic stability.'}, {'id': 6, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vY3J5cHRvc2xhdGUuY29tL2Z0eC1jb2xkLXdhbGxldC1tb3ZlZC1hbG1vc3QtMTBtLWluLWFsdGNvaW5zLXRvLWV0aGVyZXVtLXNpbmNlLWF1Zy0zMS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Sat, 02 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'FTX cold wallet moved almost $10M in altcoins to Ethereum since Aug. 31 - CryptoSlate', 'content': 'A cold wallet owned by collapsed crypto exchange FTX moved almost $10 million in altcoins from Solana to Ethereum since Aug. 31 for undisclosed reasons, according to on-chain data.\n\nThe altcoins include notable tokens like LINK, SUSHI, LUNA, and YFI.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
REASONING:
Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, the market trend for ETH appears to be bullish, with signals indicating a buy sentiment. However, there is a potential short-term correction or consolidation indicated by the shift in the MACD signal to sell at a higher price level. The news analyst report also supports a positive sentiment towards Ethereum and the cryptocurrency market in general, with potential bullish moves for altcoins and major players like Robinhood holding significant amounts of Ethereum.

Considering the overall bullish trend and positive market sentiment, I am confident in predicting a continued upward trend for ETH. Therefore, I will take a more aggressive approach and buy ETH with a larger percentage of cash to maximize potential profits.

Action: -0.7 (buy with 70% cash)
ACTION:

DAILY RETURN:

REASONING:
Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, the market trend for ETH appears to be bullish overall, with buy signals from the short_long_ma_signal and macd_signal. However, the recent sell signal from the macd_signal at 1730.19 may indicate a potential short-term correction or consolidation in the price.

Additionally, the news analyst report highlights positive developments in the cryptocurrency market, such as regulatory clarity for ETH and BTC, enhanced accessibility for Ethereum through Giddy's smart wallet, and Robinhood's expansion of crypto exposure. These developments suggest a positive outlook for the market.

Considering the bullish trend and positive news developments, I am confident in the upward trend of ETH. Therefore, I will take a more aggressive approach and buy ETH with a larger percentage of cash.

DAILY RETURN:

REASONING:
Given the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, news analyst report, and reflection analyst report, it is clear that the market trend for Ethereum (ETH) is currently uncertain and potentially bearish in the short term. The conflicting signals from different indicators, the recent price decline, and concerns about centralization in the staking market all point towards a cautious approach to trading ETH.

While the overall trend in the cryptocurrency market has been bullish, it is important to consider the short-term corrections and fluctuations that may impact trading decisions. In this case, waiting for more clarity in the market before making any trading decisions seems to be the most prudent approach.

Considering the potential bearish trend and uncertainty in the market, I would suggest a conservative approach with a slight bias towards selling ETH. Therefore, I recommend selling 0.2 (20%) of ETH to maximize profit and mitigate potential losses in the short term.

You are an experienced ETH cryptocurrency trader and you are trying to maximize your overall profit by trading ETH. In each day, you will make an action to buy or sell ETH. You will start with 1 million dollars, half in cash and half in ETH. You are assisted by a few analysts below and need to decide the final action.

ON-CHAIN ANALYST REPORT: Based on the recent price and auxiliary information provided, it can be observed that the short_long_ma_signal has consistently been indicating a buy signal. However, the macd_signal has shifted from buy to sell over the past few data points. The bollinger_bands_signal has remained at hold throughout.

The market trend appears to be somewhat mixed at the moment. The buy signals from the short_long_ma_signal suggest that there is still some bullish momentum in the market. However, the sell signals from the macd_signal indicate a potential weakening of the bullish trend.

It is important to monitor the market closely for any further developments to determine whether the current mixed signals will lead to a continuation of the bullish trend or a potential reversal. Traders and investors should exercise caution and consider implementing risk management strategies in their trading decisions.

NEWS ANALYST REPORT: Based on the news articles provided, here is a brief analysis and estimation of the market trend for Ethereum (ETH) cryptocurrency trading:

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: In reviewing my recent trading performance, it is evident that the most successful outcomes were achieved when I took a more aggressive approach in buying ETH with a larger percentage of cash. This strategy was based on a bullish market trend and positive news developments, which ultimately led to profitable trades. On the other hand, the ineffective strategy was observed when I followed conflicting signals and uncertain market trends, resulting in a loss of profit.

Key trends and indicators in the current cryptocurrency market that are likely to influence future trades include on-chain analyst reports, news analyst reports, and reflection analyst reports. It is important to consider the overall market sentiment, technical indicators, and news developments to make informed trading decisions.

Moving forward, a more conservative trading approach may be warranted given the uncertainty and potential bearish trends in the market. It is crucial to wait for more clarity and confirmation before making significant trading decisions. Additionally, closely monitoring key indicators and trends will be essential in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market effectively.

Start your response with your brief reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

Given the mixed signals from the on-chain analyst report, the stagnant market trend indicated by the news analyst report, and the reflection on past trading performance, it is clear that the current market for ETH is uncertain and potentially bearish. The conflicting signals and lack of significant market movements suggest a cautious approach is warranted.

However, considering the historical success of a more aggressive buying strategy during bullish trends, I believe there is still a possibility of a bullish reversal in the near future. Therefore, I will take a slightly bullish stance and buy ETH with 20% cash to capitalize on any potential upward movement in the market.

He cited the technical quality and enhancement of the Solana codebase, the ability to outlast hardships displayed by Solana following the collapse of FTX, and the success stories of previous Solana forks, such as the Pyth Network, which runs an adapted version of Solana as its backend.\n\nChristensen envisions a future where NewChain serves as a secure conduit between Ethereum and Solana. However, he did not limit his options to Solana. He also name-dropped Aptos, Sui, and Cosmos as alternatives.\n\nThe main benefits of Cosmos were its “large and high quality” pool of talent, as well as its wide range of independent developers, Christensen said.\n\nRead more: Solana Pay partners with Shopify to enable USDC payments\n\nFollow Us on Google News'}, {'id': 16, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vY29pbmdhcGUuY29tL3NvbGFuYS1mb3VuZGVyLWNhdXRpb25zLWFnYWluc3QtZGV0cmltZW50YWwtcml2YWxyeS13aXRoLWV0aGVyZXVtL9IBW2h0dHBzOi8vY29pbmdhcGUuY29tL3NvbGFuYS1mb3VuZGVyLWNhdXRpb25zLWFnYWluc3QtZGV0cmltZW50YWwtcml2YWxyeS13aXRoLWV0aGVyZXVtL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Sun, 03 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Solana Founder Cautions Against Rivalry With Ethereum - CoinGape', 'content': 'Solana (SOL) founder Anatoly Yakovenko has taken to the X social media platform, formerly known as Twitter to warn his community members against hurling hate statements and attacks on Ethereum (ETH).

According to the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) giant, this blockchain could be forked from the Solana (SOL) blockchain. In effect, this would mean that MakerDAO will be moving away from the Ethereum-based architecture which it currently utilizes.\n\nadvertisement\n\nExplaining further, the MakerDAO CEO claimed that the Solana codebase is the “most promising” to explore for NewChain due to its technical quality and optimization, resilience of the Solana ecosystem following the “FTX blowup,” and past examples of successful forks of the protocol, like the Pyth Network.\n\nIn response to this potential development, Yakovenko acknowledged that MakerDAO’s move is impressive, citing that it is a win for open source. At the same time, he warned that it should not be perceived as an endorsement of one blockchain over the other.\n\n“I really hope that people in the Solana community don’t use this as some cudgel to attack Ethereum,” Yakovenko said in a recent post.

Is it an innate sense of positivity; a belief that everything will turn out for the best?\n\nTo ordinary people, yes. That’s exactly what it is. For crypto enthusiasts, on the other hand, Optimism is something quite different.\n\nOptimism is an Ethereum Layer-2 scaling solution that aims to make Vitalik Buterin’s blockchain faster, affordable, and ultimately more accessible. As the Ethereum blockchain has grown in popularity and usage, it’s become clear that the network’s sluggish speeds and extortionate gas fees are ill-equipped for crypto mass adoption.\n\nWhat is Optimism (OP), and how does it work? In a crowded niche, what separates Optimism from the dozens of other Layer-2 blockchains like Arbitrum (ARB) or Polygon zkEVM?\n\nWhat is Optimism (OP)?\n\nOptimism, known by its native token symbol OP, is one of the Ethereum network’s leading Layer-2 scaling solutions. It resolves the litany of issues plaguing the Ethereum blockchain, namely scalability and high transaction fees.\n\nThe Optimism project is spearheaded by the Optimism Foundation, a passionate team of developers and decentralization enthusiasts dedicated to improving Ethereum (ETH) and ensuring its long-term growth and sustainability. The foundation’s work has given birth to one of the most promising Layer-2 solutions, with Optimism going from strength to strength since its launch.\n\nHow Does Optimism Work?\n\nCreatively named, Optimism is what crypto people call an Optimistic Rollup. In simple terms, Optimistic rollups are a method of batching groups of Layer-2 blockchain transaction data into one ‘rolled up’ transaction that can then be secured on the Ethereum mainnet, a Layer-1.\n\nProcessing transactions off-chain significantly reduces the load on the main network, meaning that Layer-2 users can enjoy all of Ethereum’s functionality without suffering its low speeds and crippling gas fees.\n\nA sequencer handles optimism block production. The sequencer is responsible for instant transaction confirmations and blockchain state updates, constructing and executing Layer-2 blocks, and submitting user transactions to Layer-1.\n\nWhy are they called Optimistic rollups, you ask? When it comes to blockchain security, Optimism operates on the principle of ‘fault proofs.’ This means that node operators operate on the ‘optimistic’ approach that the state of the blockchain is correct, secure, and doesn’t require proof of validity. It is removed and replaced if this state is challenged and found faulty.\n\nAs is always the case among Layer-2s, Optimism runs an EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine). This makes it easy for Ethereum developers to redeploy their favorite EVM-based dApps and smart contracts directly on Optimism and gives users a sense of familiarity with the network.\n\nThe Optimism Token\n\nAt the heart of Optimism is the OP token, the native cryptocurrency token of the network. OP is an ERC-20 token that plays a crucial role in the governance and future development of the Optimism network, serving as the requirement for OP community members to join and contribute to decision-making processes. It may come as a surprise, but OP is not used to pay Optimism gas fees.\n\nOne of the largest crypto airdrops to date, the OP token was distributed to hundreds of thousands of Optimism wallets. Those lucky qualifying addresses were people who’d positively contributed to Optimism’s growth, whether they were DAO voters, multi-sig signers, or simple users who interacted with Optimism dApps.\n\nOP’s first airdrop shared over 200M OP tokens and marked the birth of Optimism’s governance model, known as the Optimism Collective. This governing body collective comprises two separate houses: The Token House and the Citizens’ House.\n\nComprised of OP token holders, The Token House handles protocol governance. Through decentralized governance proposals, the Token House manages everything from protocol upgrades to inflation adjustments, treasury appropriations, rights protection, and governance fund grants.\n\nOn the other hand, the Citizens’ House is an experimental attempt at a non-plutocratic governance model, which aims to draw power and influence away from crypto whales. The Citizen’s House manages retroactive public goods funding, which rewards builders and developers who create products and services that grow the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nOptimism Ecosystem\n\nAs you’d expect from a top Layer-2 network, the Optimism ecosystem is a vibrant and dynamic space with an excellent variety of dApps. Thanks to roll-up technology, Optimism is paving the way for a new era of Ethereum-based applications that are faster, cheaper, and more efficient than what’s available on the mainnet.\n\nDeFi\n\nDecentralized Finance, or DeFi, is undoubtedly one of the most transformative applications of blockchain technology. Optimism’s EVM compatibility and low fees have made it the perfect playground for creative DeFi applications.\n\nClassic decentralized exchanges like Uniswap and Sushiswap have both moved in and set up camp on Optimism, but they’re outclassed in TVL (Total Value Locked) and trading volume by Velodrome, Optimism’s native DEX.\n\nOther DeFi platforms on Optimism can offer financial services like lending, borrowing, and yield farming through popular platforms like AAVE and Optimism’s dedicated lending market, Sonne Finance. Synthetix (SNX), another popular application on the network, supports derivatives and synthetic asset trading.\n\nNFTs\n\nWhile Optimism DeFi is a force to be reckoned with, NFTs on the network have struggled to stay relevant. What’s more interesting is that this trend is consistent across all Layer-2 networks, not just Optimism.\n\nEven though Layer-2 networks, whether they’re optimistic rollups or zk-rollups (zero-knowledge), make it cheaper and easier to trade and mint NFTs, NFT culture still resides largely on Layer-1 networks like Ethereum and Solana (SOL).\n\nDespite iconic NFT marketplaces like Opensea integrating support for Optimism, NFT trading volume is almost non-existent.\n\nA quick look at the top collections page on Quix, Optimism’s top NFT marketplace, shows that the last week of trading volume barely tips over 0.1 ETH. Opensea doesn’t fare much better, with the world’s most recognizable NFT platform tipping the scales at around two ETH per week.\n\nThe Optimism Superchain\n\nTo expand Ethereum’s capabilities further than we’ve ever thought possible, Optimism has set out to build a horizontally scalable network of blockchains called the Optimism Superchain. With the vision of growing a wider network of standardized, open-source Layer-2 networks, the Superchain tackles Ethereum’s scalability crisis from a new angle.\n\nThe central engine of the Superchain is the OP Stack, an open-source development toolkit that unifies all Superchain networks and ensures they’re all beating to the same rhythm. It guarantees that all networks are built using the same security features and communication systems to maintain a cohesive ecosystem.\n\nMoreover, the Superchain introduces a new revenue model that rewards developers with fees from their respective chains and applications. Optimism’s Superchain has proven a popular choice for large-scale businesses, including Worldcoin (WLD) and Coinbase’s Base Chain.\n\nOptimism vs. Arbitrum\n\nTwo names reign supreme in the fierce and competitive race to become the ultimate Ethereum scaling solution. At face value, there’s not a huge difference between Optimism and Arbitrum. Both networks are optimistic rollups that improve Ethereum’s scalability.\n\nUnderneath the hood, the main difference is how they handle fraud proofing. While Optimism uses single-round fraud proofs, Arbitrum takes this one step further with multi-round proofs. The result? Optimism is a faster network, but it runs the risk of having higher gas fees than Arbitrum during periods of Ethereum congestion.\n\nDiving into the on-chain metrics, Arbitrum is king in the eye of DeFi users. According to DeFiLlama, Arbitrum has more than double Optimism’s TVL (Total Value Locked) and almost 3x as many protocols built on the network. But if you’re an Optimism fan, don’t lose heart.\n\nRecent trends indicate a change in the guard. Over the past few months, daily transactions and active addresses on Arbitrum have steadily declined, while the same metrics on Optimism show sustained growth.\n\nOptimism Pros and Cons\n\nShould we be feeling optimistic or pessimistic about Optimism? Let’s dive into the pros and cons.\n\nPros\n\nScalability – Optimism offers greater transaction speeds and throughput than the Ethereum mainnet, making it better suited to supporting a large user base.\n\n– Optimism offers greater transaction speeds and throughput than the Ethereum mainnet, making it better suited to supporting a large user base.

Start your response with your brief reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

On-chain data on September 4 shows that one Ethereum holder sold 694 ETH, worth roughly $1.13 million when writing, for 1,010 MKR. At the time of the swap, MKR was changing hands at $1,122.\n\nWhale Swaps ETH For MKR\n\nAs of September 4, the address, “0x3737,” had over $20.37 million worth of assets. While the whale trades against Vitalik and doubles down on MKR, zooming in on the address’s portfolio shows that the largest holding is ETH.\n\nThe address holds 10,000 ETH worth $16.3 million at spot rates, representing over 75% of the total portfolio. Meanwhile, some of his other major holdings include Arbitrum (ARB), worth $2.9 million, and MKR, worth $1.1 million.\n\nMKR, the token issued by MakerDAO, the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that controls the minting of DAI, a stablecoin on Ethereum, has been ripping higher in the last few months.\n\nMKR plays a key role in stabilizing DAO and is used as a last resort. Holders participate in governance, voting on proposals that best stabilize the algorithmic stablecoin, deciding collateral types accepted, stability fee adjustments, and others.\n\nFrom June, MKR has more than doubled, rising 125% to peak at around $1,300 in early August. It is now trading at over $1,100, up 13% from August lows.\n\nMaker Presents Endgame\n\nThe token’s surge has been attributed to multiple factors, specifically the release of the “Endgame” roadmap. Under this plan, MakerDAO plans to, among other things, release their blockchain, rebrand, and introduce two more tokens.\n\nThis move is significant because MakerDAO is among the first decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. According to DeFiLlama data, the protocol has a total value locked (TVL) of over $5 billion. It is the largest decentralized money market in the world.\n\nMeanwhile, DAI, its algorithmic yield-earning stablecoin, has been stable recently and is the largest in Ethereum. At press time, DAI had a market cap of $5.3 billion, perched at 12th on the leaderboard. At this pace, DAI is the third-largest stablecoin after USDT and USDC.\n\nVitalik Buterin, despite the stellar performance of MKR relative to the broader crypto market, liquidated $580,000 worth of MKR after MakerDAO’s co-founder, Rune Christensen, said it was considering launching a new blockchain bridging to Ethereum that’s based on Solana’s code. The new blockchain, dubbed NewChain, is part of MakerDAO’s roadmap, “Endgame”.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
REASONING:
Given the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, news analyst report, and reflection analyst report, it is clear that the market trend for Ethereum (ETH) is currently uncertain and potentially bearish in the short term. The conflicting signals from different indicators, the recent price decline, and concerns about centralization in the staking market all point towards a cautious approach to trading ETH.

While the overall trend in the cryptocurrency market has been bullish, it is important to consider the short-term corrections and fluctuations that may impact trading decisions. In this case, waiting for more clarity in the market before making any trading decisions seems to be the most prudent approach.

Considering the potential bearish trend and uncertainty in the market, I would suggest a conservative approach with a slight bias towards selling ETH. Therefore, I recommend selling 0.2 (20%) of ETH to maximize profit and mitigate potential losses in the short term.
ACTION:
0.2
DAILY RETURN:
0.0019233409075567476
REASONING:
Given the mixed signals from the on-chain analyst report, the stagnant market trend indicated by the news analyst report, and the reflection on past trading performance, it is clear that the current market for ETH is uncertain and potentially bearish. The conflicting signals and lack of significant market movements suggest a cautious approach is warranted.

However, considering the historical success of a more aggressive buying strategy during bullish trends, I believe there is still a possibility of a bullish reversal in the near future. Therefore, I will take a slightly bullish stance and buy ETH with 20% cash to capitalize on any potential upward movement in the market.

Action: -0.2 (buy with 20% cash)

REASONING:
Given the conflicting signals from the on-chain and news analysts, as well as the reflection on recent trading performance, it is evident that the current market trend for ETH is uncertain and potentially bearish. The market is experiencing stagnant movements, with concerns about centralization in the staking market adding to the cautious outlook.

However, historical success with aggressive buying strategies during bullish trends suggests that there is still a possibility of a bullish reversal in the near future. Therefore, I will take a slightly aggressive approach and buy ETH with 20% cash to capitalize on any potential upward movement in the market.

Provide a brief reflection on your recent trading performance with a focus on the effective strategies and information that led to the most successful outcomes, and the ineffective strategies and information that led to loss of profit. Identify key trends and indicators in the current cryptocurrency market that are likely to influence future trades. Also assess whether a more aggressive or conservative trading approach is warranted. 
*** REFLECTION ANALYST RESPONSE ***
In reviewing my recent trading performance, it is evident that my more aggressive buying strategies during bullish trends have been more successful compared to my conservative selling approach during uncertain or bearish market conditions. The historical success of buying during bullish trends suggests that there is still potential for profit in the market, despite the current uncertainty surrounding ETH.

The conflicting signals from the on-chain and news analysts have made it challenging to accurately predict market movements, leading to some losses in profit. Moving forward, it will be important to closely monitor key trends and indicators in the cryptocurrency market, such as market sentiment, price movements, and regulatory developments, to make more informed trading decisions.

Given the current uncertain and potentially bearish market trend for ETH, a more cautious and conservative trading approach may be warranted to mitigate potential losses. However, it is also important to remain open to opportunities for profit by considering more aggressive buying strategies during potential bullish reversals. Balancing these approaches will be crucial in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market effectively.

GUISE aims to provide users with unmatched privacy by aggregating non-KYC crypto exchange providers. This development could attract users looking for enhanced privacy features in their transactions.

Overall, the news articles suggest a mixed sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, with a focus on privacy and security features.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: In reviewing my recent trading performance, it is evident that my more aggressive buying strategies during bullish trends have been more successful compared to my conservative selling approach during uncertain or bearish market conditions. The historical success of buying during bullish trends suggests that there is still potential for profit in the market, despite the current uncertainty surrounding ETH.

The conflicting signals from the on-chain and news analysts have made it challenging to accurately predict market movements, leading to some losses in profit. Moving forward, it will be important to closely monitor key trends and indicators in the cryptocurrency market, such as market sentiment, price movements, and regulatory developments, to make more informed trading decisions.

Given the current uncertain and potentially bearish market trend for ETH, a more cautious and conservative trading approach may be warranted to mitigate potential losses. However, it is also important to remain open to opportunities for profit by considering more aggressive buying strategies during potential bullish reversals. Balancing these approaches will be crucial in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market effectively.

Start your response with your brief reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Given the conflicting signals from the on-chain and news analysts, as well as the reflection on past trading performance, it is clear that the current market trend for ETH is uncertain and potentially bearish. The on-chain signals are mixed, with a buy signal from the short_long_ma_signal but a sell signal from the macd_signal. The news articles highlight a range-bound market with a focus on privacy and security features, adding to the uncertainty.

Considering the historical success of buying during bullish trends and the potential for profit in the market, I believe that a more cautious and conservative trading approach is warranted at this time. However, it is important to remain open to opportunities for profit by considering more aggressive buying strategies during potential bullish reversals.

Therefore, I suggest a conservative approach with a slight sell action to mitigate potential losses in the current uncertain market trend:

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
REASONING:
Given the mixed signals from the on-chain analyst report, the stagnant market trend indicated by the news analyst report, and the reflection on past trading performance, it is clear that the current market for ETH is uncertain and potentially bearish. The conflicting signals and lack of significant market movements suggest a cautious approach is warranted.

However, considering the historical success of a more aggressive buying strategy during bullish trends, I believe there is still a possibility of a bullish reversal in the near future. Therefore, I will take a slightly bullish stance and buy ETH with 20% cash to capitalize on any potential upward movement in the market.

The market is experiencing stagnant movements, with concerns about centralization in the staking market adding to the cautious outlook.

However, historical success with aggressive buying strategies during bullish trends suggests that there is still a possibility of a bullish reversal in the near future. Therefore, I will take a slightly aggressive approach and buy ETH with 20% cash to capitalize on any potential upward movement in the market.

The on-chain signals are mixed, with a buy signal from the short_long_ma_signal but a sell signal from the macd_signal. The news articles highlight a range-bound market with a focus on privacy and security features, adding to the uncertainty.

Considering the historical success of buying during bullish trends and the potential for profit in the market, I believe that a more cautious and conservative trading approach is warranted at this time. However, it is important to remain open to opportunities for profit by considering more aggressive buying strategies during potential bullish reversals.

Therefore, I suggest a conservative approach with a slight sell action to mitigate potential losses in the current uncertain market trend:

Provide a brief reflection on your recent trading performance with a focus on the effective strategies and information that led to the most successful outcomes, and the ineffective strategies and information that led to loss of profit. Identify key trends and indicators in the current cryptocurrency market that are likely to influence future trades. Also assess whether a more aggressive or conservative trading approach is warranted. 
*** REFLECTION ANALYST RESPONSE ***
In my recent trading performance, I have found that a more cautious and conservative approach has been more effective in mitigating potential losses in the uncertain and potentially bearish market trend for ETH. The conflicting signals from on-chain and news analysts have made it challenging to predict market movements accurately. However, by taking a slightly aggressive stance and buying ETH with 20% cash during potential bullish reversals, I have been able to capitalize on upward movements in the market.

On the other hand, my more aggressive buying strategies during uncertain market conditions have led to losses of profit. It is essential to remain open to opportunities for profit but also to consider the risks involved in aggressive trading approaches.

Key trends and indicators in the current cryptocurrency market that are likely to influence future trades include mixed signals from on-chain analysts, stagnant market movements, and concerns about centralization in the staking market. These factors suggest that a cautious and conservative trading approach may be more appropriate in the current market environment.

Overall, a balanced approach that combines conservative strategies to mitigate potential losses with opportunistic buying during potential bullish reversals is likely to be the most effective trading strategy in the current uncertain market for ETH.

When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Given the conflicting signals from the on-chain and news analysts, as well as the stagnant market movements and concerns about centralization in the staking market, the current market trend for ETH appears to be uncertain and potentially bearish. It is crucial to adopt a cautious and conservative trading approach to mitigate potential losses in this market environment.

However, based on the recent performance and the potential for bullish reversals in the market, I believe that a slightly aggressive stance may be warranted at this time. Therefore, I will take a calculated risk and buy ETH with 20% cash in anticipation of a potential upward movement in the market.

Action: -0.2 (buy with 20% cash)

And if you look here, red is Solana and the deltas, and then blue is ETH. You can see it smashes it. These things are on a log scale on the left. And that is the big difference. Looking at all of the key factors, they have 10 wins each, but in reality, where Solana wins, it wins by a lot more. Where Ethereum wins, it only wins by a fraction.”\n\nHis chart shows 19 different categories comparing Solana to ETH. Solana beats ETH in such categories as block time, average fee and the maximum number of transactions that a blockchain can carry out in a second, also known as transactions per second (TPS).\n\nThe trader says that ETH is considered more established than Solana and a safer bet for investors.\n\nHowever, he notes that more institutional money has flowed into Solana so far in 2023.\n\n“Ethereum is safe. It’s established. It has been around for a long time. The risk is very low. When big money comes in, they’ll go into ETH first, although we have seen so far this year in 2023 institutional money is going into Solana more so than Ethereum.”\n\nAccording to the trader, since Solana’s market cap is much smaller than Ethereum’s, SOL has a greater opportunity for a larger price increase than ETH.\n\nSolana is the 10th-ranked digital asset by market cap with a market cap of $8.2 billion. Ethereum is the second top digital asset by market cap with a market cap of $196 billion.\n\n“This is the magic question though. When you break it all down is Ethereum 20 times better than Solana? And the answer in my opinion is no. But there is risk with Solana, therefore you allocate accordingly. My Solana bag is about a third the size of my ETH bag but it will grow and I think it’ll grow faster.\n\nBut that little skinny green sliver on the right is the market cap of Solana versus the market cap of ETH. And the ETH market cap is 20 times higher, which is stunning. And I look as an investor for relative value.

Pointing out that the majority of nodes are currently run through providers like Amazon Web Services, he identified node centralization as a major problem the Ethereum community needs to deal with.\n\nIn another potential threat to Ethereum’s decentralization, critics have speculated that Chinese firms secretly control some of the richest ETH wallets in existence.\n\nThe Problem of Ethereum Node Centralization\n\nThe Ethereum network is made up of computers that communicate with each other in order to validate transactions and record data about the status of the blockchain.\n\nEach computer in the network is known as an Ethereum node. From its inception, the Ethereum community has worked to establish nodes all around the world. In order to ensure the network’s decentralization, various computers belonging to individuals, businesses, universities and other organizations all operate nodes.\n\nHowever, not all computers are up to the task. In fact, to operate a full Ethereum node, Quicknode recommends a minimum of 16 GB of RAM, a fast SSD drive with at least 1 TB of space, at least 25 MBit/s bandwidth and a fast CPU with 4 or more cores.\n\nDue to the high technical bar node operators must meet, 57.5% of all nodes are run through cloud hosting services. As a consequence, although there are currently 5882 Ethereum nodes in operation, over half of these are controlled by just 21 cloud service providers.\n\nIn fact, 1805 nodes are operated via Amazon Web Services (AWS) alone, presenting a major challenge to Ethereum’s decentralization.\n\nVitalik Buterin on the Future of Ethereum Nodes\n\nSpeaking at Korea Blockchain Week, Vitalik Buterin discusses how to create a more decentralized Ethereum network by making it easier to run nodes.\n\nAddressing the problem of node centralization in Seoul on Monday, September 4, Buterin observed that reducing the amount of data each node has to store would lower technical barriers for would-be operators.\n\n“Today, it takes hundreds of gigabytes of data to run a node… In the longer term, there’s a plan to maintain fully verified Ethereum nodes where you could literally run it on your phone,” he said .\n\nPlans to change how Ethereum nodes handle data have already been formed. For example, the Ethereum Roadmap identifies planned upgrades that will allow computers operating Ethereum nodes to delete historical data they no longer need.\n\nIn the immediate future, the Ethereum Foundation is focused on data expiry as the most achievable goal for reducing the computational burden on network participants.\n\nLooking further ahead, however, a concept known as statelessness could make it much easier to run an Ethereum node.\n\nUnder a stateless system, not all nodes would have to access the network’s full state data. But the most ambitious vision for the future of Ethereum nodes, a concept known as “strong statelessness,” may not happen for a long time.\n\nAccording to Buterin, “These technical problems will have to be addressed eventually—maybe a 10-year timescale, maybe a 20-year timescale.”\n\nChinese Government Wallets May Hold a Huge Stash of ETH\n\nAs well as the concentration of nodes among a few operators, another threat to Ethereum’s decentralization could come from the concentration of ETH among a small number of wallets.\n\nIn the proof of stake (PoS) era, ETH accumulation of that kind poses a major threat to Ethereum decentralization.\n\nUnder Ethereum’s previous proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, what’s known as a 51% attack would require a single party to control over half of all miners, thus requiring a huge amount of resources to pull off. However, with the switch from miners to stakers, to seize control of the network, attackers would need to control more than half of the circulating supply of ETH instead.\n\nFor some researchers, this prospect is especially worrying given that many of the oldest and richest Ethereum wallets remain shrouded in secrecy. Moreover, concerns have been raised recently about the role of the Chinese business conglomerate Wanxiang in Ethereum’s early history.\n\nAs the Twitter sleuth TruthLabs has observed, Wanxiang has been associated with Ethereum since its inception and likely received a portion of the 72 million ETH that was distributed to early investors.\n\nA quick 🧵showing that Wanxiang, Chinese auto and early Ethereum Investor funded and setup Vitalik Buterins official wallets. 1/6https://t.co/4uMLLnzguq pic.twitter.com/Ec1cjLOLz2 — TruthLabs \U0001fae1 (@BoringSleuth) January 29, 2023\n\nIn fact, the Chinese company has ties to Vitalik Buterin going back to 2015, when the then-CEO of Wanxiang Blockchain Labs, Feng Xia, purchased $500,000 worth of ETH from the Ethereum founder.\n\nFor TruthLabs, Wanxiang’s deep roots in the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) are a good reason to be suspicious of its ETH holdings. In fact, the crypto investigator speculates that the CCP is Ethereum’s biggest whale, secretly controlling as much as 66.6% Of the ETH supply.\n\nA complete guess, 66.6%. I found 12 Genesis Block Wallets today, alone where they ended up with the majority of the ETH from. Its so hard to know. They were invested in over 500 projects by EOY 2021, and in many cases got the pre-ICO tokens prior to both ETH/altcoin price waves. — TruthLabs \U0001fae1 (@BoringSleuth) June 28, 2023'}].

Based on the news articles analyzed, here is a brief report on the current market trend for Ethereum (ETH) cryptocurrency trading:

1. Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, is advocating for the implementation of 'privacy pools' in blockchain technology to weed out criminals. This move could potentially enhance privacy while ensuring regulatory compliance.

2. There are concerns about node centralization within the Ethereum network, with a significant number of nodes being run through centralized platforms like Amazon Web Services. Vitalik Buterin acknowledges this challenge and emphasizes the importance of decentralization for the network's future.

3. Solana (SOL), a competitor to Ethereum, is gaining institutional interest and is seen as having significant upside potential. Despite Ethereum being more established, Solana is attracting more institutional money in 2023, which could impact its price performance.

4. Vitalik Buterin also highlighted the issue of Chinese control over Ethereum wallets, raising concerns about the decentralization of the network. The concentration of ETH among a few wallets, especially those associated with Chinese firms, poses a potential threat to Ethereum's security and decentralization.

Given the mixed signals from the on-chain and news analysts, as well as the reflection on recent trading performance, it is clear that the current market trend for Ethereum (ETH) trading is uncertain and volatile. While there are concerns about node centralization, Chinese control over wallets, and competition from Solana, there are also positive developments such as the advocacy for privacy pools by Vitalik Buterin.

Considering the conflicting signals and the need for a balanced approach, I believe that a slightly conservative stance is still warranted. However, it is important to remain open to opportunities for profit during potential bullish reversals.

Based on the overall analysis and the need for a cautious yet opportunistic approach, I suggest a slightly conservative action of selling 0.2 (20%) of ETH.

Last month, two co-founders of the EVM-compatible transaction mixing service Tornado Cash were charged by the US government.\n\nThe paper’s authors — Buterin, as well as Chainalysis chief scientist Jacob Illum, University of Basel professor Fabian Schär, doctoral candidate Matthias Nadler of the University of Basel, and Spankchain co-founder Ameen Soleimani — contend that good and bad actors could be distinguished through the use of a “smart contract-based privacy enhancing protocol” dubbed Privacy Pools.\n\nPrivacy Pools uses zero-knowledge (ZK) technology and enables users to generate a new withdrawal address that can’t be linked to previous transactions.\n\nIt also lets users choose their own privacy settings — meaning they can exclude any suspicious users from their transactions.

Nonetheless, as retail takes fright, Ethereum whales are now taking advantage of the prevailing bearish sentiment, as they have commenced purchasing substantial quantities of ETH at current discounted prices.\n\nLate Tuesday, Ethereum whales made a substantial move by purchasing approximately 260,000 Ether (ETH) in just 24 hours. Ali Martinez, a prominent cryptocurrency analyst, revealed this significant acquisition, amounting to nearly $425 million, on Twitter. The pundit shared a compelling chart from Santiment, showcasing the remarkable influx of capital into Ethereum despite prevailing market conditions.\n\nThis development unfolds against the backdrop of crypto prices remaining under pressure recently. Many have attributed Ether’s weakness to dumping by big investors over the past four months, as well as prevailing regulatory challenges facing the crypto industry, particularly in the U.S.\n\nRecently, Brian Quinlivan, Santiment’s marketing director, noted that large Ethereum (ETH) holders had exhibited bearish behaviour since around April, contrasting with their bullish stance observed in late 2022.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“There has been about a 4-month long dump in supply from addresses holding between 10 and 10,000 ETH. They really were accumulating significantly at the end of last year, but profit taking from these key tiers happened hard and quickly right as the price was hitting around a 1-year high of approximately $2,120.” Quinlivan wrote.\n\nJust yesterday, Santiment highlighted two whales who sent 300,000 Ether to Coinbase, raising fears of an imminent dump among traders.\n\nOn the other hand, an analyst known by the pseudonym “greatest trader” from Cryptoquant linked Ether’s continued weakness to future traders who have been actively selling.\n\nIn a post earlier this week, the analyst noted Ethereum’s ongoing bearish trend, illustrated by a declining 30-day moving average of the taker buy-sell ratio, signals dominant bearish sentiment among futures traders. In reading this metric, values above one signify bullish sentiment, while values below one indicate bearish sentiment.\n\nThe pundit shared a chart which depicts the continuous decline in the taker buy-sell ratio over the past few months, consistently remaining below the pivotal one mark and reaching a yearly low.\n\n“This consistent behavior underscores the dominant bearish sentiment among futures traders participating in Ethereum’s market.” He wrote.\n\nThe analyst noted that for Ethereum’s price to embark on a new bullish trajectory, it would require a shift in behaviour among futures traders, characterized by a more aggressive buying stance, as indicated by a metric rising above the critical one threshold.\n\nEther was trading at $1,636 at press time, barely up a percentage point over the past 24 hours.'}, {'id': 3, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vZGVjcnlwdC5jby9yZXNvdXJjZXMvd2hvLWlzLXZpdGFsaWstYnV0ZXJpbi1ldGhlcmV1bS1jcmVhdG9y0gFKaHR0cHM6Ly9kZWNyeXB0LmNvL3Jlc291cmNlcy93aG8taXMtdml0YWxpay1idXRlcmluLWV0aGVyZXVtLWNyZWF0b3I_YW1wPTE?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Thu, 07 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Who is Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum Creator? - Decrypt', 'content': "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEarn a free on-chain certificate touting your knowledge of Ethereum by taking Decrypt U's free course, Getting Started with Ethereum.\n\nAs of September 2023, Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world by total value, with a market capitalization of over $229 billion. Despite the fact that Ethereum’s value is lower than that of rival Bitcoin, though, there is a good argument to be made that Ethereum is more important for the crypto and blockchain spaces overall than its larger competitor. Since its launch in 2015, the Ethereum network has been instrumental in powering the next generation of decentralized applications (dApps) and, more recently, the world of decentralized finance (DeFi) more broadly.\n\nThis is thanks to Ethereum’s powerful smart contracts capabilities and versatility. As of March 2023, protocols built using the Ethereum network were responsible for about 90%, or $90 billion, of the total value locked in DeFi.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJust as Ethereum is a critical component of the crypto world and one that has shaped the development of the industry since its launch, the network’s founder Vitalik Buterin is similarly influential. The Russian-Canadian programmer and writer—who is not yet 30 years old as of this writing—is arguably the single most famous individual in the world of cryptocurrency today (another prime candidate for this title, Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto, is a pseudonymous name potentially representing more than one real person). Who is Vitalik Buterin, and how did he come to create Ethereum?\n\nEarly Interests Led to Crypto\n\nButerin was born in Russia but moved to Canada at a young age, where he was quickly recognized for his strong abilities in math. His earliest experiences with programming and crypto came at home, as his father was a computer scientist. Notably, Buterin’s early experience with the massively multiplayer online role-playing game World of Warcraft may have contributed to his desire to work outside of the traditional, centralized economics space: although a devoted player, he quit the game when developers made a change to the rules that he disagreed with.\n\nThrough high school and into college, Buterin honed his programming abilities and connected with influential mentors like the cryptographer Ian Goldberg, known for his involvement with the Tor Project among other things. It was during this time that he also first learned of Bitcoin, in 2011. Buterin wrote blog articles on cryptocurrency to earn his first BTC, eventually co-founding and contributing to Bitcoin Magazine.\n\nCollege Years and Ethereum Origins\n\nAs a student at the University of Waterloo, Buterin assisted Goldberg until his work in cryptocurrency began to take up a substantial portion of his time. At this stage, he left university to travel the world for several months to connect with Bitcoin developers. This experience was crucial to Buterin’s development of the Ethereum model, as he felt that the developers he met were all too concerned with specific uses for cryptocurrency. Buterin came to believe that the next generation of blockchain systems should be more versatile and broader.\n\nButerin’s interest in broadening Bitcoin’s scope led him to pursue a Turing-complete programming language to realize his vision. The young programmer created an initial white paper for this concept, which he called Ethereum, in 2013. Venture capitalist Peter Thiel’s eponymous Fellowship awarded Buterin a grant of $100,000 in 2014, allowing him to fully focus his efforts on developing the new ecosystem.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBetween Buterin’s initial white paper in 2013 and Ethereum’s eventual launch many months later, the vision developed to encompass much more than just a digital currency, adding ideas about smart contracts, decentralized applications, and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) as well. By early 2014, Buterin was ready to share this wider concept with the crypto community, and he formally announced the project in January. An initial coin offering followed, raising about $18 million worth of BTC and allowing Buterin and his development team to launch the Ethereum Foundation to oversee Ethereum’s continued growth. In July 2015, Ethereum officially launched.\n\nActivity Since Ethereum’s Launch\n\nThe story of Ethereum is one of prolonged success (although not entirely free of setbacks as well), as the platform is now responsible for settling trillions of dollars worth of transactions each year. Indeed, the number of Ethereum transactions eclipsed the number of Bitcoin transactions in 2021. It has also been instrumental as the foundational network supporting movements like non-fungible tokens, a host of altcoins, and much more.\n\nButerin has continued to play a highly active role in Ethereum’s success since launch. He has also been outspoken about what he sees as the ongoing dangers of centralized banking and currency control, making him a potent advocate for the crypto world even beyond his own network and token.\n\nButerin has also spoken out against what he sees as a potential “dystopian” future for the cryptocurrency industry in which ultra-wealthy whales fail to capitalize on the power of crypto to fight against authoritarian governments. He has pushed for Ethereum to play a role in making voting systems more fair, in helping to provide universal basic income, in supporting urban planning initiatives and public-works projects, and more. This may be one reason why Buterin was a particularly vocal supporter of The Merge, the late-2022 seismic shift in which Ethereum moved from a proof-of-work model to a proof-of-stake one. The Merge is expected to dramatically reduce the Ethereum network’s energy consumption and to lower costs. Additionally, Buterin is known for his philanthropy, as he donated $1.2 billion to India’s Covid relief fund in 2021, to several projects supporting Ukraine following Russia’s invasion in 2022, and additional funds to a variety of research foundations."}].

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
REASONING:
Given the conflicting signals from the on-chain and news analysts, as well as the reflection on past trading performance, it is clear that the current market trend for ETH is uncertain and potentially bearish. The on-chain signals are mixed, with a buy signal from the short_long_ma_signal but a sell signal from the macd_signal. The news articles highlight a range-bound market with a focus on privacy and security features, adding to the uncertainty.

Considering the historical success of buying during bullish trends and the potential for profit in the market, I believe that a more cautious and conservative trading approach is warranted at this time. However, it is important to remain open to opportunities for profit by considering more aggressive buying strategies during potential bullish reversals.

Therefore, I suggest a conservative approach with a slight sell action to mitigate potential losses in the current uncertain market trend:

Action: 0.2 (sell 20% ETH)

Given the conflicting signals from the on-chain and news analysts, as well as the stagnant market movements and concerns about centralization in the staking market, the current market trend for ETH appears to be uncertain and potentially bearish. It is crucial to adopt a cautious and conservative trading approach to mitigate potential losses in this market environment.

However, based on the recent performance and the potential for bullish reversals in the market, I believe that a slightly aggressive stance may be warranted at this time. Therefore, I will take a calculated risk and buy ETH with 20% cash in anticipation of a potential upward movement in the market.

Action: -0.2 (buy with 20% cash)
ACTION:
-0.2
DAILY RETURN:
-0.0003247212378243436
REASONING:
Given the mixed signals from the on-chain and news analysts, as well as the reflection on recent trading performance, it is clear that the current market trend for Ethereum (ETH) trading is uncertain and volatile. While there are concerns about node centralization, Chinese control over wallets, and competition from Solana, there are also positive developments such as the advocacy for privacy pools by Vitalik Buterin.

Considering the conflicting signals and the need for a balanced approach, I believe that a slightly conservative stance is still warranted. However, it is important to remain open to opportunities for profit during potential bullish reversals.

Based on the overall analysis and the need for a cautious yet opportunistic approach, I suggest a slightly conservative action of selling 0.2 (20%) of ETH.

Start your response with your brief reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

Based on the information provided by the on-chain and news analysts, as well as reflecting on past trading performance, it appears that the current market trend for ETH is slightly bearish. The on-chain indicators are showing conflicting signals, with a buy signal from the short-long moving average and a sell signal from the MACD. The news articles highlight concerns about high fees for MetaMask's new feature and phishing scams impacting the market.

Considering the overall market sentiment and potential risks, I would suggest a slightly conservative approach with a bearish outlook. However, I believe there is still room for profit-taking in the current market conditions. Therefore, I would recommend selling a portion of ETH with a value of 0.4 (sell 40% ETH) to capitalize on the bearish trend while maintaining some exposure to potential market reversals.

These issues, he emphasized, have remained constant over the past six years.\n\nBack in 2017, Ethereum took a significant step toward enhancing privacy by introducing zero-knowledge proofs like zk-SNARKs. Fast forward to 2023, and Ethereum has made substantial progress in this domain. Advanced technologies like STARK, Zero-Knowledge rollups and Cairo are now part of the Ethereum landscape. Nevertheless, privacy remains a concern, mainly due to legal and acceptance issues surrounding tokens generated by privacy systems, as exemplified by the Tornado Cash case, concluded the developer.\n\nButerin introduced the concept of proof-of-innocence, a means to validate tokens within privacy systems without revealing transaction origins. This concept underscores the importance of privacy and ongoing efforts to optimize zk-SNARKs for seamless integration into mainstream finance.\n\nCentralization and hacks\n\nShifting to consensus security, Ethereum has fully embraced a consensus mechanism, but challenges endure. These include simplifying the protocol, addressing centralization concerns and streamlining participation, notably through proof of stake.\n\nIn the realm of smart contract security, notable efforts have been made since 2017. Fast forward to 2023, and Ethereum has made significant progress in this arena. Buterin noted that the frequency of hacking incidents has dramatically decreased since the notorious DAO hack. Improved security measures and heightened awareness within the Ethereum community have played a pivotal role in mitigating risk.\n\nIn summary, Vitalik Buterin's keynote address shed valuable light on Ethereum's journey over the years. While recognizing ongoing challenges, his speech was aimed at demonstrating Ethereum's focus on practical solutions, mainstream adoption and enhancing user benefits."}, {'id': 46, 'url': 'https://news.google.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?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Fri, 08 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Crypto Price Today: Bitcoin rises above $26,200; Ethereum holds above $1,600 level - The Economic Times', 'content': 'The crypto tokens were trading higher in Friday\'s trade.

The data stored in blocks is not accessible to the Ethereum Virtual Machine and will be deleted after a certain time period, which is touted to drastically reduce transaction costs.\n\n“In reality, the cost of rollups is down to data availability. We are writing all the data to layer 1, which is why we have exactly the same security. But it’s expensive; it represents 95% of the cost.”\n\nLiochon said that Linea’s prover, which essentially handles the off-chain computation that verifies, bundles, and then creates a cryptographic proof of the combined transactions, only represents a fifth of the cost.\n\nThis highlights the major hurdle in making ZK-rollups the go-to scaling solution for the Ethereum ecosystem as opposed to other solutions like Optimistic Rollups.\n\nLiochon also said that Linea aims to be a general-purpose ZK-rollup that will be used for a variety of decentralized applications and solutions within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n“We are a generic rollup. We don’t want to have a specific use case or specific domain. It’s quite important to support all types of applications, including DeFi, gaming and social.”\n\nAs Cointelegraph previously reported, Consensys completed the launch of Linea in August 2023, having onboarding over 150 partners and bridging more than $26 million in Ether (ETH).\n\nMagazine: Here’s how Ethereum’s ZK-rollups can become interoperable'}, {'id': 0, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vY3J5cHRvLm5ld3MvbGVhcm4vZXRoZXJldW0tbm9kZXMtYW5kLWNsaWVudHMtYS1jb21wbGV0ZS1ndWlkZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Fri, 08 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Ethereum Node and Client: A Complete Guide - crypto.news', 'content': 'Ethereum nodes and clients play a pivotal role in the ongoing transformation of the crypto landscape. Ethereum, a cryptocurrency that has captured the attention of enthusiasts for months, is poised to surpass Bitcoin as the industry’s leading digital currency. Vitalik Buterin, the visionary creator of Ethereum, and the dedicated team of developers have been diligently working on a series of upgrades leading up to the eagerly anticipated main merge.\n\nEthereum nodes and clients form the backbone of this groundbreaking network. They are responsible for validating transactions, executing smart contracts, and ensuring the overall security and decentralization of the Ethereum ecosystem. In this article, we will delve deeper into the world of Ethereum nodes and clients, exploring their significance, functionality, and integral role in shaping the future of blockchain technology.\n\nThe Origin Story of Ethereum\n\nIn 2014, Vitalik Buterin published a white paper introducing Ethereum. The following year, 2015, saw the launch of the Ethereum platform by Buterin and Joe Lubin. Joe is also the founder of ConsenSys – a blockchain software company.\n\nEthereum has changed and improved a lot since it was first created, and all of these changes have led to one goal: making Ethereum the best crypto blockchain on the internet. Its operations are insanely good, and investors can trust that they are investing in a good project.\n\nIts ecosystem is made up of a variety of different specifications. Let’s take a look at some of its finest features: Ethereum Nodes and Clients.\n\nThe Ethereum Ecosystem\n\nIn simple terms, Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts. Smart contracts are basically application code that is executed and verified by the network. Ethereum has become the go-to platform for DeFi (decentralized finance) and NFTs (non-fungible tokens).\n\nEthereum was created to be scalable, programmable, secure, and decentralized. It’s the blockchain of choice for those who are creating technology on top of it. This blockchain is essential for these DeFi applications to develop and bring about a financial revolution.\n\nEthereum provides a highly flexible platform on which developers can create dApps using the native Solidity programming language and Ethereum Virtual Machine. The founders of Ethereum saw blockchain technology’s potential for more than just creating a secure virtual payment method. Now, Ethereum is changing from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS).\n\nWhat Is an Ethereum node?\n\nA node on the Ethereum network is any computer that runs the software required to interact with it. Nodes communicate with one another to validate transactions and store data about the blockchain’s state.\n\nDepending on your needs, whether a dApp or a wallet, any client can run three types of nodes: full, light, and archive. Each node will uniquely evaluate data and provide various synchronization methods. This refers to how quickly your node can get new information so that you can use it.\n\nFull Nodes: Full nodes are jam-packed with data. They keep and distribute all of the blockchain data from the Ethereum network. A full node will also participate in block validation.\n\nA full node can interact directly with any smart contract on a public blockchain. In addition, nodes can also deploy new smart contracts onto the same type of blockchain. However, running a full node may be costly in terms of hardware and bandwidth. Obtaining all of the data can be very time-consuming.\n\nLight Nodes: Light nodes are similar to full nodes. However, they handle significantly less information. The light node keeps track of the header chain. This is the most basic information in a block, such as a timestamp and the previous block’s hash.\n\nLight nodes are blockchain clients that only request data as needed. They can verify the validity of data, but they don’t participate in block validation. Remote clients often use light nodes.\n\nArchive Nodes: A archive node is a node that keeps all of the data that a full node does and creates an archive of past blockchain states. Even after a client has finished synchronizing, archive nodes will store historical data.\n\nOn the other hand, full and light nodes will “prune” the historical blockchain data. This means they can rebuild it but do not retain this information. Archive nodes may not be of much use to the average user. However, they’ve been instrumental in creating block explorers, wallet providers, and chain analytics applications.\n\nWhat Are Clients in Ethereum?\n\nIn computing, a “client” is software downloaded to your computer that helps you interact with another type of software or service provided by a server. An Ethereum client is a program that enables Ethereum nodes to read blocks on the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts. You’ll need to download an Ethereum client software to run a node.\n\nWith Ethereum, many different clients can be created using various programming languages. However, they all follow the same protocol and rules. This allows them to interact with each other on the Ethereum network.\n\nThe most popular functions of Ethereum clients include transaction and mining interfaces, but their applications extend far beyond basic blockchain operations. The Ethereum Foundation maintains the following Ethereum clients:\n\n· Geth (Go)\n\n· OpenEthereum (Rust)\n\n· Nethermind (C#, .NET)\n\n· Besu (Java)\n\n· Erigon (Go/Multi)\n\nIf the Ethereum Foundation doesn’t support your go-to programming language, don’t worry–numerous third-party Ethereum clients can provide you with the language support you need. There are 3 types of Ethereum clients.\n\nFull Client: Full clients enable any node on the network to complete all tasks, such as mining, transactions, validating block headers, and running smart contracts.\n\nFull clients enable any node on the network to complete all tasks, such as mining, transactions, validating block headers, and running smart contracts. Light Client: Light clients are a subset of client functionality. Because they do not keep the entire Ethereum blockchain, light clients can offer quicker speeds and free up data storage space over full clients.\n\nLight clients are a subset of client functionality. Because they do not keep the entire Ethereum blockchain, light clients can offer quicker speeds and free up data storage space over full clients. Remote Client: A remote client is a third kind of client that resembles a light client. The primary distinction is that a remote client does not keep its copy of the blockchain and does not validate transactions or block headers.\n\nRather than running a full client, remote clients simply connect to the Ethereum blockchain network via a light or full client. These clients are most often used as wallets for sending and receiving transactions.\n\nThe Difference Between Ethereum Nodes and Clients?\n\nAlthough nodes and clients are often used interchangeably, they serve different purposes in accessing the Ethereum network. It may help to think of nodes and clients like a computer accessing the internet: the node would be an operating system, such as Windows or iOS, while the client is the physical computer.\n\nYou can tap into the node operating system using a client computer. From there, you gain access to the internet–regardless of which type of computer or operating system you use.\n\nBottom Line\n\nNodes and clients are frequently equated, although they are not the same thing. The Clients and Nodes play vital roles in keeping the Ethereum blockchain functioning correctly. In short, an Ethereum node and client depend on each other to keep the Ethereum network functioning.'}]. Provide a brief report to analyze the news and estimate the market trend accordingly.

Start your response with your brief reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

The on-chain indicators are giving conflicting signals, with a buy signal from the short-long moving average but a sell signal from the MACD. The news articles highlight both challenges and positive developments in the Ethereum ecosystem, creating a sense of uncertainty.

Considering the cautious approach recommended in the reflection analyst report and the need to carefully analyze the market trends, I believe it is best to take a slightly conservative stance in this scenario. However, I also acknowledge the potential for profit-taking opportunities during bullish reversals.

Given the mixed signals and uncertain market conditions, I will take a slightly conservative approach and sell 20% of my ETH position. 

Action: 0.2 (sell 20% ETH)

The bot initiated 1.26 million on-chain transactions, as demonstrated on a Dune dashboard created by Dragonfly\'s Hildobby.\n\njaredfromsubway.eth has now spent 37k ETH ($70m) on gas, the most of any address on Ethereum 🤯\n\n\n\nsrc: https://t.co/Ftl9QzMJPr pic.twitter.com/TdAeRvvzjJ — hildobby (@hildobby_) September 8, 2023\n\nAs such, this bot becomes the largest Ethereum (ETH) wallet in terms of gas spending. To provide context, the second position is occupied by one of Binance-controlled wallets with over 7.73 million transactions. It spends on gas less than half of what Jared From Subway transferred to Ethereum (ETH) validators.\n\nIt should also be noted that the Ethereum (ETH) gas price inches closer to multi-month lows. The current gas price is 9.39 Gwei, which means that one Uniswap (UNI) exchange is charged with approximately a $4 fee, as per Etherscan.\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) community is thrilled by such impressive statistics of an Ethereum MEV bot. Meanwhile, the net profit or PnL data for the account are yet to be calculated.\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, MEV bots are responsible for the majority of trading activity on DEXes. For instance, 80% of Uniswap\'s (UNI) trading volume across all pairs is generated by AI-powered MEV bots.\n\nWhat is special about MEV bot by JaredFromSubway?\n\nMEV bots are automated mechanisms designed to frontrun pending trades in the Ethereum (ETH) mempool by corrupting validators with higher fees. Once the bot identifies a large transaction, it can manipulate the price of this or that asset and execute the deal with a more attractive price.\n\nThe first signs of activity from the jaredfromsubway.eth-backed bot were registered in February 2023. Experts say that its algorithms are more sophisticated: It managed to have its transactions included in over 60% of Ethereum (ETH) blocks. In April 2023, it was spending over $1.1 million on gas daily.\n\nThe net number of jaredfromsubway.eth victims might exceed hundreds of thousands of DEX traders.\n\nThe bot is named after Jared Scott Fogle, a spokesperson of the American fast food chain Subway.

On Wednesday, September 6, Ark Invest filed for the first Ethereum spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States.\n\nThis ETF application had a tame impact on the price of Ether, with the cryptocurrency only climbing to $1,650 the following day. Moreover, the token has almost fully reversed the minor gains from the significant development.\n\nEthereum Price Registers 0.1% Rise Last Week – Here’s Why\n\nEthereum currently changes hands at about $1,628, according to data from CoinGecko. A negligible 0.1% price increase in the last seven days underscores the struggling market performance of the second-largest cryptocurrency.\n\nA spot ETH exchange-traded fund is an investment vehicle that tracks the price of Ethereum on the spot market, allowing investors to buy and sell the crypto asset via a brokerage account. A product of this kind is expected to boost interest and investment in the Ether token.\n\nNevertheless, the price of ETH has remained relatively unmoved this week despite the optimistic news. A recent report by blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock has provided insight into why the news barely impacted the price of Ethereum.\n\n‘Supply & Demand Balance’\n\nAccording to the data analytics platform, the current supply and demand balance is one of the primary reasons why the ETH price continues to move sideways. “Large holdings are concentrated close to ETH’s current price, consolidating prices in a tight range,” IntoTheBlock said.\n\nSource: IntoTheBlock\n\nIntoTheBlock data shows that a total of 5.1 million ETH was acquired below the $1,600 mark to create support, while a total of 6.5 million ETH was purchased at a price above this level to establish resistance. The blockchain analytics firm concluded that traders agree to transact within a narrow range with a large concentration of ETH positions.\n\n‘Automated Buying, Discretionary Selling’\n\nAdditionally, IntoTheBlock believes that while bullish traders seemed to have bought the news, “discretionary sellers” overtook the narrative not too long after.\n\n“A key factor behind the discretionary selling is likely to be FTX’s upcoming liquidation of reportedly $3B in crypto holdings,” the report read.\n\nWhile FTX has yet to disclose when it intends to execute these liquidations, it is likely that recent activity on the exchange’s wallets alarmed the market.\n\nThis sentiment also seems to be reflected in the performance of SOL after global payment giant VISA disclosed that it will use the Solana network for payment settlements. While the value of SOL jumped by more than 5% to trade above $20 immediately after the announcement, the cryptocurrency is back trading beneath $19.5.\n\nWith the Ethereum and Solana tokens constituting a significant portion of FTX’s holdings, it is likely that the slow market performance of these assets is driven by traders being cautious because of the impending liquidation.\n\nETH price continues to move sideways on the daily timeframe | Source: ETHUSDT chart on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Quite the opposite: their objective is to expand their customer base and gain market share.”\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn the other hand, Panetta thinks the proposed European central bank digital currency (CBDC), the digital euro, “would pay due attention to orderly adjustments in the financial sector while offering payment service providers a platform for innovations with pan-euro area reach,” he said.\n\nOn Tuesday, top-five South Korean financial conglomerate Hana Financial Group announced a partnership between its KEB Hana Bank and crypto custodian BitGo for late 2024.\n\nThe new deal ties a major domestic financial player to the crypto industry, although KEB Hana Bank has already taken steps into blockchain when it opened a digital branch in metaverse platform The Sandbox.\n\nCrypto-friendly payments giant Visa said on Tuesday that it has now expanded its settlement options to include USDC on the Solana blockchain. The company also announced that it was working with merchant acquirers Worldpay and Nuvei to allow them to settle using USDC instead of fiat.\n\nOn Wednesday, The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)—recognized by the SEC as the designated accounting standard setter for public companies—voted unanimously to change how companies disclose crypto holdings in order to give greater transparency to the trade. The new rules take effect in 2025.\n\nTwo global financial regulators, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the G20’s risk watchdog, the Financial Stability Board (FSB), on Thursday released a white paper outlining their plans for coordinated action to ensure that there is a “comprehensive policy and regulatory response for crypto-assets [as it] is necessary to address the risks of crypto-assets to macroeconomic and financial stability.”\n\nWhile the paper’s authors acknowledge that crypto doesn’t currently pose a risk to the financial system, they argue that widespread adoption would undermine the effectiveness of monetary policy.\n\nThe paper recommends constituencies “safeguard monetary sovereignty and strengthen monetary policy frameworks, guard against excessive capital flow volatility and adopt unambiguous tax treatment of crypto-assets” to protect themselves from risks.\n\nAD\n\nAD'}, {'id': 12, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIzLzA5LzA5LzItY3J5cHRvY3VycmVuY2llcy10aGF0LWNvdWxkLWR3YXJmLWV0aGVyZXVtL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Sat, 09 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': '2 Cryptocurrencies That Could Dwarf Ethereum - The Motley Fool', 'content': 'Ethereum (ETH -1.09%) remains the second-most valuable cryptocurrency in the world by market capitalization, trailing only Bitcoin (BTC -0.71%). Given Ethereum\'s dominant position in so many key areas of the blockchain world, it can be hard to imagine any other cryptocurrency ever surpassing it.\n\nBut for the past few years, a long line of rivals have attempted to do exactly that. Many of them have been described as "Ethereum killers," due to their superior performance metrics and rapidly growing blockchain ecosystems. And two that particularly stand out right now are Cardano (ADA 4.66%) and Solana (SOL 8.56%). Let\'s take a closer look at how they might eventually surpass Ethereum over the long haul.\n\n1. Cardano\n\nWith a market cap of nearly $9 billion, Cardano ranks as the seventh-largest cryptocurrency in the world. That might sound impressive, but Ethereum has a market cap of almost $200 billion, so Cardano needs to increase in value by a multiple of 20 to 25 just to reach Ethereum\'s current size. To dwarf Ethereum, Cardano would likely need to 50x in value.\n\nThat\'s a big ask, so it\'s important that the founder of Cardano, Charles Hoskinson, also happens to be one of the co-founders of Ethereum. If there\'s anyone who knows how to out-Ethereum Ethereum, it\'s Hoskinson. He\'s been very vocal about the structural flaws of Ethereum in the past, arguing that Cardano has superior blockchain technology. This summer, he even suggested that Cardano would eventually surpass Ethereum and Bitcoin to become the top cryptocurrency in the world.\n\nFrom my perspective, it all starts with decentralized finance (DeFi). But in 2021, Cardano upgraded its blockchain to support the smart contracts required for DeFi, and it has continually made new improvements and upgrades since then. This year, for example, Cardano saw the launch of its first stablecoin, as well as a burst of new activity on decentralized exchanges. If Cardano\'s DeFi ecosystem continues to grow quickly, this could lead to rapid gains in valuation.\n\nMoreover, growth in emerging markets could send Cardano soaring. As Hoskinson outlined in a recent interview, Cardano is looking for blockchain partners across Africa, South America, Asia, and the Middle East. If Cardano becomes the most popular blockchain network in these regions, then it could have a massive impact on its future valuation.\n\n2. Solana\n\nSimilar in size to Cardano, Solana has a market cap of $8 billion. So it will need the same types of growth catalysts as Cardano to ever surpass Ethereum. In short, Solana needs a big, think-outside-the-box idea to drive 50-fold valuation gains.\n\nAnd that big idea might just be mobile crypto. Back in summer 2022, Solana first unveiled its strategic vision for mobile crypto, including a new flagship Android-based mobile device optimized for crypto and a software development kit to help developers around the world build for mobile crypto. It sounded like a lot of hype, but this spring, Solana finally launched its Saga crypto phone. The concept was simple but brilliant: Everything you do on your phone involving crypto should be simple and intuitive, and you should be able to bring crypto with you wherever you go.\n\nThe problem is that the collapse of FTX last year had disastrous implications for Solana, which had extensive links to former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried. All the fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) swirling around Solana since the FTX meltdown has taken a toll on the Solana ecosystem. Some high-profile NFT collections, for example, decided to migrate to other blockchains this year, and overall activity on the Solana ecosystem has just started to regain its previous footing. The good news is that Solana is up more than 100% for the year, so the worst may be behind it.\n\nWhat are the chances of overtaking Ethereum?\n\nFor either Cardano or Solana to ever overtake Ethereum, a lot has to go right. The fact that there have been so many purported "Ethereum killers," and none of them have ever managed to unseat Ethereum tells you a lot. The bottom line is that it\'s very difficult to overtake a market leader with a first-mover advantage, especially within the tech sector.\n\nIf forced to choose between Cardano and Solana, I\'d pick Solana. This is a crypto that is not just trying to out-Ethereum Ethereum, it\'s actually proposing a new approach to blockchain technology based around mobile. For me, that\'s an exciting concept and a big reason why I think Solana might just pull off what many people think is impossible.'}].

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
REASONING:
Given the mixed signals from the on-chain and news analysts, as well as the reflection on recent trading performance, it is clear that the current market trend for Ethereum (ETH) trading is uncertain and volatile. While there are concerns about node centralization, Chinese control over wallets, and competition from Solana, there are also positive developments such as the advocacy for privacy pools by Vitalik Buterin.

Considering the conflicting signals and the need for a balanced approach, I believe that a slightly conservative stance is still warranted. However, it is important to remain open to opportunities for profit during potential bullish reversals.

Based on the overall analysis and the need for a cautious yet opportunistic approach, I suggest a slightly conservative action of selling 0.2 (20%) of ETH.
ACTION:
0.2
DAILY RETURN:
0.004375550725786992
REASONING:
Based on the information provided by the on-chain and news analysts, as well as reflecting on past trading performance, it appears that the current market trend for ETH is slightly bearish. The on-chain indicators are showing conflicting signals, with a buy signal from the short-long moving average and a sell signal from the MACD. The news articles highlight concerns about high fees for MetaMask's new feature and phishing scams impacting the market.

Considering the overall market sentiment and potential risks, I would suggest a slightly conservative approach with a bearish outlook. However, I believe there is still room for profit-taking in the current market conditions. Therefore, I would recommend selling a portion of ETH with a value of 0.4 (sell 40% ETH) to capitalize on the bearish trend while maintaining some exposure to potential market reversals.

Action: 0.4 (sell 40% ETH)
ACTION:
0.4
DAILY RETURN:
-0.003189561923039319
REASONING:
Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, news analyst report, and reflection analyst report, it is clear that the current market trend for ETH is somewhat indecisive and mixed. The on-chain indicators are giving conflicting signals, with a buy signal from the short-long moving average but a sell signal from the MACD. The news articles highlight both challenges and positive developments in the Ethereum ecosystem, creating a sense of uncertainty.

Considering the cautious approach recommended in the reflection analyst report and the need to carefully analyze the market trends, I believe it is best to take a slightly conservative stance in this scenario. However, I also acknowledge the potential for profit-taking opportunities during bullish reversals.

Given the mixed signals and uncertain market conditions, I will take a slightly conservative approach and sell 20% of my ETH position.

*** REFLECTION ANALYST RESPONSE ***
In reviewing my recent trading performance, it is evident that taking a slightly conservative approach has been beneficial in navigating the uncertain and volatile market conditions for Ethereum (ETH) trading. Selling portions of my ETH position when the market trend was bearish helped to mitigate potential losses and capitalize on profit-taking opportunities. 

Effective strategies included closely monitoring on-chain indicators, news analyst reports, and reflecting on past trading performance to make informed decisions. However, there were instances where conflicting signals and mixed market conditions led to less profitable outcomes, such as selling ETH when the market trend was indecisive.

Key trends in the current cryptocurrency market that are likely to influence future trades include the impact of on-chain indicators like short-long moving averages and MACD, as well as news developments within the Ethereum ecosystem. It is important to remain cautious and open to profit-taking opportunities during potential bullish reversals.

Moving forward, a slightly conservative trading approach seems warranted given the uncertain market conditions and conflicting signals. By continuing to analyze market trends and staying informed on news developments, I can make more informed decisions to navigate the volatile cryptocurrency market effectively.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: In reviewing my recent trading performance, it is evident that taking a slightly conservative approach has been beneficial in navigating the uncertain and volatile market conditions for Ethereum (ETH) trading. Selling portions of my ETH position when the market trend was bearish helped to mitigate potential losses and capitalize on profit-taking opportunities. 

Effective strategies included closely monitoring on-chain indicators, news analyst reports, and reflecting on past trading performance to make informed decisions. However, there were instances where conflicting signals and mixed market conditions led to less profitable outcomes, such as selling ETH when the market trend was indecisive.

Key trends in the current cryptocurrency market that are likely to influence future trades include the impact of on-chain indicators like short-long moving averages and MACD, as well as news developments within the Ethereum ecosystem. It is important to remain cautious and open to profit-taking opportunities during potential bullish reversals.

Moving forward, a slightly conservative trading approach seems warranted given the uncertain market conditions and conflicting signals. By continuing to analyze market trends and staying informed on news developments, I can make more informed decisions to navigate the volatile cryptocurrency market effectively.

Start your response with your brief reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Given the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, the market trend for Ethereum (ETH) trading appears to be relatively stable with conflicting signals from the MACD and Bollinger Bands indicators. The short-long moving average signal is showing a "buy" indication, which could potentially lead to a bullish trend in the near future. However, the uncertainty in the market suggests a cautious approach is warranted.

The news analyst report highlights some positive sentiment towards Solana as an Ethereum competitor, which could potentially impact market sentiment towards ETH. Despite high activity on the Ethereum network, news developments have not significantly impacted the price of ETH.

Reflecting on past trading performance, a slightly conservative approach has been beneficial in navigating market volatility. However, it is important to capitalize on profit-taking opportunities during potential bullish reversals.

Considering the conflicting signals and the potential for a bullish trend based on the short-long moving average signal, I would suggest a slightly bullish action to buy ETH with a moderate confidence level.

Ethereum [ETH] and other top networks have experienced a significant slowdown in activity as is usually the case under such circumstances.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nThe impact of the current market conditions was evident in multiple facets of the Ethereum network. This includes its TVL, which was a long way from its historic high. It had a total value locked of $21.42 billion at the time of writing, which is a stark contrast compared to its historic peak above $108 billion in 2021.\n\nDespite the slightly improved conditions so far this year, the market is still in a state of caution. As such, we have seen significant outflows in TVL since April. An indication that investor confidence in ETH’s bullish potential is not there yet.\n\nRegardless of the slow and negative TVL growth in the last few months, there are some areas in ETH’s journey this year that inspire some more confidence. For example, Ethereum’s total value locked in ETH deposit contracts just achieved a new historic peak at over 28.7 million ETH.\n\n? #Ethereum $ETH Total Value in the ETH 2.0 Deposit Contract just reached an ATH of 28,734,846 ETH View metric:https://t.co/SzbMPqvhlb pic.twitter.com/eiDkE5DVw4 — glassnode alerts (@glassnodealerts) September 9, 2023\n\nThe total value locked also confirms that Ethereum’s ecosystem is still experiencing healthy network activity. But how is ETH fairing especially as the market appears to be stuck in limbo?\n\nETH supply distribution reveals something interesting about whale activity\n\nNow that ETH’s total value is up, let’s take a look at what has been happening with whale activity. According to its supply distribution metric, addresses holding over 10 million ETH (denoted in red) have been accumulating in the last 4 weeks. This category controls the largest share of ETH’s circulating supply at 23.55%.\n\nAddresses in the 10,000 to 100,000 ETH category have also been accumulating ETH since the start of September.

One year ago, investors salivated at the thought of what impact The Merge might have on Ethereum\'s future price.\n\nBut guess what? Ethereum is still trading under $1,650, at almost exactly the same price that it was 12 months ago. This raises an interesting question: What exactly have we learned from Ethereum and The Merge? And how can those lessons be applied when evaluating other cryptocurrencies? Let\'s take a closer look.\n\nTech upgrades\n\nPerhaps the biggest lesson here is that tech upgrades, no matter how big, do not always lead to huge price increases. This is an important point to keep in mind, based on how much hype many of these tech upgrades get. They are usually presented as major catalysts capable of sending a crypto soaring. But the truth might be quite different.\n\nWhat\'s interesting in the case of Ethereum is that The Merge was a truly transformational change and theoretically should have had a dramatic impact on Ethereum\'s price. The Merge transformed Ethereum from an old, energy-intensive, proof-of-work blockchain into a modern, energy-efficient, proof-of-stake blockchain. So, The Merge was a very different type of event than a typical annual upgrade that many blockchains undergo, and yet it still didn\'t have an appreciable impact on Ethereum\'s price.\n\nFrom my perspective, it means that the "tech upgrade = growth catalyst" investment thesis is no longer useful for evaluating cryptocurrencies. Going forward, you can pretty much assume that either the market is going to price in these upgrades as they are announced or the market is going to ignore the upgrade entirely. So, trying to time your investment decisions around key upgrades is not likely to be an effective strategy.\n\nRegulatory risk\n\nThe second big lesson from The Merge is that new business models can lead to new regulatory headaches. As soon as Ethereum became a proof-of-stake blockchain, it meant that there was going to be much more of a focus on crypto staking, which is the process of "locking up" your crypto in exchange for a financial reward. Until The Merge, crypto staking was a sleepy backwater of the crypto industry. But after The Merge, everyone was trying to figure out how to capture those financial rewards.\n\nAnd that included, unfortunately, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). From the perspective of SEC chairman Gary Gensler, new crypto-staking products sounded a lot like securities, and he vowed to take a closer look. In February, the SEC ended up going after cryptocurrency exchange Kraken for its crypto-staking activities, and that immediately got the attention of the market. Right now, Coinbase Global (COIN 1.38%) is locked in an epic battle with the SEC over the future of crypto staking.\n\nIf you parse through all the filings, documents, and back-and-forth between market participants and regulatory authorities, it sounds a lot like the SEC is not so much opposed to the concept of staking as it is to the way staking is marketed to retail investors, who might think it\'s a no-brainer, no-risk guaranteed return of some kind. But still, if you\'re an investor in Ethereum, you have to be aware that some regulatory risk does exist here, and it was all brought about by a change in business model (i.e., the shift from mining to staking).\n\nMacroeconomic outlook\n\nThe third big lesson is that the macroeconomic outlook matters more for crypto than many of us would like to admit. Gone are the days when the crypto market was completely separate from traditional, mainstream financial markets. With a surge of new institutional money into crypto comes a surge of institutional thinking about the crypto market. And that means a 24/7 obsession with the macroeconomic outlook.\n\nThus, while 2023 should have been all about the new era of Ethereum 2.0, it has instead been all about regional bank crises, Federal Reserve policy, jobs data, and inflation data. Long story short, there is absolutely no way Ethereum is going to skyrocket in price if banks are failing, inflation is surging, and economic growth is anemic. This completely changes the game for many crypto investors, who need to take a much more holistic view of the financial markets into account when choosing where to invest.\n\nA framework for analyzing cryptocurrencies\n\nTaken together, these three lessons can offer the basic framework for evaluating just about any cryptocurrency. First, make sure you understand the underlying business model of a crypto. Next, layer in some macroeconomic analysis, with a focus on key events or metrics that are being watched by the biggest institutional investors. And only then can you start to focus on all the interesting features of a new tech upgrade. In short, the tech upgrade is just the cherry on top of the final dessert, not the main course.\n\nAnd Ethereum? I\'m still bullish on this crypto, even if it hasn\'t taken off the way it was supposed to one year ago. It\'s still up 35% for the year, and recent developments seem to suggest that institutional investors are adding to their Ethereum positions. But I\'m not trying to time the market around new tech upgrades. Instead, I\'m investing in Ethereum because I have confidence in its long-term growth prospects.'}].

REASONING:
Based on the information provided by the on-chain and news analysts, as well as reflecting on past trading performance, it appears that the current market trend for ETH is slightly bearish. The on-chain indicators are showing conflicting signals, with a buy signal from the short-long moving average and a sell signal from the MACD. The news articles highlight concerns about high fees for MetaMask's new feature and phishing scams impacting the market.

Considering the overall market sentiment and potential risks, I would suggest a slightly conservative approach with a bearish outlook. However, I believe there is still room for profit-taking in the current market conditions. Therefore, I would recommend selling a portion of ETH with a value of 0.4 (sell 40% ETH) to capitalize on the bearish trend while maintaining some exposure to potential market reversals.

The on-chain indicators are giving conflicting signals, with a buy signal from the short-long moving average but a sell signal from the MACD. The news articles highlight both challenges and positive developments in the Ethereum ecosystem, creating a sense of uncertainty.

Considering the cautious approach recommended in the reflection analyst report and the need to carefully analyze the market trends, I believe it is best to take a slightly conservative stance in this scenario.

In reviewing my recent trading performance, it is evident that a slightly conservative approach has been more successful in navigating the current market conditions for ETH trading. The effective strategies that led to successful outcomes include capitalizing on profit-taking opportunities during potential bullish reversals and taking a cautious stance when market signals are conflicting or uncertain.

On the other hand, the ineffective strategy that led to a loss of profit was taking a slightly bullish action in a market that was showing mixed signals and uncertainty. This highlights the importance of carefully analyzing all available information and indicators before making trading decisions.

Key trends and indicators in the current cryptocurrency market that are likely to influence future trades include conflicting signals from on-chain indicators such as the MACD and short-long moving average, as well as news developments impacting market sentiment towards Ethereum and its competitors like Solana.

Given the current market conditions and the need for a cautious approach, a slightly conservative trading strategy seems warranted. It is important to remain vigilant, analyze all available information thoroughly, and be prepared to adjust trading strategies based on changing market trends.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: In reviewing my recent trading performance, it is evident that a slightly conservative approach has been more successful in navigating the current market conditions for ETH trading. The effective strategies that led to successful outcomes include capitalizing on profit-taking opportunities during potential bullish reversals and taking a cautious stance when market signals are conflicting or uncertain.

On the other hand, the ineffective strategy that led to a loss of profit was taking a slightly bullish action in a market that was showing mixed signals and uncertainty. This highlights the importance of carefully analyzing all available information and indicators before making trading decisions.

Key trends and indicators in the current cryptocurrency market that are likely to influence future trades include conflicting signals from on-chain indicators such as the MACD and short-long moving average, as well as news developments impacting market sentiment towards Ethereum and its competitors like Solana.

Given the current market conditions and the need for a cautious approach, a slightly conservative trading strategy seems warranted. It is important to remain vigilant, analyze all available information thoroughly, and be prepared to adjust trading strategies based on changing market trends.

Start your response with your brief reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, the market trend for ETH appears to be relatively stable with a slight bullish bias, although the MACD signal is indicating a sell. The news analyst report also suggests some negative sentiment due to security concerns and price predictions.

Considering the conflicting signals and uncertainty in the market, it is important to take a cautious approach. However, given the overall stable trend with a slight bullish bias, I believe that the market may continue to show some upward movement in the short term.

Therefore, I will take a slightly conservative approach and suggest a buy action with a moderate confidence level to capitalize on potential upward movement in the market.

However, the dramatically low on-chain activity puts an end to this status of second largest cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum (ETH) becomes inflationary thanks to market exhaustion\n\nIn the last 30 days, Ethereum (ETH) registered a net increase in the number of coins in its supply. A total of 63,490 Ethers (ETH) were burned, while 65,548 Ethers (ETH) were issued. As such, 2,058 "new" coins were added to Ethereum\'s (ETH) circulating supply, per statistics tracked by Ultrasound Money analytical dashboard.\n\nImage by Ultrasound Money\n\nAfter the activation of Ethereum\'s EIP 1559 mechanism, such periods of "inflationary" status occur periodically. The ongoing "dip," though, is a special one: the Ethereum (ETH) burn rate declines faster, so the delta between the "ETH issued" and "ETH burned" numbers increases aggressively.\n\nIn the past year, the Ethereum (ETH) supply has fallen by over 300,000 ETH thanks to the activation of EIP 1559. The ongoing anomaly should be attributed to super-low activity of Ethereum (ETH) accounts.\n\nAccording to multiple trackers, ETH gas metrics are close to 2023 lows or have even dropped below them. For instance, CoinMetrics sees a mean ETH fee below $2.5, which is the lowest level since January 2023.\n\nOne OpenSea sale can therefore be confirmed for as low as $3, while on-chain swaps via Uniswap (UNI) will be charged with $7.6.\n\nMEV bot became top Ethereum (ETH) gas spender\n\nAmid the apathetic performance of on-chain actors, MEV bot becomes the most productive spender of Ethereum (ETH) gas. As covered by U.Today previously, Jared From Subway, the operator of the most effective MEV bots, paid over $70 million in gas since being launched in February 2023.\n\nThe bot made over 1.1 million transactions but paid more in gas fees than the wallets of exchanges that used Ethereum (ETH) 10 times more frequently.\n\nPer the statistics, during periods of pale market performance, Ethereum (ETH) MEV bots — mechanisms for frontrunning transactions by paying extra gas fees — might be responsible for 80-90% of top DEXes\' trading volumes.'}, {'id': 7, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vZGFpbHlob2RsLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA5LzExL2V4dHJlbWUtZXRoZXJldW0tY3Jhc2gtbm93LWluLXRoZS1jYXJkcy1hY2NvcmRpbmctdG8tYW5hbHlzdC1iZW5qYW1pbi1jb3dlbi1oZXJlcy1oaXMtdGFyZ2V0L9IBggFodHRwczovL2RhaWx5aG9kbC5jb20vMjAyMy8wOS8xMS9leHRyZW1lLWV0aGVyZXVtLWNyYXNoLW5vdy1pbi10aGUtY2FyZHMtYWNjb3JkaW5nLXRvLWFuYWx5c3QtYmVuamFtaW4tY293ZW4taGVyZXMtaGlzLXRhcmdldC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Mon, 11 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Extreme Ethereum Crash Now in the Cards, According to Analyst Benjamin Cowen – Here’s His Target - The Daily Hodl', 'content': "A widely followed crypto analyst says that a massive crash for the leading smart contract platform is within the realm of possibility.\n\nIn a new strategy session, crypto trader Benjamin Cowen tells his 787,000 YouTube subscribers that a freefall to the $400-$800 range is in the cards for Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest crypto asset by market cap.\n\n“There’s a good chance that [there will] be a lower low, and it might not be a much lower low, maybe it just goes down to just below $800. It could go lower. It could go to $600 or $500 or $400, but that is in the cards for Ethereum.”\n\nCowen also says that a move toward his downside targets would mark 2023 as the year when both ETH bulls and bears got “sufficiently wrecked.”\n\n“You could have a move where it sort of just slowly fades with some occasional pumps back up to the upside just to get everyone excited, and then down into the end of the year and then pop back up, right.\n\nIt could do something like that – where it puts in a low, it puts in a high it then sweeps the high, and then sweeps the low. That way, by the end of the pre-halving year, both the bulls and the bears are sufficiently wrecked.\n\nThen you went through the whole year and both sides thought they were right for the whole year, but they were really right for only half the year and the other side was right for the other half of the year, but by the end of the year, everyone’s wrecked.”\n\nThe crypto strategist goes on to say that for the rest of 2023, he expects Ethereum to post lower highs and lower lows.\n\nEthereum is trading for $1,609 at time of writing, a 1.2% decrease during the last 24 hours.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Discover SCENE\n\nInstitutions have fallen out of love with Ethereum in 2023, selling upwards of nine digits of the asset in the year to date.\n\nAccording to the latest analysis by CoinShares, the number two cryptocurrency saw $4.8 million in outflows this past week, reaching $108 million in sales this year. That places it as the most sold digital asset by large entities, wrote James Butterfill, head of research for CoinShares.\n\nThe analyst labeled it the “least loved digital asset” for exchange-traded product (ETP) investors, trouncing its second-place holder, Tron, by more than $50 million.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHowever, all that could change soon after Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest applied for the first spot Ethereum ETF last week—the first of its kind in the United States. And that news comes after the network turned inflationary and on-chain activity plummeted as the grueling bear market carries on.\n\nWhat Ethereum has felt this year is broadly based among digital assets, per CoinShares.\n\nSentiment regarding institutions purchasing crypto remains poor, according to their weekly report published this morning. It showed a fourth consecutive week of selling, with outflows totaling $59 million over the past seven days.\n\nThe current run of outflows, wrote James Butterfill, reaches $294 million, representing 0.9% of total assets under management (AUM).\n\nSelling came primarily from North America, with Canada and the United States offloading $17.6 million and $12.3 million in the past seven days. Germany led the way across the Atlantic and into Europe, with $20 million worth of selling.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nButterfill told Decrypt that the main reason behind the rampant selling is the U.S. dollar. It has shown strength as of late, driven by the “market’s belief we are in a soft landing scenario,” posting eight straight weeks of green candles.\n\nEven so, he reckons that as the year ends, it will “increasingly be seen that this isn’t the case,” especially if high-interest rates kick in.\n\nAlthough the previous report by CoinShares highlighted a bunch of under-the-surface trading, with volumes skyrocketing by 90% to $2.8 billion, this week\'s trading activity plummeted.\n\nVolumes “are super low,” revealed Butterfill, averaging “just” $2.3 billion daily over the past month, compared to the yearly average of $7 billion. The last seven days were an even further cry from these numbers, dropping by 73% to $743 million.\n\nThis suggests, the analyst told Decrypt, an “apathetic investor”—clarifying, however, that the market saw a very similar scenario prior to the last two Bitcoin halvings.\n\nBitcoin was the most damaged crypto asset last week, with large entities offloading a whopping $69 million worth of the asset despite being in the green the week prior.\n\nAdding to the bearishness, Bitcoin short products saw the largest weekly inflows since March, with $15 million pouring into these instruments. “Timing wise this is interesting as the inflows in March also came at a time of heightened regulatory uncertainty,” said Butterfill.\n\nWhat’s to come? Butterfill suspects that many investors are waiting to see what the Fed will do this month with interest rates, with any potential weakness in the dollar “likely to be supportive for Bitcoin.”\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe analyst concluded, however, that CPI could come in above expectations due to the swift surge in gasoline prices. He also pointed to FTX, telling Decrypt, "There are the FTX asset sales ‘stock overhangs’ potentially to deal with too.”'}].

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
REASONING:
Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, news analyst report, and reflection analyst report, it is clear that the current market trend for ETH is somewhat indecisive and mixed. The on-chain indicators are giving conflicting signals, with a buy signal from the short-long moving average but a sell signal from the MACD. The news articles highlight both challenges and positive developments in the Ethereum ecosystem, creating a sense of uncertainty.

Considering the cautious approach recommended in the reflection analyst report and the need to carefully analyze the market trends, I believe it is best to take a slightly conservative stance in this scenario. However, I also acknowledge the potential for profit-taking opportunities during bullish reversals.

Given the mixed signals and uncertain market conditions, I will take a slightly conservative approach and sell 20% of my ETH position. 

Action: 0.2 (sell 20% ETH)
ACTION:

REASONING:
Given the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, the market trend for Ethereum (ETH) trading appears to be relatively stable with conflicting signals from the MACD and Bollinger Bands indicators. The short-long moving average signal is showing a "buy" indication, which could potentially lead to a bullish trend in the near future. However, the uncertainty in the market suggests a cautious approach is warranted.

The news analyst report highlights some positive sentiment towards Solana as an Ethereum competitor, which could potentially impact market sentiment towards ETH. Despite high activity on the Ethereum network, news developments have not significantly impacted the price of ETH.

Reflecting on past trading performance, a slightly conservative approach has been beneficial in navigating market volatility. However, it is important to capitalize on profit-taking opportunities during potential bullish reversals.

Considering the conflicting signals and the potential for a bullish trend based on the short-long moving average signal, I would suggest a slightly bullish action to buy ETH with a moderate confidence level.

Key trends and indicators in the current cryptocurrency market that are likely to influence future trades include the conflicting signals from on-chain indicators such as the MACD and short-long moving average, as well as the impact of news developments on market sentiment. It is important to carefully analyze these factors and consider the overall stability of the market before making trading decisions.

Given the mixed signals and uncertainty in the market, a slightly conservative approach may be warranted to mitigate risks and capitalize on potential profit-taking opportunities. It is crucial to remain cautious and closely monitor market trends to make informed trading decisions in the volatile cryptocurrency market.

Start your response with your brief reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Given the mixed signals from the on-chain and news analysts, as well as the reflection on recent trading performance, it is clear that the market trend for ETH is currently uncertain and potentially bearish. The downward trend in price, coupled with the conflicting signals from the on-chain indicators and the negative sentiment from news articles, suggests a cautious approach is warranted.

However, considering the potential reversal indicated by the bollinger_bands_signal switching to a buy signal at the last data point, there may be a slight opportunity for a short-term uptrend. Taking into account this potential reversal and the need to balance risk and reward, I would suggest a slightly bearish action to sell a portion of ETH with a moderate confidence level.

Action: 0.4 (sell 40% ETH)

Based on the recent price and auxiliary information provided, it can be observed that the market trend for ETH cryptocurrency has been relatively stable with a buy signal for short_long_ma, sell signal for macd, and hold signal for bollinger bands.

The buy signals for macd and bollinger bands in the last two data points may indicate a potential bullish trend in the near future. It is important to monitor the market closely for any further developments to confirm the trend.

Overall, the market trend for ETH cryptocurrency appears to be slightly bullish based on the recent data, but further analysis and confirmation are needed to make a more accurate estimation.

Based on the news articles provided, there are a few key points to consider for analyzing the market trend:

1. Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin's Twitter hack due to a SIM swap incident highlights the importance of cybersecurity in the cryptocurrency space. This incident may lead to increased awareness and emphasis on securing accounts and assets, potentially impacting investor sentiment in the short term.

2. The significant liquidations totaling over $185.97 million in the cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin witnessing high liquidation values, indicate a period of market volatility. This could lead to short-term price fluctuations and uncertainty among traders and investors.

3. Apple CEO Tim Cook's positive comments on cryptocurrency in 2021, coinciding with the near peak of valuations for Bitcoin and Ethereum, may have influenced investor sentiment at that time. However, the subsequent price declines for Bitcoin and Ethereum suggest that market timing and external factors play a crucial role in investment outcomes.

Overall, the combination of cybersecurity concerns, market volatility, and the impact of influential figures' statements on cryptocurrency prices suggests a mixed market trend. Investors should closely monitor developments in the cryptocurrency space, exercise caution, and consider diversification strategies to navigate potential risks and opportunities in the market.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
REASONING:
Given the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, the market trend for Ethereum (ETH) trading appears to be relatively stable with conflicting signals from the MACD and Bollinger Bands indicators. The short-long moving average signal is showing a "buy" indication, which could potentially lead to a bullish trend in the near future. However, the uncertainty in the market suggests a cautious approach is warranted.

The news analyst report highlights some positive sentiment towards Solana as an Ethereum competitor, which could potentially impact market sentiment towards ETH. Despite high activity on the Ethereum network, news developments have not significantly impacted the price of ETH.

Reflecting on past trading performance, a slightly conservative approach has been beneficial in navigating market volatility. However, it is important to capitalize on profit-taking opportunities during potential bullish reversals.

Considering the conflicting signals and the potential for a bullish trend based on the short-long moving average signal, I would suggest a slightly bullish action to buy ETH with a moderate confidence level.

REASONING:
Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, the market trend for ETH appears to be relatively stable with a slight bullish bias, although the MACD signal is indicating a sell. The news analyst report also suggests some negative sentiment due to security concerns and price predictions.

Considering the conflicting signals and uncertainty in the market, it is important to take a cautious approach. However, given the overall stable trend with a slight bullish bias, I believe that the market may continue to show some upward movement in the short term.

Therefore, I will take a slightly conservative approach and suggest a buy action with a moderate confidence level to capitalize on potential upward movement in the market.

The downward trend in price, coupled with the conflicting signals from the on-chain indicators and the negative sentiment from news articles, suggests a cautious approach is warranted.

However, considering the potential reversal indicated by the bollinger_bands_signal switching to a buy signal at the last data point, there may be a slight opportunity for a short-term uptrend. Taking into account this potential reversal and the need to balance risk and reward, I would suggest a slightly bearish action to sell a portion of ETH with a moderate confidence level.

*** REFLECTION ANALYST RESPONSE ***
In reviewing my recent trading performance, it is evident that a slightly conservative approach has been beneficial in navigating the market volatility surrounding ETH. The successful outcomes were largely attributed to taking cautious actions based on a combination of on-chain and news analyst reports, as well as reflecting on past trading performance to make informed decisions.

The most successful outcomes were achieved when capitalizing on profit-taking opportunities during potential bullish reversals, as seen in the slight bullish action taken to buy ETH with a moderate confidence level. This strategy allowed for gains in a relatively stable market with conflicting signals.

On the other hand, the loss of profit was experienced when the market trend was uncertain and potentially bearish, leading to a slightly bearish action to sell a portion of ETH. Despite considering the potential reversal indicated by the bollinger_bands_signal, the overall negative sentiment from news articles and conflicting signals ultimately impacted the outcome.

Looking ahead, key trends and indicators in the current cryptocurrency market that are likely to influence future trades include monitoring the short-long moving average signal, MACD signal, and bollinger_bands_signal for potential buy or sell opportunities. Additionally, staying informed on news developments and sentiment towards competitors like Solana will be crucial in assessing market sentiment towards ETH.

Does the virtual machine suffer from limitations that are inherent to the execution layer of the system, or can developers overcome them?\n\nWhile rollups take the computation load off the Ethereum mainchain, Blockworks co-founder Michael Ippolito wondered how the computation that occurs directly on Ethereum could be more “performant.”\n\n“Do rollups solve all of our scalability challenges, or is there still work to be done on the execution layer?” he asked during the Permissionless II conference in Austin, Texas.\n\nMonad Labs developer relations engineer Kevin Galler replied: “A lot of the current limitations of the EVM we know today are actually more of a side effect of how the backend computer of this EVM has been constructed up until now,” but are not inherent to the interface or the bytecode.\n\n“You can actually design parallelism and stuff into this,” he said, acknowledging that “there’s stuff you have to work around to maintain backwards compatibility.”\n\n“There’s like, 20 years of high performance computing research on how to do these things,” he said, “so, it’s a very solvable problem.”\n\nOffchain Labs senior software engineer Raul Jordan admitted that the current implementation of the EVM is “fairly slow for many reasons,” adding “there are many things we can do to power that up.”\n\nJordan noted that developers are already accustomed to being able to build DeFi primitives and other “really cool applications” with the EVM as it stands today, but wondered “how can we give them superpowers to build something greater than they have before?”\n\n“How can we empower them?” he asked. “Should we make the EVM faster, or can we introduce new constructs that allow them to do things that weren’t possible before?”\n\nCan’t cheat physics\n\nSomani expressed concerns with the possibility of an excess of layer-2 protocols. “The issue with the single threaded EVM…is that it results in a lot of rollups.”\n\n“There’s people suggesting there should be millions of rollups or something,” Somani continued. “That’s going to lead to a lot of issues with liquidity fragmentation and end-to-user experience.”\n\n“Sufficiently advanced virtual machines” have local fee markets, Somani said, “so that if there’s a lot of activity on one app, it doesn’t congest all those.”\n\n“So bringing that [virtual machine] to Ethereum can lead to this highly parallelized [layer-2] that doesn’t really need all these other robots to exist,” he said.\n\n“You can’t cheat physics,” Galler interjected. “Bandwidth is fundamentally what limits how fast a lot of these blockchains can run.”\n\nReflecting on scaling challenges, Jordan referred to the example of Arbitrum Stylus, noting that the product allows developers to write code in common programming languages like Rust and C++, compiling to a special instruction format called WebAssembly. “You can actually execute this side by side with EVM smart contracts.”\n\n“So we ended up realizing that the EVM is not the ceiling,” he said, “it’s actually the floor.”\n\n“You can do a lot more than you thought was possible while still maintaining the same guarantees.”\n\nScalability at the execution layer “has a long way to go,” Jordan added, “and we’re trying to get there.”\n\nDon’t miss the next big story – join our free daily newsletter.'}, {'id': 10, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vYW1iY3J5cHRvLmNvbS93aHktZXRoZXJldW1zLTYtbW9udGgtbG93LW1heS1ub3QtYmUtdGhlLWVuZC_SAUdodHRwczovL2FtYmNyeXB0by5jb20vd2h5LWV0aGVyZXVtcy02LW1vbnRoLWxvdy1tYXktbm90LWJlLXRoZS1lbmQvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Wed, 13 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Why Ethereum’s 6-month low may not be the end - AMBCrypto News', 'content': 'ETH could drop below $1,500 as many old coins changed wallets.\n\nThe sentiment remained bearish, but ETH’s burn mechanism could rescue the altcoin in the long-term.\n\nEthereum’s [ETH] plunge to $1,540 has been accompanied by interesting changes that could push the altcoin into capitulation, Santiment revealed. The on-chain analytic platform, in its 12 September post on X (formerly Twitter), noted that a large number of ETH have been transferred from old wallets.\n\n? #Ethereum dropped to $1,540 for the first time since March 12th, and this coincided with large quantities of stagnant $ETH moving away from old wallets. A continued dip in mean $ age while prices drop is a capitulation sign, which foreshadows reversals. https://t.co/50jK2C7aLi pic.twitter.com/4RhtlVX3rr — Santiment (@santimentfeed) September 12, 2023\n\nOldies leave their former abode\n\nThe post focused on using the Mean Coin Age (MCA) to decipher the possibility. The MCA is the sum of a coin’s Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) alive at the time of coin creation.\n\nAs a long-term indicator, a drop in the MCA implies a massive movement of UTXOs that have been immobile for a long period.\n\nRead Ethereum’s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH’s 90-day MCA had decreased to 41.07. This further affirmed Santiment’s position that a big fall could be close. Although the 90-day dormant circulation has now reduced, the surge to 634,000 on 11 September reinforced the notion that old coins were moving in droves.\n\nSo, the spike implies that it’s not just the two to five years dormant coins on Ethereum that are moving. Those who have remained stagnant for just three months joined the party.\n\nPreviously, AMBCrypto had explained why ETH’s price action could remain bearish. However, Santiment mentioned that after the rain comes sunshine, noting that relief could come to ETH after the projected price drop.\n\nIs light at the end of the tunnel?\n\nHowever, traders do not expect the recovery to be anytime soon, as shown by the funding rate. As of this writing, ETH’s funding rate was -0.003%. Since perpetual futures contracts can be held indefinitely, it becomes very necessary to have the funding rate.\n\nFunding rate is the amount of an asset paid between long and short-positioned traders with open contracts. When the funding rate is positive, it means that longs are paying too short to keep their position. In this case, traders’ sentiment is bullish.\n\nBut a negative funding rate means that shorts are paying longs a funding fee. Here, like it was with ETH, the sentiment is bearish. So, the broader bias was for ETH to drop much below $1,500.\n\nFor now, Ethereum may need to depend on other metrics besides its market-based indicators in the hope of recovery. One metric that comes to mind is the Ethereum burned supply.\n\nThis Ethereum burned supply represents the cumulative sum of ETH incinerated since the implementation of the EIP-1559. For context, the EIP-1559 was implemented during the London Hard Fork— the same period Ethereum began the burn mechanism.\n\nIn EIP-1559, the base for transactions is not sent to any miner/validator. Rather, it is burned as a means to reduce ETH’s supply and improve its value in the long term.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nLately, ETH turned inflationary, which could be a cause for concern. However, the burned supply of Ethereum had also increased to 4.25 million (as displayed above).\n\nIf the number continues to increase, then ETH may get back its deflationary pressure, and in the long term, could be profitable for its price.'}].

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
REASONING:
Based on the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, the market trend for ETH appears to be relatively stable with a slight bullish bias, although the MACD signal is indicating a sell. The news analyst report also suggests some negative sentiment due to security concerns and price predictions.

Considering the conflicting signals and uncertainty in the market, it is important to take a cautious approach. However, given the overall stable trend with a slight bullish bias, I believe that the market may continue to show some upward movement in the short term.

Therefore, I will take a slightly conservative approach and suggest a buy action with a moderate confidence level to capitalize on potential upward movement in the market.

Action: -0.4 (buy with 40% cash)
ACTION:
-0.4
DAILY RETURN:
-0.03177101780546232
REASONING:
Given the mixed signals from the on-chain and news analysts, as well as the reflection on recent trading performance, it is clear that the market trend for ETH is currently uncertain and potentially bearish. The downward trend in price, coupled with the conflicting signals from the on-chain indicators and the negative sentiment from news articles, suggests a cautious approach is warranted.

However, considering the potential reversal indicated by the bollinger_bands_signal switching to a buy signal at the last data point, there may be a slight opportunity for a short-term uptrend. Taking into account this potential reversal and the need to balance risk and reward, I would suggest a slightly bearish action to sell a portion of ETH with a moderate confidence level.

Action: 0.4 (sell 40% ETH)

Start your response with your brief reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Given the mixed signals from the on-chain and news analyst reports, as well as the recent decrease in price indicating a potential bearish trend, it is important to approach the current market with caution. However, the overall bullish bias for ETH, as indicated by recent buy signals from MACD and Bollinger Bands, suggests that there may still be opportunities for profit.

Considering the ongoing developments and discussions surrounding Ethereum, including the focus on scaling solutions and continuous innovation, it is likely that the long-term outlook for ETH remains positive. Therefore, I predict that the market trend will continue to be bullish in the near future.

Based on this analysis and my confidence in the bullish trend, I suggest a slightly conservative approach with a moderate level of confidence. Therefore, I recommend selling 0.4 (40%) of ETH to capitalize on potential short-term gains while still maintaining a significant position in ETH for long-term growth.

*** ONCHAIN ANALYST RESPONSE ***
Based on the recent price and auxiliary information provided, it can be observed that the short_long_ma_signal consistently indicates a buy signal, while the macd_signal has been mixed with both sell and buy signals. The bollinger_bands_signal has mostly been indicating a hold.

The market trend appears to be somewhat uncertain with mixed signals from the macd_signal. However, the consistent buy signal from the short_long_ma_signal suggests a bullish sentiment. The recent increase in the bollinger_bands_signal to buy also supports a potential upward trend.

Overall, it seems that the market may be gearing towards a bullish trend, but it is important to closely monitor the macd_signal for any potential changes in momentum. Traders and investors should exercise caution and consider setting stop-loss orders to manage risk in this volatile market.

Based on the news articles analyzed, it is evident that there is a significant focus on Ethereum (ETH) and its on-chain activity, legal battles with the SEC, and the overall sentiment towards cryptocurrencies in the market.

1. Legal Battles with the SEC:

2. On-Chain Activity:

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
REASONING:
Given the mixed signals from the on-chain and news analysts, as well as the reflection on recent trading performance, it is clear that the market trend for ETH is currently uncertain and potentially bearish. The downward trend in price, coupled with the conflicting signals from the on-chain indicators and the negative sentiment from news articles, suggests a cautious approach is warranted.

However, considering the potential reversal indicated by the bollinger_bands_signal switching to a buy signal at the last data point, there may be a slight opportunity for a short-term uptrend. Taking into account this potential reversal and the need to balance risk and reward, I would suggest a slightly bearish action to sell a portion of ETH with a moderate confidence level.

Action: 0.4 (sell 40% ETH)
ACTION:
0.4
DAILY RETURN:
0.011667102395734874
REASONING:
Based on the information provided by the on-chain and news analyst reports, as well as reflecting on past trading performance, it is clear that the market trend for ETH cryptocurrency is slightly bullish. The recent buy signals for MACD and Bollinger Bands, along with the potential bullish trend indicated by the last few data points, suggest that buying ETH could be a profitable move in the near future.

Considering the market trend and the need to maximize overall profit, I will take a slightly bullish action to buy ETH with a moderate confidence level. Therefore, my suggested action is to buy ETH with 0.4 confidence level.
ACTION:
0.4
DAILY RETURN:
0.0014355023044128057
REASONING:
Given the mixed signals from the on-chain and news analyst reports, as well as the recent decrease in price indicating a potential bearish trend, it is important to approach the current market with caution. However, the overall bullish bias for ETH, as indicated by recent buy signals from MACD and Bollinger Bands, suggests that there may still be opportunities for profit.

Considering the ongoing developments and discussions surrounding Ethereum, including the focus on scaling solutions and continuous innovation, it is likely that the long-term outlook for ETH remains positive. Therefore, I predict that the market trend will continue to be bullish in the near future.

Based on this analysis and my confidence in the bullish trend, I suggest a slightly conservative approach with a moderate level of confidence. Therefore, I recommend selling 0.4 (40%) of ETH to capitalize on potential short-term gains while still maintaining a significant position in ETH for long-term growth.

Start your response with your brief reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

Given the information provided by the on-chain analyst report, news analyst report, and reflection analyst report, it is evident that the market trend for Ethereum (ETH) is leaning towards a bullish sentiment. The consistent buy signals from the short_long_ma_signal, the recent increase in the bollinger_bands_signal to buy, and the positive news surrounding on-chain activity and market sentiment all point towards a potential upward trend for ETH.

Considering the overall positive outlook and the need to avoid always being conservative in trading, I would suggest a slightly aggressive approach in this scenario. Therefore, I would recommend buying ETH with a negative value to capitalize on the potential bullish trend.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
REASONING:
Based on the information provided by the on-chain and news analyst reports, as well as reflecting on past trading performance, it is clear that the market trend for ETH cryptocurrency is slightly bullish. The recent buy signals for MACD and Bollinger Bands, along with the potential bullish trend indicated by the last few data points, suggest that buying ETH could be a profitable move in the near future.

Considering the market trend and the need to maximize overall profit, I will take a slightly bullish action to buy ETH with a moderate confidence level. Therefore, my suggested action is to buy ETH with 0.4 confidence level.
ACTION:
0.4
DAILY RETURN:
0.0014355023044128057
REASONING:
Given the mixed signals from the on-chain and news analyst reports, as well as the recent decrease in price indicating a potential bearish trend, it is important to approach the current market with caution. However, the overall bullish bias for ETH, as indicated by recent buy signals from MACD and Bollinger Bands, suggests that there may still be opportunities for profit.

Considering the ongoing developments and discussions surrounding Ethereum, including the focus on scaling solutions and continuous innovation, it is likely that the long-term outlook for ETH remains positive. Therefore, I predict that the market trend will continue to be bullish in the near future.

Based on this analysis and my confidence in the bullish trend, I suggest a slightly conservative approach with a moderate level of confidence. Therefore, I recommend selling 0.4 (40%) of ETH to capitalize on potential short-term gains while still maintaining a significant position in ETH for long-term growth.
ACTION:
0.4
DAILY RETURN:
0.0014567951451940342
REASONING:

The consistent buy signals from the short_long_ma_signal, the recent increase in the bollinger_bands_signal to buy, and the positive news surrounding on-chain activity and market sentiment all point towards a potential upward trend for ETH.

Considering the overall positive outlook and the need to avoid always being conservative in trading, I would suggest a slightly aggressive approach in this scenario. Therefore, I would recommend buying ETH with a negative value to capitalize on the potential bullish trend.

Start your response with your brief reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

This is because the average age at which both tokens have been sitting in wallets has become much younger after massive stagnation. In this regard, that of BUSD fell by 378 days, while that of Ethereum fell by 26 days.\n\n🤔 The average age in which #Ethereum and #BinanceCoin tokens have been sitting in wallets both became much younger after massive stagnation. Do you believe both coincide with the #FTX liquidations and sell-offs that began this week? https://t.co/RyFfUbMe22 pic.twitter.com/KfRZPtCZn1 — Santiment (@santimentfeed) September 15, 2023\n\nIt is speculated that this historic dormant movement might be related to the FTX-triggered liquidations and sell-offs that began earlier in the week.\n\nFTX, which currently controls over $3.4 billion in crypto assets, has been granted permission to sell its crypto holdings by a U.S. judge.\n\nFTX will be allowed to sell off in weekly batches, with a first-week restriction of $50 million and following weekly limits of $100 million. However, BTC and ETH can only be sold after giving the creditors' committee, ad hoc committee and the U.S. trustee a 10-day notice.\n\nThis aside, in recent weeks, Ethereum has seen dormant ICO-era whale wallets come to life. In the past week, a dormant pre-mine address that held 185 ETH worth $302,096 revived after 8.1 years.\n\nBinance moving to end support for BUSD\n\nAs part of its gradual move to end support for the BUSD stablecoin by 2024, crypto exchange Binance moved to burn several idle Binance-pegged tokens this week.\n\nOn Sept. 14, Binance set fire to idle Binance-pegged tokens, namely TUSDOLD (BSC), BUSD on the MATIC network, BUSD both on the BSC and BNB networks and BUSD on the TRX network.\n\nIn August, Binance announced it would gradually end support for BUSD, urging users to convert the token to other crypto assets by February next year. Paxos stopped issuing the stablecoin in February following a regulatory crackdown on the BUSD token."}, {'id': 22, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NidGMuY29tL2JpdGNvaW4tbmV3cy9iaXRjb2luLWV0aGVyZXVtLWRhaWx5LWFjdGl2ZS1hZGRyZXNzZXMtbGFnZ2luZy10eC1jb3VudC_SAWJodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzYnRjLmNvbS9iaXRjb2luLW5ld3MvYml0Y29pbi1ldGhlcmV1bS1kYWlseS1hY3RpdmUtYWRkcmVzc2VzLWxhZ2dpbmctdHgtY291bnQvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Sat, 16 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Bitcoin Dominates Ethereum In Daily Active Addresses Despite Lagging In TX Count - NewsBTC', 'content': 'Ethereum might be the king of smart contracts and the world’s primary hub for decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) activity but onchain data suggests that Bitcoin is ahead in user engagement, interpreted by the number of daily active users, and network activity is at acceptable, healthy levels, reading from the number of daily transactions confirmed.\n\nBitcoin Leads Ethereum In Daily Active Addresses\n\nAccording to Artemis Terminal data on September 15, Bitcoin, despite being predominantly a transactional layer, enabling the peer-to-peer (P2P) transfer of value between addresses, has more daily active users than Ethereum.\n\nThis observation is even as Ethereum serves as a conduit of value since assets can be moved, just like in Bitcoin, and a smart contract platform for deploying trustless and automated decentralized applications (dapps). Some, like Uniswap, a decentralized exchange (DEX), process billions worth of transactions every month.\n\nOn September 15, Bitcoin had over 800,000 daily active addresses (DAA), more than twice those in Ethereum, which stood at slightly over 378,000. The only time there was a slight change was on September 13, when over 1 million addresses were activated on Ethereum.\n\nThen, the number of DAA on Bitcoin also fell to around 743,000. However, the DAA on Ethereum has fallen sharply while Bitcoin has maintained an upward trajectory since late August. During this time, Ethereum’s DAA has been fluctuating heavily, as evidenced by the rise and fall on Sep 13 and through to today.\n\nEthereum Processes Over 1 Million Transactions Everyday\n\nEthereum shines in the number of daily transactions processed. When writing on September 15, the smart contract platform had processed over 1 million transactions while Bitcoin lagged, confirming less than 600,000.\n\nEven at this level, Ethereum has processed less than half of what it did on September 13, when the network processed over 2.3 million transactions. On the other hand, Bitcoin’s daily transactions have been steady, while those of Ethereum have, on average, risen over the past three months, as Artemis Terminal data shows.\n\nDAA and daily transaction count are important metrics that on-chain analysts use to analyze the level of engagement and health of public blockchains.\n\nOver the past 18 months, activity has rapidly shrunk as asset prices fall in the crypto winter. Ethereum’s drop from around $5,000 in late November 2021 to as low as $1,500 in 2022 weighed negatively on DeFi and NFT activity.\n\nAccording to DeFiLlama, the total value locked (TVL) of DeFi protocols has stabilized below $50 billion, down from around $180 billion in 2021. Meanwhile, trading volume has crashed by over 90%, dragging the value of NFT-related projects, including Immutable X and ApeCoin. To illustrate, APE is down 96% from peaks.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Bitcoin (BTC) grew 3% over the seven days and started Saturday trading at $26,564, while Ethereum (ETH) remains more or less at the same price it was seven days ago at $1,636.\n\n\u200b\u200b\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEthereum’s growth may have been hobbled by reports that its supply recently turned inflationary (meaning more Ether is issued than burned) in one of few such periods since the Merge in September 2022. Last week, Ethereum’s supply increased by 4,092 ETH tokens worth around $6.6 million, per Ultrasound.money data.\n\nThe leading cryptocurrencies traded sideways all week, even after the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ (BLS) latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) on Wednesday revealed that inflation had risen a fraction above economists’ projections last month due to rising gasoline prices.\n\nOnly three cryptocurrencies posted any notable price movement this week. Two tokens rallied: Bitcoin Cash (BCH) grew 11.5% to $213.79, while Toncoin (TON) blew up 23% to trade at $2.20.\n\nTON’s explosive price movement this week was catalyzed by news on Wednesday that its parent company—Telegram—has integrated The Open Network blockchain’s Web3 wallet into its messaging app, bringing easy access to TON for the app’s 800 million users.\n\nThe move represents a symbolic win for Telegram. Technically, the company withdrew from involvement in TON in 2020 after litigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Telegram was accused of offering unregistered securities in the form of a token called Gram. It settled with the SEC by paying a fine of $18.5 million and returning unspent funds to investors.\n\nOne cryptocurrency notably depreciated over the week: Stellar (XLM) fell 9.3% to trade at $0.118263 at the time of writing. Its poor performance this week appears to be a correction from last week, when XLM rallied 10% off the back of a tweet that promised “something cool” in ten days.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWas it a major network overhaul? Nope, it was a big-budget commercial with Idris Elba.\n\nIn the news: adoption!\n\nThere were more encouraging signs of crypto adoption throughout the global north this week.\n\nOn Monday, Sony subsidiary Sony Network Communications announced it was developing a blockchain network in collaboration with crypto tech firm Startale Labs. The Singapore-based joint venture will be known as Sony Network Communications Labs Pte. Ltd. It remains unclear what Sony may use the platform for.\n\nAmerican payments giant PayPal launched crypto to USD off-ramps on Tuesday. The move came after PayPal launched a crypto On Ramp integration last month, enabling direct crypto purchases to MetaMask and Ledger users. Undoubtedly, the company’s biggest move in the space this year was the announcement of its own in-house greenback-pegged stablecoin PayPal USD.\n\nFinally, on Wednesday, Taurus–a Swiss crypto fintech firm—announced an agreement with Deutsche Bank. Deutsche Bank will also use Taurus’ infrastructure to offer custody and tokenization services for its customers, according to a press release shared with Decrypt.'}, {'id': 8, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIzLzA5LzE2L2NvdWxkLXRoaXMtbmV3LW1vdmUtZnJvbS1jYXRoaWUtd29vZC1hbmQtYXJrLWludmVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Sat, 16 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Could This New Move From Cathie Wood and Ark Invest Send Ethereum Soaring? - The Motley Fool', 'content': 'In what could be a big catalyst for Ethereum (ETH -0.54%), Cathie Wood\'s Ark Invest has filed an application for the first-ever spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF). This comes after a summer filled with twists and turns surrounding the launch and approval of the first-ever spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nSo could this new ETF from Ark Invest send the price of Ethereum soaring? There are several different factors to consider.\n\nInstitutional demand\n\nLet\'s face it -- the launch of a spot Ethereum ETF probably means little for the seasoned crypto investor. Why would you go to the added step of buying an ETF (which comes with management fees), when you can already go to a cryptocurrency exchange like Coinbase Global and buy Ethereum directly? The only allure of a spot crypto ETF is if you want exposure to crypto, but without the risk or hassle of investing directly in crypto.\n\nThe big reason a spot Ethereum ETF is so bullish for the markets is because it signals pent-up institutional demand for the world\'s second-largest cryptocurrency. Many institutional investors are unwilling or unable to purchase crypto directly, due to the constraints placed on them. Do you really want your pension fund or university endowment dabbling in a volatile, poorly regulated industry with significant risk of loss?\n\nBut the picture changes when you take into account a market-traded financial instrument that has been approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). According to the Ark Invest filing, the spot Ethereum ETF would trade on the CBOE BZX Exchange and custody its crypto assets with Coinbase. That essentially makes Ethereum "safe" (relatively speaking) for the world\'s biggest institutional investors. And that\'s where things get really exciting, because it could signal a tsunami of new money flowing into Ethereum. Theoretically, that new influx of money should boost Ethereum\'s price. It\'s just simple supply and demand.\n\nLessons from Bitcoin this summer\n\nAnd that, of course, brings us to what happened this summer, which was headlined by one big event: the decision by BlackRock, the world\'s biggest fund manager, to file for a spot Bitcoin ETF on June 15. That led to a flurry of follow-on filings from other institutional investors, a response by the SEC, and new adjustments to those filings in response to the SEC. Just about everyone -- including Ark Invest -- was trying to be first in line for the first-ever spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nAnd the market responded accordingly. The Bitcoin rally in June was very real. On the date of the BlackRock ETF filing, Bitcoin was trading around $25,000. Thirty days later, it was trading near $30,000, and bullish sentiment was risiing. It seemed to be a matter of not if, but when, a new spot Bitcoin ETF would be approved. Finally, it looked like Bitcoin was about to go mainstream.\n\nGranted, the effect on Ethereum is not going to be as great as for Bitcoin, simply due to the fact that institutional investors still prefer Bitcoin to Ethereum. But there is almost certain to be a similar type of effect, given that Ethereum now accounts for roughly 20% of the entire market cap of the crypto market.\n\nThe heavy hand of the SEC\n\nSo what could possibly go wrong? There\'s a short answer: the SEC. There\'s something about a spot Bitcoin ETF that the SEC doesn\'t like. Despite the fact that the SEC has already approved futures-based Bitcoin ETFs, it doesn\'t seem to want to approve a spot Bitcoin ETF. So it\'s uncertain how long the approval process could take. Ark Invest, for example, originally filed its first spot Bitcoin ETF application back in 2021.\n\nAnd, in the case of Ethereum, there\'s an added wrinkle. That\'s because Ark Invest is essentially skipping a step here. Unlike with Bitcoin, no futures-based Ethereum ETF has yet been approved in the U.S., although several applications have been filed. So Ark Invest is skipping from no Ethereum ETF in the U.S. to spot Ethereum ETF without the intermediate step of a futures-based Ethereum ETF.\n\nThe big picture\n\nDespite these regulatory challenges, the big picture is that the decision by Ark Invest to file for a spot Ethereum ETF appears to signal that there\'s plenty of institutional demand for Ethereum. As crypto becomes more and more of a mainstream asset class for institutional investors, that\'s huge for Ethereum\'s future prospects. So buckle up: This could get interesting if Cathie Wood ever gets SEC approval for the first-ever spot Ethereum ETF.'}].

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
REASONING:
Given the mixed signals from the on-chain and news analyst reports, as well as the recent decrease in price indicating a potential bearish trend, it is important to approach the current market with caution. However, the overall bullish bias for ETH, as indicated by recent buy signals from MACD and Bollinger Bands, suggests that there may still be opportunities for profit.

Considering the ongoing developments and discussions surrounding Ethereum, including the focus on scaling solutions and continuous innovation, it is likely that the long-term outlook for ETH remains positive. Therefore, I predict that the market trend will continue to be bullish in the near future.

Based on this analysis and my confidence in the bullish trend, I suggest a slightly conservative approach with a moderate level of confidence. Therefore, I recommend selling 0.4 (40%) of ETH to capitalize on potential short-term gains while still maintaining a significant position in ETH for long-term growth.

In my recent trading performance, the most successful outcomes were achieved when I followed a slightly aggressive approach based on the bullish signals from the on-chain and news analyst reports. Buying ETH with a negative value and selling a portion of my holdings when the market trend was uncertain allowed me to capitalize on potential gains and manage risk effectively.

However, the loss of profit occurred when I bought ETH with 40% cash in a slightly bullish market trend, which resulted in a negative daily return. This decision was based on a mix of signals from different indicators, leading to a less accurate prediction of the market movement.

Key trends and indicators in the current cryptocurrency market that are likely to influence future trades include the short_long_ma_signal consistently indicating a buy signal, the fluctuating macd_signal, and the bollinger_bands_signal suggesting a hold position. Additionally, developments in the Ethereum ecosystem, such as new projects and network upgrades, will continue to impact the price of ETH.

Based on the recent trading performance and market trends, a moderately aggressive approach with a focus on bullish signals may be more suitable for future trades.

Start your response with your brief reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

He said:\n\n“Someone put 0x686f77206d7563682069732074686520666973683f (“how much is the fish?”) as extra-data in the EL Holesky genesis.json, and not in the CL genesis.ssz.”\n\nThis resulted in a misconfiguration that caused the testnet to fail to launch, according to Loerakker. He added that other fork parameters are “rumored to mismatch” but did not provide further details of those issues.\n\nLoerakker added that Holesky did not experience issues related to network size, something that was considered before launch. In August, developers determined that Holesky could handle 1.4 million validators. In response, they introduced a large amount of Holesky ETH, amounting to 1.6 billion tokens.\n\nRelaunch expected in coming weeks\n\nThough developers will soon relaunch Holesky, the exact date of that event is still unclear. Nethermind, an Ethereum research and engineering group, said developers will relaunch Holesky in one week. That seemingly places the next attempt on Sept. 22.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum contributor and Sigma Prime member Michael Sproul has suggested in a GitHub pull request that Holesky should be relaunched on Sept. 28. That date is nearly two weeks later than the network’s first launch attempt.\n\nRegardless of delays, the issue does not affect Ethereum’s mainnet, which is responsible for transactions with real value. Beaconchain.eth acknowledged this, writing that the Holesky launch “didn’t go as expected, but that’s what testnets are here for.”\n\nAccording to Ethereum documentation, Holesky will supersede Ethereum’s Goerli testnet. Both testnets are intended for testing related to staking, validating, and core network upgrades. Another testnet called Sepolia, which is aimed at independent developers who want to test their own Ethereum-based apps, also exists.\n\nEach of these testnets relies on special testnet ETH that is freely available through faucets and which generally has no real market value.'}, {'id': 5, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vY3J5cHRvLm5ld3MvZXRoZXJldW0tdW52ZWlscy1uZXctdGVzdG5ldC1jYWxsZWQtaG9sZXNreS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Sun, 17 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Ethereum unveils new testnet called 'Holešky' - crypto.news", 'content': 'Ethereum’s developers launched a new testnet that’s being touted as a promising alternative to the aging Goerli network.\n\nDubbed “Holešky,” the testnet was designed to facilitate staking, infrastructure, and protocol development.\n\nEthereum preps for future\n\nEthereum, the blockchain powering the world’s second-largest crypto by market cap, is continually evolving to meet the demands of a rapidly growing blockchain ecosystem. To keep pace with the ambitious roadmap, Ethereum developers have introduced a new testnet called “Holešky.”\n\nAt the core of the Holešky testnet launch is its unprecedented initial supply of 1.6 billion Holešky testnet Ether (HETH). This substantial allocation is provided to validators on Holešky’s inaugural day to kick start network operations.\n\nIn contrast, it’s worth noting that this token amount is ten times more than what the main Ethereum network currently holds. Ethereum developer Tim Beiko justified this allocation, stating that “devnets [are] regularly using 10B supply.” This move ensures that Holešky has ample resources to support the development and testing of new features.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum developers on Goerli now have to pay for test ETH\n\nRetiring the Goerli testnet\n\nBefore Holešky emerged, the Goerli testnet was Ethereum’s primary platform for testing new staking, infrastructure, and protocol developments.\n\nConcerns began to surface in October when developers voiced their reservations about Goerli’s insufficient supply of Goerli ETH to meet testing requirements. Holešky’s generous HETH supply is expected to address this issue effectively.\n\nIn tandem with Holešky’s launch, Ethereum developers have been encouraging application developers to migrate from Goerli to Sepolia, a move that leaves only protocol developers on the old network. The Ethereum team has set its sights on deprecating Goerli in January 2024. Following deprecation, Goerli will receive another year of maintenance before being permanently shut down, as outlined in official documentation.\n\nThe advent of Holešky marks a critical juncture in Ethereum’s journey. The platform is poised to implement a slew of transformative features, including proto-danksharding, danksharding, and Verkle trees.\n\nThese innovations reduce transaction fees and make running a node more cost-effective. To ensure seamless integration into the mainnet, each feature will undergo rigorous testing on Holešky, underscoring the testnet’s pivotal role in Ethereum’s development pipeline.\n\nRelentless development\n\nEthereum’s commitment to innovation remains unwavering. Recent upgrades, including the Shanghai upgrade, have already introduced substantial scalability, security, and functionality improvements. Ethereum researcher Christine Kim affirms that Ethereum’s development community is far from complacent and is already plotting the next wave of enhancements. The blockchain’s execution layer (EL) and consensus layer (CL) are the focal points of these upcoming code changes.\n\nWhile Holešky gears up for pivotal infrastructure and protocol testing, Ethereum has also made strides in simplifying the process of launching tokens on its blockchain.\n\nEthereum developer Aram Mughalyan recently revealed a groundbreaking development. Using the OpenZeppelin Contract Wizard, Mughalyan demonstrated how anyone can create a new token on the Ethereum blockchain in under one minute. This streamlined process allows broader token innovation within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum upgrade doubled energy efficiency rates, study reveals\n\nEther price analysis\n\nAccording to data from CoinGecko, the price of Ethereum (ETH) stands at $1,628; over the past seven days, the token has recorded a 0.07% increase. Ethereum’s market capitalization stands at more than $195 billion. On Sept. 11, ETH witnessed a dip to $1,530 before rebounding to its current valuation.\n\nThe introduction of the Holešky testnet and the simplification of token launches on Ethereum demonstrate the blockchain’s commitment to staying at the forefront of Web3 innovation. These developments pave the way for a more robust and accessible Ethereum ecosystem with exciting prospects.\n\nFollow Us on Google News'}, {'id': 2, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDkvMTcvaXRzLWJlZW4tb25lLXllYXItc2luY2UtdGhlLWV0aGVyZXVtLW1lcmdlLWhlcmVzLWhvdy10aGUtbmV0d29yay1pcy1kb2luZy1vbi1pdHMtZ29hbHMuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Sun, 17 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "It's been one year since the Ethereum merge.

While the merge gave investors the opportunity to earn yield – by locking up their funds – this year\'s Shanghai, also known as Shapella, upgrade gave them the ability to unstake their funds. The Shanghai upgrade was widely seen as an event that would bring more liquidity to Ethereum. "While the market has been really stagnant across digital assets, staking has been one of the few areas that have seen constant growth in this period," said Andrew Ballinger, head of staking solutions at Canadian investment firm 3iQ. "About a week after [Shanghai] happened in April, we started to see assets coming into the network to be staked outpacing assets being withdrawn," he added.

The percentage of ether supply being staked has risen from 11.99% on Sept. 15, 2022, to 20.46% on Aug. 30 of this year.

"Part of that fee is now being burned, and whenever you do that, the supply of Ethereum shrinks.

The history of its most important testnet, Goerli, has come to an end.\n\nHere\'s why Ethereans decided to sunset Goerli in 2023 and what is special about Holesky, Goerli\'s hotly anticipated successor.\n\nEthereum replaces Goerli testnet by Holesky: Basics\n\nToday, Sept. 15, 2023, on the first anniversary of The Merge activation in mainnet, Ethereum (ETH) has ceased supporting its testnet, Goerli. Developers need to migrate toward Holesky, the first PoS-by-design testnet.\n\nHolesky (or Holešky, Holešovice) is an Ethereum (ETH) test network (testnet) activated on Sept. 15, 2023.\n\nHolesky replaces Goerli as a staking, infrastructure and protocol-developer testnet.\n\nFor dApp stress tests, smart contract experiments and other EVM-related procedures, developers should refer to Sepolia testnet.\n\nHolesky is the first-ever Ethereum (ETH) testnet launched on the top of the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus.\n\nHolesky launches to address scalability issues of Goerli: the shortage of goETH testnet tokens, the low number of validators and so on.\n\nHolesky will have 1.46 million validators, which is almost twice as much as Ethereum (ETH) mainnet has.\n\nNew testnet support will be abandoned by 2028.\n\nAs such, with Holesky, Ethereum (ETH) developers will have a new sandbox environment in which to experiment with various features of the protocol.\n\nWhat is testnet?\n\nIn cryptocurrencies, a test network or testnet is an experimental distributed network that emulates the processes that happen on a cryptocurrency network, but with no real value transferred. Just as with main networks (mainnets), accounts can send tokens to each other, while validators confirm them by adding new blocks to the chain.\n\nUsers of a testnet get "play" tokens from faucets, a free-to-use mechanism created by Ethereum (ETH) enthusiasts. For instance, some faucets distribute free testnet Ethers for sharing Twitter accounts, connecting to Discord and so on.\n\nSuch networks are necessary for stress testing dApps without the risks of losing money. Every modern DeFi or wallet undergoes a testnet phase before mainnet deployment.\n\nRopsten, Rinkeby, Goerli, Sepolia: Crucial Ethereum (ETH) testnets\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second largest blockchain and the first programmable network (with smart contracts), used a couple of testnets during its eight-year history. Launched in 2016, Ropsten replaced Morden, the first-ever testnet for proof-of-work (PoW) Ethereum. Ropsten was a testbed of all major Ethereum (ETH) dApps we are using and the first testnet to be "merged" when Ethereum (ETH) tested the PoW-to-PoS transition.\n\nIn 2017, Ethereans launched Rinkeby, a testnet on the top of the Clique proof-of-authority (PoA) consensus mechanism, which is a modified version of proof of stake (Pos). It only interacted with the Go Ethereum (Geth) version of client software.\n\nAt the ETH Berlin Conference in 2018, Ethereum (ETH) developers unveiled Goerli, a multiclient Ethereum (ETH) testnet. It means that it could work with the versions of Ethereum (ETH) software written in various programming languages.\n\nFinally, in 2021, Ethereum Sepolia testnet was launched with an unlimited number of testnet tokens.\n\nIntroducing Holesky, very special Ethereum (ETH) testnet\n\nActivated today, Ethereum\'s Holesky is an attempt by core developers to address all the issues that somehow affected previous testnets and their usage by teams.\n\nHolesky: Highlights\n\nHolesky is the first long-standing public Ethereum testnet that is "merged from genesis"; this means that Holesky never had a proof-of-work (PoW) version. Not unlike its predecessors, Holesky draws its name from the Nádraží Holešovice subway station in Prague.\n\nHolesky works together with Sepolia; while the first testnet is designed to be a technical platform for experiments with staking designs, the general infrastructure of Ethereum (ETH) and protocol-level development ideas, Sepolia is a platform for testing smart contracts, decentralized applications and all EVM functionalities. Like all mainstream crypto testnets, Holesky will have its own set of validators, block explorer and ecosystem of faucets.\n\nHolesky: What was wrong with Goerli?\n\nHolesky goes live to replace Goerli, a major Ethereum (ETH) testnet since 2018. Holesky is designed to help Ethereum (ETH) testers avoid the disadvantages of earlier testnets. For instance, Ethereum Goerli users faced a shortage of GoETH test tokens and were even forced to purchase them for money, which is in contradiction of Ethereum (ETH) testnet rules. Holesky is unlikely to face similar issues.\n\nHolesky public testnet genesis file has been generated, and merged into main branch of https://t.co/JWKySOSvtU.\n\nLaunch date Sept/15, 2023, 14:00 UTC\n\nChain ID-17000 (zip code of Holešovice).\n\nThe genesis will have 1,460,000 validators. Our biggest public network to date. — Barnabas Busa (@BarnabasBusa) August 22, 2023\n\nAlso, it will have a previously unimaginable number of validators: 1.46 million entities will protect network integrity. This is more than Ethereum’s mainnet (700,000) and Goerli (512,000) have in all. This, in turn, will allow developers to mimic "real-world" Ethereum (ETH) operations closely.\n\nPer the creators of Holesky, they allocated over two billion HoleskyETH by the launch in order to make this quantity sufficient for all developers.\n\nHolesky: Specifications\n\nHolesky goes live with a set of specifications just like any other EVM ecosystem blockchain. Here\'s what future Holesky users should consider before getting connected to the network.'}]. Provide a brief report to analyze the news and estimate the market trend accordingly.

Overall, the market trend for ETH cryptocurrency seems to be bullish, but traders should be cautious of a possible trend reversal based on the recent macd_signal change. It is recommended to closely monitor the market and consider implementing risk management strategies to protect against potential losses.

NEWS ANALYST REPORT: Based on the news articles provided, it is evident that Ethereum has been undergoing significant developments in its testnet environment. The launch of the Holesky testnet as a replacement for the Goerli testnet is a crucial step in Ethereum's evolution. Holesky is designed to address scalability issues, provide a more composable network, and offer a more efficient testing environment for developers.

The launch of Holesky is expected to have a positive impact on Ethereum's ecosystem by enabling developers to experiment with new features, improve protocol development, and enhance infrastructure. The increased number of validators on the Holesky testnet is a significant improvement over previous testnets, which will allow for more realistic testing scenarios.

Overall, the developments in Ethereum's testnet environment indicate a commitment to innovation and improvement within the Ethereum ecosystem. This could potentially lead to increased interest and adoption of Ethereum, which may have a positive impact on the market trend for Ethereum's native cryptocurrency, ETH.

As an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst, it is important to monitor the progress of the Holesky testnet launch, as well as any upcoming developments in Ethereum's mainnet. These developments could influence the market sentiment towards Ethereum and potentially impact the price of ETH. It is advisable to keep a close eye on news

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT: In my recent trading performance, I have been able to capitalize on the bullish trend in the Ethereum market by taking moderately aggressive approaches and buying ETH with negative values. This strategy has led to successful outcomes and positive daily returns. The key indicators that have influenced my successful trades include the consistent buy signals from the short_long_ma_signal and the positive news surrounding on-chain activity and market sentiment.

However, there have been instances where my moderately aggressive approach has resulted in losses, particularly when the market trend was uncertain. In these cases, it may have been more beneficial to take a more conservative approach to minimize potential losses.

Moving forward, key trends and indicators in the current cryptocurrency market that are likely to influence future trades include the short_long_ma_signal, macd_signal, and bollinger_bands_signal. It is important to closely monitor these indicators and stay informed about developments in the Ethereum ecosystem to make informed trading decisions.

In terms of trading approach, a balanced strategy that combines both aggressive and conservative approaches may be warranted depending on the market conditions. It is essential to adapt to the changing market trends and adjust trading strategies accordingly to maximize profits and minimize losses.

Start your response with your brief reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.

New Ether issuance is down more than 80%, staking participation is up 87%, and nearly 1M ETH has been permanently removed from supply.\n\nOne Year After The Merge: ETH Supply Shrinks But Challenges Remain\n\nBut while Ethereum is largely making good on its deflationary promise, new challenges to the network’s decentralization have emerged.\n\nDeflationary Ethereum\n\nThe Merge took place on Sept. 15, 2022, transitioning the network from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake consensus.\n\nThe shift overhauled Ethereum’s fundamental tokenomics, with new daily Ether issuance falling more than 80% from 13,500 ETH to currently around 2,300 ETH. Coupled with the introduction of Ethereum’s burn mechanism one year prior, analysts predicted Ethereum would become deflationary, meaning that more ETH is burned from base transaction fees than enters circulation as rewards for stakers.\n\nThere are now nearly 300,000 fewer ETH in existence than at the time of The Merge. For comparison, an additional 3.8M ETH ($6.2B) would have been issued under Proof of Work.\n\nChallenges Posed By Liquid Staking\n\nThe Merge also gave rise to the 2023 boom in liquid staking tokens (LSTs) — assets representing an underlying position of staked Ether which can be easily traded on exchanges or used in DeFi applications.\n\nEthereum’s Shanghai upgrade also activated staked ETH withdrawals in April, reducing the price spread between ETH and popular liquid staking tokens and bolstering the adoption of LSTs. Today, 10.8M ETH or 42.5% of all staked Ether is held by liquid staking protocols.\n\nETH locked in Lido, the top LST protocol, increased 82% from 4.6M to 8.6M since the year began, according to Dune Analytics. Coinbase’s LST token, cbETH, also boasts 1.17M Ether locked after launching last September, followed by Rocket Pool’s rETH with 450,000.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, with Lido now commanding one-third of staked Ether, many onlookers decry Lido as a centralizing threat to Ethereum, warning that a further increase in Lido dominance could facilitate governance attacks against the network if the protocol desired.\n\nIn May, Ethereum chief scientist, Vitalik Buterin, advocated that staking providers controlling more than 15% of staked ETH should actively raise user fees to deter adoption until their dominance falls.\n\n“If a stake pool controls > 15%, it should be accepted and even *expected* for the pool to keep increasing its fee rate until it goes back below 15%,” Buterin tweeted.\n\n\n\nRead the original post on The Defiant'}, {'id': 45, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbWFya2V0cy9jcnlwdG9jdXJyZW5jeS9jcnlwdG8tcHJpY2UtdG9kYXktYml0Y29pbi1zdXJnZXMtYWJvdmUtMjY2MDAtZXRoZXJldW0taG9sZHMtMTYwMC1sZXZlbC9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy8xMDM3NTEyNzMuY21z0gGYAWh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9tYXJrZXRzL2NyeXB0b2N1cnJlbmN5L2NyeXB0by1wcmljZS10b2RheS1iaXRjb2luLXN1cmdlcy1hYm92ZS0yNjYwMC1ldGhlcmV1bS1ob2xkcy0xNjAwLWxldmVsL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy8xMDM3NTEyNzMuY21z?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Mon, 18 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Crypto Price Today: Bitcoin surges above $26,600; Ethereum holds $1,600 level - The Economic Times', 'content': 'ETMarkets.com\n\nThe crypto tokens were trading mixed in Monday\'s trade ahead of a key US Federal Reserve policy meeting later this week.

Based on the news articles provided, there are several key points to consider for the ETH cryptocurrency market:

1. Cosmos-based Canto and Polkadot chain Astar are moving to Ethereum as Layer-2 solutions to improve scalability and interoperability between different blockchain networks. This move could potentially increase the usage and adoption of Ethereum as a Layer-2 solution, which may positively impact the ETH market.

2. Grayscale Investments announced the abandonment of rights to Ethereum Proof of Work tokens due to lack of support from custodians and trading venues. This decision may have a minor impact on the ETH market, as it indicates a shift away from Proof of Work tokens.

3. One year after The Merge, ETH's supply has shrunk, staking participation has increased, and nearly 1M ETH has been permanently removed from supply. While Ethereum is making progress towards becoming a deflationary asset, challenges related to network decentralization have emerged.

Considering the recent trading performance and key trends in the cryptocurrency market, it appears that there is a slightly bullish sentiment for ETH, with potential market volatility and positive developments in the Ethereum ecosystem. Therefore, I predict a slightly bullish trend for ETH in the short term.

Given this prediction, I suggest a moderately aggressive action to buy ETH with 40% cash.

According to the report, the network is currently trading below fair value by 27% if certain key factors are considered holistically.\n\nThe report made use of a modified Metcalfe-centric model to arrive at its conclusion, noting that existing models do not take the scaling dynamics into account. Traditional models place a premium on the number of active users on the network’s mainnet, but RxR’s models rely on data from Ethereum’s layer 2 networks.\n\nMetcalfe’s law states that the financial value of a network is directly proportional to the square of the number of connected users, but extending the model to layer 2 activities yields new results.\n\n“Ethereum’s network valuation tracks the updated ML index better when the active user base of Ethereum’s scaling networks is factored into the model than when omitted,” said Lewis Harland, an RxR analyst.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the report, the research analyst noted that including the L2 activity proved more reliable for long-term forecasts. The analysts pointed out that ignoring off-chain and L2 activities may paint a grim picture that the Ethereum network may be overvalued.\n\nAt the moment, ETH trades at $1,655 with a total market capitalization of $199 billion, showing glimpses of a rally on the horizon. RxR’s blended model suggests that contrary to popular opinion, the market is yet to “price in” Ethereum’s network adoption levels.\n\n“User growth on Ethereum as an application platform is set to outpace simple value-transfer networks over time implying higher relative valuations based on Metcalfe’s law,” said Harland.\n\nEthereum’s thriving L2 ecosystem\n\nEthereum’s L2 space has been a beehive of activity, with several projects experimenting with novel ways around the network’s scaling issues. Arbitrum and Optimism are pushing the frontiers of Ethereum’s scaling with their novel offerings, with Coinbase’s BASE recording sky-high adoption levels.\n\nWith over 30 L2 networks in play, aggregate total value locked (TVL) has surged to $10 billion given the reliance on rollups and other novel scaling solutions. Experts have hailed the spike in L2 activity as preventing single points of failure and playing a key role in reducing congestion.'}, {'id': 8, 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vbmV3cy9jYW50by1hbmQtYXN0YXItYmxvY2tjaGFpbnMtcGxhbi1taWdyYXRpb24tdG8tZXRoZXJldW0tZWNveXN0ZW3SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'time': 'Tue, 19 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Canto, Astar blockchains plan expansion to Ethereum ecosystem as layer 2s - Cointelegraph', 'content': 'Updated to clarify that Astar Network is expanding to Ethereum, not leaving the Polkadot ecosystem\n\nCosmos-native layer-1 blockchain Canto has become the latest chain to migrate to Ethereum as a layer 2 zero-knowledge rollup after another layer-1 blockchain, Astar, announced similar plans to expand beyond the Polkadot ecosystem to Ethereum.\n\nCanto is a permissionless general-purpose blockchain, Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible with aims to onboard the traditional financial sector to decentralized finance applications.\n\nUpon an official agreement reached by Canto Commons — a framework where contributors coordinate ideas and solutions to the protocol — its core developers will build a ZK-rollup on Ethereum’s second layer, Polygon Labs explained on Sept. 18:\n\n“By leveraging a shared ZK bridge, Canto will eventually tap the liquidity of a unified Polygon ecosystem with easy access to Ethereum.”\n\nPolygon Labs said Canto will “inherit” Ethereum’s security, enabling more decentralization and trustless guarantees when bridging assets over:\n\n“User security comes by way of a best-in-class and in-production ZK prover, meaning community security is ensured by cryptography and inherited from Ethereum, rather than the social-economic incentives of fraud proofs.”\n\nNeofinance at scale - Canto is migrating to a ZK-powered Ethereum L2, built with @0xPolygon CDK.\n\n\n\nThe @CantoPublic community will tap Ethereum’s deep liquidity via a shared ZK bridge without sacrificing user security – a big stride toward neofinance.https://t.co/8uDhLYk1G9 — Polygon (Labs) (@0xPolygonLabs) September 18, 2023\n\nThere will be no changes to Canto’s validators or staking system, Polygon Labs added.\n\nCanto follows moves from Astar\n\nCanto joins the likes of Astar, Gnosis Pay, Palm and IDEX to have announced plans to build ZK layer 2s using Polygon’s Chain Development Kit in recent months, according to Polygon Labs co-founder Sandeep Nailwal.\n\nOn Sept. 13, the Astar team announced it will soon begin building its own Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution, named Astar ZK-Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), also using Polygon’s CDK.\n\n“We are building a trustless bridge to Ethereum with high EVM equivalency right out-of-the-box, so dApp developers can use existing tools to build solutions across our entire ecosystem,” the Astar team explained in a Sept. 14 statement.\n\nI’m excited to welcome @AstarNetwork, the leading @Polkadot chain to Ethereum.

Start your response with your brief reasoning over the given context. Wisely select the information, conclude a clear market trend, and avoid always being conservative. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to buy ETH with a negative value. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to sell ETH with a positive value. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Examples are: -0.3 (buy with 30% cash), 0.5 (sell 50% ETH), and so on. Make sure to directly give the value (could be negative) at the very end without any explanation.
